To tackle this problem, attention has turned to the role of food environments where people interact with the wider food system to acquire and consume foods [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Within retail food environments (that is, supermarkets), policy initiatives that aim to support consumers in making healthier choices include the display of interpretative front-of-pack nutrition labeling (FOPNL) on products [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This information is intended to improve consumers&#x02019; food choices by indicating &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; (red) and lower (amber or green) levels of specific nutrients of public health concern, including fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, there are other ways in which retail food environments can influence consumers to buy specific food products, such as by using product promotions. Promotions include offers on product price (that is, temporarily reducing the price), volume (that is, offering a discount for purchasing multiple items), or placement (that is, placing products physically closer to the customer, such as at the end-of-aisles) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, it is thought that ends-of-aisles contribute heavily to consumers&#x02019; overall spend and around 30% of total retail sales [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Promotions are therefore considered likely to promote overconsumption of certain types of products or nutrients of public health concern, particularly if the food on promotion may be considered &#x0201c;less healthy&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. With this in mind, the UK Government considers that &#x0201c;retail promotional environments do not always align with government healthy eating guidelines, and as such this makes it harder for people to make healthier choices when shopping&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Because of their proximity to the customer, the ends-of-aisles and other key in-store locations such as checkouts, queuing areas, store entrances, etc. are therefore ideal targets for policies that restrict the display of less-healthy products and promote healthier items. Review evidence synthesizing several real-life in-store studies shows a positive impact on sales when stores promote &#x0201c;healthier&#x0201d; products [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such products include those from categories including fruit and vegetables, promoted using a combination of price and placement/proximity (that is, on a specific shelf, front of store, at eye-level), and compared with preintervention or control stores [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, there is less evidence regarding the restriction of promotion of less-healthy food products by location, yet research shows some impact on sales [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This includes research in the United Kingdom that reported a decrease in sales of less-healthy common checkout products after implementation of voluntary supermarket policies to restrict &#x0201c;high fat, sugar salt&#x0201d; (HFSS) products at these in-store locations [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Overall, the available research supports development of the new Food (Promotion and Placement) Regulations (England) 2021, which now restrict the appearance of specific categories of HFSS products displayed within prominent in-store locations [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These &#x0201c;restricted areas&#x0201d; (RAs) include store entrances, aisle ends, and checkouts of stores with areas over 185.8 m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">The 13 product categories that are &#x0201c;in-scope&#x0201d; of these new regulations include major contributors to UK population intakes of nutrients of public health concern (that is, saturates, sugars, salt, etc.). Identified using dietary intake data, in-scope categories include those contributing to sugar intakes, for example, sugar-sweetened soft drinks, breakfast cereals, yogurts, biscuits, cakes, and confectionery [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, the regulations define which product types, within these in-scope categories, are considered &#x0201c;less healthy&#x0201d; by using the UK Nutrient Profile Model (NPM) [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], to define HFSS products on the basis of their nutrient and ingredient content [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, the UK multiple traffic light (MTL) FOPNL criteria identifies &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; (red), &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; (amber), or &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; (green) levels of 4 nutrients (fat, saturates, sugars, salt) that are intended to be displayed on the FOPNL, albeit voluntarily [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">In the literature, there exists heterogeneity across studies that have evaluated in-store interventions in the types of &#x0201c;healthier&#x0201d; products and categories they used (that is, bananas, &#x0201c;low calorie&#x0201d; foods, popcorn, etc.) [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, 1 study has previously found a reduction in &#x0201c;less-healthy&#x0201d; (HFSS) products at supermarket checkouts in stores with (voluntary) policies on restricting such products, compared with those without [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this case, classification of the products as &#x0201c;HFSS&#x0201d; was based on the evaluation of the content &#x0201c;per 100 g&#x0201d; of energy, saturates, sugar, sodium, protein, fiber, and fruit/vegetables/nuts, as required in the UK NPM. Besides this, there is currently little evidence available that specifically evaluates the HFSS status, nutritional composition, and FOPNL of products now promoted in UK supermarkets, including those stores newly experiencing regulatory restrictions. This study aims to evaluate specific product-level aspects of supermarket stores after the implementation of the new regulations with respect to these and other policies such as FOPNL, also in operation in the United Kingdom.

To evaluate product-level healthfulness using both the UK NPM and UK MTL FOPNL criteria, specific product-level nutrition information was collected including the content of energy (kcal/kJ), total fat (g), saturated fat (g), sugars (g), and salt (g).

These were the UK NPM [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and UK MTL FOPNL criteria [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, the UK MTLs evaluate each product&#x02019;s content of fat, saturates, sugars, and salt as green/amber/red on a &#x0201c;per 100 g&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;per serving&#x0201d; basis [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], whereas the UK NPM computes a score based on the &#x0201c;per 100 g&#x0201d; delivery of energy, saturates, sugars, sodium, fiber, protein, fruit/vegetables, and nuts [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The UK NPM score is used to classify products as non-HFSS (that is, &#x0003c;4) or HFSS in line with the regulations. In this study, the UK MTL criteria were used to evaluate each product&#x02019;s possession of 0&#x02013;4 inherent red traffic lights (iRTLs) (inherent, regardless of their voluntary display on-pack).

For ingredient declarations (<italic>n =</italic> 15) where no quantitative percentage (%) information was given for fruit, vegetable, and nut ingredients, values were estimated according to other ingredient quantities and order of appearance in the ingredient listing, using researcher judgment.

First, we show that the majority of the identified in-store RAs (54) displayed non-food products, and were not therefore included in the onward analysis. Among those RAs that were included, almost two-thirds (64%) of food products were from categories out-of-scope of (not covered by) the regulations, including pies and pastries, party food, etc. Together, both findings suggest that retail stores might take a partly category-based approach when implementing the new regulations, such that non-food and food products sold in RAs are likely to be from those outside the 13 in-scope categories. However, around a third (36%) of products sold in the included RAs were from those 13 in-scope categories (that is, breakfast cereals, cakes and cakes, confectionery, etc.) selected because these are known major contributors to children&#x02019;s sugar and calorie intakes [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In comparison, a previous report conducted before the regulations were implemented found that 70% of products sold in various &#x0201c;prime&#x0201d; key in-store locations (that is, aisle and checkouts) were from such categories [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="p0090">However, our study goes beyond product categories, and applies the UK NPM, as required by the regulations, to identify which products specifically are restricted (that is, according to HFSS status) within the included RAs. Prevalence of HFSS products that fell into those 13 in-scope categories was 17%. This suggests these stores were not in full compliance with the regulations, across the included RAs, at the time of our study. When compared with a previous (pre-regulation) in-store evaluation of products at checkouts (not aisle ends) that also used the UK NPM, 35% of products were classified as less healthy (HFSS) even within supermarkets with clear policies restricting less-healthy checkout foods [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="p0095">It is also important to highlight that both HFSS and non-HFSS products were identified in the included RAs, including for categories in-scope of the regulations. For example, among the &#x0201c;sweet biscuits and bars&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;cakes and cupcakes&#x0201d; products included, all or most were deemed non-HFSS. The existence of these non-HFSS products in such categories may be due to industrial reformulation to alter nutrient and ingredient delivery, in line with those thresholds of the UK NPM, as described elsewhere [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nonetheless, we also found that over half of the products in out-of-scope categories (that is, those not covered by the regulation) sold within the included RAs were HFSS (less healthy). Although this is likely due to the compositional nature of some categories of products (that is, fat and fat spreads), other out-of-scope categories including &#x0201c;pies, pasties, and Yorkshire puddings&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;party food&#x0201d; warrant highlighting. Products in these 2 categories alone made up 11% of those out-of-scope products in the included RAs, of which the majority (65%) were HFSS. Although our work did not collect data before the implementation of the regulations, it is possible that a consequence of this new policy is that more &#x0201c;out-of-scope&#x0201d; product categories are now being displayed in these key locations in-store.</p><p id="p0100">The occurrence of out-of-scope products in RAs that are also &#x0201c;less healthy&#x0201d; is of further concern given that our findings also show that such permitted products may also not display FOPNL, without which consumers may be &#x0201c;in the dark&#x0201d; about which promoted products deliver &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; (red) levels of specific nutrients of public health concern. Indeed, we found that overall only around half of products sold in RAs display FOPNL, and not all of these were in the MTL format, as recommended by UK policy [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This prevalence of FOPNL specifically on products promoted in key in-store locations is a new finding we add to the current literature, and is similar to previous evaluations of the penetration (&#x0223c;50% of products) of this voluntarily displayed product information in-store [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and online [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, in our study a further concern is that for products in in-scope categories, those classified as less healthy (HFSS) were significantly less likely to display FOPNL than non-HFSS products.</p><p id="p0105">Finally, we show that there exists both overlap and misalignment between the 2 UK policies used here to evalauted product-level healthfulness, because some products categorized as &#x0201c;non-HFSS&#x0201d; were found to possess a number of iRTLs. This is likely due to differences between the criteria used in the UK MTL and UK NPM, also reported recently [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, for products in the regulated in-scope category &#x0201c;ready to cook meals or meal centers,&#x0201d; 73% displayed MTL and almost all products (96%) were non-HFSS, yet 20% of these products possessed &#x02265;1 iRTL, and 9% possessed 3 iRTLs. Furthermore, this study now also suggests that many products in out-of-scope categories (that is, pies, pastries and Yorkshire puddings, party food, instant pasta, rice, noodles), which are allowed to be sold in RAs in key in-store locations regardless of HFSS status, can also possess a number of iRTLs indicating the delivery of &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; levels of fat, saturates, salt, or sugars. The simultaneous possession of iRTLs alongside the unreliable display of FOPNL, including MTLs across the permitted (out of scope) product categories surveyed here, has important implications for both consumers and industry. This is because the display of MTL FOPNL is known to encourage healthier choices, and drive industrial reformulation practices aimed at reducing the number of &#x0201c;red&#x0201d; traffic lights [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Implications for research and future policy impact evaluation</title><p id="p0110">To our knowledge this work is the first research evaluation of the in-store implementation of the new regulations and implies incomplete compliance with the regulations because some HFSS products were found to be present in in-scope categories in in-store RAs. Findings therefore imply the need for enforcement of the new regulation [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and echo other research into the challenge of undertaking such enforcement given the required categorization, and complex product-level UK NPM calculations [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our findings are also the first to highlight to policy makers the initial consequences of implementation of the new regulations, which mean it is now possible for RAs to legally display products that are HFSS yet in categories &#x0201c;out-of-scope&#x0201d; (that is, pies and pastries) and which may or may not display (voluntary) FOPNL indicating any &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; (red) levels of specific nutrients of public health concern. Conversely, policy makers should be aware that it is also now possible for some permitted non-HFSS products to also possess iRTLs, which again may or may not be (voluntarily) displayed on the front-of-pack.</p><p id="p0115">Recommendations for policy makers now include the need for <italic>1</italic>) the regulations to go further and include additional in-scope categories, including pies and pastries, <italic>2</italic>) the United Kingdom&#x02019;s existing voluntary FOPNL policy to become mandatory, to clearly show MTL FOPNL on products in RAs [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and <italic>3</italic>) continued enforcement of the regulations, which the researchers suggest may be facilitated with new consumer-facing product labeling to indicate &#x0201c;HFSS status&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;NPM score&#x0201d; thereby aiding both enforcement activities and store-level implementation. Together with our 7-step approach, and detailed, extensive, in- and out-of-scope category descriptions, our findings now support future evaluation of the impact of the regulations [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] on consumers and industry, and future development of the policy that best supports consumer healthier food choices.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Limitations and strengths of this study</title><p id="p0120">This study is cross-sectional and as such findings do not reflect product changes in RAs at timepoints pre- to post-implementation of the new regulations. In addition, our product-level evaluation was based on included RAs in 3 stores in 1 UK city at a single time period throughout 2 major national holidays taking place in December and January, after the implementation of the regulations the previous October. As such, results may not reflect other (that is, non-seasonal) time frames in those supermarkets nor nationally in other stores, given that stores change their promotional displays frequently, and perhaps even daily. Nonetheless, we aimed to collect a sample of products sold in RAs, by including stores of varying sizes and those in different urban locations, reflecting 3 different major UK retailers. In addition, our manual approach to identification of RAs without using measuring tapes to record the exact distances specified in the regulations for certain types of RAs, and identifying products based on photographs and online records may be subject to human error. Although both may have led to the incorrect products or RAs being included, this is unlikely because the majority of included RAs were &#x0201c;aisle-end&#x0201d; types, identification of which is not reliant on checking distances. This approach, which is specifically related to the regulations and independent of industry involvement, will be of interest to enforcement authorities. However, we highlight that it was not the aim of this study to check the legal compliance of stores, but instead to capture and evaluate the nutritional and labeling nature of specific products in RAs in retail food environments.</p><p id="p0125">Other limitations include the lack of (online) full nutritional and ingredient information for some products (that is, no information on fiber or percentage of fruit, vegetable, or nut ingredients), which hindered the application of the UK NPM. However, these labeling omissions are unlikely to sustainably change our classification of products as either &#x0201c;HFSS&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;non-HFSS&#x0201d; given that such fruit, vegetable, and nut content is required to be over 40% to &#x0201c;count&#x0201d; toward NPM score, reducing the risk of misclassifying the HFSS status of a product [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Finally, we placed individual products into categories (that is, either in- or out-of-scope), by using the regulation&#x02019;s implementation guidance [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] together with published industry guidance on product-specific inclusions and exemptions [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and product-level information from online supermarket records including description and ingredients. Although challenges still exist in categorizing some products, we believe this is the first research to report a full list of definitions of both in- and out-of-scope categories (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Tables&#x000a0;2 and 3</xref>), which are now of use to enforcers, and also researchers seeking to reduce study heterogeneity in research evaluating the impact of the regulations on sales [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0130">There exists a varied prevalence of less-healthy (HFSS) products promoted in RAs within 3 stores across categories both in- and out-of-scope of the new regulations, shortly after their implementation in October 2022. Although a feature of healthier food retail environments, the display of voluntary FOPNL (that is, traffic lights) was found to be variable across HFSS/non-HFSS promoted products in categories both in- and out-of-scope of the regulations, including those that possessed but may not display &#x0201c;red&#x0201d; traffic lights indicating high levels of specific nutrients of public health concern. Although limited in the number of stores surveyed, this study is the first researcher-led evaluation of those recently regulated consumer-facing product promotions within key locations in-store food retail environments, with specific implications for future policy development and impact evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0135">The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows &#x02013; SGM, EH, LWW: designed the study; EH: conducted the research, analyzed data, and performed statistical analysis together with SGM who wrote the manuscript with contributions from EH and LWW; and all authors: read and approved the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec7"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0140">Data described in the manuscript will be made publicly and freely available by request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0145">The authors reported no funding received for this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="p0150">The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>GBD Risk Factors Collaborators</collab></person-group><article-title>Global Burden of 87 Risk Factors in 204 Countries and Territories, 1990&#x02013;2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>396</volume><issue>10258</issue><year>2020</year><fpage>1223</fpage><lpage>1249</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30752-2</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">33069327</pub-id>
