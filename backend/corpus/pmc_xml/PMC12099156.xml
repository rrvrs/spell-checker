Clinical observations indicate that individuals in elevated mood states, such as mania or hypomania, are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviours, including hypersexuality. Characterised by an excessive preoccupation with sex, hypersexuality can lead to serious consequences such as sexual assault, unplanned pregnancies, and relationship breakdowns. Existing evidence suggests that opportunities for intervention in cases of hypersexuality in bipolar may currently be overlooked. This study provides insight into the lived experience of hypersexuality in bipolar using corpus-assisted discourse analysis (CADA) to qualitatively examine Reddit posts. The use of Reddit as a source of information in this study is particularly valuable because Reddit posts include narratives that may not be captured in traditional clinical settings. The candid, community-driven discussions found on Reddit can help identify gaps in care and raise awareness of the nuanced ways in which hypersexuality manifests and impacts individuals. Analysis of Reddit posts enables researchers to explore patterns, themes, and concerns that may be overlooked or underreported in clinical research, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the symptom of hypersexuality in bipolar. By employing keyword, concordance, and collocation methods, we identified 14 key thematic categories within the corpus and explored 4 of these in greater detail. The analysis showed that Redditors discussed hypersexuality within the context of bipolar symptoms, with many terms related to mood fluctuations and associated emotions. The diverse language used to describe sexual behaviours, along with references to shame and judgement, highlighted significant issues surrounding the discussion of hypersexuality in society and within healthcare settings. To enhance clinical practice, discussions about hypersexuality should be normalised and integrated into routine assessments, and healthcare professionals should receive training to address stigma.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bipolar</kwd><kwd>hypersexuality</kwd><kwd>natural language processing</kwd><kwd>corpus linguistics</kwd><kwd>computational linguistics</kwd><kwd>discourse analysis</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-00469580251338565"><funding-source id="funding1-00469580251338565">

The study&#x02019;s significance lies in its potential to inform both clinical practice and societal perceptions of hypersexuality in bipolar. By leveraging a corpus-assisted discourse analysis approach, this research also offers a novel methodological contribution to the field, demonstrating the utility of computational linguistics and text from social media to explore sensitive, often overlooked aspects of mental health. This conceptual contribution is timely, as increased awareness and understanding of hypersexuality could lead to better interventions and support for individuals with bipolar, particularly in clinical settings where such discussions are often taboo or misunderstood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-00469580251338565"><title>Methodology</title><p>This study methodology implements CADA to analyse the presentation of hypersexuality on Reddit.

</sup></p><p>First, we scraped all of the posts from the 2 largest subreddits dedicated to bipolar: r/bipolar and r/BipolarReddit over 5&#x02009;years between July 2017 and July 2022. The data collection took place in the UK but Reddit is an international site which is accessible globally, so posts were collected from English speaking Redditors regardless of location. Next, we used a pattern matching technique as has been implemented in prior research<sup><xref rid="bibr41-00469580251338565" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr43-00469580251338565" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>

To qualify for inclusion, diagnosis statements were required to (1) contain at least 1 condition term for bipolar, (2) match at least 1 inclusion pattern (ie, bipolar diagnosis of any type by a professional), and (3) not match any exclusion pattern (eg, self-diagnosis). We then scraped the entire posting history across Reddit for users who self-reported a diagnosis of bipolar. We note that there are limitations to using self-reported diagnoses as these have not been clinically verified within the dataset.</p><p>The posts were collected into a corpus which contained over 6&#x02009;million posts from ~5000 Redditors &#x02013; the Talking About Bipolar on Reddit Corpus (TABoRC). This resulted in a snapshot corpus that contains data that span 13&#x02009;years, with the earliest post dating back to June 2009 and the latest submission date in August 2022. Fourth, we used a list of key words and phrases related to hypersexuality with a pattern matching methodology to identify posts within the TABoRC which referenced 1 or more of the hypersexuality terms &#x02013; shown in <xref rid="table1-00469580251338565" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The hypersexuality search terms were created through an iterative process which involved training word embedding models on a corpus of interviews related to risk-taking behaviours in bipolar and identifying the most similar words in the Reddit corpus.

</sup> From a legal perspective, while Reddit is inherently an anonymous platform, it is possible that users employ the same username on other social media sites or platforms. Consequently, it is good practice to regard the information collected from the site as personal data. As researchers we acknowledge that the Reddit posts used in our study contain sensitive information, and we have only collected data that is available in the public domain. We did not seek informed consent from the Redditors whose posts were included in our corpus because this would have been impractical considering the number of posts and Redditors in our initial corpus from where the hypersexuality posts were filtered (~5000 Redditors in the <italic toggle="yes">Talking About Bipolar on Reddit</italic> Corpus: TABoRC).

We have masked the usernames in this dataset (ie, created alternative alphanumeric usernames for each Redditor in the dataset) and have only included paraphrased and depersonalised quotes in research outputs. Where we have presented paraphrased quotes, we verified that Redditors could not be re-identified based on an internet search of the reworded quotes.

Some Redditors describe self-management strategies that they use to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts of hypersexuality, such as using sex toys or a trusted partner to remove the risk of STIs, or deleting dating apps during a period of hypersexuality. The category of trauma and abuse includes terms such as <italic toggle="yes">rape</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">sexual trauma</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">childhood sexual abuse (CSA)</italic> and reveals multiple facets related to sexual trauma.

The taboo around hypersexuality is also referenced in the category of therapy and treatment, where some Redditors describe healthcare professionals as being reticent to discuss hypersexuality or state that they feel too much shame to broach the topic themselves. This issue has also been reported in the wider literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr82-00469580251338565" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>

</sup> the stigma surrounding mental illness makes it unlikely that Reddit users would falsely report symptoms of a condition they do not have. However, response bias is a general issue in health research, and this limitation is not unique to studies using social media data. Any study that relies on self-reported information, whether through surveys, interviews, or online posts, must consider the potential for inaccuracies, as participants may consciously or unconsciously misrepresent their experiences. We must also recognise that the corpus may represent bias user demographics as Reddit users tend to be younger, more tech-savvy, based in the US and predominantly male.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr90-00469580251338565" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>
</sup> However, recent research which investigates the demographics of a corpus of Redditors who self-report bipolar suggests that more than half of the Redditors in their corpus are female with a less skewed distribution of age groups compared to average US Reddit users.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-00469580251338565" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bibr90-00469580251338565" ref-type="bibr">90</xref></sup></p><p>We also note that due to the restricted set of hypersexuality keywords which was used to build the HiB-RC, the data presented is not fully representative of all experiences and perspectives on hypersexuality in individuals with bipolar across Reddit.

</sup></p><p>We acknowledge that reflexivity is an essential component of the research process. The authors&#x02019; perspectives, informed by both clinical and academic backgrounds, inevitably shape the interpretative lens through which data is analysed. The qualitative inductive approach used in our thematic coding process was an integral part of the reflexive research process. While this method allowed for a rich and nuanced exploration of lived experiences, it required ongoing critical awareness of the researcher&#x02019;s interpretative role. Given the inherently interpretative nature of qualitative coding, alternative readings of the data are always possible. Furthermore, the reliance on publicly available Reddit posts, rather than direct engagement with participants, required careful consideration of context and meaning within the data.</p><p>This study has yielded various avenues for further research, including more in-depth investigation on the role of shame and judgement and further investigation into experiences of trauma and abuse as well as CSA in relation to hypersexuality. A linked important area of research could use a subreddit such as r/bipolarSOs (used by people in a relationship with someone who has bipolar) to understand how hypersexuality is experienced from an external perspective, which could yield insight into early detection and presentation of the symptom of hypersexuality.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section20-00469580251338565"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has provided valuable insights into how hypersexuality is discussed by individuals who report a diagnosis of bipolar on Reddit, shedding light on the lived experiences of this symptom. By employing corpus-assisted discourse analysis, we were able to identify key thematic categories and linguistic patterns related to hypersexuality. The findings reveal that hypersexuality is often described in the context of fluctuating mood states and sometimes framed by feelings of shame and judgement, which contribute to the stigma surrounding this issue. A number of Redditors expressed a sense of being out of control, with hypersexuality leading to harmful consequences such as sexually transmitted infections, encountering vulnerable situations, and relationship breakdowns.</p><p>Moreover, the study highlights the importance of normalising discussions around hypersexuality in both clinical and social contexts. The research signposts to the need for better training for healthcare professionals to address this symptom without perpetuating stigma. Current therapeutic practices may not be sufficient in addressing the complex emotional and behavioural issues associated with hypersexuality in bipolar, which may contribute to unresolved trauma and delayed recovery.</p><p>Our findings suggest that improving access to psychological therapies, particularly those that provide a safe space for open discussions about sexuality, is essential. The development of training programmes for clinicians, informed by lived experiences, could also foster a more compassionate and effective approach to supporting individuals with bipolar who experience hypersexuality. Additionally, the research has demonstrated the utility of corpus linguistic methods in exploring sensitive topics and shows that Reddit serves as a unique space where individuals are able to make disclosures they may not feel comfortable sharing elsewhere.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Daisy Harvey <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_00469580251338565-img1.jpg"/>
