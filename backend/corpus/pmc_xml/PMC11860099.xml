However, much remains unknown about the differences in underlying psychological mechanisms of change. Assessing dynamic change of depressive symptoms and treatment-specific psychological constructs over time may yield important insights.</p></sec><sec id="sec0490"><title>Objectives</title><p>The current study will be the first to compare dynamic symptom networks in randomized groups of two psychotherapies by using dynamic time-warp (DTW) analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec0491"><title>Methods</title><p>We reanalyzed data from a randomized controlled trail of 82 patients suffering from MDD. Three depressive symptom subscales (mood, sleep, appetite/weight) and three treatment-related constructs (dysfunctional attitudes, decentering, and experiential avoidance) were collected at 7 time-points before, during, after treatment, and at up to 12 months follow-up. The DTW-analysis modeled the temporal dynamics of depressive symptoms and treatment-related constructs within each individual after which the findings were aggregated on the group-level. Undirected and directed networks were constructed, of which the latter yielded in- and out-strength for each node, that were compared between treatment arms.</p></sec><sec id="sec0492"><title>Results</title><p>Networks based on symptom and construct dynamics markedly differed between treatment arms. Within the CBT-arm a decrease of experiential avoidance was related to a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.059, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.008). Within the ACT-arm a decrease of mood symptoms was related to a decrease of experiential avoidance (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.051, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.04) and an increase of decentering was related to a decrease in sleep symptoms (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.038, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.02) and appetite/weight symptoms (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.049, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.03).</p></sec><sec id="sec0493"><title>Conclusions</title><p>DTW offers a promising alternative approach to study and compare working mechanisms of different treatment interventions. Comparing CBT and ACT revealed a decrease in experiential avoidance within CBT and an increase in the ability to decenter within ACT. However, within both treatments a change in other constructs, suggesting that a first alleviation of mood symptoms is important to activate underlying psychological change.</p></sec><sec id="sec0494"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
