Here, we manipulated length and strength of transcription in hybrid-genome mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) at a single locus upstream of the silent, late replicating, Pleiotrophin (Ptn) gene, directly comparing RT to nascent transcription rates at engineered vs. wild-type alleles. First, we inserted four reporter genes that differ only in their promoter. Two promoters transcribed the reporter gene at high rates and advanced RT. The other two transcribed at lower rates and did not advance RT. Since these promoters may prove useful in applications where effects on RT are undesirable, we confirmed the inability of one of them to advance RT at numerous ectopic sites. We next juxtaposed these same four promoters upstream of the Ptn transcription start site where they all transcribed the 96kb Ptn gene and advanced RT to different extents correlated with transcription rates. Indeed, a doxycycline-responsive promoter, which could not advance RT when induced as a small reporter gene, elicited a rapid and reversible RT advance proportional to the rate of transcription, providing direct evidence that transcription itself can advance RT. However, deletion of the Ptn promoter and enhancer, followed by directed differentiation to neural precursors, eliminated induction of transcription throughout the entire Ptn replication domain, without preventing the switch to early replication. Our results provide a solid empirical base with which to re-evaluate many decades of literature, demonstrating that length and strength of transcription is sufficient but not necessary to advance RT. Our results also provide a robust system in which to rapidly effect an RT change, permitting mechanistic studies of the role of transcription in RT and the consequences of RT changes to epigenomic remodeling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Mammalian chromosomes replicate segmentally in a temporal order, called the replication timing (RT) program. RT is cell-type specific and is disrupted in diseased states (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia, Sasaki, et al., 2019</xref>), and the RT program is critical for the faithful propagation of a cell&#x02019;s epigenomic state (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Lande-Diner et al., 2009</xref>). In yeasts, RT is regulated by mechanisms that promote or antagonize steps in the conversion of DNA-bound MCM double hexamers into an active helicase (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Hu &#x00026; Stillman, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Vouzas &#x00026; Gilbert, 2023</xref>). Many of these mechanisms are conserved in mammalian cells, but the complexities of changing epigenomic states during cell fate transitions necessitate additional layers of upstream regulation. These additional layers regulate changes in the RT of sub-megabase replication domains (RDs) during cell fate transitions by altering the probability of initiating replication within multi-kilobase initiation zones (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Dileep et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia, Kim, et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Sima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Vouzas &#x00026; Gilbert, 2021</xref>; need to add Wang, Klein, Mol. Cell 2021). In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), developmentally regulated early replicating RDs contain discrete early replication control elements (ERCEs) necessary to maintain domain-specific early RT, 3D architecture, chromatin compartment interactions, and transcription (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Sima et al., 2019</xref>). These elements interact in 3D, are surrounded by acetylated histones and are bound by multiple transcription factors, which may function by creating a local sub-nuclear environment favorable for initiating replication (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Sima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2024</xref>). ERCEs are reminiscent of the Fkh1,2 transcription factors in budding yeast that interact and promote early replication independent of their transcription activity (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Hoggard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Ostrow et al., 2017</xref>). RT can also be influenced by factors such as Rif1 that antagonizes initiation via mechanisms conserved with yeasts (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Brueckner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Gnan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Peace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Stow et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Transcriptional activation and silencing of genes is tightly coordinated with RT changes during cell fate transitions (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Dileep et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hiratani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2015</xref>) and early RT correlates with transcriptional activity in every multi-cellular organism investigated (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Goldman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Hatton et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Vouzas &#x00026; Gilbert, 2021</xref>). However, the relationship between RT and transcription has been enigmatic. The correlation is largely driven by a majority of genes that are early replicating and expressed in all cell types (constitutively early housekeeping genes), while genes that are developmentally regulated show a much weaker correlation between RT and transcriptional activity (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, some genes are induced when switching from early to late replicating (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hiratani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, mono-allelically expressed and asynchronously replicating genes show no relationship between their transcription and RT (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Several groups have studied the effect of ectopic transcription on RT, with seemingly contradictory findings. In two studies targeting a strong acidic transcriptional activator to the promoter of late replicating genes in mESCs, both activated their transcription and advanced their RT (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Brueckner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Therizols et al., 2014</xref>). In another case, targeting histone acetyltransferases to the mid S-phase replicating, human &#x003b2;-globin domain, inserted in the genome of transgenic mice, led to an advance in RT in the absence of transcriptional induction in both spleen lymphocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from these transgenic mice (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Goren et al., 2008</xref>). Ectopic insertions of promoters have also had varied effects on RT. Insertion of an SV40-promoter driven vector in Chinese hamster cells was shown to advance RT of the insertion locus at one insertion site but not at two others (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert &#x00026; Cohen, 1990</xref>). Insertion of the &#x003b2;-actin and &#x003b2;-globin promoters in a mid-late replicating domain of chicken DT-40 cells advanced RT in a transcription dependent manner (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brossas et al., 2020</xref>). Also, in DT-40 cells, transcription of a short transcript or low levels of transcription of a longer transcript were unable to advance RT (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Blin et. al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Hassan-Zadeh et. al.2012</xref>), while high levels of transcription of a long transcript did advance RT (Blin et. al.). The primary challenge with interpreting the seemingly contradictory results from the aforementioned collection of studies is the use of multiple methods to induce transcription and perturb RT in a variety of species, cell types and chromosomal sites.</p><p id="P5">Here, we take a systematic, reductionist, approach to dissect transcriptional activity in a late replicating domain with the express goal of identifying the elements of transcriptional activity that may have potential to advance RT of a developmentally regulated RD in which transcription of a single gene (Ptn) is induced coincident with a switch to early RT. We find that, with short selectable marker gene insertions, a high transcription rate can partially advance RT, although it also leads to a detectable number of longer transcripts that extend beyond the polyA termination site. However, lower levels of transcription, that are nonetheless fully capable of conferring drug resistance, do not affect RT in multiple vector and chromosomal contexts. Longer transcripts generated by the same promoters integrated at the same site but driving the 96kb Ptn gene, can all advance RT to varying extents. Taking advantage of the artificial Doxycyline-inducible promoter, we demonstrate that the advance in RT by this promoter, when driving Ptn, is proportional to the rate of transcription, is affected within hours of the onset of transcription and is reversible within a single cell cycle. However, we show that transcription of the Ptn gene is not necessary to advance RT in the context of differentiation; deletion of the enhancers and promoter of Ptn eliminated transcription induction without preventing the RT advance during a cell fate transition. Our results reconcile many seemingly contradictory reports in the literature, demonstrating that transcription can advance RT depending on the nature of the promoter and the length and strength of transcription but, is not necessary for an RT advance during a cell fate transition. Other factors must also be able to advance RT independent of transcription.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transcription Per Se is Not Sufficient to Advance RT.</title><p id="P6">We reasoned that one explanation for the varied effects of transcription on RT in the literature could be the use of different promoters. To systematically study the effect of transcriptional activation driven by different promoters on RT, we inserted a set of reporter genes into the same location upstream of the mouse Pleiotrophin (Ptn) gene, which encodes a neuronal growth factor. We identified the replication domain containing Ptn as one that switches from late to early coincident with transcriptional induction during the differentiation of mESCs to mouse neural precursor cells (mNPCs) (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hiratani et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Subsequently, we and others have shown that the domain can advance RT in response to transcriptional induction induced by targeting a strong transactivator to the Ptn promoter in the absence of differentiation (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Brueckner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Therizols et al., 2014</xref>). Ptn is the only gene in the domain that undergoes transcriptional induction at the time of the RT switch during differentiation to mNPCs; three other nearby genes, the Dgki gene whose 3&#x02019; end encroaches into the Ptn domain, an upstream non-coding RNA and the Chrm2 gene downstream of Ptn, all remain silent in both ESCs and mNPCs (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Giorgetti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2018</xref>). We constructed four reporter genes expressing the Hygromycin-Thymidine Kinase (HTK) gene fusion from a 2.0 kb transcript, differing only in the promoter used to drive expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>): the mouse and human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (mPGK and hPGK) promoters, the cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/chicken &#x003b2;-actin (CAG) promoter and the inducible tetracycline response element (TRE) promoter. The CAG promoter is a widely used synthetic construct that contains a cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer element, promoter, first exon and first intron of the chicken &#x003b2;-actin gene and the splice acceptor of the rabbit &#x003b2;-globin gene. The TRE promoter contains seven repeats of the bacterial tetO operator separated by a spacer. The mESC cell line used in all these studies expresses a reverse tetracycline transactivator (M2rtTA), consisting of the E. coli tetracyline repressor DNA binding domain fused to the Herpes virus VP16 acidic transactivation domain. The coding sequence for this artificial transactivator is integrated in front of and expressed constitutively from the Rosa26 promoter (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Quinodoz et al., 2021</xref>). Upon introduction of Doxycycline (Dox), a derivative of Tetracycline, rtTA binds to the tetO elements of the TRE promoter and induces transcription. For all experiments, unless otherwise stated, cells with the inserted TRE promoter were treated with 2&#x003bc;g/ml of Dox for 24 hours. These reporter cassettes were inserted, one at a time, via CRISPR mediated homologous recombination, into a site ~2.0 kb upstream of the Ptn gene transcription start site, avoiding all candidate cis-regulatory elements and replacing the genomic sequence marked as &#x0201c;YourSeq&#x0201d; in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020</xref>). Insertion was made into the <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> allele of a <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> x <italic toggle="yes">Castaneus</italic> hybrid mESC line, greatly facilitating phasing of the two Ptn alleles due to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density of approximately one SNP every 150bp. In this way, we could distinguish the effects of insertion into one allele, while retaining the unmanipulated homologous allele in the same cells as an internal control, permitting the sensitivity to detect small RT changes (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Sima et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To assess the effects of these insertions on RT and transcription rates, we performed Repli-Seq and Bru-Seq (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Marchal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Paulsen et al., 2014</xref>). The reporter cassettes harboring the CAG and mPGK promoters led to advances in the RT of the Ptn domain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, the reporter cassettes with hPGK or the inducible TRE promoter, with or without 2&#x003bc;g/ml Doxycycline (Dox) for 24 hours, were unable to advance the RT of the Ptn domain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Since all reporter cassettes transcribe HTK and sustain Hygromycin resistance, transcription of a reporter gene per s&#x000e9; is clearly not sufficient to advance RT. However, the CAG and mPGK promoters that were able to advance RT induced higher expression levels of HTK than the hPGK and TRE promoters (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Note that Bru-Seq detects a small amount of transcriptional readthrough of the small transgene with the CAG and mPGK promoters, suggesting that the poly-A termination site, used in many vector designs, is not fully effective at constraining high levels of transcription to the vector sequences (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 1A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>), albeit the level of read through Ptn expression is substantially lower than the levels of HTK expression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 1C</xref>). Directly comparing the RT advance of the Ptn domain and the levels of transcription of HTK (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) revealed that, for the two promoters that did advance RT, the RT advance was greater when transcription rate was higher. One possible interpretation of these data is that there may be a transcription level threshold necessary to advance RT. Alternatively, the readthrough transcription with CAG and mPGK, creating a longer transcript, may elicit the RT advance (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 1D</xref>). Another possibility is that there are other, transcription-independent, differences between these promoters that influence their ability to advance RT. In summary, our results reconcile previous contradictory reports in the literature (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Blin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brossas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert &#x00026; Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Goren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Therizols et al., 2014</xref>)by demonstrating that some selectable marker gene insertions can advance RT while others cannot, and this is dependent upon the choice of promoter driving transcription, possibly due to transcription rate.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The inability of hPGK to advance RT is vector and position independent.</title><p id="P8">The hPGK promoter is commonly used to drive transcription and clearly produces sufficient gene expression for drug resistance, yet neither of these promoters can advance RT at the Ptn locus. If its lack of effect on RT is position-independent, such a promoter can be a useful tool to manipulate genomes without the concern of altering RT and consequently inducing significant changes in surrounding chromatin context. To determine whether hPGK can drive gene expression without affecting RT in a vector and position-independent manner, we analyzed the RT of hPGK promoter insertions in two previously characterized F121&#x02013;9 clonal cell lines (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Brueckner et al., 2020</xref>) with a total of 107 single-copy/single-allele insertions of a PiggyBac (PB) vector expressing GFP from the hPGK promoter (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although there was a slight bias towards PB integration into early replicating domains, we detected integrations at sites replicating throughout S phase, including both constitutive and developmental late replicating regions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Results revealed that all single-copy/single-allele insertion sites showed a high correlation between the <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">castaneus</italic> alleles both in the mutant CM lines (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and the parental WT cell lines (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 2A</xref>), demonstrating preservation of RT despite ectopic transcription in one allele. The few domains whose RT differed between alleles were at sites where there was a natural difference in the RT of the <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> vs <italic toggle="yes">castaneous</italic> genomes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Additionally, there were no statistically significant advances in the RT of all but of the insertion sites (red line in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 2B</xref>). The RT plot of the insertion site with the statistically significant RT advance reveals a modest RT advance (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 2C</xref> &#x02013; Top Right). A small number of other insertion sites had small but statistically non-significant RT changes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To assess the transcription levels at each insertion site we mined the mRNA-seq data from Brueckner et. al.. Since the inserted eGFP sequence is identical at all insertion sites this was challenging. However, dividing the total eGFP expression by the number of insertions in each clone reveals that the average eGFP expression is higher than 99% of all genes in both clones (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 2D</xref>). To assess expression levels across each insertion, we filtered for reads containing the entire 16 nucleotide barcode. It is important to note that coverage across any given 16 nucleotide segment of the genome may be low and therefore, this type of analysis can only be informative to assess the expression of barcodes relative to each other and not to other genes. Further, low or no expression of a barcode may be the result of low coverage, rather than a biological observation. Barcode specific expression analysis was limited to 61/107 insertions for which the barcode has been identified. Calculating the RPM of each individual barcode reveals that barcodes inserted in early replicating loci tend to be more highly expressed than barcodes inserted in late replicating loci (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 2E</xref>). However, there are still a number of insertions in late replicating loci that appear to be highly expressed. Interestingly, there appears to be no correlation between the levels of transcription originating from a given insertion and changes in the RT of the insertion site (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup. Fig. 2E</xref>). We conclude that, with rare exceptions, transcription from the hPGK promoter fails to advance RT at many ectopic sites in mESCs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcription of a long transcript enhances the ability of promoters to advance RT.</title><p id="P10">A previous study in chicken DT40 cells provided evidence suggesting that longer transcripts are more effective at advancing RT but there was not a direct comparison of transcription and RT at the same genomic location, in the same cell lines (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Blin et al., 2019</xref>). To directly investigate the influence of gene size on RT, we took advantage of the negative selection marker of our reporter genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), to delete the sequence between each of our inserted promoters and the +1 TSS for the 96kb Ptn gene, thereby bringing the Ptn gene under the transcriptional control of each promoter (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Under these conditions, the TRE promoter (in the presence of Dox) and the hPGK promoter gained the ability to advance RT (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Additionally, the CAG promoter led to a more substantial advance in RT, whereas the mPGK promoter advanced RT to a similar extent driving either a small or large gene (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Quantification of the levels of Ptn transcription and the RT advance of the Ptn domain induced by each promoter reveals a correlation between RT advance and transcription rates (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup.

We treated TRE-Ptn cells with various concentrations of Dox for 24 hours (approximately 1.5 cell cycles), followed by Repli-Seq and Bru-Seq.

Interestingly, 3 hours of Dox treatment was sufficient to induce maximal Ptn transcription rates, and led to a substantial advance in RT, while 6 hours of treatment was sufficient to induce an RT advance similar to 12 and 24 hours of treatment (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Taking into account the 2-hour BrdU label following the 6-hour induction, that S phase is approximately 8 hours, and that the average doubling time is approximately 14 hours, we conclude that the RT shift occurs within the first cell cycle of transcriptional induction. We further investigated whether the observed RT advance is sustained upon Dox removal, perhaps as an autonomous epigenetic memory. We treated TRE-Ptn cells with 2ug/ml of Dox for 24h and then removed the Dox for a further 24 hours. Within 24 hours of the removal of Dox, transcription of the Ptn gene was eliminated and the RT of the Ptn locus returned to its original timing (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup.

Quantification of the levels of Ptn expression and changes in RT show a positive correlation of the increase in Ptn transcription with RT advance during the time course, and a complete elimination of both the Ptn transcription and the RT advance upon removal of Dox (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Sup.

We conclude that the TRE promoter-induced RT shift is rapid and reversible.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Transcription of the Ptn Gene is not Necessary to Advance RT During Differentiation.</title><p id="P13">The results we have shown with TRE-driven short and long transcripts demonstrate directly that, when isolated as the only variable, transcription of the Ptn gene can be sufficient to advance RT. The fact that a small TRE reporter gene cannot advance RT with the same promoter at the same location eliminates the possibility that binding of the rtTA transactivator on its own is sufficient to advance RT but, rather, the effect on RT requires a sufficient length and strength of transcription. This raises the question as to whether the natural RT advance that accompanies Ptn induction during differentiation requires Ptn transcription. We identified the Ptn domain as an RT-switching domain over 20 years ago (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hiratani, PNAS 2004</xref>), and showed that its RT is advanced coincident with movement away from the nuclear periphery and activation of transcription (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hiratani et al., 2010</xref>). The coincidence was such that we were not able to delineate the order in which these correlated events occurred over the course of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> differentiation, consistent with a direct link between transcription and RT. To directly address the causality between transcription and RT during differentiation, we deleted both the promoter and predicted enhancers for Ptn transcription, either on the <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> (129) allele alone or on both <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">castaneus</italic> alleles, and differentiated these cells to neural precursor cells (NPCs). Results (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) demonstrated that the RT advance during differentiation still occurred despite elimination of detectable Ptn transcription or whether detectable transcription was eliminated on one allele or both alleles. In the heterozygote configuration, both alleles were found to advance similarly, despite the differential presence of Ptn gene induction. Thus, Ptn transcription is sufficient to advance RT in mESCs, but not necessary to advance RT during differentiation. Given that Ptn was the only RNA detected throughout this domain during NPC differentiation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) by total, rRNA-depleted RNA-seq, and has previously been shown to be the only transcriptional activity detected throughout this domain in either mESCs or mNPCs (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Giorgetti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2018</xref>), there is no evidence for a requirement of any transcription for an RT shift during differentiation within this developmentally RT-switching RD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P14">The RT program is essential for maintenance of the global epigenome, strongly correlated with other structural and functional features of chromosomes and is regulated during development. Therefore, it is likely that changes in RT during differentiation are an integral part of organismal development, but we have little understanding of how they are executed. One longstanding hypothesis has been that transcription is sufficient for early replication and potentially drives RT changes during development (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Goldman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Hatton et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Therizols et al., 2014</xref>). If true, then such changes, affecting large replication domains and in some cases multiple genes, could alter domain-wide epigenome architecture to assemble a chromatin environment more robust for transcriptional throughout the domain (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2021</xref>). As attractive as this model is, it is challenged by both manipulative studies and genomics data that provide numerous contradictory examples of late replicating and expressed genes discussed in the introduction (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Blin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Hassan-Zadeh et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have taken a reductionist approach to systematically alter single variables that could reconcile these contradictions. We find that transcription can be sufficient to advance RT depending upon the length and strength of the resulting transcript; small genes can be transcribed with no detectable effect on RT but when driven by promoters that drive high levels of transcription, can advance RT. Large transcription units can advance RT even at low levels of transcription and show an RT shift that is positively correlated with transcription rate. However, we also show that transcription is entirely dispensable for developmental RT shifts, demonstrating that non-transcriptional mechanisms can be equally effective at driving an RT advance. Together, these experimental results provide an empirical rationale to reconcile data in the literature relating transcription and RT.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Length and Strength Explain Much of the Literature with Ectopic Transcription</title><p id="P15">Our results provide a solid empirical base with which to re-evaluate many decades of literature by considering length and strength of transcription as sufficient but not necessary to advance RT. This seems particularly true for the ectopic vector induction literature (see <xref rid="S1" ref-type="sec">Introduction</xref>). Small vectors may or may not advance RT, while long transcripts are more effective at doing so and ectopic inserts that do not induce transcription can advance RT through alternative mechanisms. Our results extend very interesting observations in chicken DT40 cells (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Blin et al., 2019</xref>). While this study was focused on the effects of RT on fragile site expression, and the design of the experiments did not directly compare transcription length, strength and RT at the same locus, their results were consistent with those reported here. An apparent contradiction with our results was that Blin et. al. did not find any significant effect of transcriptional induction by the TRE promoter even when driving a long transcript. There are several differences in our approaches that could account for this discrepancy. First, Blin et. al. detected a small advance in RT prior to induction and did not titrate their induction to determine whether they had achieved maximum transcription thereafter, thus it is possible that they had leaky transcription prior to induction and/or did not fully induce the TRE promoter. Second, steady state transcription was measured rather than nascent transcription rates as we have done. Third, RT relative to the wild-type locus was measured in different cell lines; our direct allelic comparison in a hybrid-genome cell line offers much improved sensitivity to detect RT changes. Perhaps most importantly however, RT and transcription were assayed by single locus PCR quantification, which in our hands can be misleading. Here, we have performed genome-wide analyses to capture whole-domain RT and all nascent transcription, with and without induction, at different times and concentrations of inducer, and relative to an internal wild-type control allele. Thus, our results have the potential to explain all of the discrepancies in the literature regarding ectopic manipulations of genomic sites to study the relationship of RT to transcription.</p><p id="P16">While our results to not unveil detailed mechanisms by which transcription can advance RT, they do focus our attention on the act of transcription of a sufficient length of chromatin. Most compellingly, we show that an artificial trans-activator, as the only variable, can be targeted to a small DNA sequence to induce transcription of a small gene with no effect on RT, while the same targeting event to the same small DNA sequence, when inducing a larger gene, substantially advances RT at the same or even lower targeting dosage. It is therefore unlikely that the effects on RT are indirectly related to Tet trans-activator binding and its downstream effects on local chromatin or its recruitment of the transcription machinery per s&#x000e9;. Rather, the RT advances must be a consequence of transcribing a larger segment of chromatin. Further, the fact that the RT advance can occur within a few hours and is rapidly reversible suggests a direct dependence upon transcription itself. Due to the short duration of the mESC G1 phase, we unfortunately cannot conclude whether or not transcriptional induction must occur prior to mitosis or the early G1 phase Timing Decision Point (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Dimitrova &#x00026; Gilbert, 1999</xref>). This will require recapitulating the system in cell lines with longer G1 phases. When considering the short transcripts, our data demonstrate that promoters that advanced RT drove detectable, albeit low level, read-through transcription beyond the vector polyA sequence. Thus, it is possible that their ability to advance RT is not directly due to transcription rate but to the frequency of long transcription. Altogether, the effects of ectopic insertions of promoters on RT may only indirectly depend upon the nature of the promoter but, rather, depend solely on the length and strength of transcription.</p><p id="P17">In contrast to the literature on ectopic manipulation of genomes, what is not fully explained are genomics results surveying natural relationships between RT and transcription in different tissues and differentiation systems (see <xref rid="S1" ref-type="sec">introduction</xref>). There are still numerous examples of large to very large, even highly expressed, late replicating and expressed genes and rare examples of induced genes experiencing delays in RT and genes that are only transcribed when late replicating (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2015</xref>). Many of these datasets score only steady state mRNA or steady state total RNA and most analyses do not take into account the effects of neighboring genes within the same domains. What is needed is a thorough re-analysis of genome-wide RT and nascent total transcription datasets to test the length and strength hypothesis. It also remains possible that the rules of engagement are different for ectopic vs. natural transcriptional induction.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>A system to rapidly and reversibly alter RT opens up avenues to explore mechanism.</title><p id="P18">Our finding of a system for inducible RT shifts opens up a host of experimental approaches to investigate mechanisms linking transcriptional induction to RT changes. How transcription mediates this change remains a subject of speculation. One possibility is that transcription of large genomic segments could move pre-loaded, and remarkably stable Mcm helicases (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Kuipers et al., 2011</xref>), in such a way that concentrates them downstream of the transcription unit, sufficiently to create a high efficiency initiation site (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>). What are needed to test this hypothesis are effective means to map the positions of Mcm double hexamers in living cells (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Another possibility is that longer transcripts tend to be spliced, and it is well established that proximity to speckles, the sub-nuclear storage compartments for splicing machinery is highly correlated with early replication and splicing may induce movement of domains towards the speckles (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bhat et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Our results underscore the need for a focus on transcript length and strength as a mechanism driving RT changes.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Transcription is not necessary to advance RT during a cell fate change</title><p id="P19">With respect to natural RT shifts in the context of differentiation, we demonstrate that transcription is not necessary for a differentiation-induced RT advance. Some other mechanism, perhaps developmentally-activated ERCEs present in the Ptn domain (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Sima et al., 2019</xref>), can elicit the RT switch in the absence of transcription. These two mechanisms could interact to form a positive feedback loop if either transcription or ERCEs could initiate an RT switch, followed by either binding of core TFs to activate latent ERCEs or a higher level of transcriptional activation following an RT shift, respectively (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2024</xref>). Together, this could serve to lock in epigenetic states in a step-wise fashion to provide flexible alternatives during a cell fate transition. Experimental approaches that can uncouple transcription induction from core TF binding during a natural cell fate transition will be needed to investigate the separate roles of these different regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Reporter Genes That do not Affect RT Provide Useful Tools.</title><p id="P20">Our work also identified promoters that can drive ectopic gene expression in either a constitutive or inducible fashion, and function well as selectable markers, without affecting RT.

All insertions were made ~1.7kB upstream of the Ptn domain, leaving the natural Ptn promoter and enhancers intact. Arrows indicate the direction of the HTK and Ptn genes. The donor vectors used to make the insertions into the Ptn domain contained one of the four promoters used in this study driving the expression of a fusion positive/negative selectable marker consisting of the hygromycin resistance gene fused to the tyrosine kinase gene (HTK), followed by a transcription termination sequence (pA). Therefore, the inserted sequences were identical except for the promoter, allowing us to directly compare the effects of the four promoters on RT. B) UCSD Genome Browser track indicating the locations of the exact genomic sequence (YourSeq) that was replaced by the insertions, as well as the Ptn promoter (red), proximal enhancers (orange), and distal enhancer (yellow) elements. All candidate cis-regulatory elements remained intact after transgene replacement. C) RT of the Ptn domain for the CAG-HTK (top left), mPGK-HTK (top right), TRE-HTK (bottom left) and hPGK-HTK (bottom right) cell lines. In each plot, the black and gray lines indicate the RT of WT ESCs and mNPCs respectively. The red lines indicate the RT of the insertion cell line. In the TRE-Ptn plot, dark red lines and light red lines indicate the RT of TRE-Ptn cells with and without Dox, respectively. Solid and dashed lines indicate the RT of the <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> (mouse strain 129) and <italic toggle="yes">castaneus</italic> alleles, respectively. Vertical blue line indicates the site of the Promoter-HTK insertion. The red shading indicates 50kb windows with statistically significant differences in RT between WT casteneus and modified 129 alleles. D) Genome browser view of the Ptn domain displaying nascent RNA (Bru-Seq) signal for each one of the four promoters. The left track displays the unparsed Bru-Seq signal in the Ptn domain. The vertical red line indicates the locus where the HTK insertion was made. The zoomed in Bru-Seq signal for HTK is displayed on the right track. The dynamic range for both tracks is the same. Replicate experiments are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>. E) Bar graph of the relationship between nascent HTK transcription and the observed advance in the RT of the Ptn domain. The asterisks indicate a significant difference in the levels of HTK expression calculated using DEseq, relative to HTK expression in the parental cell line, which is expected to be zero, since the parental line does not have an HTK insertion. The RT advance of the Ptn domain is measured as the average difference between the RT of 50kb bins of the <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> allele and the <italic toggle="yes">castaneus</italic> allele. As indicated, the <italic toggle="yes">musculus</italic> (129) allele replicates slightly earlier than the <italic toggle="yes">castaneus</italic> allele in WT; RT differences between the two alleles are normalized for these allelic differences.
