The long-term outcomes of these patients have not been well-examined to date, and it is unclear whether such patients represent a clinically distinct population. In addition, investigating common characteristics of these patients may reveal novel insights into the clinical factors and biological mechanisms underlying these complete responses, but this subject remains poorly studied to date. Here, we characterize long-term survival outcomes and clinical-genomic features of complete responders to immunotherapy (defined as a complete response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] or modified RECIST) among patients with HCC from the IMbrave150 trial and a large multicenter cohort of patients treated with anti&#x02013;programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1/L1) therapies in the first-line setting.<sup><xref rid="zoi241716r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="H1-2-ZOI241716"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-ZOI241716"><title>Patient Cohorts</title><p>This cohort study examined patients with advanced stage HCC treated with first-line immunotherapy in the IMbrave150 trial<sup><xref rid="zoi241716r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and in an international multicenter population (not previously published). The IMbrave150 trial was a randomized phase 3 trial enrolling patients across 17 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia that demonstrated the superiority of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab vs sorafenib in patients with Child-Pugh class A disease and advanced HCC who had not been previously treated with systemic therapies. The IMbrave150 cohort in this analysis included patients treated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in the intent-to-treat population because of legal, regulatory, or contractual constraints in data availability (eFigure in <xref rid="note-ZOI241716-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Tumors were assessed in the IMbrave150 trial by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and every 6 weeks until week 54 and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Data from IMbrave150 were accessed through Vivli, a public data-sharing platform. The multicenter cohort included patients with Child-Pugh class A or B disease treated in the first-line setting with anti-PD-1/L1 therapies (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, durvalumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab) across 3 centers (2 in the US and 1 in Asia) that were not enrolling sites for the IMbrave150 trial. These patients were not allowed to have received prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapies in any setting, including neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. Patients were retrospectively identified after investigators received institutional review board approval at their respective institutions. Patient characteristics and clinical data were abstracted from electronic medical records. All patients in the multicenter cohort were required to have a baseline scan taken within 5 weeks of immunotherapy initiation treatment, and must have had at least 1 subsequent radiographic tumor assessment after starting immunotherapy. Tumors were assessed in the multicenter cohort by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 2 to 3 cycles of treatment (approximating 6-9 weeks). No other exclusion criterion was used to select patients for the IMbrave150 or multicenter cohorts. Complete responses were defined by RECIST as the disappearance of all lesions and by modified RECIST as the disappearance of all enhancing lesions. An institutional-determined waiver was obtained for the analysis of the IMbrave150 cohort because the dataset is deidentified and publicly available. The multicenter cohort study was approved by the institutional review board at each of the respective sites, which waived the need for informed consent because the study was retrospective and posed minimal patient risk, in accordance with 45 CFR &#x000a7;46. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guidelines for cohort studies.</p></sec><sec id="H2-2-ZOI241716"><title>Molecular Profiling</title><p>A subset of patients in the IMbrave150 cohort had DNA isolated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens that were analyzed using an assay (F1CDx; Foundation One) that uses targeted, high-throughput, hybridization-based capture technology for the detection of alterations and copy number alterations in 324&#x02009;genes, and tumor mutation burden using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens. Tissue specimens from patients in the IMbrave150 trial were also analyzed for PD-L1 protein level by immunohistochemistry performed at a central laboratory with a PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay (SP263; Ventana Medical Systems), and was characterized according to the combined scoring of PD-L1 protein expression on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

In this cohort study, our post hoc assessment of the IMbrave150 trial and analysis of a contemporary multicenter population highlights how complete responders represent a nontrivial proportion of patients who are biologically distinct given their highly durable responses and survival. Patients who attained a partial response had a greater progression-free and overall survival benefit compared with patients who only attained stable or progressive disease, but their outcomes were still inferior to those of complete responders. Thus, the depth of immunotherapy response is likely associated with long-term outcomes in HCC, which supports the examination of additional strategies of using immunotherapies in combinations with locoregional therapy, such as with neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi241716r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241716r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241716r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Given that complete responders also experienced disease control even after the cessation of immunotherapy, our results suggest that indefinite treatment is not necessary in some patients with advanced stage disease. Nonetheless, the optimal length of immunotherapy treatment for advanced stage HCC and the utility of other modalities, such as liver transplantation, after a complete response remain to be defined.<sup><xref rid="zoi241716r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Stage migration after initiation of systemic therapies is not frequently encountered, but the nontrivial prevalence of durable complete responders brings into question how such patients should be managed according to existing treatment algorithms, such as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system.<sup><xref rid="zoi241716r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> It remains unknown whether durable complete responders have attained a functional or actual cure, but further research may help ascertain whether such patients may be considered for curative intent modalities, such as liver transplantation for patients with only hepatic disease or resection for evaluation of pathologic response.</p><p>Our analysis indicates that complete responders do not have unique clinical characteristics, including demographics or established prognostic factors, such as disease cause, tumor differentiation, and AFP levels. Thus, adverse factors conventionally associated with worse outcomes may not affect the ability of immunotherapy to induce complete and durable tumor responses. We also did not identify specific genomic alterations associated with complete response. However, pretreatment ctDNA levels were diminished in complete responders, suggesting that ctDNA may represent a novel predictive marker for immunotherapy treatment in HCC. In addition, although PD-L1 protein expression has not been consistently associated with immunotherapy outcomes in HCC, we identified that PD-L1 protein expression in immune cells was associated with complete response.<sup><xref rid="zoi241716r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241716r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241716r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Further studies are needed to corroborate our results given the relatively small sample size of patients in this study with molecular profiling data, but these findings suggest that ctDNA and immune PD-L1 protein expression may be used as stratification markers of tumors with exquisite and prolonged sensitivity to immunotherapies.</p><sec id="H2-4-ZOI241716"><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>This study is limited by the relatively small sample size of complete responders, which is attributable to the rarity of such tumor responses to immunotherapy. In particular, this may have reduced the statistical power of this study to detect associations between complete response and molecular features, given that only a subset of patients in both cohorts underwent genetic and immunohistochemical profiling. In addition, longer-term follow-up is necessary to elucidate patterns of progression and postprogression treatment outcomes among complete responders.</p><p>Nonetheless, the results of this study are likely generalizable and relevant to other patient populations as they were consistent across a pivotal trial population and a multicenter patient cohort. In addition, this study provides novel clinical and biological insights into the mechanisms underlying complete responses to immunotherapy in HCC, which underscores the importance of continued investigation into the long-term effects and durability of immunotherapy, and may inform clinical practice by identifying potential biomarkers for response, guiding patient selection, and optimizing treatment strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI241716"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this post hoc trial and multicenter cohort analysis of patients with HCC treated with immunotherapy, complete responders demonstrated prolonged survival and durable disease control even after discontinuation of therapy. Biological features of complete responders were also distinct, and further evaluation of immune cell PD-L1 protein expression and ctDNA as potential biomarkers is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI241716"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi241716r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name><surname>Rumgay</surname>
