Globally, the scientific community has been exploring multi-antibiotic techniques to find new ways to address this challenge. To address this critical challenge and explore alternative antibiotic treatments, we investigated the potential of <italic toggle="yes">Solanum trilobatum</italic>, an edible and medicinally important herb plant in Ayurvedic medicine. Methods: Our research focused on a 60 kDa serine protease isolated and purified from the leaves of <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic>, which showed evidence of possessing hydrolase activity. In this study, we examined the capability of the purified enzyme to eradicate preformed biofilms of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> in combination with ampicillin. Additionally, we assessed the stability of the enzyme in the presence of metal ions and detergents. Results: Enzyme kinetics revealed a Vmax of 48.63 &#x000b5;M/min and a Km of 14.08 &#x000b5;M, indicating efficient enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the enzyme exhibited maximum activity at physiological pH, suggesting its potential effectiveness under physiological conditions.

Introduction</title><p>A bacterial biofilm is a layer of bacterial colonization that forms beneath a protective wall made of the matrix. This protective wall consists of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPSs), which include proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and extracellular DNA. These components play a vital role in developing various microbial infections [<xref rid="B1-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Microbial cells within biofilms are known to survive extreme conditions and show resistance to factors such as UV radiation, metal-induced toxicity, exposure to acids, and changes in pH [<xref rid="B2-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, EPS helps these pathogens evade the immune system by inhibiting neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis [<xref rid="B3-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and intercellular adhesins within EPS serve as barriers to antimicrobials, as eDNA can bind to human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), reducing their effectiveness [<xref rid="B4-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, many bacterial species have shown a greater tendency to accumulate on a variety of surfaces, eventually forming sedentary communities. These surfaces vary from plant and animal tissues to pipelines that carry household and industrial waste and prolonged usage of medical devices such as catheters, implants, and contact lenses [<xref rid="B5-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Their proximity in these environments facilitates the efficient exchange of substrates, distributes the required metabolic products, and removes the toxic end products. This accumulation of mono- or poly-microbial aggregates results in the formation of biofilms comprising diverse communities of both bacteria and fungi [<xref rid="B6-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Though they impart both positive and negative impacts on human health, biofilms are known to exhibit a profound effect in inducing several pathogenic forms of human diseases and plant infections. The most common examples are cystic fibrosis and dental plaque. While individuals affected by cystic fibrosis are susceptible to chronic <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infections resulting in the formation of mucoid biofilm [<xref rid="B7-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], patients affected by dental plaque may experience increased biofilm acidification, which, in turn, leads to the demineralization of the enamel, forming dental caries [<xref rid="B9-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is widely recognized as a major human pathogen responsible for a variety of diseases, including skin infections, bacteremia, and infective endocarditis [<xref rid="B10-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among the different staphylococcal strains, <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> is considered the most virulent due to its diverse array of secreted and cell-surface-associated virulence factors, immune evasion mechanisms, and toxin production [<xref rid="B11-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These strains exhibit significant genetic diversity, enabling them to form biofilms and acquire antibiotic resistance. Particularly concerning are the methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) strains, which often display multiple antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="B12-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They are a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, as they can attach to and accumulate on host tissues or medical devices, leading to complications such as surgical site infections, intravascular catheter (IVC) infections, and implant-related infections [<xref rid="B11-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Research indicates that up to 80% of human bacterial infections are associated with biofilm-forming microorganisms like <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> [<xref rid="B13-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains can also form biofilms in other sectors, such as the food and dairy industries. In these environments, they tend to adhere to milking machines and food-contact surfaces, showing high resistance to antibiotics and sanitization procedures [<xref rid="B14-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These biofilms are particularly resistant to both innate and adaptive immune defense systems, as well as to antimicrobial agents, resulting in persistent infections and treatment failures. Owing to their widespread prevalence in diseases and prolonged resistance to antimicrobial treatments, exploring novel approaches to combat or prevent biofilm formation has become of paramount importance worldwide.</p><p>Proteases hydrolyze protein peptide bonds and can be classified as serine, cysteine, aspartic, metallo, glutamic, and threonine proteases based on their catalytic residue. Among all the known families, serine proteases are the most extensively characterized proteases [<xref rid="B15-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. They are involved in the metabolic processes of all organisms and regulate many physiological pathways. In general, proteases from leaves are few, and particularly, serine proteases from plant leaves are very rare [<xref rid="B16-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Most of the characterized plant proteases are cysteine proteases, and they are readily reduced by air oxidation and metal ions [<xref rid="B18-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The search for novel plant proteases with high stability has become a global research theme.</p><p>The plant <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> is well known for its traditional use in mucus clearance. Incidentally, this plant is known to demonstrate the existence of hydrolase. <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> has been in use for various ailments in different parts of Asian countries [<xref rid="B19-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and its active principle &#x0201c;sobatum&#x0201d; has been reported to possess anti-tumor activity [<xref rid="B21-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and anti-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="B23-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the tannin of <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> leaves has been reported to have anti-bacterial activity [<xref rid="B24-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The aqueous and methanol extracts of its leaves and stems were also reported to have anti-microbial activity [<xref rid="B26-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The leaf extract of <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> was reported to exhibit anti-oxidant potency [<xref rid="B27-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as well as possess oviposition-deterrent and repellent activities against the mosquito <italic toggle="yes">Anopheles stephensi</italic> [<xref rid="B28-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The presence of Nucleotide Binding Site (NBS)&#x02013;Leucine-rich repeating (LRR) resistance gene analogs has also been reported in <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> plant species [<xref rid="B29-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While plant extracts such as <italic toggle="yes">Piper betle</italic> L [<xref rid="B30-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> Labill, and <italic toggle="yes">Juglans regia</italic> L [<xref rid="B31-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have been studied for their antibiofilm properties against <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains, a recent report demonstrated the anti-<italic toggle="yes">Vibrio cholera</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> action of a purified <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> antibacterial protein (<italic toggle="yes">St</italic>AP) from <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> leaves [<xref rid="B25-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; no published reports exist on the antibiofilm activity of <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> extracts. Furthermore, previous studies have primarily attributed the antibiofilm properties of these plant extracts to the presence of phytochemicals rather than proteins or enzymes. Therefore, this study presents a novel investigation into the potential of an <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic>-derived serine protease in combating <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> biofilms. In this context, we describe the identification, purification, and biofilm-eradicating potency of a serine protease from the leaves of <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic>, an edible plant known for its medicinal properties.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-idr-17-00050"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-idr-17-00050"><title>2.1. Extraction and Purification</title><p>As reported in an earlier study [<xref rid="B25-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the fresh leaves of <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> were collected from the Vandalur Forest area near Chennai, India. After removing the thorns, the leaves were thoroughly washed with distilled water and left to air dry. A total of 100 g of the dried leaves was weighed and then extracted using a 50 mL buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.8) and 150 mM NaCl. The resulting mixture was filtered through muslin cloth to remove large particulates.</p><p>The filtered extract was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 &#x000b0;C to separate the supernatant (crude extract) from the pellet. Enzymatic assays were performed on the supernatant using trypsin as the positive control and the extraction buffer as the negative control [<xref rid="B15-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For further purification, the crude extract was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation. Pulverized ammonium sulfate was gradually added to the extract with constant stirring to achieve 30% saturation. After standing for 2 h at 4 &#x000b0;C, the mixture was centrifuged again at 12,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in 3 mL of the extraction buffer. Subsequently, the saturation was adjusted to 30&#x02013;60% and 60&#x02013;80%, with the same centrifugation and re-suspension procedures applied for each fraction. The three obtained fractions were then extensively dialyzed against 20 mM Tris (pH 7.8) using 10 kDa cut-off dialysis membranes at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight, followed by an additional 4 h of dialysis exchanged with fresh buffer to remove excess salts.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-idr-17-00050"><title>2.2. Purification of Active Fraction via Anionic Exchange Chromatography</title><p>Ion exchange chromatography was performed using a strong anion-exchange column, Q-Sepharose HP-FF 1 mL (GE Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA), to purify the active 60&#x02013;80% fraction. The column was pre-equilibrated with 10 column volumes (CVs) of buffer A [20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, containing 150 mM NaCl] and buffer B [20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, containing 1 M NaCl], at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, as mentioned by [<xref rid="B25-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Before loading the active fraction, it was centrifuged briefly at 12,000 rpm at 4 &#x000b0;C to remove any particulate matter, and the clear supernatant was loaded onto the column. The unbound proteins were washed out with 8 CV of buffer A, while the bound proteins were eluted using a linear salt gradient (0 M NaCl to 1 M NaCl), collecting fractions in 20 CV of buffer B at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The eluted and unbound fractions were analyzed for enzymatic activity to identify the fraction with the highest activity. Additionally, all fractions were subjected to Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to assess their purity and homogeneity. This allowed for the identification of the fraction with the desired enzyme activity and ensured that the protein was adequately purified.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-idr-17-00050"><title>2.3. Biofilm Eradication Assay</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strain from the Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank (MTCC) No. 96, obtained from the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), India, was grown overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C in autoclaved LB medium and then plated on an LB agar plate. A well-grown single colony was picked and inoculated into LB medium, where it was grown overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C with agitation at 180 rpm. These bacterial suspensions served as inocula for all biofilm experiments. The biofilm was formed by adding 900 &#x000b5;L of LB medium to 100 &#x000b5;L of the <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> inoculum, mixed in two different 24-well polystyrene plates from top to bottom in their respective wells.

After 2 days, the contents of the wells were carefully discarded and washed once with a 0.1 M NaCl solution, followed by three washes with water. The wells of the first plate alone were stained with a crystal violet solution for 15 min and then washed with water. The formed biofilms were observed using an optical microscope. In the second plate (unstained), the preformed biofilm was treated with 160 &#x000b5;M of purified protease as well as a combination of the protease fraction and ampicillin and kept overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C in a static environment. After 12 h, the contents of the well were carefully discarded and washed three times with water. The wells were stained with a crystal violet solution, and then, they were washed with water.

After incubation, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The proteolytic activity of the enzyme was visualized as a clear, colorless zone against the substrate background, indicating gelatin and casein digestion [<xref rid="B37-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot9-idr-17-00050"><title>2.9. Determination of Vmax and km</title><p>The spectroscopic method was employed to determine the kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km, of <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> serine protease using casein as the substrate, as described with a slight modification [<xref rid="B38-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A fixed concentration of 5 mM serine protease, along with a fixed reaction time, was used to measure the rate of proteolysis as the substrate concentration increased. To assess residual protease activity, varying concentrations of casein (ranging from 7 to 80 &#x000b5;M) were added to purified serine protease and incubated for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C in a 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.8. The reaction was stopped by adding 10% ice-cold TCA solution after the 30 min mark. After incubation at 4 &#x000b0;C for an additional 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for the spectroscopic analysis. The progression of the proteolysis reaction was observed by measuring UV absorbance at 280 nm. The Km and Vmax value of serine protease was determined by the substrate&#x02013;velocity curve. Assays were carried out in triplicate, and the kinetic parameters were determined using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (<uri>Graphpad.com</uri>, San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-idr-17-00050"><title>3. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-idr-17-00050"><title>3.1. Isolation and Purification of Protease from Solanum Trilobatum</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> leaves were extracted in a 20 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl buffer, following which the protease activity of the crude extract was tested by the radial diffusion method (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a). By using casein as the substrate, the dialyzed ammonium sulfate fractions (0&#x02013;30%, 30&#x02013;60%, and 60&#x02013;80%) along with the aqueous crude extract were evaluated by the UV spectroscopy method. The proteolytic activity was measured from the cleaved and liberated casein fragments, which were subsequently quantified by UV 280 nm absorbance. Among the various fractions, the 60&#x02013;80% fraction exhibited maximum protease activity similar to that of bovine trypsin (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b). Substantial protease activity was also observed in the crude extract.</p><p>Based on this observation, the active fraction (60&#x02013;80%) was loaded onto a Q Sepharose Fast Flow anionic exchange column. While the unbound proteins were collected as an unabsorbed fraction with the same buffer A [20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, containing 150 mM NaCl], the bound proteins were eluted using an increasing salt concentration, starting from 0 M NaCl to 1 M NaCl. The elution profiles of both the flow-through and active fractions are depicted in <xref rid="idr-17-00050-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a. Following the chromatographic run, both the unbound and elution peak fractions were analyzed for their proteolytic activity on a casein agar plate. The activity study revealed that only the eluted peak (bound) fractions exhibited reliable protease activity when compared to the unbound fraction (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b). Using 10% SDS-PAGE, the homogeneity of those bound fractions displaying the caseinolytic activity was determined, confirming the protease&#x02019;s purity (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c). Interestingly, the molecular weight (~60 kDa) of this purified <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> serine protease (<italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP) was found to be in accordance with serine proteases found in the fruits of <italic toggle="yes">Cucumis trigonaus</italic> [<xref rid="B39-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the leaves of wheat seeds [<xref rid="B40-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and the seeds of <italic toggle="yes">Solanum dubium</italic> [<xref rid="B41-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>As a result, the fractions exhibiting proteolytic activity were pooled, concentrated, and used for further kinetic as well as other functional characterization studies.

Inhibition of Serine Protease by Serine Protease Inhibitor (PMSF)</title><p>As outlined in the methodology section, the enzyme activity of the <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP was tested in the presence of the cysteine protease inhibitor Iodoacetamide (IAA), the metalloprotease inhibitor (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid&#x02014;EDTA), and the serine protease inhibitor (Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride&#x02014;PMSF). The results indicated that protease activity remained unaffected in the presence of either EDTA or IAA, as evidenced by distinct zones of digestion observed in the wells containing these inhibitors (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). Conversely, the incorporation of the serine protease inhibitor PMSF into the purified protease completely inhibited its enzymatic activity (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b), confirming that the <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP is a member of the serine protease family.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-idr-17-00050"><title>3.3. Staphylococcus aureus-Preformed Biofilm Eradicated by StSP</title><p>Biofilm eradication experiments were employed to understand the effect of these enzymes on preformed biofilm surfaces. The experiments reveal the destruction of preformed biofilm by treatment with these enzymes. In <xref rid="idr-17-00050-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the upper panels (a, b, c, and d) show the preformed biofilm on the polystyrene surface of the microtiter plate. The lower panels (e, f, g, and h) correspond to the respective sample treatments mentioned in the figure. In the lower lane of the figure, the <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP-treated biofilm shows reduced growth compared to the control. When the preformed biofilm was incubated with media and grown statically, profound propagation was witnessed (referred to as &#x0201c;untreated&#x0201d;). The robustness of the biofilm could be witnessed by the fact that ampicillin had no effect on the biofilm and the propagation was as good as the untreated surface (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>h). Though they differ in their specificities, the degree of disturbance exhibited by both the enzyme and the combination of the enzyme and the antibiotic (<italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP and ampicillin) is comparable. From a visual comparison of the <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP and the combination of the enzyme and the antibiotic, the combined usage was found to have better biofilm eradication potency than the simple enzyme (<italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP) treatment (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f). The presence of the biofilm even after treatment with enzymes may be due to the spread of biofilm fragments, which are cleaved off by enzymes. The reduced biofilm growth suggests the influence of antibiotics on the fragment or the planktonic bacteria excreted from the biofilm after the digestion of EPS.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-idr-17-00050"><title>3.4. Effect of Metal Ions</title><p>The enzymatic activity of the serine protease isolated from <italic toggle="yes">S. trilobatum</italic> leaves exhibited a significant enhancement with the addition of 0.1 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> metal ions, while experiencing a moderate activation with Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a). Notably, the residual activity showed a remarkable increase of more than 1-fold, reaching up to 1.5-fold and 1.1-fold when incubated with Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> metal ions, respectively. However, the enzymatic activity of the <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP remained unaffected by the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions among the tested metal ions (<xref rid="idr-17-00050-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a). Interestingly, a similar activation of residual activity by a 60 kDa serine protease from pigeon pea leaves was observed with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. In summary, none of the tested metal ions inhibited or altered the proteolytic activity of the <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP, aligning with previously published reports that emphasize the role of metal ions in enhancing the activity of plant proteases [<xref rid="B42-idr-17-00050" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-idr-17-00050"><title>3.5.

However, when treated with acetone, the activity was retained at more than 1-fold, and it approached the same fold when exposed to isopropanol as toluene.

The study involved varying substrate concentrations (7&#x02013;80 &#x000b5;M), revealing that, at higher concentrations of the substrate, the proteolytic activity reached the enzyme&#x02019;s saturation point. This was evident in the linear regression plot and the Km of this enzyme, at 14.63 &#x000b5;M. The <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>SP enzyme has a Vmax of approximately 48.63 &#x000b5;M and a Km value of 14.08 &#x000b5;M/min.
