While some sought education and social and professional support, others self-isolated or engaged in high-risk behaviors to cope. Despite advances in HCV treatment, PWEI continue to experience various forms of stigma and fear surrounding their HCV diagnosis, resulting in delayed HCV care.

Introduction</title><p>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection disproportionately affects certain sub-populations, underscoring the importance of targeted efforts among priority groups if the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination efforts are to be achieved by 2030 [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Canada has defined people with experience of incarceration (PWEI) as a priority population for national HCV elimination efforts [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. People who are incarcerated in Canadian prisons represent 10% of the overall HCV burden in Canada [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most recent statistics by the Public Health Agency of Canada show that 1 in 10 people in prison&#x02014;or 38,000 individuals&#x02014;have been exposed to HCV, pointing to the urgent need to improve uptake of viral hepatitis services and care in prison [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given the interface between carceral settings and surrounding communities, as well as high turnover and recidivism rates among incarcerated individuals, optimizing HCV care in all prisons globally is paramount for HCV elimination [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>An extensive body of work exists on ways in which people who inject drugs with chronic HCV conceptualize HCV [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This research suggests that an individual&#x02019;s understanding of their illness affects their willingness to get screened for HCV, to consider initiating treatment, and to complete treatment once started. Much less research has been published on ways in which PWEI with chronic HCV perceive their infection and its management in prison or following release. While most research has been published in the interferon era [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], much less is known in the direct-acting antiviral era despite simplifications in testing and treatment [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A better and current understanding of how PWEI perceive their chronic HCV infection may offer insights into how healthcare providers in prison, and in surrounding communities, can better understand and utilize HCV illness perceptions to evaluate willingness to engage in HCV care and treatment among PWEI [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM)&#x02014;or illness perception model&#x02014;is a well-recognized social cognition approach [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] that seeks to understand how individuals&#x02019; perceptions of &#x0201c;illness threats&#x0201d; guide their behaviors (coping strategies) in addressing these threats. <xref rid="viruses-16-01910-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents the CS-SRM and its main components [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. According to this model, people develop beliefs and emotions about an illness, known as illness representations, based on information stored in memory and acquired through external (e.g., healthcare professionals, media) or endogenous (e.g., symptoms experienced) sources. Illness representations are categorized into two major groups: cognitive illness representations and emotional illness representations. Cognitive illness representations represent individuals&#x02019; logical beliefs about an illness and can be further subdivided into six categories: identity, timeline, cause, consequences, controllability/curability, and coherence. Emotional illness representations represent individuals&#x02019; reflections on their emotional responses to the illness. Based on these illness representations, individuals develop, enact, appraise, and update a set of coping strategies. New experiences may lead to new illness representations, which in turn generate new coping strategies or update existing ones [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The CS-SRM is a dynamic framework which can offer insights into the evolving P perceptions of HCV and its management among PWEI. To our knowledge, the CS-SRM has never been applied to PWEI. That being said, previous studies among PWEI have demonstrated several barriers to HCV treatment initiation, including but not limited to ongoing injection drug use, limited access to harm reduction services, and HCV-related stigma [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Conversely, a strong motivator for the completion of HCV treatment in prison was the reduced number of competing priorities&#x02014;many of which take precedence post-release [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These studies underscore that PWEIs&#x02019; illness perceptions of HCV play a role, among many other factors, in treatment initiation in prison. Similar studies are needed in Canada given the disparate political, structural, and organizational factors that exist among carceral settings worldwide, limiting the generalizability of previous studies [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Setting and Participants</title><p>There are 16 provincial prisons in Quebec, and they housed approximately 4412 sentenced individuals in 2022/2023 [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The mean duration of incarceration in Canadian provincial prison is 28 days [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although we initially intended to recruit individuals in Quebec provincial prisons, all non-essential prison-based research was halted from March 2020&#x02013;2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Consequently, we opted to recruit individuals recently released from prison rather than those currently sentenced in prison.</p><p>We recruited individuals aged &#x02265; 18 currently or previously living with chronic HCV who were incarcerated in one of Quebec&#x02019;s 16 provincial prisons within the previous 12 months and who were able to consent to study participation in either English or French. Potential participants were recruited using a convenience sampling strategy from CACTUS Montr&#x000e9;al, a large urban harm reduction community organization dedicated to the prevention of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections in Montr&#x000e9;al. In 2020&#x02013;21, 70,939 people visited CACTUS Montr&#x000e9;al to use its various programs (e.g., needle and syringe programs, supervised injection sites, and the social involvement program for people who use drugs) [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Data saturation in qualitative research is an important indicator of quality and trustworthiness. In this study, we gauged saturation by whether new themes emerged after each interview. To ensure an adequate sample for content validity, we applied the 10 + 3 decision rule [<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], whereby we aimed to conduct 10 initial interviews, followed by an additional three interviews until no new themes emerged.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-viruses-16-01910"><title>2.3.

All interviews were conducted in French and lasted an average of 58 min (range: 34&#x02013;88 min). Interviews consisted of two separate research questions, one of which is the focus of a separate manuscript. The median age of participants was 48 years old (range: 33&#x02013;59 years). The highest level of education among most participants was high school (n = 15); four individuals had completed a university degree. Of the 19 participants, 7 (37%) were diagnosed with HCV in prison. Fourteen had received treatment for HCV, among whom, six were cured and three had received treatment in prison; one individual had been spontaneously cured. Four participants had not yet received direct-acting antivirals: one was awaiting treatment initiation, while the other three were not yet ready to start treatment.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-viruses-16-01910"><title>3.1.

Discussion</title><p>This study explored the perceptions of HCV and its management among PWEI in Quebec provincial prisons who had been released into the community in the preceding 12 months, using an established social cognition model, the CS-SRM. Participants primarily reported delays in seeking initial HCV care, including screening, due to non-specific symptoms and stigma related to injection drug use and/or associated with incarceration. Following diagnosis, most participants reported experiencing fear and attempted several coping strategies during the course of illness (e.g., self-management, seeking social support, and seeking information) before visiting a healthcare provider. While knowledge of HCV among PWEI appears to be improving over time, holistic education that involves correctional officers and healthcare providers may help overcome stigma, address fears, and improve awareness of both patient- and occupational-level benefits of HCV testing and treatment of PWEI.</p><p>Delays in seeking HCV care were primarily due to non-specific symptoms and associated coping mechanisms following diagnosis. Generalized fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms not specific to chronic HCV infection, or no symptoms at all, made it difficult to consider a diagnosis of HCV and/or seek care. Furthermore, some participants initially attributed their symptoms to food poisoning, other infections, or medication side effects, as has been found in other studies [<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Following the diagnosis of HCV, many participants isolated themselves from friends and the public. Some coped by using drugs to mask symptoms, further compromising their ability to acknowledge their infection. Most often, however, self-isolation was a strategy to avoid experiencing prejudice and stigma by others and/or to reduce the fear of transmitting the virus to others [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Participants reported experiencing several forms of stigma, including but not limited to stigma related to having HCV, injection drug use, and/or associated with incarceration. Stigma contributed to diminished feelings of self-worth as a result of being viewed as a &#x0201c;junkie&#x0201d;, a &#x0201c;dishonest person&#x0201d;, or even &#x0201c;a criminal&#x0201d;, findings that are corroborated elsewhere [<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Internalized stigma&#x02014;that is, when social attitudes about people who inject drugs and are temporarily housed in prison become part of a person&#x02019;s understanding of themselves and their sense of self-worth&#x02014;may also impact people in prison [<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and subsequent health-seeking behaviors. Internalized stigma has been associated with poor health outcomes and healthcare-system engagement [<xref rid="B53-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], pointing to the urgent need to offer education and training to facilitate destigmatized approaches to substance use and HCV that still promote institutional safety and security during incarceration.</p><p>Participants reported several fears following their HCV diagnosis. They feared transmitting the virus to others, worried about their life expectancy and the well-being of their children, and, consequently, limited their inter-personal relationships [<xref rid="B54-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In fact, studies have demonstrated that PWEI are motivated to start HCV treatment as an act of reciprocity to their family and to improve inter-personal relationships [<xref rid="B55-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This not only highlights the need to raise awareness about HCV prevention and transmission among PWEI but may also assist healthcare providers in better understanding how to deliver information about HCV, recognizing that PWEIs&#x02019; fears can be allayed with early treatment initiation. Simplifying and streamlining the pre-treatment clinical evaluation and workup within a single visit in carceral settings has been shown to be associated with high treatment uptake in prison and high levels of acceptability among PWEI [<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. While immediate treatment initiation is complicated in prison due to short incarceration durations and challenges with movement, it is important to recognize that this approach may have an important positive psychological impact on PWEI, an area that requires further research.</p><p>Encouragingly, participants reported an improvement in HCV knowledge over time&#x02014;albeit still plagued with misconceptions&#x02014;which resulted in changes in their perception of HCV and its management. Information about HCV was provided to PWEI through various mechanisms. Many had received verbal information from their healthcare providers during screening and/or treatment; however, some struggled with understanding and processing due to their initial shock and disbelief. Some participants accessed information on HCV in prison through pamphlets and peer-led group sessions, as well as through correctional officers. This suggests that access to HCV information for PWEI may be improving. However, gaps in HCV health literacy (knowledge, attitudes, and competencies) among key sectoral sub-populations (healthcare providers, correctional officers, and PWEI) have been identified as major barriers to enhanced HCV care for PWEI [<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Consequently, whole-of-sector education that includes correctional officers and healthcare providers may help overcome stigma and improve awareness of both the patient- and occupational-level benefits of HCV testing and treatment of PWEI [<xref rid="B60-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Due to highly entrenched prison subcultures, peers may be considered part of an attractive and cost-effective educational strategy for PWEI [<xref rid="B63-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] which may lead to meaningful changes in the way PWEI engage in HCV-related care [<xref rid="B64-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Finally, many participants relied on community organizations, such as safe injection sites, as their primary sources of information. As these are often frequented by PWEI following release, enhancing communities&#x02019; organizational capacity to provide education and/or HCV screening (including other sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections) will be key to HCV elimination among this population [<xref rid="B65-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>Finally, prior to this study, little was known about how people with chronic HCV cope following their diagnosis [<xref rid="B66-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and nothing was known about how PWEI do so. Participants reported various coping strategies following their HCV diagnosis and to describe how they managed their HCV-related symptoms. Most of these coping strategies consisted of seeking information to improve health literacy; instrumental and emotional support from family, friends and professionals; and HCV treatment to accelerate cure. Conversely, and despite the associated risks, some resorted to avoidance or denial as a coping mechanism whereby increased drug use helped numb symptoms and the pain and anxiety provoked by the new diagnosis. This coping strategy was also found in a recent study with people who inject drugs in Montr&#x000e9;al [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Understanding coping strategies among PWEI following a new HCV diagnosis is important, as it can assist healthcare providers in better understanding how best to deliver information and determine how closely the patient needs to be seen in follow-up depending on hypothesized coping strategies.</p><p>Our study has limitations. First, our study was conducted during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, when all prison research was halted to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in prison. While we would have preferred to interview people in prison, we instead chose to interview people with recent lived experience of incarceration. This means that all of our results may not be generalizable to the incarcerated population in Quebec, as participants were likely reflecting on experiences during incarceration and post-release. Furthermore, given overlapping risk factors for HCV acquisition, it is not surprising that similar findings were observed in a recent study with people who inject drugs in Montr&#x000e9;al [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01910" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Second, as all interviews were conducted in French, they required translation to English for analysis. In doing so, certain meanings and concepts may have been lost in translation. That being said, both interviewers were fluent in both English and French. Third, as we collected minimal sociodemographic characteristics of participants, our findings may not be representative of the broader provincially incarcerated population in Quebec or Canada. Fourth, while the CS-SRM separates cognitive and emotional representations, our findings demonstrate that these domains often overlap. For example, beliefs about HCV consequences, like social isolation or fear of transmission, blend cognitive evaluations with emotional responses, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of illness perceptions. Fifth, the small sample size and heterogeneity in participants&#x02019; HCV treatment status restrict our ability to draw conclusions about differences in experiences based on treatment outcomes, such as patterns of social, sexual, or emotional isolation. Additional research with larger and more stratified samples is needed to investigate these patterns more systematically. Finally, as with all qualitative research, social desirability bias may have been introduced. Conversely, to our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize perceptions of HCV and its management, specifically with PWEI, using the CS-SRM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-16-01910"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Despite advances in HCV treatment, PWEI continue to experience many forms of stigma and fear surrounding their HCV diagnosis, resulting in delayed HCV care. These findings highlight the urgent need for whole-of-sector HCV education (correctional officers, healthcare workers, and PWEI), and they simultaneously provide insights into how prison- or community-based healthcare providers can better understand and utilize HCV illness perceptions to evaluate willingness to engage in HCV care and treatment among PWEI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank all the participants, as well as CACTUS, who assisted with recruitment.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
