There are now over 900 monogenic etiologies observed to be associated with epilepsy.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Genetic forms of epilepsy are common in the neonatal and infantile period, especially in the case of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1,2</xref></sup> In a recent multicenter study on the yield of rapid genome sequencing in neonatal/infantile seizures, 74% of infants with neonatal-onset seizures had an underlying genetic diagnosis, compared with 36% of infants with infantile-onset seizures, highlighting the vital contribution of genetics to epilepsy etiology in these age groups.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Genetic discovery is crucial because it may allow for more tailored treatment approaches, provide information related to the underlying prognosis, and allow for relevant genetic counseling to occur.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2,3</xref></sup></p><p>Pathogenic loss of function variants in the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene are an important cause of self-limited infantile epilepsy (SeLIE) and other neurologic disorders such as hemiplegic migraine and <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic>-associated paroxysmal movement disorders.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,5</xref></sup> Eighty percent of cases of SeLIE are secondary to pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene, but less commonly, it may be secondary to pathogenic variants in <italic toggle="yes">SCN8A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SCN2A</italic>, for example.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,5</xref></sup> The <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene is located on chromosome 16 and encodes for proline-rich transmembrane protein 2, which has a role in exocytosis and neurotransmitter release.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> SeLIE often occurs among family members and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, de novo cases are also reported.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4-6</xref></sup> The typical onset of seizures in SeLIE is around 6 months of age (range 2&#x02013;8 months), and infants typically present with clusters of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (BTC) seizures.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,5</xref></sup> The seizures usually abate by the age of 2 years and rarely may recur in adulthood.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,6,7</xref></sup> Furthermore, the seizures generally respond well to sodium channel blocker antiseizure medications (ASMs).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>More recently, there are single reports of pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants causing additional epilepsy phenotypes, such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep (DEE/EE-SWAS) and epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9-12</xref></sup> It is unclear why some patients with pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants present with a self-limited form of epilepsy while others develop a more severe epilepsy course. However, some of the phenotypic variability observed could be secondary to the effects of other genes within the 16p11.2 region where the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene is located.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,6</xref></sup> Microdeletion within this region may lead to a broader range of clinical features and, therefore, complicate the phenotypic presentation of <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic>-related disorders. In this study, we report an additional cohort of <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic>-related epilepsy/seizures and highlight commonalities to previous descriptions as well as atypical features of the condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents</title><p>Research ethics approval was obtained from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HIREB) at McMaster University in Hamilton, ON, Canada (HIREB# 16916).

Two children with heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants and SeLIE also continued to have persistent seizures after 36 months of age. 16p11.2 microdeletion encompassing the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene was associated with a variable epilepsy/neurologic phenotype in our cohort ranging from SeLIE with well-controlled seizures to childhood-onset medically refractory GGE with intellectual disability and autistic features. Homozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants in our cohort were associated with SeLIE with normal development and comorbid movement disorders. In addition, 2 novel variants in <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> were observed in our cohort.</p><p>IESS is rarely associated with heterozygous variants in the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene. Two cases are described in the literature: one of an infant with a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene and IESS and another infant with a pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variant who evolved from SeLIE at 4 months of age to IESS at 7 months, similar to our case (case 12).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9,15</xref></sup> Evolution to EE-SWAS is described in 2 cases in the literature; each case evolved from SeLIE to EE-SWAS at 5 years of age with prominent centrotemporal epileptiform discharges and developmental stagnation on neuropsychology assessment.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> By contrast, our case presented with early-onset SWAS on EEG at the age of 2&#x02013;3 years with both generalized and focal interictal epileptiform discharges (right central parietal) but had no slowing or regression in development and did not meet diagnostic criteria for EE-SWAS. Neuroimaging was initially normal in infancy, but in mid-childhood, it showed a small heterotopia adjacent to the caudate in the right frontal lobe. It is possible that this neuroimaging finding may have contributed to the focal EEG findings along with the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variant or that it was incidental. The mechanism surrounding the evolution from SeLIE to EE-SWAS with pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants is unknown. However, it has been previously hypothesized that the wide cortical and subcortical expression of <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> could result in focal EEG patterns and evolution to more diffuse EEG patterns seen in EE-SWAS.

Moreover, recurrent seizures have rarely been described in adulthood after an atypical SeLIE course.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7,16,17</xref></sup> However, adolescent/adult-onset FE without a history of SeLIE is not well described.

Nevertheless, our additional case illustrates the spectrum of epilepsy that may occur with pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants, including later-onset FE.</p><p>Microdeletions in 16p11.2 encompassing the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene are often associated with a SeLIE phenotype.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> An atypical course of SeLIE has been described in some infants with 16p11.2 microdeletions with seizure recurrence after remission, earlier seizure onset, and later age at seizure remission.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, in most cases, the seizures resolve in infancy.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Three of 4 cases with 16p11.2 microdeletions had SeLIE with no atypical features. However, 1 child (case 11) presented with medically refractory tonic-clonic and absence seizures in late childhood and had no history of SeLIE. This child was subsequently diagnosed with a GGE with concomitant intellectual disability and autistic features. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder are both associated with 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> There are isolated reports of 16p11.2 microdeletions being related to other epilepsy phenotypes, such as epilepsy with myoclonic absences.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, given the small case numbers and the short period of follow-up in our study, we were not able to assess for evolution to other epilepsy phenotypes in this group and it is also possible that other neurologic comorbidities were underestimated. Microdeletions in 15q11.2 and 16p11.3 have been more frequently identified in individuals with GGE. However, copy number variants in 16p11.2 are less reported, and thus, the spectrum of the epilepsy is less well known.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19-21</xref></sup></p><p>Given the known association between 16p11.2 microdeletion and a more severe neurologic presentation (i.e., intellectual disability and autism) as demonstrated in our case (case 11), it is important that individuals with 16p11.2 microdeletion undergo routine neurodevelopmental surveillance and be followed for the development new seizures/epilepsy types.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In addition, owing to the phenotypic overlap between 16p11.2 microdeletion and <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic>-related disorders, it may be helpful to pair <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> genetic testing with microarray analysis to look for 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome, given the broader clinical phenotype that can be associated with it. In our case (case 11), paired gene panel with microarray led to the diagnosis of 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome. There are few cases (total = 4) in the literature that report individuals with both heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants and 16p11.2 microdeletion; all had epilepsy, and learning disabilities, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder were seen in half of the cases.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22-24</xref></sup></p><p>There are few reports of patients with homozygous and compound heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants in the literature.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22,25</xref></sup> These cases have been reported to have a more severe epilepsy phenotype than SeLIE (i.e., daily seizures despite ASM treatment and seizures occurring later in childhood/adulthood), intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, abnormal neuroimaging, and more prolonged movement disorders (i.e., PKD).<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22,25</xref></sup> Homozygous and compound heterozygous deleterious <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants have also been found to be associated with prolonged episodes of episodic ataxia and cerebellar atrophy on neuroimaging.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22,25</xref></sup> However, none of our cases with homozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants had intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, or ataxia (cases 26, 29, and 30). All 3 cases had movement disorders including dystonia, choreoathetosis, and PKD.

However, it is possible that the number of children with movement disorders was underestimated, given the lack of longitudinal follow-up in our cohort. Dyskinesias, dystonia, and choreoathetosis were observed. One child (case 2) with SeLIE and a heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variant had nonepileptic head drops consistent with benign myoclonus of infancy, which has been previously described in only 1 case in the literature.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Similar to the literature, cognitive development was normal in all children,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> except for 1 child with 16p11.2 microdeletion (case 11) who had intellectual disability with autistic features. Furthermore, 1 child with a heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variant and SeLIE (case 27) was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. This child was diagnosed through exome sequencing, however, and chromosomal microarray was not performed to assess for 16p11.2 microdeletion. Of the children with 16p11.2 microdeletion, 1 child had obesity, which is a known comorbidity, and another child had hypotonia, which has also been previously reported in the literature (case 16).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The extent of comorbidities in 16p11.2 microdeletion in our cohort is likely underestimated, given that 2 cases (cases 16 and 37) were still infants.</p><p>Overall, several different ASMs were used in our cohort. LEV, PHB, CLB, VPA, and sodium channel blockers were most commonly prescribed (i.e., carbamazepine, OXC, phenytoin, and RUF). ASMs other than sodium channel blockers were likely used because the genetic diagnosis typically lagged behind clinical seizure onset (i.e., median 8 months for genetic diagnosis vs 5 months for seizure onset).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Sodium channel blockers were effective in most children prescribed them, which has also been described in the literature.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8,17</xref></sup> Previous studies have shown that individuals treated with LEV and PHB required additional ASMs because of inadequate seizure control. However, some children in our cohort responded to these agents.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It is difficult to know whether the response to other ASMs, such as PHB, was secondary to the effect of the ASM alone or was related to the self-limiting nature of epilepsy in children with SeLIE. Given the small number, we were not able to assess difference in response to ASMs based on the underlying genotype.</p><p>Finally, we could not identify any precise genotype-phenotype relationships in our cohort, nor are they well established in the literature.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Most children in our cohort had the recurrent hotspot <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variant, c.649dupC (p.Arg217Profs*8). The other hotspot variant, c.649delC (p.Arg217Glufs*12), was less common in our cohort.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Most frameshift variants in <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> result in a truncated protein that lacks both the C-terminal and transmembrane domain.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17,30</xref></sup> Truncating variants occur throughout the gene while missense variants impair plasma membrane localization and cluster around the C-terminus.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17,30</xref></sup> It has been proposed that whole-gene <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> deletions/haploinsufficiency may be associated with a more severe phenotype. This finding is supported by our single case with a whole-gene <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> deletion (case 11) who was diagnosed with medically refractory GGE.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Homozygous/compound heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants also disrupt the PRRT2 protein more than heterozygous variants and have been reported to cause a more severe phenotype.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17,22,25</xref></sup> However, the 3 children with homozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants in our cohort did not display a severe epilepsy/neurologic phenotype.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22,25</xref></sup> However, overall, our small sample size limited our ability to make meaningful genotype-phenotype correlations. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype relationships are not precise with pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants, and it is unclear why some patients present with a self-limited epilepsy course and others develop DEEs.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> For example, the child who developed IESS shared the same genotype c.649dupC (p.Arg217Profs*8) as several children in the cohort who were diagnosed with SeLIE alone. Likely, other unknown genetic mechanisms (modifier genes, epigenetics) or environmental influences could modify the epilepsy phenotype.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17,29,31</xref></sup> Moreover, variants in the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene display pleiotropy, a high degree of variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance (50%&#x02013;90%).<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17,28</xref></sup> Understanding the spectrum of epilepsy in patients with <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants is important when counseling patients and caregivers.</p><p>Our study has limitations, including that it was a retrospective study and had a small sample size. We could not look for common or rare modifiers of gene expression. Seizure types, frequencies, and treatment responses to ASMs were based on parental reports, which may be more subjective. Although genetic testing did not identify a dual diagnosis in any of the children, it is possible that other unknown genetic mechanisms/conditions modified the phenotype. Given that most children in the cohort did not undergo additional chromosomal microarray, it is possible that the number of individuals with 16p11.2 microdeletion was underestimated. Moreover, nearly half of the cohort underwent exome sequencing and it is possible that some small microdeletions in 16p11.2 may have been missed because of the limitations in detecting copy number variants with exome sequencing. The extent of neurologic comorbidities is likely underestimated in our cohort, given that some children were still infants. We also cannot rule out subtle structural changes that may have been missed during initial neuroimaging and could have contributed to the epilepsy phenotype. We were unable to obtain specific details on the epilepsy phenotype in relatives. Long-term follow-up was limited, and we were not able to assess the natural history of the epilepsy over time for all patients in our cohort.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that although pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants are most commonly associated with a SeLIE phenotype, atypical features may occur with seizures persisting later into childhood or the development of additional epilepsy phenotypes in others, such as IESS. Collection of additional cases, however, is needed to better understand the epilepsy phenotypes associated with 16p11.2 microdeletions encompassing the <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> gene and homozygous and compound heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants. In individuals with heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants, corresponding chromosomal microarray may be helpful to assess for concomitant 16p11.2 microdeletion, given the phenotypic overlap between the 2 conditions. Ongoing surveillance of individuals with 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome is important to screen for additional neurologic comorbidities and epilepsy phenotypes over time. Overall, sodium channel blockers remain an effective treatment for epilepsy related to pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">PRRT2</italic> variants. Currently, precise genotype-phenotype relationships are lacking.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="contributions"><title>Author Contributions</title><p content-type="contributions">M.
