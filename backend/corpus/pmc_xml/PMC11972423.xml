He had a medical history of epilepsy and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Consciousness was impaired (Glasgow Coma Scale of E1V1M1) and no obvious external trauma was noted in the body. Physical examination showed height of 175 cm, weight of 108.7 kg, and body mass index (BMI) of 34.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Vital signs were blood pressure of 120/101 mmHg, pulse rate of 155 bpm, body temperature of 40.1 &#x000b0;C, and saturation of percutaneous oxygen (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 71% (room air). Laboratory studies on admission revealed white blood cell (WBC) count of 22,900/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL, serum albumin of 4.0 g/dL, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level of 133 U/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 17 mg/dL, serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.51 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate of 39 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, sodium of 143 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, corrected Ca of 8.4 mg/dL, Pi of 4.3 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein of 0.06 mg/dL. After he was admitted to the neurology department, he was treated with anticonvulsants on mechanical ventilation.</p><p>On the second day of hospitalization, the serum CPK level increased to 39,253 U/L&#x000a0;and the serum Cr level&#x000a0;increased to 2.23 mg/dL. The serum myoglobin level also increased to 284,000 ng/mL (reference: 0-154.9 ng/mL) and urinary occult blood was positive (3+) without red blood cells on sediment examination. The patient was referred to the nephrology department and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI.</p><p>On the third day of hospitalization, the patient was started hemodialysis&#x000a0;because he became anuric&#x000a0;and his renal function rapidly deteriorated as BUN, serum Cr, and potassium levels increased to 67 mg/dL, 7.54 mg/dL, and 6.8 mEq/L, respectively. The serum CPK level peaked at 182,900 U/L on the sixth day and gradually declined. As rhabdomyolysis improved, urine output gradually increased from around the 20th day, and he was successfully weaned off hemodialysis (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although serum corrected Ca level was mildly low at 8.4 mg/dL on admission, it began to rise as rhabdomyolysis improved, reaching a peak of 13.3 mg/dL on the 26th day (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Serum corrected Ca levels were calculated using Payne&#x02019;s formula: corrected Ca level (mg/dL) = measured Ca level (mg/dL) + (4 - serum albumin level [g/dL]) [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To investigate the cause of hypercalcemia, a CT scan was performed, and it showed calcification in the left-side muscles including the pectoralis major muscle, triceps brachii muscle, and biceps femoris muscle. Correspondingly, bone scintigraphy revealed a high accumulation of technetium-99m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMDP) in these areas (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Secondary hypercalcemia due to malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin D toxicity were also ruled out (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The isotonic electrolyte solution of 1000-2000 mL daily depending on the urine volume was administered to treat hypercalcemia, although hypercalcemia did not improve. On the 26th day of hospitalization, denosumab was administered, and the serum Ca levels returned to normal. A follow-up CT scan on the 45th day showed complete resolution of the calcific lesions, and no accumulation was noted in the bone scintigraphy (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). At 15 months before and after hospitalization, his serum corrected Ca and Pi levels maintained within the normal range (9.0 and 2.9 mg/dL before hospitalization, and 9.0 and 2.7 mg/dL after hospitalization, respectively).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Clinical course after admission</title><p>Ca, calcium; CPK, creatine phosphokinase; Cr, creatinine; Pi, phosphate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000080177-i01" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Whole-body plain CT scans and bone scintigraphy</title><p>(A) At the onset of hypercalcemia (Day 26), calcium deposits (white arrowheads) are seen in the left pectoralis muscle and upper arm, as well as other muscles on the left side.

This can lead to complications such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, compartment syndrome, and AKI [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Regarding serum Ca levels in rhabdomyolysis, it is known that serum Ca levels often decrease during the acute phase&#x000a0;and increase during the recovery phase [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This Ca metabolic abnormality has been reported in up to 33% of rhabdomyolysis cases [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. During the acute phase, Pi released from the damaged muscle cells binds with Ca to form calcium phosphates, leading to Ca deposition into the injured muscle. In the recovery phase, the dissolution of these calcium phosphates into the bloodstream results in hypercalcemia. Hadjis et al. [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] demonstrated this process using CT scans and muscle biopsies. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the release of calcium phosphates during the recovery phase are not fully understood. Several studies suggest that the decrease in serum Pi levels due to renal recovery (diuresis) causes hypercalcemia to maintain the calcium phosphate product (Ca x Pi) [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, Meneghini et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported several cases in which hypercalcemia had developed during the oliguric phase of AKI. In this case, hypercalcemia persisted despite continuous hyperphosphatemia, indicating that mechanisms independent of Ca x Pi may be involved. Other proposed mechanisms include secondary hyperparathyroidism following acute hypocalcemia [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or an increase in active vitamin D during renal recovery [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, in a report by Meneghini et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which summarized cases of rhabdomyolysis complicated by AKI, 11 cases had elevated intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels among 34 cases, and only two cases had elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels among nine cases. These findings suggest that the Ca metabolism abnormalities in rhabdomyolysis cannot be simply explained by the changes in hormones or vitamins. In our case, both intact PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels were low during hypercalcemia, and then the involvement of hyperparathyroidism and the effect of increased vitamin D levels were unlikely.</p><p>We also investigated other factors such as malignancy, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis as possible causes of hypercalcemia, but those factors were ruled out based on the radiological and laboratory findings (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, Ca replacement therapy was not administered for the acute-phase hypocalcemia in our case. Although the involvement of immobility could not be completely ruled out, early rehabilitation and the absence of elevated bone resorption markers (TRACP [tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase]-5b) suggested that its effect was minimal [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>There have been several reports on Ca metabolism abnormalities in rhabdomyolysis, although those reports observed the progression of calcific lesions using CT scans or bone scintigraphy at a single time point [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the other hand, our case observed the serial changes in calcific lesions using two modalities, CT scans and bone scintigraphy. Furthermore, those calcific lesions were primarily observed on the left side of the body corresponding to the site of seizures. Taken together, we speculated the mechanism of hypercalcemia complicated with rhabdomyolysis in our case as follows: (i) Pi released from the damaged muscle cells bound with Ca to form calcium phosphates, leading to Ca deposition into the injured muscle during the acute phase; and (ii) the dissolution of these calcium phosphates into the bloodstream resulted in hypercalcemia in the recovery phase. Recently, Alkaissi and&#x000a0;McFarlane&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] also reported serial radiographical findings in a patient who had been applied Ca sulfate beads at the surgical sites, which developed hypercalcemia probably due to the dissolution from the sites. Furthermore, our case responded well to denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), effectively reducing serum Ca levels. In the presence of AKI, denosumab can be a useful treatment option as it does not require renal excretion, although hemodialysis using a dialysis fluid of low calcium concentration may be another treatment option.</p><p>From the point of view of hyperphosphatemia, familial hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis (FHTC) could be listed as one of the differential diagnoses of the disease that shows a similar phenotype to our case [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, hyperphosphatemia was transiently observed just in the recovery phase of rhabdomyolysis, hypercalcemia was rarely observed in FHTC, and calcific lesions were observed in the site of injured muscles, but not in the periarticular sites typically found in FHTC. In addition, we could not explain the reason for the suppressed serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> level, which should be elevated or inappropriately normal&#x000a0;for the degree of hyperphosphatemia in FHTC [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We presented a case of hypercalcemia developed in the recovery phase of rhabdomyolysis. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first report that observed the serial changes of calcific lesions using two modalities, CT scans and bone scintigraphy. Although the exact mechanisms of hypercalcemia in rhabdomyolysis are still controversial, it was speculated that the dissolution of the calcific lesions into the bloodstream resulted in hypercalcemia. In addition, denosumab was found to be effective in normalizing the Ca levels, although denosumab might actually affect bones. This case emphasizes the importance of monitoring Ca levels and suggests a treatment option such as denosumab in patients with hypercalcemia following rhabdomyolysis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Kyosuke Omata and Hirotaka Fukasawa have equally contributed to the work and should be considered co-first authors.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Kyosuke Omata, Hirotaka Fukasawa, Mai Kaneko, Takashi Matsuyama, Ryuichi Furuya</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Kyosuke Omata</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Kyosuke Omata, Hirotaka Fukasawa</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Hirotaka Fukasawa, Mai Kaneko, Takashi Matsuyama, Ryuichi Furuya</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Ryuichi Furuya</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><person-group>
