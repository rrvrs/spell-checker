This study aimed to evaluate the biomarker potential of extracellular vesicle (EV)-encapsulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (EV-GFAP), neurofilament light chain (EV-NfL), total tau (EV-T-Tau), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (EV-UCH-L1) in TBI. A cohort of 93 trauma patients (75 with TBI and 18 without TBI) was analyzed. Patients were sampled on admission, as well as 15 and 72&#x000a0;h post-injury. Following initial method validation, EVs were isolated from plasma using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and plasma levels and EV cargo levels of biomarkers were measured using an ultra-sensitive Single Molecule Array. EV-GFAP levels were significantly elevated in TBI patients compared to non-TBI trauma patients at admission and 15&#x000a0;h. A positive head CT was associated with 2.85 (95% CI: 1.18&#x02013;6.91) fold increased EV-GFAP, whereas EV-NfL, EV-T-Tau, and EV-UCH-L1 levels were not affected. None of the tested EV biomarkers were associated with 1-year mortality or 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; functional outcome. Plasma-GFAP levels increased 3.4 (95% CI: 1.72&#x02013;6.70) fold with a positive head CT but were not associated with outcomes. EV-GFAP shows potential as an early biomarker of TBI, but plasma-GFAP remains a practical and reliable alternative. Future studies should explore the potential complementary roles of EV-based biomarkers on alternative aspects of TBI pathophysiology and prediction of long-term outcomes. Studies should refine methods to enhance reproducibility and clinical applicability.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12031-025-02360-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>Glial fibrillary acidic protein</kwd><kwd>Traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Aalborg University Hospital</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Aalborg University Hospital</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par29">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant global health concern, affecting approximately 69 million people annually (Dewan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>). TBI is a complex condition covering a wide range of severities with an equally wide range of long-term outcomes posing a clinical challenge and calls for improved diagnostic and prognostic approaches. Enhancing our ability to predict long-term outcomes and identify patients who may benefit from specialized interventions or rehabilitation has considerable potential in terms of personal and economic consequences.</p><p id="Par30">Several studies have investigated freely circulating, nerve-derived proteins such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase -L1 (UCH-L1), and total Tau (T-Tau) as biomarkers of TBI (Papa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2016</xref>; Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>; Abdelhak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>; Helmrich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>). These biomarkers have shown strong and cumulative diagnostic and prognostic utilities across the TBI severity spectrum (Helmrich et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>; Bazarian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>; Kaaber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">Besides circulating freely in plasma, nerve-derived proteins are actively shed from nerve-tissue within extracellular vesicles (EVs) (Nekludov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>). EVs are lipid bilayer particles secreted by all cell types that encapsulate proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids from the cells of origin. Hereby, they provide a circulating, liquid biopsy of the originating cells, which may reflect the biological state of the host tissue more precisely than freely circulating proteins (Abels and Breakefield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>; Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2022</xref>). As EVs readily cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB), they may constitute an easily available, stable, and non-invasive source of biomarkers that accurately reflect the status of nerve cells in TBI patients.</p><p id="Par32">Despite this, only few studies have investigated the biomarker potential of EV cargo proteins during the initial phases of acute TBI (Mondello, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>; Kawata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>; Guedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>; Goetzl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). Three of these studies were small (Mondello, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>; Kawata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>; Goetzl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>) and only one study provided longitudinal data (Mondello, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). Furthermore, the majority of evidence is based on precipitation-based methods for EV isolation (Mondello, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>; Guedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>; Goetzl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>) and lack thorough methodological characterization, which may raise concerns about the purity and quality of the isolated EVs (Brennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). This underscores the need for additional research, using optimized and validated isolation and characterization protocols for EVs and down-stream analytical methods, to determine if EVs provide a superior source of biomarkers in acute TBI.</p><p id="Par33">In this study, we address the limitations of prior reports by providing a thoroughly validated method for EV-cargo analysis in TBI patients. We apply this method on a large acute TBI cohort to analyze acute and longitudinal changes in the nerve-derived proteins GFAP, NfL, UCH-L1, and T-Tau. Lastly, we compare the biomarker abilities of these EV-cargo proteins with those of their counterparts freely circulating in plasma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Population</title><p id="Par34">This study was carried out using biobank samples from the established Systematic Urine Evaluation for Activation of Coagulation in Severe Trauma (SURVIVE) cohort (Kaaber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2024</xref>; Lesbo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2023</xref>). The cohort comprises 418 trauma patients admitted to the level I trauma center at Aarhus University Hospital between March 2017 and March 2018. All admitted trauma patients were assessed for eligibility in the SURVIVE study. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) individuals younger than 18 years; (2) patients who were dead upon arrival; (3) declared pregnancy; (4) those who did not meet Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) criteria for trauma team activation; and (5) individuals who opted to decline or withdraw consent.</p><p id="Par35">For this study, a nested case&#x02013;control cohort was established through a two step-process. Initially, fifty trauma patients with a positive head CT (defined as any acute intracranial pathology visible on CT) and a Marshall Classification Score (Marshall score) &#x0003e;&#x02009;1 was extracted from the database and selected as cases (see Data Collection for description). These were matched by age, sex, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) with 50 controls, who were trauma patients with a negative head CT and a Marshall score of 1. To ensure the control group was free of head trauma, a second classification of the control group was performed by a detailed chart review. In this step, control patients with any documentation of head injury in the chart were reclassified as cases and cases with concomitant traumatic spinal cord injury (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;= 7) were excluded, resulting in a total of 93 individuals for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data Collection</title><p id="Par36">In the SURVIVE study, patient data was collected from the Aarhus University Hospital trauma registry and the electronic medical records. The trauma registry provided detailed information on the time of injury, injury mechanism, prehospital treatment interventions, vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score at admission. The AIS score was used to calculate the New Injury Severity Score (NISS). For patients with missing GCS data in the registry, values were retrieved from admission records.</p><p id="Par37">The electronic medical records provided information on patient demographics, including age and sex, as well as clinical data, including time of hospital admission, blood sampling, antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, surgical procedures, and blood transfusions within 72 h of admission. If antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy status was missing, patients were classified as not receiving this treatment.</p><p id="Par38">The initial head CT scans were reviewed to assign Marshall CT Classification scores. The Marshall score, a six-category system based on midline shift, basal cistern compression, and hemorrhagic lesions, was recorded. Patients with head trauma, but no visible intracranial pathology were assigned a score of 1 (Marshall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1992</xref>). CT scans were evaluated by a junior doctor with neurosurgery experience and verified by a senior consultant in neurosurgery. Outcome measures included 1-year all-cause mortality and functional outcome assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) at 6&#x02013;12 months (Wilson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1998</xref>). Functional outcomes were classified as favorable (GOSE &#x02265;&#x02009;5) or unfavorable (GOSE &#x02264;&#x02009;4), based on medical records documenting patient consciousness, independence, and social or work engagement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Blood Samples</title><p id="Par39">Blood samples were collected upon arrival to the trauma resuscitation room and again at 15 (&#x000b1; 3) hours and 72 (&#x000b1; 6) hours after admission. If patients were discharged or transferred to another hospital within 72 h, they exited the study and further blood sampling was discontinued.</p><p id="Par40">Blood samples were obtained either from an arterial line or by venous puncture, and collected into citrate, heparin and EDTA tubes (BD Vacutainer&#x000ae;, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Samples were transported to the laboratory at room temperature (RT) and processed within 1&#x000a0;h.

Five hundred microliters of the citrated plasma was loaded onto the column and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Merck, D8537). An Automatic Fraction Collector (IZON, Christchurch, New Zealand) was employed to automate the column runs. A volume of 1.5 mL was collected after an initial buffer volume of 2.7 mL was eluted. Each column was used up to ten times, as specified by the manufacturer. Flushing steps were performed between samples to prevent carryover contamination. 8.5 mL of 0.5 M NaOH (Merck, 1.06498.1000) was used to wash the column, followed by another 17 mL PBS flush to remove any residual NaOH. Before the first use of each column, it was flushed with 17 mL of PBS to equilibrate the column.

These findings, obtained through rigorously validated methods for EV isolation and protein measurement, support a potential of EV-associated biomarkers in TBI.</p><p id="Par66">EV research has methodological challenges related to contamination with non-EV particles, variability in yield, and purity of isolates (Witwer, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). Among isolation methods, some methods prioritize high yield but compromise on purity, while others achieve greater purity at the expense of time efficiency, cost, or reproducibility (Allelein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>). Findings derived from EV research are therefore heavily dependent on the isolation method used.</p><p id="Par67">In this study, SEC was used, and the low protein levels in the SEC-enriched samples indicated minimal contamination with freely circulating proteins. This is important, as the TBI markers of interest in this study are proteins, making it crucial to distinguish between freely circulating proteins and those derived from EVs. After detergent treatment, total and nerve-derived protein levels increased, suggesting that most of the measured protein originated from the EV cargo. The NTA analysis confirmed a narrow particle size distribution in the SEC-enriched samples of 70&#x02013;130 nm, consistent with small EVs. Yet, NTA cannot differentiate EVs from non-vesicular particles with overlapping size profiles, such as lipoproteins (Comfort et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>). hFCM was therefore used to further validate our findings, confirming the presence of EVs and their dissolution with detergent treatment. Sonication also reduced the CD9<sup>+</sup>CD63<sup>+</sup>CD81<sup>+</sup> signal but did not increase total protein or biomarker concentration, likely due to protein aggregation from the sonication protocol. Subtracting detergent-treated hFCM signals from the total CD9<sup>+</sup>CD63<sup>+</sup>CD81<sup>+</sup> signal calculated the EV-specific particle count, which showed minimal variation across donor pools. This contrasted with the significant variability observed in NTA measurements, likely reflecting contamination with non-EV particles, such as lipoproteins, from the use of non-fasting donor pools. While lipoprotein contamination is an inherent issue with SEC-enriched samples (Karimi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>), SEC offers the advantage of minimal contamination with freely circulating proteins, as shown in our validation. This is crucial, as most prior TBI studies have used precipitation-based methods (Mondello, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>; Guedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>) that yield larger quantities of EVs (Veerman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>; Zhen, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2022</xref>) with the cost of contamination with non-EV particles and freely circulating proteins (Yuana, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>; S&#x000f3;dar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>; Pang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>; Sj&#x000f6;lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2022</xref>; Welton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). Therefore, SEC provides a reliable platform for studies requiring precise EV biomarker measurements.</p><p id="Par68">Using this method, we found increased EV-GFAP levels in TBI patients compared to non-TBI trauma patients. Few studies have examined nerve-derived biomarkers in circulating EV cargo in acute TBI. Mondello et al. (Mondello, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>) measured EV-GFAP, EV-NfL, EV-UCH-L1, and EV-Tau levels in circulating EVs during the first 5&#x000a0;days after TBI using a cohort of 21 moderate to severe TBI cases but without controls. In their study, EV-GFAP concentrations peaked early and declined over time after injury. Similarly, Guedes et al. (Guedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>) studied levels of EV-GFAP, EV-UCH-L1, EV-NfL, and EV-Tau in 41 TBI patients and 73 trauma controls 6&#x02013;12 h after injury, finding elevated EV-GFAP levels in TBI patients. Our results align with these studies, reinforcing EV-GFAP as a reliable TBI biomarker. Yet, EV-NfL, EV-T-Tau, and EV-UCH-L1 levels were unaltered in TBI patients in our study. This is in contrast to Guedes et al. (Guedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>) who found elevated EV-NfL and EV-UCH-L1 but not EV-Tau in TBI patients, and may be attributed to contamination from freely circulating proteins in their precipitation-based method. The exact reasons for the discrepancy remain unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine whether the isolation method or other factors, such as injury severity or timing of sample collection, explain these differences.</p><p id="Par69">EV-Tau has been more widely studied in cohorts of mild and repetitive TBI (Kawata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>; Goetzl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; Kenney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Gill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>). Collectively, these studies reported elevated EV-Tau levels suggesting a biomarker potential in mild TBI. This highlights a potential biomarker-specific capability of EV cargo proteins, similar to findings with freely circulating proteins (Kaaber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2024</xref>). Lastly, the association between EV-GFAP levels with two injury severity indicators aligns with the findings of Guedes et al. (Guedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>), who demonstrated significant associations with increasing Head Abbreviated Injury Scores (HAIS). While HAIS is anatomically based and does not directly reflect brain injury (Foreman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>), the Marshall score and CT findings provide direct neuroimaging measures (Marshall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1992</xref>), which substantiate an association between EV-GFAP levels and the extent of neurological injury.</p><p id="Par70">In our study, the extent of the association between plasma-GFAP and EV-GFAP with TBI severity was comparable. This aligns with Guedes et al. (Guedes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>), who reported a strong correlation (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;= 0.96) between EV- and plasma-GFAP levels, suggesting that both provide identical information on CNS injury severity. This suggests that EV-GFAP offers little additional biomarker information compared to the easier measurement of plasma-GFAP (Abdelhak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>) on the parameters tested in our study. However, EVs are considered highly stable structures that tolerate different preanalytical conditions, which is why they are likely to protect biomarkers in their cargo more efficiently compared with soluble plasma proteins. Moreover, EV-based biomarkers may reflect other aspects of TBI pathophysiology better than plasma biomarkers, although this remains unclear and calls for further investigation. At present, EV biomarker analysis remains technically complex and is not yet suited for routine clinical implementation.</p><p id="Par71">Interestingly, despite the overall similarity between plasma- and EV-GFAP, their temporal patterns differed: plasma-GFAP remained elevated at all timepoints, while EV-GFAP was only elevated at admission and 15 h. The mechanisms underlying the release of EV-encapsulated versus freely circulating GFAP remain incompletely understood, but the observed difference may reflect involvement of distinct cellular processes. For instance, EV-mediated release likely involves an active and regulated pathway, including intracellular packaging and secretion, while freely circulating GFAP may be released through alternative mechanisms.</p><p id="Par72">No association was observed between EV and plasma biomarkers with the tested outcomes. In this study, EV biomarkers were associated with acute measures of TBI severity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), but not with long-term outcomes (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), suggesting their primary utility may lie in early-phase assessment. This contrast earlier findings of an association between the tested plasma biomarkers and outcomes in this cohort (Kaaber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2024</xref>) and is likely caused by the smaller sample size of the present study. Furthermore, Mondello et al. showed a potential prognostic role for EV-UCH-L1 trajectories in early mortality (Mondello, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>), though these patterns were observed in a small sample with high bias risk. Collectively, this suggests that EV biomarkers may hold potential on outcome parameters which require further investigation.</p><p id="Par73">Some limitations should be considered. This study may have a relatively low statistical power, due to high CV of the analytical method combined with the modest cohort size. While this limits firm conclusions on insignificant findings, it also highlights the robustness of EV-GFAP findings. The EVs in our study were not CNS-specific and therefore, we cannot rule out a potential interference of EVs from peripheral nerves. However, the analyzed proteins are nerve-specific, and the bulk derive from CNS. As such, the observed protein changes would mainly derive from the CNS.</p><p id="Par74">Another limitation derives from normalization of biomarker levels to initial plasma volume rather than to EV count. While some studies suggest TBI may increase circulating EV counts (Kuravi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>), our study focuses on the biomarker potential of the total cargo protein. Whether changes in biomarker levels occur due to altered EV counts or cargo load would have little impact for this purpose. Finally, case/control misclassification could affect results, as mild or subclinical TBIs may have been overlooked. Yet, our study&#x02019;s use of neuroimaging and clinical assessments for control classification would largely exclude this risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par75">Our study demonstrates increased EV-GFAP levels in acute TBI patients. It uncovers an association between EV-GFAP levels and neuroimaging-derived severity indicators, but not with long-term clinical outcomes. Using thoroughly validated methods for EV isolation and protein cargo measurement, it uncovers comparable biomarker capabilities for plasma and EV-GFAP for the endpoints tested. This favors plasma over EV biomarker in moderate to severe TBI and calls for more detailed analysis to unravel if EV-GFAP may provide biomarker value on other parameters or endpoints.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12031_2025_2360_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 849 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AIS</term><def><p id="Par2">Abbreviated Injury Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATLS</term><def><p id="Par3">Advanced trauma life support</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CD</term><def><p id="Par4">Cluster of differentiation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNS</term><def><p id="Par5">Central nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV%</term><def><p id="Par6">Coefficient of variation percentage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDTA</term><def><p id="Par7">Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EV</term><def><p id="Par8">Extracellular vesicle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFAP</term><def><p id="Par9">Glial fibrillary acidic protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCS</term><def><p id="Par10">Glasgow Coma Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOSE</term><def><p id="Par11">Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAIS</term><def><p id="Par12">Head Abbreviated Injury Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hFCM</term><def><p id="Par13">High-resolution flow cytometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ID</term><def><p id="Par14">Identification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISS</term><def><p id="Par15">Injury Severity Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOD</term><def><p id="Par16">Limit of detection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLOQ</term><def><p id="Par17">Lower limit of quantification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mTBI</term><def><p id="Par18">Mild traumatic brain injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NfL</term><def><p id="Par19">Neurofilament light chain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NISS</term><def><p id="Par20">New Injury Severity Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTA</term><def><p id="Par21">Nanoparticle tracking analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p id="Par22">Phosphate-buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p id="Par23">Room temperature</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEC</term><def><p id="Par24">Size exclusion chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Simoa</term><def><p id="Par25">Single molecule array</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T-Tau</term><def><p id="Par26">Total Tau</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBI</term><def><p id="Par27">Traumatic brain injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCH-L1</term><def><p id="Par28">Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>AB, TOW, and CVBH conceived and designed the study.
