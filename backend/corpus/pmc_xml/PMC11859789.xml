To clarify the impact of soil pH under acidified conditions on tea plant growth physiology and the key genes involved in Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport in tea plants, this study planted &#x02018;Longjing 43&#x02019; under different pH levels (4.0, 4.5, and 5.5) and Cd concentrations (T1 = 0 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, T2 = 0.01 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, T3 = 0.05 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and T4 = 0.2 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The results showed that the concentration of Cd in tea plants from highest to lowest was root &#x0003e; stem &#x0003e; mature leaves &#x0003e; young leaves. Under T4, with decreasing pH, the total chlorophyll significantly decreased, the <italic toggle="yes">Fv</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Fm</italic> significantly decreased, stomatal aperture reduced, and net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate significantly decreased. In the T4 treatment at pH = 4.0, the contents of free proline and malondialdehyde were both the highest, while superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase from micrococcus lysodeiktic (CAT) showed a significant negative correlation with pH. By screening the tea genome data, a total of nine CsHMAs involved in metal ion transport were identified. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression level of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> was the highest in young leaves of tea, and <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> was localized on the cell membrane. Under T4 and pH = 4.0, transient overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> enhanced the ability of tea to transport Cd<sup>2+</sup>, whereas transient silencing of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> weakened this ability. These findings not only help understand how tea adapts and regulates its physiological processes in acidic environments but also provide an important theoretical basis and technical guidance for soil improvement in tea gardens, the control of heavy metal pollution, and the optimization of tea quality.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tea</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolites</kwd><kwd>photosynthetic</kwd><kwd>antioxidant</kwd><kwd>overexpression</kwd><kwd>redundant</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key R &#x00026; D Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2020YFE0202900</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>31972460</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by [National Key R &#x00026; D Program of China] grant number [2020YFE0202900].

Introduction</title><p>Tea (<italic toggle="yes">Camellia sinensis</italic> L.) is an important economic crop suitable for cultivation in acidic environments; however, excessively acidic soil conditions can inhibit the metabolic activities of tea plants and degrade the quality of tea leaves [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With the rapid development of industry, there is an exacerbation of the acidification of tea garden soils due to acid deposition [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To avoid the accumulation of heavy metals in tea leaves, it is imperative to address the problem of soil acidification in tea gardens [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The main causes of soil acidification in Chinese tea plantations include atmospheric acidification, fertilization methods, planting management methods, and physiological metabolism of tea [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are many reasons for the acidification of tea garden soils, which can be mainly divided into two forms: exogenous acids and endogenous acids [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Exogenous acids include acid rain, the return of fallen branches and leaves and pruned branches to the field, and regular fertilization during tea garden management [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Endogenous acids consist of hydrogen ion secretion from the root systems of tea plants, as well as organic acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid. The process of increasing H<sup>+</sup> in the soil is the essence of soil acidification [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Soil acidification in tea gardens leads to nutrient depletion, which inhibits the growth of tea plants and reduces the content of secondary metabolites [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The content of secondary metabolites in tea plants primarily comprises substances such as tea polyphenols (TP), catechins, caffeine (CAF), amino acids (AA), flavonoids, pigments, and terpenoids [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A decrease in available nitrogen in the soil affects the accumulation of AA in tea leaves, although there has been no direct research proving that soil acidification leads to a reduction in the AA content in tea leaves [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Catechins are a series of compounds derived from carbon elements, and soil acidification results in the leaching of organic matter in the soil, affecting the types and quantities of microorganisms in the soil and inhibiting the synthesis of catechins in tea [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tea leaves are rich in caffeine, far exceeding other plants [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The content of caffeine in tea leaves is closely related to the nitrogen cycle in tea leaves; soil acidification reduces the absorption of carbon and nitrogen content from the soil by tea, thereby decreasing the synthesis of CAF in tea [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Soluble sugars (SS) in tea leaves are the main carbohydrates, primarily consisting of glucose, fructose, galactose, and arabinose [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Soil acidification alters the form of mineral elements absorbed by tea, thus affecting the synthesis of soluble sugars within the tea. Changes in environmental conditions due to soil acidification impact the absorption of organic matter and mineral elements by tea, influencing the composition and content of major quality components in tea leaves [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Soil acidification leads to an increase in the availability of heavy metals in the soil [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Heavy metals accumulate in tea leaves through bioaccumulation, posing a toxic threat and severely endangering the natural ecological environment [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Cd is one of the most common. Once Cd enters the soil, it is readily captured by the root systems of tea and is transported to the aerial parts where it accumulates, potentially entering the human body through the food chain and posing a potential risk to human health [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. When the accumulation of Cd in tea plants exceeds the tolerance level, basic physiological functions, including photosynthesis, transpiration, metabolic activities, and antioxidant defense mechanisms, are negatively affected, hindering normal growth and resulting in decreased yield and quality of tea leaves [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the impact of soil acidification in tea gardens on the absorption of Cd by tea plants remains unclear, and the genes related to the absorption and transport of Cd ions in tea plants have yet to be discovered.</p><p>Plants possess regulatory systems for maintaining the balance of metal ion concentrations within their bodies, with heavy metal transport proteins being a crucial component of these systems [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Heavy metal transport proteins can be broadly classified into two categories: uptake proteins and efflux proteins. Among them, the main uptake proteins include the Yellow Stripe-Like (<italic toggle="yes">YSL</italic>) transporter family, the Zinc/Iron Regulator (<italic toggle="yes">ZRT/IRT</italic>)-like protein (<italic toggle="yes">ZIP</italic>) family, and the Natural-Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein (<italic toggle="yes">NRAMP</italic>) family [<xref rid="B21-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Efflux proteins include P<sub>1B</sub>-type ATPases and Anion Diffusion Facilitator (<italic toggle="yes">ADF</italic>) protein families, which serve to expel heavy metals from the cytoplasm or transport them to vacuoles [<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases are a widely present class of proteins in living organisms that can transport heavy metal ions across membranes via ATP hydrolysis, forming a subclass of the P-type ATPase family. Research has found that P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases primarily handle the active transport of heavy metal ions in plants and play a vital role in the regulation of heavy metal homeostasis [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPase genes are widespread in plants, and studies have shown that members of the HMA gene family play significant roles in regulating the uptake and transport of Cd. For example, <italic toggle="yes">OsHMA2</italic> is expressed in the roots and nodes of rice, and the protein is located in the plasma membrane of the root sheath. <italic toggle="yes">AtHMA3</italic> locates in the vacuole membrane and mediates the transport of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup> into the vacuole for detoxification [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, there are no reports on the identification and functional studies of HMA gene family members in tea.</p><p>To investigate the effects of Cd treatment under acidified soil conditions on the growth physiology of tea plants and the absorption mechanism of Cd under these conditions, this study set up an experiment planting tea with different Cd concentrations under acidified conditions. The experiment measured the Cd concentration in tea, growth indicators, photosynthetic system parameters, and antioxidant enzyme activities. These results are crucial for developing soil amendments for acidified soils; exploring efficient and environmentally friendly application techniques to adjust the pH value of soils; and improving the availability of mineral elements, which is of great significance for the healthy development of soil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-00570"><title>2.

Effect of pH Value and Cd Treatment on Cd Content in Tea</title><p>The Cd content in the young leaves, mature leave, stems, and roots of tea plants was measured after 7 days under treatment with Cd concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) at pH levels of 5.5, 4.5, and 4.0. The results indicate that the order of Cd concentration in tea from highest to lowest is root &#x0003e; stem &#x0003e; mature leaf &#x0003e; young leaf. Under high-concentration Cd treatment at the same pH value, the Cd content in tea was significantly higher compared to other Cd concentration treatments. The Cd treatment significantly increased the Cd content in all tissues of tea, and the Cd content increased significantly with decreasing pH values. Under the same pH, the Cd content in T4 was significantly higher than in other treatments across all tissues (<xref rid="plants-14-00570-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-14-00570"><title>2.2. Effects of pH Value and Cd Treatment on Secondary Metabolites of Tea</title><p>The effects of different pH levels and Cd treatments on secondary metabolites in tea, including AA, TP, CAF, and SS, were measured. As shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>, with the continuous decrease in pH, the contents of AA and TP continuously decreased; as the Cd concentration treatment increased, the contents of AA and TP significantly decreased. With the continuous decrease in pH, there was no significant change in the contents of CAF and SS; however, as the Cd concentration treatment increased, the contents of CAF and SS significantly decreased. Notably, under T4 at pH 4.0, the AA content was reduced by 55% compared to T1 under CK. The impacts of different pH levels and Cd treatments on six types of catechins in tea&#x02014;epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), and gallocatechin (GC)&#x02014;were also examined. With the continuous decrease in pH, the contents of GC, EC, and EGCG continuously decreased, and as the Cd concentration treatment increased, the contents of GC, EC, and EGCG significantly decreased. With the continuous decrease in pH, there was no significant change in the contents of ECG, GCG, and GC; similarly, as the Cd concentration treatment increased, these three catechins showed no significant change. Among them, under T4 at pH 4.0, the EC content was approximately three times lower than that of T1 under CK.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-14-00570"><title>2.3. Effects of pH Value and Cd Treatment on Phenotypes of Tea</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>, in the CK, the growth of tea buds and roots was inhibited, but the degree of inhibition did not significantly increase with increasing Cd concentration and treatment time. In the group with pH 4.0, the growth of tea buds and roots was markedly inhibited, and the degree of inhibition became more pronounced with increasing Cd concentration and treatment time. By day 21, T4 at pH 4.0 had a significant inhibitory effect on the elongation of tea buds, the elongation of new roots, and the number of new root tips. In T1 to T4 shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>, the elongation of buds significantly decreased as the pH decreased. At the same pH level, the elongation of buds progressively decreased as the Cd concentration increased. The trend in the elongation of root tips was similar to that of bud elongation, but the significance was less pronounced.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-plants-14-00570"><title>2.4. Effects of pH Value and Cd Treatment on Photosynthetic System Indexes of Tea</title><p>The chlorophyll fluorescence in vivo of tea seedlings was observed under different pH levels and Cd concentrations. Purple-blue indicates that the photosynthetic organs are in a normal state, while green, yellow, and red indicate damage to Photosystem II due to Cd stress. Damage to plants worsened with increasing Cd concentration across all pH treatments. Similarly, damage worsened with decreasing pH levels across all Cd concentration treatments. The most severe damage occurred under T4 at pH 4.0 (<xref rid="plants-14-00570-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). As illustrated in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S4a</xref>, the phenotypic effects of different pH levels and Cd concentrations on tea were observed. In the CK, T4 showed a phenotype of red threads and wilting compared to T1-T3. At pH 4.0, T2-T4 exhibited yellowing, red threads, and wilting compared to T1. Under T1, there was no significant change in leaf phenotype with decreasing pH. However, under T4, the leaf phenotype showed significant yellowing and wilting with decreasing pH, along with a marked increase in red threads. The effects of different pH levels and Cd treatments on chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, and total chlorophyll content were also examined. In <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S4b</xref>, it was found that within each group, chlorophyll a content continuously decreased with increasing Cd concentration. In the CK, the chlorophyll a content in T4 and T3 was significantly lower than in T1 and T2. At pH 4.0, the chlorophyll a content in T4 was significantly lower than in other treatments. As shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>, the trends in chlorophyll b, carotenoids, and total chlorophyll content across different pH levels and Cd treatments were consistent with the trend in chlorophyll a content. Under different pH levels and Cd treatments, the <italic toggle="yes">Fv/Fm</italic> ratio continuously decreased with increasing Cd concentration. It also continuously decreased with decreasing pH levels. The <italic toggle="yes">Fv/Fm</italic> ratio reached its lowest point under T4 and pH 4.0 (as shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Photosynthesis is the most fundamental life activity for plant growth and metabolism. This study measured the photosynthetic parameters of tea after treatment with different pH levels and Cd concentrations. The results are shown in <xref rid="plants-14-00570-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. As the duration of stress treatment increased, the transpiration rate (Tr), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), and stomatal conductance (Gs) of tea plant leaves all showed a gradual downward trend, while the intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Ci) did not change significantly during the stress period. Among these, the Tr, Pn, and Gs parameters in the CK at the tested Cd concentration were significantly higher than those in the pH = 4.0. It is noteworthy that under high Cd concentration treatment, the Pn and Tr parameters of the tea in both the CK and the pH = 4.0 showed a significant decrease, indicating that acidification exacerbated the photosynthetic and respiratory stresses on the tea leaves caused by Cd. The reduction in the photosynthetic rate of tea leaves was due to non-stomatal factors such as the weakening of mesophyll photosynthetic capacity. As shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S6</xref>, the state of stomata was observed under a focal length of 100 &#x003bc;m, and the degree of stomatal opening and closing was recorded. The effect of stomatal opening and closing is reflected by the ratio of stomatal length to width. Under T1&#x02013;T4 in the CK, there was no significant difference in the degree of stomatal opening and closing; under T1&#x02013;T4 at pH = 4.5, a significant difference in the degree of stomatal opening and closing was observed; and under T1&#x02013;T4 at pH = 4.0, an extremely significant difference in the degree of stomatal opening and closing was noted (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-00570" ref-type="app">Figure S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-plants-14-00570"><title>2.5. Effects of pH Value and Cd Treatment on the Antioxidant System of Tea</title><p><xref rid="plants-14-00570-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a shows the results of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> histochemical staining of tea leaves treated with NBT solution, where dark blue spots indicate the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A lower degree of decolorization suggests more severe stress on the leaves. It can be observed that the tea leaves subjected to different pH and Cd treatments exhibited varying degrees of dark blue spots and decolorization. Compared to T1 in the CK, T4 in the CK almost failed to decolorize, with few dark blue spots. T1 at pH 4.0 completely decolorized, with an increase in dark blue spots. T4 at pH = 4.0 not only failed to decolorize but also showed large areas of dark blue spots.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="plants-14-00570-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, enzymes related to plant antioxidant defense include SOD, POD, and CAT. When plants suffer from abiotic stress, a large amount of free oxygen accumulates in the body, and the antioxidant enzyme system is induced to remove oxygen free radicals. The activity levels of SOD, POD, and CAT indicate the impact of Cd on the antioxidant enzymes in tea.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, under the treatment of pH 4.0 and a Cd concentration of 0.2 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the roots of tea directly absorbed and immobilized a large amount of Cd, leading to increased Cd content in all tissues of the tea. Compared to the CK, the Cd content in all tissues of tea treated with low pH and high Cd concentration was significantly higher. The Cd content increased in the order of root &#x0003e; stem &#x0003e; mature leaf &#x0003e; young leaf, which is similar to the pattern of Cd absorption in other plants [<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The uptake of Cd by plants mainly comes from the soil, and there is a mechanism for accumulating Cd in the roots and stems of tea. In the results of this study, Cd elements showed a significant negative correlation with secondary metabolites in tea leaves. As the Cd content in various tissues of tea increased, the levels of secondary metabolites decreased, with the most significant reductions observed in AA and TP. The reduction in AA can be attributed to two factors: one is the decrease in pH, which leads to the transformation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> into nitrate nitrogen, affecting the absorption of nitrogen in the nutrient solution [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the other is the impact of increased Cd absorption on the formation of AA in tea [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The reduction in TP is mainly due to the decrease in the content of EGC, EC, and EGCG, with EGCG being the most abundant among catechins and a precursor for the formation of simple catechins. EC plays a crucial role in the pleasant taste of simple catechins in tea leaves. The increase in Cd reduces the content of CAF, thereby degrading the quality of tea [<xref rid="B27-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Soil acidification can inhibit the growth and development of plants. In this study, tea treated with pH 4.0 showed slow growth, with a reduction in the elongation of buds, the number of new root tips, and the elongation of roots. This is consistent with the results of Lin et al., which further proves that soil acidification can inhibit plant growth and development [<xref rid="B28-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Under the influence of acidic environment, the growth of tea was significantly slowed down, and when the concentration of Cd was too high, the growth and development of tea was significantly inhibited, which was consistent with the results of Huybrechts&#x02019; study that Cd had toxic effects on the growth and development of tea [<xref rid="B29-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our results showed that an acidic environment exacerbated the effect of low Cd concentration on tea growth and development, and it accelerated the growth and development effect caused by the enhancement of tea Cd absorption ability, which was consistent with the results of Ju et al. [<xref rid="B30-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Compared to the control, both pH 4.5 and pH 4.0 conditions reduced bud numbers, indicating that acidity and Cd concentration inhibit bud development. High Cd concentrations also significantly decreased root tip elongation and the number of root tips, suggesting that Cd<sup>2+</sup> imposes greater phenotypic stress on roots than on buds and stems, consistent with findings in rice studies [<xref rid="B31-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Under high-concentration Cd treatment, the content of chlorophyll was significantly inhibited, with the lowest chlorophyll content in tea leaves observed under T4 and pH 4.0. This may have been due to the fact that Cd stress causes key enzymes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway, such as protochlorophyllide reductase and porphobilinogen deaminase, to undergo conformational changes, thereby reducing their activity and decreasing chlorophyll synthesis [<xref rid="B32-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, acidification activates Cd<sup>2+</sup>, and active Cd hinders the absorption of trace elements required for chlorophyll synthesis and disrupts the integrity of the membrane structure where chlorophyll is located, leading to the disintegration of the grana stacking structure within chloroplasts and causing irreversible damage to chloroplasts [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Despite no significant decrease in chlorophyll content with decreasing pH, increasing Cd concentrations led to a decline in chlorophyll levels. This suggests that Cd stress affects chlorophyll synthesis and adaptation mechanisms in tea plants [<xref rid="B34-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Heavy metals inhibit photosynthesis by affecting the electron transport process in photosynthetic reactions and disrupting the structure of chloroplasts, thus damaging the integrity of the photosynthetic system [<xref rid="B35-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, compared to T1, the stomatal conductance, Pn, and Tr of T4 at pH 4.0 were significantly reduced. As the Cd concentration increased, the stomata of the leaves may close, reducing transpiration and leading to a decrease in photosynthesis [<xref rid="B36-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The content of free proline in leaves and roots increased with the increase in Cd concentration under pH 4.5 and pH 4.0 treatments, indicating significant accumulation of proline, which suggests that tea is under heavy metal Cd stress in an acidic environment. Therefore, by measuring MDA, we can indirectly assess the extent of lipid peroxidation and the damage to the membrane system, as well as the plant&#x02019;s stress resistance. Membrane and cell damage can lead to MDA accumulation, primarily by inducing lipid peroxidation, damaging the structure of biological membranes, especially the plasma membrane, leading to structural and functional damage to cell membranes, altering membrane permeability, and thus affecting the normal progression of various physiological and biochemical reactions [<xref rid="B37-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The MDA is the final decomposition product of lipid peroxidation in membranes and reacts with proteins, causing them to lose function. The content of MDA can reflect the degree of damage to plants under stress [<xref rid="B38-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, under Cd stress conditions, the antioxidant enzyme system in tea was significantly activated to cope with the oxidative stress brought by Cd. The content of SOD increased only with the increase in Cd concentration under pH 4.0. However, the content of POD and SOD significantly increased with the increase in Cd concentration under pH 4.5 and pH 4.0. Combining the analysis of superoxide anion content through NBT staining, it was found that tea cells under high-concentration Cd treatments at pH 4.5 and pH 4.0 were severely stressed. POD and CAT were activated to assist in the conversion of superoxide anions into water during this process [<xref rid="B39-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Based on the specific expression of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMAs</italic> genes in different tissues of tea plants and under various pH and Cd treatments, we infer the role of these metal ion transporters in the transport of metal within tea. <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA3</italic> all belong to the Zn subfamily but have distinct expression patterns. The expression of the <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> is significantly higher in leaves and stems than in roots, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> may have a role similar to the transport of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, and its expression is relatively high during transport in stems and leaves. <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA3</italic> is highly expressed only in roots, which is similar to the results in Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco, where it is primarily localized in the vacuolar membrane of roots [<xref rid="B40-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This differs from the transport of Zn<sup>2+</sup> by the <italic toggle="yes">AtHMA4</italic> gene in Arabidopsis and the <italic toggle="yes">AhHMA4</italic> gene in barley, which may be a specific expression of the tea gene [<xref rid="B41-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that <italic toggle="yes">HMA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HMA4</italic> genes in different crops are key genes for the transport of Cd<sup>2+</sup> [<xref rid="B42-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the T1 treatment of roots, stems, and leaves, changes in pH did not significantly affect the expression of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic>, indicating that single acidification changes cannot regulate the expression of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic>. Under the same pH treatment, as the Cd concentration increased, the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> gene also increased, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> responds directly or indirectly to Cd stress. Under the same Cd concentration treatment, the lower the pH, the higher the expression of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic>, which may be due to the increased activation of Cd<sup>2+</sup> as the acidity decreases, leading to the absorption of more Cd<sup>2+</sup> by the tea. Therefore, we infer that <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> is a key gene responsible for the transport of Cd ions in tea plants and that its function is influenced by pH. Zhao et al. found that <italic toggle="yes">OsHMA2</italic> in rice serves as a crucial transporter for cadmium (Cd). <italic toggle="yes">OsHMA2</italic> is expressed in the roots and nodes of rice plants, where it localizes to the plasma membrane of root pericycle cells and the phloem of nodes. Mutation of <italic toggle="yes">OsHMA2</italic> decreases the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots. These observations align with our findings [<xref rid="B43-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> exacerbated Cd stress damage to young leaves, leading to an increase in Cd content in young leaves. Conversely, silencing <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> alleviated Cd stress, resulting in a decrease in Cd content in young leaves. This indicates that the accumulation of Cd in young leaves is closely related to the expression level of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic>. Under high-concentration Cd stress in acidified conditions, the trends in the overexpression and silencing of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> were similar to those under high-concentration Cd stress alone. The main reason for this could be that the decrease in pH accelerates the activity of heavy metal ions such as Cd<sup>2+</sup>, while simultaneously reducing the activity of metal ions such as Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> [<xref rid="B44-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The increased expression of <italic toggle="yes">CsHMA2</italic> enhances the transport efficiency of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, thus yielding similar results to those observed under high-concentration Cd stress alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-14-00570"><title>4.

The Cd content was detected using the ICP-MS standard sample preparation method (Optima 8000, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-plants-14-00570"><title>4.3. Determination of Photosynthetic System Parameters</title><p>On the 7th day of the experiment, fresh leaves of the tea seedlings were taken, the midribs were removed, and the leaves were cut and weighed at 0.2 g. They were then ground to a uniform paste and re-ground with 95% ethanol until the tissue turned white, after which they were left to stand for 5 min. The mixture was filtered into a 25 mL volumetric flask, diluted with ethanol, and mixed thoroughly. Using 95% ethanol as the blank, the absorbance of the extract was measured at wavelengths of 665 nm and 649 nm. The chlorophyll content (mg g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was calculated as follows: (concentration &#x000d7; extraction volume &#x000d7; dilution factor)/fresh weight of the sample. To measure the chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics, an IMAGING-PAM chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system was used to capture images of the plants on day 0 and day 7 after planting, recording the <italic toggle="yes">Fv/Fm</italic> value, which represents the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII primary photoenergy conversion. For the determination of photosynthetic parameters, the entire plant was placed in a dark environment for more than 30 min, and a portable chlorophyll fluorescence meter was used to measure the second leaf from the top of the tea plant (avoiding the main vein), with at least 15 measurements per treatment on the 7th day of the experiment [<xref rid="B45-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Determination of Antioxidant Enzyme Activities</title><p>On the 7th day of the experiment, 0.2 g of fresh leaves from the tea seedlings was ground into a powder in a pre-cooled mortar with liquid nitrogen. Then, 1.8 mL of phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.2) was added and the mixture was further ground into a homogenate. After centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and used for the determination of enzyme activities. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity: SOD activity was determined using the xanthine oxidase method (hydroxylamine method). Peroxidase (POD) activity: POD activity was measured using the guaiacol colorimetric method. Catalase (CAT) activity: CAT activity was determined using the ammonium molybdate method. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) staining: On the 7th day of the cd stress treatment, leaf segments about 10 cm long were cut from the tea leaves and immersed in NBT reaction solution (2 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, pH = 7.8, 50 mmol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> sodium phosphate buffer) in the dark for 8 h. Subsequently, a decolorizing solution was prepared in the ratio of ethanol/acetic acid/glycerol = 30:10:10. The leaves were decolorized in a boiling water bath at 100 &#x000b0;C until completely green-free, and then the stained leaf tissues were observed and photographed. Free proline content determination: Free proline content was determined using fresh leaves from the 7th day of the experiment. Free proline was extracted from the plant material using sulfosalicylic acid. Under acidic conditions, proline reacts with ninhydrin to form a stable red compound, which was extracted with toluene and the absorbance was measured at 520 nm. The determination of free proline content was carried out according to the experimental method of Yang [<xref rid="B48-plants-14-00570" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>MDA content determination: Fresh leaves from the 7th day of the experiment were used to determine MDA content. One gram of tea leaf sample was thoroughly ground in liquid nitrogen, and then 10 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected as the sample extract. Two milliliters of the sample extract were mixed with 2 mL of 0.6% thiobarbituric acid (TBA) solution, and the mixture was immediately placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. After the water bath, the mixture was rapidly cooled and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a microplate, and the absorbance levels were measured at 532 nm, 600 nm, and 450 nm using a multifunctional microplate reader.

Gently puncture the leaf surface with a needle, then use a 1 mL syringe without a needle to draw up the suspension solution and inject it into the lower epidermis of the leaves, spreading it across the entire leaf. Inject 2&#x02013;3 leaves per tea plant, with at least three tea seedlings injected. Use tea seedlings injected only with the pBI121-GFP suspension as the control group (CK). Transfer the tea seedlings to an artificial climate chamber and keep them in the dark for 12 h.

Store them at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis.</p><p>Gene silencing validation was also conducted. The constructed TRV2-CsHMAs, empty TRV2, and TRV1 plasmids were transformed into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Correct positive clones were identified and cultured overnight in YEB liquid medium containing both Kanamycin (Kan) and Rifampicin (Rif) antibiotics. The bacterial cultures were collected and resuspended, and the OD<sub>600</sub> was adjusted to around 1.5. Next, the treatment group TRV2-CsHMAs resuspension (equal volumes of TRV2-CsHMAs and TRV1 mixed together) and the control group TRV2 resuspension (equal volumes of empty TRV2 and TRV1 mixed together) were incubated in the dark at 28 &#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;5 h. Healthy &#x02018;Longjing 43&#x02019; tea cuttings were selected. The second and third leaves were gently punctured with the needle of a syringe, and the leaves were infiltrated with the bacterial suspension using a vacuum pump until the suspension spread across the entire leaf surface. After infiltration, the plants were rinsed under running water to remove any surface bacterial suspension and returned to the hydroponic solution for recovery. Subsequently, the tea seedlings were managed under normal cultivation conditions. Once the roots had developed, the tea seedlings that were confirmed to be positive for transient interference by qRT-PCR (both the TRV2-CsHMAs and the empty vector control) were subjected to Cd treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-plants-14-00570"><title>4.7.

The findings of this study not only help to understand how tea adapts and regulates its physiological processes in acidic environments but also provide important theoretical foundations and technical guidance for future soil improvement in tea gardens, heavy metal pollution control, and optimization of tea quality.
