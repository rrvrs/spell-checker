Due to its in vitro culture complexity, high genome diversity, and the lack of cross-reactive immunity between genogroups, there is an unmet urgent need for polyvalent norovirus vaccines that provide broad-spectrum protection, and no vaccine has gained global approval to date. In this study, we constructed a bivalent norovirus vaccine, based on the highly attenuated poxvirus [strain VG9] vector, expressing the major capsid protein VP1 from genotypes GII.4 and GII.17. VG9-NOR exhibited a comparable replication ability to the authentic virus while preserving good safety. After the intramuscular and intranasal immunization of mice, VG9-NOR induced high IgG- and IgA-binding antibody (Ab) titers against GII.4 and GII.17, increased the secretion of GII.4 and GII.17-specific HGBA-blocking antibodies, and enhanced GII.17-specific mucosal immunity. Furthermore, VG9-NOR also induced a Th1-mediated cellular response. These results demonstrate that the polyvalent poxvirus vector vaccine expressing VP1 variants from different subtypes is able to elicit effective protection. Our study highlights the VG9 vector as a highly promising candidate for the development of polyvalent norovirus vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>norovirus</kwd><kwd>poxvirus vector</kwd><kwd>bivalent vaccine</kwd><kwd>immune response</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key Research and Development Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2023YFC2307905</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2023YFC2307905].</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-00237"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Norovirus, also known as Norwalk virus, was first reported in 1972 as the cause of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in the United States [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hosts can be infected via the fecal&#x02013;oral route or contact with aerosols from vomiting patients [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The high infectivity and effective transmission have maintained the worldwide norovirus pandemic to date. There are currently 10 genogroups of noroviruses [GI-GX], five of which infect humans [GI, GII, GIV, GVII, and GIX] [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Notably, GII.4 is the most widespread genotype that accounts for 70&#x02013;80% of all norovirus cases, and is currently the dominant strain associated with numerous recent NoV outbreaks worldwide [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, no cross-reactive immunity was detected between GII.4 and GII.17 [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], emphasizing the essential need to develop bivalent vaccines against these genotypes.</p><p>Norovirus belongs to the calicivirus family, possessing a 7.5 kb uncoated positive-sense RNA genome encoding three open reading frames [ORF1-3]. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein, which is cleaved into non-structural proteins after translation. ORF2 is responsible for the expression of the major capsid protein VP1, which consists of a shell [S] domain and a protruding [P] domain. ORF3 encodes the minor capsid protein VP2 [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, VP1 alone can self-assemble into virus-like particles [VLPs] [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which have become the focus of norovirus vaccine development. Norovirus VLPs have been successfully produced in various systems, including <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], insect cells [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and mammalian cells [293T] [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as well as vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV] [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and adenovirus vectors [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Currently, several norovirus vaccines are being tested in clinical trials, including a quadrivalent recombinant norovirus vaccine [NCT04563533] [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], adenovirus-based VXA-NVV-201,202 norovirus vaccines [NCT05212168, NCT05626803] [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], recombinant norovirus bivalent vaccines [National Vaccine &#x00026; Serum Institute, NCT04941261, NCT05916326] [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], bivalent vaccines against genotypes GI.4/GII.4 [NCT05508178] [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], a recombinant hexavalent vaccine [NCT05805618] [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], an mRNA-1403/mRNA-1405 polyvalent vaccine [NCT05992935] [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and recombinant tetravalent vaccines [CXSL2300464 CXSL2300465] [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, testing of the bivalent vaccine developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical has been terminated due to an insufficient therapeutic effect. In addition, a trivalent vaccine against the rotavirus capsid protein VP6 carries the norovirus GII.4 VP1 [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and a <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic>-based vaccine against VP1 [<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] is being developed.</p><p>The vaccinia virus vector has a large gene-carrying capacity, with a maximal insertion length of 25 kb [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and has been applied in HIV vaccine development [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the efficiency of the vaccinia virus vector for the norovirus vaccine has yet to be determined. In this study, we constructed a bivalent norovirus vaccine using the VG9-attenuated strain of vaccinia virus as the vector, named VG9-NOR. The VG9 strain was obtained via three cycles of plaque purification of the Tian Tan strain of the vaccinia virus [VVT], which has the advantages of low toxicity, high intake capacity, and immunogenicity, while providing a sustained high expression of the introduced genes [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The VP1 coding sequences of the GII.4 and GII.17 strains were placed under the control of the ELO160 and PE/L promoters. In this study, we assessed the VP1 gene expression level, genetic stability, safety of VG9-NOR, and immunogenicity of the VG9-NOR bivalent vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00237"><title>2.

Construction of VP1-Expressing Recombinant VG9-NOR</title><p>To construct the GII.4 and GII.17 bivalent norovirus vaccine, the VG9 strain was used as the vector to express the VP1 protein of both genotypes. The structure of the constructed bivalent VG9-NOR is shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A. The early and late promoter ELO160 plays a role in immune regulation [<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and was introduced to induce the expression of GII.4 VP1, while the expression of GII.17 VP1 was driven by the promoter PE/L [<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To prevent expression interference, the two promoters were arranged in a &#x0201c;head-to-head&#x0201d; manner. The screenable marker EGFP was inserted between two loxP sites and its expression was driven by the p11 promoter [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This segment was then inserted between the J2R and TJ3R sites in the genome of the vaccinia virus. The recombinant virus VG9-NOR-EGFP was obtained through multiple consecutive rounds of plaque purification. Subsequently, the VG9-NOR-EGFP infected cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing Cre recombinase (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), after which six additional rounds of purification were performed to obtain the EGFP knockout recombinant VG9-NOR. The insertion was validated by PCR (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). A Western blot analysis confirmed that GII.4 and GII.17 VP1 proteins were both successfully expressed in VG9-NOR (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D,E).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-17-00237"><title>3.2. Stability of the VG9-NOR Bivalent Vaccine</title><p>To ensure that the insertion of the VP1 coding sequence did not adversely affect viral replication and genetic stability, we infected Vero, BHK-21, and HeLa cells with 0.05 MOI of VG9-NOR. The recombinant virus showed a comparable replication ability to the VG9 strain (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). We then compared the morphology of pox on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryos induced by VG9 and VG9-NOR, finding no noticeable difference in size, shape, or number (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). These results indicate that the replication capability was preserved in the VG9-NOR strain. Since gene loss frequently occurs during the passaging of the vaccinia virus due to gene deletion, frameshift, or nonsense mutations [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we investigated the genetic stability of the inserted sequence. The third-generation virus after purification was obtained and used to infect BHK-21 cells. The cell supernatant was collected and passaged for six consecutive generations. Protein expression was evaluated by a Western blot analysis. The results showed that the VP1 proteins of the GII.4 and GII.17 strains were stably expressed in all generations, which confirmed the genetic stability of VG9-NOR.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-17-00237"><title>3.3. Safety Evaluation of VG9-NOR Bivalent Norovirus Vaccine</title><p>The TTV-derived VG9 strain has low toxicity and causes fewer side effects [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To evaluate the safety of VG9 and VG9-NOR, we conducted pathological sectioning, rabbit skin pockmark test, and body weight analysis in mice after vaccination. Firstly, 14 days after a single dose of the vaccine, we performed pathological sectioning on the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain of mice. <xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A shows the pathological results of the lung and spleen following intramuscular vaccination with VG9-NOR, intranasal VG9-NOR, and VG9 (see <xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials</xref>). There were no obvious lesions in the lungs and spleen, with only slight lymphocyte infiltration. This suggests that the pathological changes caused by VG9 and VG9-NOR in mice are minimal. Secondly, we carried out the rabbit pockmark test, which revealed that there was no significant difference in the size of the pockmarks formed by the two viral strains, but the pockmarks induced by low-dose VG9-NOR receded faster in the last three days (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B,C). This may be due to a slightly weaker replication ability of VG9-NOR in rabbit skin caused by the insertion of exogenous genes. Lastly, we further analyzed the impact of VG9-NOR and VG9 on the body weight of mice (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). The results showed that the changes in the body weight of mice were not significant, indicating that VG9 and VG9-NOR had a minimal impact on the general health of mice. In conclusion, VG9-NOR showed a similar safety profile to VG9 in rabbits and mice. These results suggest that VG9-NOR, as a vaccine candidate strain, has good safety and a low risk of side effects in the animal model tested.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-17-00237"><title>3.4. VG9-NOR-Induced Robust Humoral and Cellular Immunity</title><p>To assess the humoral response induced by VG9-NOR, BALB/c mice were intramuscularly or intranasally immunized with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> [high dose] or 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> [low dose] PFU of VG9-NOR (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A), and boosted after 14 days. We conducted ELISA 14 days after each round of immunization to evaluate the IgG (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B) and IgA Abs (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). The results showed that the high-dose intranasal immunization elicited the highest antibody titers against GII.4 and GII.17, respectively. In addition, HGBA blockage is also an essential indicator for assessing norovirus vaccines [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We thus performed an HGBA blockage assay and observed that VG9-NOR immunization was able to induce antibodies blocking HGBA, whereby the intranasal route showed the best performance. Intestinal IgA Ab is one of the major antibodies that can prevent norovirus infection. Accordingly, we examined mouse fecal IgA Abs 14 days after the first dose and the booster dose. The intranasally immunized mice showed a 100% positivity rate for fecal IgA Abs against GII.17 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). The mice immunized via the intramuscular route showed a rise in the fecal IgA Abs positivity rate from 40 to 60% after boosting. However, no GII.4-specific fecal IgA Ab was observed in any of the immunized mouse. These results indicate that intranasal administration of the high dose is a preferable and safe way for VG9-NOR immunization, which can induce high IgG, and IgA, as well as fecal IgA antibodies shortly after immunization. The difference between high and low doses of HGBA-blocking antibodies against GII.4 and GII.17 was statistically significant, with higher antibody Abs in the high-dose group. In addition, the IgG- and IgA-binding antibodies titers against GII.4 and GII.17 after the second dose were higher than after the initial dose, but there was no significant difference in IgG-binding Ab against GII.17 following the first and second dose.</p><p>Cellular immunity is strongly activated after a norovirus infection to eliminate the virus [<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We, therefore, evaluated if VG9-NOR induced a cellular immune response in mice. Mouse splenocytes were separated 14 days after the booster dose. We observed that VG9-NOR activated the IL-2- and TNF-&#x003b1;-secreting CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response (<xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,B).

Discussion</title><p>Norovirus infection is one of the main causes of acute gastroenteritis around the world. The lack of cross-immunity between prevalent strains has led to an unmet, yet urgent, need for a polyvalent vaccine that provides wider protection. In this study, we selected the low-pathogenicity vaccinia strain VG9 as the vector, into which we inserted the VP1 genes of prevalent strains GII.4 and GII.17 VP1 to develop the bivalent norovirus vaccine VG9-NOR. GII.4 is a widespread norovirus genotype that is continuing to mutate [<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], while GII.17 is currently the dominant strain associated with numerous recent NoV outbreaks worldwide [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Vaccinia vectors are widely used in the development of polyvalent vaccines, primarily because they can effectively induce mucosal immunity, and possess high genomic stability with a concomitant low host&#x02013;genome integration risk, while allowing the insertion of large gene fragments. The recently marketed preventive vaccinia vector vaccine, a non-replicating Ankara strain, has exhibited high vaccine safety. The vaccinia vector vaccines in the clinical trials showed no adverse effects, including those against Zika virus [<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], Ebola virus [<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and chikungunya fever virus [<xref rid="B45-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Here, we evaluated the safety of VG9-NOR by comparing the mouse organ histology, skin pox lesions, and mouse weight changes following VG9-NOR immunization. Our results confirmed that VG9-NOR has good safety in both mice and rabbits.</p><p>The World Health Organization [WHO] has not provided evaluation guidance for norovirus vaccines. Thus, we assessed the immunogenicity of VG9-NOR by measuring various immune responses. The VG9-NOR bivalent vaccine was able to simultaneously induce systemic mucosal immunity against both GII.4 and GII.17, including high titers of IgA- and IgG-binding Abs, which are essential antibodies that defend against norovirus infection [<xref rid="B46-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Compared with the norovirus vaccine developed by Jiang et al. [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], high-dose intranasal immunization with VG9-NOR elicited higher IgG [titer:2<sup>20</sup>] and IgA [titer:2<sup>25</sup>] Abs titers. The VG9-NOR-induced GII.4-specific IgA antibody was higher than that of the adenovirus vector vaccine, whereas intranasal administration induced a slightly lower IgG antibody count than the adenovirus vector vaccine [maximal titer 10<sup>5</sup>]. As shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00237-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C,D, our purpose was to study the stability of the antigen expression during passage. However, multiple bands were observed in GII.4, and the molecular weights of GII.4 and GII.17 were also inconsistent. For the multiple bands in GII.4, we proposed that it may be due to the hydrolysis of its N-terminal, as a similar phenomenon had also been observed by other researchers using VSV to express the VP1 protein of GII.4 [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With regard to the difference in molecular weight between GII.4 and GII.17, we speculated that this may be due to differences in the reactivity of polyclonal antibodies used against different antigens. Specifically, polyclonal antibodies of GII.4 may be more responsive to intact virus-like particles (VLPs), while polyclonal antibodies of GII.17 may be more active to N-terminal-degraded fragments. Meanwhile, we found that the GII.17 expression level was higher, which was consistent with our immunological results that the fecal IgA antibody and HGBA-blocking antibody in GII.17 were all higher than that in GII.4.</p><p>Since the histo-blood group antigen [HBGA] antibody is one of the key factors in assessing the protectivity of norovirus vaccines [<xref rid="B47-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we demonstrated that VG9-NOR can induce HBGA antibodies with a comparable BT50 value to the vaccines developed by Jiang and colleagues [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In addition to humoral responses, cellular immunity is also essential in response to norovirus infection [<xref rid="B48-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We therefore investigated if VG9-NOR activated cellular immunity. It was found that VG9-NOR induced a Th1-biased response in mice. After stimulation with genotype-specific VLPs, there was a higher secretion of IL-2 and TNF-&#x003b1; compared to IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4, suggesting a strong CD4+ cellular response. Atochina-Vasserman et al. [<xref rid="B49-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] developed a bivalent norovirus mRNA vaccine, which also induced double-positive CD4<sup>&#x02009;+</sup>&#x02009;T cells as well as polyfunctional CD8&#x02009;<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;T cells, which was consistent with our results.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of the VG9-NOR vaccine, particularly against GII.4 and GII.17 norovirus. However, there are some limitations to our study, particularly in the evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity and safety. First, we did not use a non-human primate (NHP) model to evaluate the immunogenicity of the VG9-NOR vaccine, which is considered the most reliable platform for evaluating vaccine immunogenicity. This limitation may affect the accuracy of our assessment of the vaccine&#x02019;s actual protective effect in humans. Secondly, we found that the VG9 strain induced pox lesions on the skin of rabbits. Therefore, before conducting human clinical studies, further safety tests in non-human primates are needed. Finally, we only explored intranasal and intramuscular immunization methods, while subcutaneous methods and oral methods were beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the latter may elicit a stronger mucosal immune response. At present, the preclinical evaluation of norovirus vaccines has mainly focused on the histo blood group antigen (HBGA) blockade, but this approach does not fully reflect the immunogenicity of vaccines in vivo. In recent years, select human norovirus genotypes have been successfully cultured in human intestinal enteroids (HIEs). This non-transformed human intestinal organoid model, derived from surgical resections of the small intestine, mimics the human intestinal epithelium with multiple cell types and permits limited human norovirus replication, and provides a valuable platform for evaluating serum neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), which can effectively reflect the immunogenicity of vaccines in vivo [<xref rid="B50-viruses-17-00237" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, it is recommended that we evaluate human intestinal enteroids first, while using the NHP model only for vaccines that show the desired immunogenicity. This phased evaluation strategy can screen potential vaccine candidates at an early stage, while reducing unnecessary resource expenditure as well as alleviating ethical concerns related to NHP models.</p><p>The vaccinia virus has a long and storied history as the first preventive inoculation against the smallpox virus, against which it can provide lifelong protection with only one dose. However, vaccinia vector vaccines generally require a two-dose immunization. A study of vaccinia vector Ebola vaccines found that the first injection of the vaccine elicited only limited titers of antibodies, which were significantly enhanced after the booster dose. This result is consistent with our study, as we also found that the booster dose noticeably enhanced the VG9-NOR-induced immune responses, especially the antibodies blocking HBGA. GII.4-IgG- and -IgA-binding Abs, as well as GII.17-IgA-binding Ab increased after booster injection, but there was no significant change in GII.17-IgG-binding Ab between the first and second immunizations. We observed that intranasal immunization resulted in higher IgG -and IgA-binding Abs titers, as well as fecal IgA Abs positivity rates, compared with the intramuscular route. Moreover, increasing the vaccine dose significant improved both the humoral and cellular immune response, which is feasible due to the low toxicity of VG9.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Ling Pan for the assistance with the mouse immunization experiments.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
