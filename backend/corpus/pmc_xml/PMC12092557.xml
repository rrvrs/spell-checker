The five-year survival rate is poor due to late diagnosis. Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is the second-most common OSCC. An in vitro cell line model is a valuable tool to get a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in therapy resistance and disease progression. We report establishment of three OTSCC cell lines from advanced&#x000a0;stage treatment&#x000a0;na&#x000ef;ve Indian patient samples, such as ACOTSC120, ACOSTC132, and ACOTSC140. All three OTSCC cell lines showed epithelial morphology, which was confirmed by Keratin-14 staining. The cell lines showed in vitro spheroid-forming and in vivo tumorigenic potential. The STR of the cell lines ensured their human origin and novelty when compared to DSMZ cell line database. The karyotype of the cell lines showed aneuploidy and further confirmed their human origin. These cell lines showed the presence of cancer stem cell (CSCs) population, i.e., the ALDH<sup>br</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup> population. These cell lines thus provide a model to help understand the biology of disease and its progression.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13577-025-01231-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tongue carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Cell line</kwd><kwd>Epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>Cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>In vivo tumorigenesis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department Of Atomic Energy</institution></funding-source><award-id>DAE-4598</award-id><award-id>TRAC-3542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waghmare</surname><given-names>Sanjeev K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC) - Khargar</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Department of Atomic Energy.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Japan Human Cell Society 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the&#x000a0;sixth most common cancer in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], wherein one-third cases come from India, making it a serious health&#x000a0;risk in India. A high prevalence is due to lack of awareness regarding risk factors and unavailability of early detection services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Around 70% of the cases are diagnosed in the later stage bringing down the five-year survival to around 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among OSCC, oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is second&#x000a0;most common. Currently employed treatment regime against OSCC consists of surgery, chemo-radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. Surgery is considered as a primary treatment modality in majority of cases and performed in combination with chemo-radiation to improve treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Surgery is preferred in cases of early&#x000a0;stage disease, while complex procedures involving reconstruction and adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy are performed in cases of advanced&#x000a0;stage cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Although multi-modality treatments are utilized, the five-year survival rate has been poor for OSCC.
