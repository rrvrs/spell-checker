Endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) are vessel-resident progenitors with vasoreparative capacity and they offer an important avenue for allogeneic cytotherapy to achieve perfusion of ischemic tissues. Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) has been proposed as a marker for vascular endothelial stem cells, but its precise role in ECFC biology remains unknown. The current study has investigated the biological relevance of EPCR in ECFC function. Our data show that over 95% of ECFCs exhibit high EPCR expression. These levels surpassing CD34 and CD157, positions EPCR as a new robust ECFC immunophenotypic marker, alongside established markers CD31 and CD105. Functionally, depleting EPCR expression in ECFCs significantly diminished angiogenic activity, including proliferation, migration and tube formation. This knockdown also altered normal ECFC barrier function. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that knockdown of EPCR led to enrichment of gene signatures for cell cycle, TGF beta, and focal adhesion kinases. G1 cell cycle arrest was confirmed in ECFCs with depleted EPCR. Mechanistically, EPCR knockdown led to increased release of TGF&#x003b2;2 and SMAD2/3 activation, coupled with increased p21, decreased pFAK, and increased transgelin. Additionally, we showed that quiescent ECFCs showed significantly lower EPCR expression when compared to proliferating ECFCs. In agreement with this, cell sorting experiments demonstrated that ECFCs with the highest EPCR expression exhibited the highest clonogenic capacity. In summary, our findings highlight that EPCR expression in ECFCs is critical for their angiogenic activity, by modulating cell cycle progression.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2">

As such, ECFCs carry potential as a cell therapy for ischemic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and have shown efficacy in an array of preclinical models of vascular insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Importantly, an international survey provided technical guidance on how to standardize ECFC isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. ECFCs are commonly distinguished from other endothelial cell-types by their superior clonogenic and angiogenic capacities, highly pure immunophenotyping profiles based on CD31, VE-Cadherin, CD105, and VEGFR2 endothelial markers while lacking hematopoietic markers CD45 and CD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ECFCs progenitor cell properties have been attributed to the expression of CD34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but more recently, CD157 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and <italic>PROCR</italic> (EPCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have been highlighted in vivo as identifiers of distinct populations of vascular endothelial stem cells. Isolation of ECFCs in vitro based on these markers, yields colonies of high proliferative potential that are capable of long term-self-renewal. Added to this, a cohort of human cord blood circulating ECFCs of CD34<sup>bright</sup> cells possessed high clonal proliferative potential, compared to CD34<sup>high</sup> cells, and were enriched in expression of <italic>PROCR</italic> (EPCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Other than being used as a marker of stemness, it is well understood that EPCR enhances the activation of protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex into APC (activated protein C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. EPCR is also required as a co-receptor for noncanonical proteolytic cleavage of PAR-1 (at Arg46) to elicit cytoprotective effects of APC, and indeed capable of switching thrombin-mediated Arg41 cleavage of PAR-1 from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory by recruiting &#x003b2;-Arrestins to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This EPCR-PAR-1 biased signaling has recently been described to be crucial in restoration of blood flow in post-ischemic reperfusion in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The aim of this study is to investigate the functional role of EPCR in human umbilical cord blood-derived ECFCs using established protocols of endothelial potency (colony formation, tubulogenesis, migration, and endothelial barrier formation). Here we uncovered a key role for EPCR as a regulator of cell cycle progression in ECFCs, via its downstream TGF&#x003b2;2 signaling. We demonstrate by selection of ECFCs with low EPCR expression, either by transient knockdown or by fluorescence activated cell sorting, that ECFCs highly proliferative state is dependent on the expression of EPCR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>EPCR is highly expressed in the cellular membrane of human cord blood-derived ECFCs and during mouse lung microvascular regeneration</title><p id="Par6">ECFCs can be identified by a combination of cell surface markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previously we have demonstrated that ECFCs exhibit high expression of endothelial markers CD31 and CD105, low/negligible expression of hematopoietic markers CD14 and CD45, and varied expression of stem/progenitor marker CD34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since EPCR has been identified as a marker of vascular endothelial stem cells in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], we assessed its expression in human cord blood-derived ECFCs. Here we show cell surface expression of EPCR, CD157, and CD34 on ECFCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The % of expression and the median fluorescence intensity are both significantly higher for EPCR when compared to CD157 and CD34 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c). EPCR expression was also the most homogeneous among ECFCs from nine different donors as demonstrated by all assessments showing&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;95% positivity. The expression of CD157 and CD34 was heterogeneous. CD157 exhibited expression levels from 48 to 82%, and CD34 from 11 to 72% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In addition, immunofluorescence of EPCR confirmed its widespread expression on the cell surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). To corroborate our findings, we assessed ECFC transcriptomes generated by other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Publicly available data from GEO with IDs GSE263058 and GSE131995 were analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We found that human cord blood-derived ECFCs showed significant higher <italic>PROCR</italic> mRNA expression than human induced pluripotent stem cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1a). Similarly, peripheral blood-derived ECFCs exhibited a significantly higher expression of <italic>PROCR</italic> mRNA than subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1b). Furthermore, to establish the biological relevance of EPCR in the in vivo setting, we harnessed data from the single-cell transcriptomic atlas from a mouse model of lung microvascular regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which is publicly available in GEO with ID GSE211335. This model of severe acute lung injury is induced by intratracheal instillation of diphtheria toxin in mice genetically modified to express the human diphtheria receptor in endothelial cells. This leads to the selective ablation of more than 70% of lung endothelial cells, which triggers vasoreparative mechanisms that achieve replenishment of endothelial cells by 7&#x000a0;days post-injury. Focusing on the expression of <italic>Procr</italic>, the gene that codes for EPCR, in the different cell types within this acute lung injury model, we confirmed that <italic>Procr</italic> was expressed at higher levels in mouse lung endothelial cells in comparison to other lung cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e), and there was a clear upregulation in <italic>Procr</italic> expression in response to injury. The increase in <italic>Procr</italic> expression was specific to endothelial cells and was quantified to be over two-fold increase by day 3 in 9.68% of cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). A gene correlation analysis of <italic>Procr</italic> with other reported marker genes for endothelial progenitor/stem cells, identified <italic>Procr</italic> clustering together with <italic>Cd34</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> having a positive strong correlation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). Interestingly, there was a negative correlation between <italic>Procr</italic> and endothelial differentiation markers including <italic>Cdh5</italic> (Ve-cadherin), <italic>Cd31</italic> (Pecam), and <italic>Eng</italic> (Endoglin). Moreover, a second in vivo mouse lung injury model was examined. This model employed LPS to induce lung endothelial injury through inflammation and trigger vasoreparative processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Results indicated that <italic>Procr</italic> increased significantly after LPS exposure (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;2a). This <italic>Procr</italic> mRNA expression increase was already evident 6&#x000a0;h post LPS, reached highest levels at 24&#x000a0;h post LPS, and was not detectable at 72 and 168&#x000a0;h post LPS (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;2b). This suggested that EPCR expression in endothelial cells was associated with acute endothelial injury and early reparative mechanisms. Taken altogether, both the murine lung and human ECFC results confirm that EPCR (<italic>PROCR</italic>) is a robust marker for vasoreparative cells.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>ECFCs show widespread expression of EPCR on cell surface. <bold>a</bold> Cell surface expression by flow cytometry of EPCR (pink histogram), CD157 (orange histogram), and CD34 (blue histogram) relative to unstained sample (grey histogram).

Protein evaluation by Western blot indicated a 95% decrease in EPCR expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;3). This knockdown led to a significant decrease in proliferative, tubulogenic, and migratory capacities, as shown by clonogenics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), tubulogenesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), and scratch migration assays (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). In addition, endothelial barrier formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e) is impeded when <italic>PROCR</italic> is silenced in ECFCs, measured by a significant reduction in cell index recorded during barrier formation (2.28&#x000a0;h) and after plateau (12&#x000a0;h). The full trace of barrier formation and stability over 18&#x000a0;h is available in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;4. Disruption of the endothelial barrier with thrombin treatment highlighted a greater response in <italic>PROCR</italic> siRNA cells compared to control siRNA, with a significant reduction in normalized cell index and a delay in barrier recovery after thrombin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). In addition, we also evaluated the role of EPCR in more complex in vitro models including the 3D vasculature-on-chip and the MSC aggregates model. In agreement with previous results, EPCR<sup>high</sup> ECFCs showed a significant larger area for sprouting and vascular network formation than EPCR<sup>low</sup> ECFCs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;5). Human MSC aggregates were cocultured with EPCR knocked down ECFCs or controls. We observed less intra-aggregate RFP vascular structures in EPCR knocked down ECFCs than in control ECFCs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;6). Taken together, our evidence demonstrated that ECFCs in vitro functionality is dependent on the presence of EPCR.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Expression of EPCR in ECFCs is essential for endothelial functionality. <bold>a</bold>

Secondly, cell surface immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, showed that the cell cycle arrest was not associated with increased cell death.

When quantified, there is a significant increase in cells within G1, and a concomitant reduction in cells within G2/M phases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g).

Interestingly, the expression of Alk5, which is the receptor upstream of pSMAD2/3, showed a second band of lower molecular weight, evident only in <italic>PROCR</italic> knockdown ECFCs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;13). Considering that Alk5 is activated by multiple ligands, we queried our transcriptome results for Alk5 ligand changes with <italic>PROCR</italic> knockdown.

ECFCs were cultured at high density until fully confluent, kept for 3&#x000a0;days and then serum starved, before sampling. Single cell RNA sequencing of ECFCs, made quiescent by contact inhibition, revealed a significant reduction in <italic>PROCR</italic> mRNA expression in quiescent cells when compared to proliferating cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). In addition, we explored <italic>PROCR</italic> expression changes throughout the in vitro expansion of ECFCs. We found that <italic>PROCR</italic> mRNA expression remained stable from P9 to P26 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;15). Nevertheless, we observed that the frequency of ECFCs with the lowest expression of <italic>PROCR</italic> (bottom quartile) increased from 7% at P9, to 13% at P19, and 30% at P26. To corroborate the quiescence model findings at the protein level, we performed flow cytometry for EPCR expression. DyeCycle histograms confirmed the quiescent and proliferating phenotypes in ECFCs by cell cycle phase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that quiescent ECFCs show loss of G2/M peak, which was associated with a significant loss of EPCR expression, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and % expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). To further confirm the relationship between EPCR expression and proliferation, we used a third model by FACS (fluorescently activated cell sorting), based on EPCR expression levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c) into EPCR<sup>low</sup>, EPCR<sup>mid</sup>, and EPCR<sup>high</sup> expressing ECFCs. Sorted populations were cultured and colony formation evaluated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d).

Furthermore, EPCR<sup>high</sup> expressing ECFCs yield significantly more HPP (high proliferative potential) colonies and significantly less LPP (low proliferative potential) colonies than both EPCR<sup>low</sup> and EPCR<sup>mid</sup> ECFCs. In addition, co-staining of EPCR sorted cells with cell cycle analysis further demonstrates the association of EPCR expression with cell cycle status by a stepwise reduction in G1/G2M ratio from EPCR<sup>low</sup> through to EPCR<sup>high</sup> ECFCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;16).

EPCR has also been used to identify vascular endothelial stem cells in murine tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Indeed, we show a high expression of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;95% for EPCR in ECFCs from all the donors analyzed. While inter-donor variability in the percentage of EPCR-positive cells was minimal, we observed differences in EPCR expression levels, which may reflect variations in the proliferative status of the cells at the time of analysis. EPCR has been reported to be central for cell proliferation and functionality for human cord blood-derived HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and epidermal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and, for the first time, we show the importance of EPCR for the&#x000a0;proliferative capacity and functionality of ECFCs. siRNA knockdown of the gene <italic>PROCR</italic> coding for EPCR resulted in a significant decline of angiogenic activity, as shown by cell proliferation, migratory capacity and tube formation assays. Furthermore, sorting of EPCR<sup>high</sup> expressing ECFCs exhibited the highest proliferative potential, suggesting that the level of EPCR expression as central in controlling ECFC functionality. This agrees with a study of EPCR deletion in murine endothelial cells which shows reduced sprouting angiogenesis of isolated endothelial cells in vitro and reduced post-ischemic reperfusion in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This study also described EPCR-dependent biased PAR-1 signaling to be crucial for regenerative angiogenesis in ischemic injury.</p><p id="Par13">Interestingly, a recent study linked PAR-1 expression to ECFC function. It was shown that siRNA knockdown of PAR-1 in ECFCs led to a significant increase in proliferation in vitro, and post-ischemic revascularization in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Coupled with our data, this provides a thought-provoking insight into the function of EPCR-PAR-1 complex, suggesting a balance between these two receptors dictates ECFC proliferative capacity. Several studies have shown that altering EPCR expression does not affect PAR-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In our hands, silencing of EPCR appears to modulate PAR-1 expression in 2 out of 4 biological replicates (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;13) but overall not significant; therefore, further research is necessary to better understand the interplay between these two receptors and ECFC function.</p><p id="Par14">It is well accepted that EPCR signaling in endothelial cells facilitates the activation of protein C (PC) to prevent excess levels of thrombin and promote anti-coagulation in maintenance of a homeostatic vascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is essential for development, evident in both mice homozygous knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and human EPCR mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], proving embryonic lethal. Furthermore, the concurrent expression of EPCR and thrombomodulin within endothelial progenitors confers both anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Notably, aberrant regulation of EPCR in ECFCs has been implicated in enhanced thrombin generation associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Secondly, EPCR mediates cytoprotective signaling, via its predominant ligand APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], to cleave and induce activation of PAR-1 and subsequent activation of downstream survival pathways including PI3K/Akt. These signaling events lead to cell survival through anti-apoptotic activity, stabilization of endothelial barrier, and anti-inflammatory response through inhibition of NF&#x003ba;B signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our <italic>PROCR</italic> knockout ECFCs showed a significantly impaired endothelial barrier (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E), beyond this they exhibit a larger disruption to barrier integrity and delayed recovery after thrombin treatment. In brain endothelial cells, a PMM2 (Phosphomannomutase 2) knockdown leads to a down regulation of <italic>PROCR</italic> and subsequently a lower surface expression of EPCR. In this model of coagulopathy, EPCR<sup>low</sup> endothelial cells demonstrate impaired integrity of endothelial cell monolayer, which agrees with our findings. This was mediated by scattering of actin filaments and altered VE-Cadherin junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This change in barrier integrity with EPCR absence could be explained by studies in HEK293 cells (which do not express EPCR). In the absence of EPCR, APC switches to canonical cleavage of PAR-1 (at Arg1) to initiate barrier disruptive signaling responses, like thrombin, and fails to cleave Arg46 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Beyond its role in coagulation and cytoprotection, there is also evidence to suggest that EPCR has a role in immune activation because it can bind directly to &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This is due to structural similarities between EPCR and CD1/MHC-class 1. Although more research is needed to confirm activation/expansion of T-cells through this binding complex, it highlights the need for further research and raises questions about the specific role of EPCR-expressing endothelial cells in immunity. Indeed, a recent study of EPCR structure identified a novel conformation that is incompatible with PC/APC binding and may dictate EPCR properties that are still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Here we show that the level of EPCR expression of ECFCs dictates their proliferative potential, where <italic>PROCR</italic> silenced ECFCs have reduced expression of Ki67 and PCNA. Transcriptomics analysis of <italic>PROCR</italic> silenced ECFCs highlights a significant negative enrichment score of REACTOME CELL CYCLE pathway, and we confidently confirm that EPCR expression is responsible for progression from G1 phase of the cell cycle by reduced EdU incorporation, loss of G2M peak, and significant reduction of G1 checkpoint genes in <italic>PROCR</italic> silenced ECFCs. Similar results have suggested a role for Procr in controlling the proliferation of mammary stem cells, through HSP90AA1, Src, and IGFR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, we corroborated that EPCR expression dictates ECFCs proliferative status by assessing the transcriptomics at the single cell level in proliferating vs quiescent ECFCs, showing that ECFCs in a quiescent monolayer have a lower expression of <italic>PROCR</italic> and a significantly lower expression of EPCR on their cell surface. No previous studies have linked EPCR with contact inhibition in normal endothelial cells, however our results provide convincing evidence that EPCR expression decreased under quiescence, and this is likely associated with changes in ERKs phosphorylation and p21, as found in <italic>PROCR</italic> knock down ECFCs. On the other hand, <italic>PROCR</italic> knockdown in ECFCs led to a positive enrichment of TGF&#x003b2; signaling, confirmed by an increase in TGF&#x003b2;2 release and concomitant phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, suggesting that TGF&#x003b2;2 acts via Alk5 which is known to produce antiangiogenic effects associated with a decrease in endothelial cell proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is not clear how EPCR deficiency leads to activation of TGF&#x003b2;2/SMAD2/3 signaling in ECFCs, however, a relationship between EPCR and TGF&#x003b2; has been established previously in human proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK-2 cells). This study proposed that EPCR occupancy by protein C switches the signaling specificity of thrombin through PAR-1 receptors leading to the inhibition of TGF&#x003b2;-mediated processes such as expression of extracellular matrix proteins related to profibrotic pathology in diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].
