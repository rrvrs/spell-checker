In up to 40% of patients, this resistance is caused by activating mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ESR1. Accumulating clinical evidence indicate adverse outcomes for these patients, beyond that expected by resistance to endocrine therapy. Here we aimed to study the role of ESR1 mutations in conferring chemoresistance in BC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">MCF-7 cells harboring Y537S and D538G ESR1 mutations (mut-ER) were employed to study the response to chemotherapy drugs, paclitaxel and doxorubicin, using viability and apoptotic assay in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. JNK/c-Jun/MDR1 pathway was studied using qRT-PCR, western-blot, gene-reporter and ChIP assays. <italic>MDR1</italic> expression was analyzed in clinical samples using IHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">&#x000a0;Cell harboring ESR1 mutations displayed relative chemoresistance compared to WT-ER, evidenced by higher viability and reduced apoptosis as well as resistance to paclitaxel in vivo. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, <italic>MDR1</italic> expression was examined and elevated levels were observed in mut-ER cells, and in clinical BC samples. <italic>MDR1</italic> is regulated by the c-Jun pathway, and we showed high correlation between these two genes in BC using TCGA databases. Accordingly, we detected higher JNK/c-Jun expression and activity in ESR1-mutated cells, as well as increased occupancy of c-Jun in <italic>MDR1</italic> promoter. Importantly, JNK inhibition decreased <italic>MDR1</italic> expression and restored sensitivity to chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations confer chemoresistance through activation of the JNK/MDR1 axis.

About 75% of patients with BC express estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; (<italic>ESR1</italic>) and endocrine therapy is the mainstay treatment for these patients. While being effective and safe, some patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) do not respond to any form of endocrine treatment (de novo resistance), and virtually all patients who initially respond will eventually develop endocrine resistance (acquired resistance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We and others have discovered activating mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the <italic>ESR1</italic> as an acquired mechanism for endocrine resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with D538G and Y537S being the most common mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These mutations arise following endocrine treatment, most commonly aromatase inhibitors, and are identified in up to 40% of patients with ER(&#x003b1;)-positive MBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Accumulating clinical and laboratory data suggest a unique aggressive phenotype of BC expressing these mutations beyond merely endocrine resistance. Thus, we and others have shown predilection of tumors and cells harboring these mutations to form liver metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, these data indicates that following the development of endocrine resistance, the outcomes for patients with tumors harboring ESR1 mutations are significantly worse compared to those with other forms of endocrine resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Following the development of endocrine resistance, patients with MBC are treated with chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin are being among the most commonly used drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Yet, some patients rapidly develop resistance to them. Mechanisms associated with resistance to chemotherapy include the activation of survival pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and alterations in drug metabolism, including drug uptake, efflux, and detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Multiple drug resistance (MDR) refers to the ability of cancer cells to resist a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs. The MDR phenotype occurs most often due to the overexpression of drug-efflux pumps in the plasma membrane of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], including the multidrug resistance-1 (<italic>MDR1</italic>) gene, which is known as <italic>ABCB1</italic>. It encodes for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is an efflux transporter that limits drugs from penetrating cells and depositing them into the extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Expression of <italic>MDR1</italic> was noted in over 50% of cancers with MDR phenotype and it can be inherited or induced by chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A well-established regulator of the MDR phenotype is c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Exposure of tumors to chemotherapy activates JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], leading to phosphorylation and activation of its downstream effector, the transcription factor c-Jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which in turn upregulates the expression of <italic>MDR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Based on the accumulating clinical data, we hypothesized that <italic>ESR1</italic> activating mutations confer resistance to chemotherapy. Indeed, our results indicate an association between these mutations and resistance to chemotherapy in BC cells. Furthermore, <italic>MDR1</italic> was upregulated in mut-ER, especially in D538G-ER, and this was associated with increased activity of the JNK/c-Jun pathway. Importantly, inhibition of this pathway increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. These data suggest a novel treatment option for patients harboring activating <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p id="Par17">Paclitaxel (Taxol; 6&#x000a0;mg/ml) and doxorubicin (2&#x000a0;mg/ml) were provided from the pharmacy of the Oncology department at Sourasky Medical Center (Tel Aviv, Israel).

First, we studied the effect of JNK inhibition on apoptosis in MCF-7 mut-ER and WT-ER cells. We treated cells with the JNK inhibitor SP, examined c-PARP expression, and found that JNK inhibition induced apoptosis, mostly in D538G cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). In order to determine the role of JNK in mediating chemoresistance in these cells, we compared cell viability after treatment with doxorubicin, SP, or their combination. As expected, the results showed that mut-ER cells were more resistant to doxorubicin treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 compared to WT-ER). Interestingly, while SP inhibited both WT-ER and mut-ER cells, WT-ER cells were more affected (45 vs 55% viability). Importantly, co-treatment with SP and doxorubicin sensitized mut-ER cells to doxorubicin. Of note, co-treatment of WT-ER cells did not reduce cells viability beyond doxorubicin alone, which may be due to the strong effect of doxorubicin as a single treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 of D538G cells when treated with combination compared to doxorubicin alone). On the other hand, there was no significant decrease following combination of SP and paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone for both the WT-ER and the D538G cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Previously, it was shown that one of SP mechanisms of action is similar to that of paclitaxel, namely, it binds tubulin and increases tubulin polymerization disrupting cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This shared mechanism likely accounts for the lack of enhanced efficacy observed with paclitaxel.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>JNK inhibition restores sensitivity of mut-ER and WT-ER cells. <bold>a</bold> MCF-7&#x000a0;expressing the WT-ER and LBD-ER cells were treated with 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of SP for 24&#x000a0;h, then cells were lysed and immunoblotted against c-PARP and &#x003b2;-actin served as a loading control. <bold>b</bold> Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and treated with 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M SP, 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M doxorubicin, or combination for 72&#x000a0;h.

As we first showed that D538G mutated cells express higher P-gp levels compared to WT-ER, our next aim was to show that doxorubicin accumulation is reduced in D538G mutated cells. To this aim, we monitored cellular accumulation of fluorescently label doxorubicin (DOX-F). We treated MCF-7 WT-ER and D538G cells with DOX-F, and in accordance with our hypothesis, we observed the fluorescent signal in the nuclei of the D538G mutated cells was lower compared to WT-ER cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a&#x02013;b). In order to validate that the JNK pathway modulates P-gp expression and hence activity, cells were treated with DOX-F and SP together.

Importantly, this group of patients often have a more aggressive disease and worse prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Chemoresistance continues to be a major obstacle that impairs the efficacy of cancer therapy and nearly 90% of patients fail to respond to chemotherapy due to resistance of cancer cells, either de novo or acquired resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As most patients with endocrine resistance are treated with chemotherapy, we hypothesized that reduced response to chemotherapy may contribute to the worse prognosis seen in patients harboring these mutations. Yet, no studies have assessed chemotherapy resistance in ER-positive patients harboring LBD-ER mutations. In our study, we discovered that LBD-ER cells are more resistant to chemotherapy drugs, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, compared to the WT-ER cells using both in vitro and in vivo models.</p><p id="Par50">In order to study chemoresistance, we employed the well-established MCF-7 cell model that expresses WT, D538G or Y537S&#x02013;ER, at physiological levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Using these cells, we explored the effect of the mutations on viability, colony formation, and apoptosis following chemotherapy treatments. Our results show that LBD-ER cells are more resistant compared to the WT-ER cells. Of note, we established an in vivo model, and observed that paclitaxel treatment led to tumor shrinkage in the WT-ER group only (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). It is important to point out that while the in vivo experiment showed a clear resistance of D538G-ER tumors compared to WT-ER tumors, this model had some limitations. First, we employed subcutaneous implantation approach; thus, drug response may be modulated by different microenvironmental stimuli. Second, we used paclitaxel doses suitable for mice tolerance, and perhaps WT-ER cells would respond to higher doses. Yet, the accumulating data we present strongly suggest a relative resistance to chemotherapy in mut-ER cells.</p><p id="Par51">There are several mechanisms that enable BC cells to acquire drug resistance. Among these are the well characterized P-gp transporters, which are encoded by the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Doxorubicin is one of the major substrates of P-gp;&#x000a0;therefore, it plays a role in drug internalization within cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Similarly, low doxorubicin accumulation has been reported in MDR cell lines including MCF-7<sup>ADR</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Indeed, we have shown that doxorubicin accumulation was lower in the D538G mutated cells compared to WT-ER (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b&#x02013;c). We further revealed that LBD-ER mutant cells exhibited elevated <italic>MDR1</italic> expression, though more prominently in D538G, compared to the WT-ER in both MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a&#x02013;d). In agreement with these results, we found an increase in the P-gp expression level in patients' samples harboring the ESR1 mutations compared to patients without the mutation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). Our results suggest that the mut-ER cells are able to utilize the P-gp transporters as part of their resistance mechanism to overcome chemotherapy treatments. A relationship between endocrine treatment and P-gp was demonstrated previously, showing that tamoxifen increases sensitivity to doxorubicin, and increases accumulation of vinblastine in MCF-7 cells expressing <italic>MDR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. On the other hand, another study showed that WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) can bind ER&#x000a0;and enhance <italic>MDR1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">We aimed to reveal the mechanism through which mut-ER induces <italic>MDR1</italic> expression. Although <italic>MDR1</italic> expression was observed primarily in mut-ER cells, we first confirmed that there are no ER binding sites on the <italic>MDR1</italic> promoter. In search for a possible mechanism, we focused on the JNK/c-Jun pathway as it has been shown to play a role in chemoresistance of some types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. ThusIn addition, previous studies revealed that&#x000a0;activation of JNKs, leading to increased c-Jun&#x000a0; transcriptional activity , also led to the transcription of other genes related to drug resistance, like XIAP, c-fos, and JunB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Therefore, our goal was to reveal whether the JNK pathway was differentially regulated in LBD-ER cells. We observed activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway as evidenced by high expressions of p-JNK, p&#x02013;c-Jun and elevated AP-1 transcriptional activity in the LBD-ER mutant cells compared to WT-ER (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These data suggest a role of the JNK pathway in the LBD-ER mutations. Our results are supported by several studies. Increased JNK signaling was observed following long term acquisition of resistance to endocrine therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Another study showed that activation of the JNK pathway is associated with everolimus resistance in endocrine resistant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Noteworthy, the important role AP-1 plays in endocrine resistance was demonstrated in a study where inhibition of AP-1, in both in vitro and in vivo settings, enhanced anti proliferative effect of endocrine treatments and delayed the onset of tamoxifen resistance in mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">The JNK/c-Jun pathway is known to be associated with <italic>MDR1</italic> expression. Several studies have shown that JNK/c-Jun pathway is activated in cancer cells that acquired resistance to chemotherapy in vitro, demonstrating the importance in regulating <italic>MDR1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To test this, we first showed that SP600125, an inhibitor of the JNK signaling pathway, downregulated the expression of P-gp and <italic>MDR1</italic>, especially in the D538G cells. To provide additional evidence, we performed a ChIP assay and indeed our results showed an increase in c-Jun occupancy in the MDR1 promoter, leading to an increase in P-gp transporters in the mutated cells. In addition, a bioinformatics analysis of TCGA breast cancer BRCA database showed a strong positive correlation between <italic>JUN</italic> and <italic>ABCB1</italic>, confirming our results that c-Jun potentiates the <italic>MDR1</italic> expression in BC cells.</p><p id="Par54">The JNK/c-Jun pathway emerged as a differentially activated pathway in mut-ER cells that directly regulates <italic>MDR1</italic> expression. Hence, our next aim was to assess whether this pathway may serve as a novel target for mut-ER breast cancer tumors. We studied viability and apoptosis of WT and mut-ER cells treated with JNK inhibitors and found that JNK inhibition decreased viability in both WT and D538G cells but significantly increased apoptosis in the D538G mutated cells. Previously, it was shown that JNK inhibition decreased cell growth in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and triple-negative breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. As we found that c-Jun directly induces <italic>MDR1</italic> expression, we aimed to reveal whether inhibition of c-Jun activity would restore cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. Indeed, using a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) we were able to sensitize cells to doxorubicin. This effect was observed in all cell lines, with highest effect in D538G-ER cells. Indeed, it was shown that SP600125 reduced viability of breast cancer cells which acquired resistance to doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and the combined treatment with SP600125 inhibited cell growth more effectively than the single treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Indeed, we showed that JNK inhibition led to increase the accumulation of doxorubicin in the D538G-ER cells. These results imply that doxorubicin resistance can be accounted for by decreased amounts of drug at nuclear targets, which may be mediated by the expression and function of P-gp.</p><p id="Par55">Interestingly, while Y537S and D538G exhibit similar behavior, a detailed analysis suggests some subtle, yet potentially important differences. Thus, we observed less JNK phosphorylation in Y537S cells compared to D538G cells (as verified by analyzing different stable clones, supplementary Fig. S2). Additionally, we noted higher <italic>MDR1</italic> expression in D538G cells and lower binding of c-Jun to <italic>MDR1</italic> promoter in Y537S cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). These results suggest unique characteristics for each mutation despite their similar role in conferring endocrine resistance. Consistent with our observations, previous studies have also revealed notable differences between Y537S and D538G. For example, Y537S confers higher endocrine resistance than D538G cells and is associated with a shorter overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">While we focused on the JNK-MDR1 axis in mut-ER cells, studies showed that resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer could evolve from a wide array of mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], some of them are relevant to mut-ER cells. For example, active PI3K/mTOR pathway may lead to resistance to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and several studies including ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] showed increased activation of this pathway in mut-ER cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">Taken together, our current study demonstrates that activating mutations in the LBD-ER not only confer resistance to endocrine therapy but also relative resistance to commonly used chemotherapy. This resistance is, at least in part, mediated by the activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway, leading to the upregulation of <italic>MDR1</italic> expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). These findings underscore the urgency of discovering new drugs to effectively treat patients with ESR1-mutated tumors, as these tumors display decreased responsiveness even to subsequent lines of treatment such as chemotherapy. Moreover, the study highlights the significance of targeting the JNK/c-Jun as a strategy to sensitize mut-ER cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study reveals distinct differences between the Y537S and D538G mutations, emphasizing the importance of carefully examining these discrepancies, as they may hold implications for the treatment of patients harboring these specific mutations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="10549_2024_7507_MOESM1_ESM.pptx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PPTX 3695 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BC</term><def><p id="Par5">Breast cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBC</term><def><p id="Par6">Metastatic breast cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ER&#x003b1;</term><def><p id="Par7">Estrogen receptor-a</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBD</term><def><p id="Par8">Ligand-binding domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDR1</term><def><p id="Par9">Multiple drug resistance-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>P-gp</term><def><p id="Par10">P-glycoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JNK</term><def><p id="Par11">C-Jun N-terminal kinase</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MT&#x02014;Collected the data, performed the analysis of in vitro and in vivo assays, and wrote the manuscript.
