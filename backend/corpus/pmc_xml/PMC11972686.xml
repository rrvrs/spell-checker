The limbic network is involved in crucial physiologic functions involving memory, emotion and sleep. Temporal lobe epilepsy is frequently drug-resistant, and people often experience comorbidities related to memory, mood and sleep. Deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) is an established therapy for temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the optimal stimulation parameters and their impact on memory, mood and sleep comorbidities remain unclear. We used an investigational brain sensing-stimulation implanted device to accurately track seizures, interictal epileptiform spikes (IES), and memory, mood and sleep comorbidities in five ambulatory subjects. Wireless streaming of limbic network local field potentials (LFPs) and subject behaviour were captured on a mobile device integrated with a cloud environment. Automated algorithms applied to the continuous LFPs were used to accurately cataloged seizures, IES and sleep-wake brain state. Memory and mood assessments were remotely administered to densely sample cognitive and behavioural response during ANT-DBS in ambulatory subjects living in their natural home environment. We evaluated the effect of continuous low-frequency and duty cycle high-frequency ANT-DBS on epileptiform activity and memory, mood and sleep comorbidities. Both low-frequency and high-frequency ANT-DBS paradigms reduced seizures. However, continuous low-frequency ANT-DBS showed greater reductions in IES, electrographic seizures and better sleep and memory outcomes. These results highlight the potential of synchronized brain sensing and dense behavioural tracking during ANT-DBS for optimizing neuromodulation therapy. While studies with larger patient numbers are needed to validate the benefits of low-frequency ANT-DBS, these findings are potentially translatable to individuals currently implanted with ANT-DBS systems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Kremen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. report that both continuous low-frequency and duty cycle high-frequency anterior nucleus of the thalamus deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) reduced seizures in five ambulatory subjects with temporal lobe epilepsy.

In the subsequent 5-year open-label phase, the median seizure reduction reached 69%, and 16% of participants had at least one 6-month seizure-free period.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The ANT<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf106-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> is an important limbic network node, and ANT-DBS can impact MMS. In the SANTE trial, participants receiving HF-ANT reported depressive mood (14.8% versus 1.8%) and memory impairment (13.0% versus 1.8%) symptoms more frequently than the non-stimulated control group.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Interestingly, at the group level, mood and memory changes were not captured by standard neuropsychological (NP) assessments.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> An independent study investigating SANTE ANT-DBS did not find a group level mood change during stimulation treatment, but reported individual patients with histories of depression may experience sudden depressive symptoms with ANT-DBS that can be alleviated by adjusting stimulation parameters.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In addition, a study investigating cognitive changes with ANT-DBS showed fewer symptoms of executive dysfunction with ANT-DBS, and those with significant seizure reduction showed improved verbal learning.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>The effect of ANT-DBS on sleep has received less attention, but it is known SANTE ANT-DBS can disrupt sleep.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf106-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>These results highlight the potential importance of quantitatively tracking seizures and MMS comorbidities during ANT-DBS.

(<bold>A</bold>) The INSS device enables wireless streaming of brain LFP to a mobile device running the EPA. The EPA application orchestrates integration and synchronization of multiple wireless devices and provides a system for bidirectional communication between devices, participants, and the remote clinical team. In five participants with mTLE, limbic circuit network nodes were implanted with four, 4-contact leads targeting bilateral HPC-AMG and ANT (inset view). The sensing-stimulation lead extensions were tunneled under the skin to the INSS device implanted in a surgically created pocket over the left pectoralis muscle. The INSS device supports bidirectional wireless communications and streaming of 4-bipolar LFP channels to a mobile device via a relay telemetry device typically worn by the individual. Bidirectional wireless communication between the INSS, mobile device and cloud environment enables analysis of synchronized brain electrophysiology, patient inputs and behaviour.

Here we investigated five people with drug-resistant mTLE to focus attention on limbic network circuits generating disabling, drug-resistant seizures and MMS comorbidities. We created a neurotechnology platform (BrainRISE) integrating implantable and mobile devices within a cloud infrastructure to investigate the impact of ANT-DBS therapy on seizures, IES and MMS. Synchronized data streams<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> from multiple devices (brain sensing-stimulation implanted device, mobile computing and wearable devices) were streamed to a cloud-based data storage, viewing and computing environment. Validated algorithms were applied to streaming hippocampal LFP recordings to create accurate catalogs of seizures, IES and sleep-wake behavioural states. Subjects also reported seizures and performed a word free-recall memory task and answered mood questionnaires using the custom mobile application. The results demonstrate that the participants are often poor reporters of their seizures. This has been demonstrated previously by multiple groups using implanted devices<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf106-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and in the EMU.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf106-B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Patients may attribute various symptoms to seizures despite a non-epileptic etiology and without closed-loop responsiveness testing, it remains unclear what patients are experiencing. We have recently demonstrated automated responsiveness testing in epilepsy that we plan to use in future studies to correlate patient behaviour and electrographic seizures.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> The current study demonstrates the feasibility and potential clinical utility of continuous, synchronized tracking of brain electrophysiology and behaviour in PWE living in their natural home environments (<xref rid="fcaf106-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>We characterized the circadian patterns of epileptiform activity in mTLE and showed that seizures occur primarily during wakefulness and IES are markedly increased during sleep, as has been previously reported in studies with more limited data.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B72" ref-type="bibr">72-74</xref></sup> The mechanism underlying the discordance of behavioural state-dependent IES and seizures, two fundamental measures of pathological brain excitability, remains unclear. We speculate that behavioural state-dependent modulation of limbic network circuits differentially effects activation, spread and network propagation of pathological hippocampal electrographic activity to reduce seizures during NREM and REM sleep compared with wakefulness.</p><p>We quantified the effects of ANT-DBS on mTLE epileptiform activity and surprisingly show that LF-DBS is as effective as the widely utilized, and FDA and <sc>Ce-</sc>mark approved HF-DBS for reducing patient-reported seizures in this small group of patients. But possibly more important, LF-DBS showed greater reductions of electrographic seizures and IES (<xref rid="fcaf106-F4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fcaf106-F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), objective biomarkers of pathologic network excitability,<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B75" ref-type="bibr">75-77</xref></sup> in both wakefulness and sleep. Furthermore, LF-DBS was associated with improved objective measures of sleep (<xref rid="fcaf106-F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) and verbal memory (<xref rid="fcaf106-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) compared with HF-DBS.</p><p>HF-DBS is proven to reduce seizures,<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> but there may be more optimal stimulation paradigms depending on the circuits and etiologies underlying the epilepsy, seizures and MMS comorbidities. Here we show that in a small number of well-characterized mTLE participants having hippocampal onset seizures, LF-DBS was more effective in reducing epileptiform activity and was better for sleep and memory than HF-DBS. We can speculate that the reduced NREM-REM duration is likely related to arousals. This is supported by the results showing that WASO is increased with HF-DBS (<xref rid="fcaf106-F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>The clinical relevance of reducing IES and subclinical electrographic seizures in epilepsy has long been debated, but recent studies show the deleterious impact of IES on memory<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B78" ref-type="bibr">78-81</xref></sup> and sleep.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup> Furthermore, the role of IES on progression and maintenance of epilepsy remains poorly understood, but IES in slow-wave sleep may play a role in disruption of long-term memory<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> and consolidation of seizure engrams and epileptogensis.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf106-B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup> It is important to note that participants receiving ANT-DBS, both LF-DBS and HF-DBS, over multiple months did not show evidence for kindling with increasing IES and seizures.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup> In the future, the BrainRISE platform can be used for optimizing ANT-DBS paradigms, but results will first require replication and validation in a larger cohort of patients.</p><p>While our current study focused on establishing the integrated platform in a small number of subjects, we would like to highlight the potential for LFP biomarker-guided DBS, particularly in the context of multi-node ANT-HPC stimulation. Future investigations will explore closed-loop paradigms utilizing this platform to personalize and optimize DBS therapy based on individual patient's LFP and behavioural biomarkers.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. (i) The trial design was focused on safety and feasibility and does not include blinding or randomization of a control group without ANT-DBS therapy activated. Given the proven, class-I evidence for ANT-DBS, we did not feel there was clinical equipoise to withhold ANT-DBS therapy from patients for an extended period. We did not control for duration of the therapy periods, but comparing equal reporting periods did not affect the results. (ii) The existence of cycles of seizure occurrence in epilepsy<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> is now well established and the results obtained in any future trial will likely depend on the timing of therapy and data collection. We have largely addressed this limitation here with the dense long-term monitoring. (iii) Similar to other studies, we use patient reports of seizures to assess the outcome of ANT-DBS. There is strong evidence that many PWE are poor reporters of their seizures. This was also demonstrated in our data when comparing proven electrographic seizure discharges with patient reports. This remains a fundamental limitation in clinical epileptology, but here the gap is partially mitigated by the unique long-term continuous LFP sensing and automated seizure detection after device implant. (iv) Similar to the clinical trial leading to regulatory approval of high-frequency ANT-DBS, we did not see differences in standard NP and memory testing during in person clinic visits at baseline prior to implant and during both LF-DBS and HF-DBS. But with the ambulatory free-recall memory and IMS tasks, we were not able to obtain baseline assessments prior to implant. Unfortunately, the software system was not completed prior to enrollment of participants. Therefore, we could only compare differences in memory free-recall tasks and IMS scores after implantation between LF-DBS and HF-DBS. (v) The BrainRISE platform provides synchronized behaviour and neural activity on an unprecedented scale in ambulatory humans, but challenges remain given the participant burden associated with keeping multiple device batteries charged and wireless connectivity active. (vi) It remains unknown if, and to what degree, electrographic seizures detected from streaming LFP impair consciousness. This is a fundamental gap in the assessment and treatment of epilepsy that will be addressed in the future with assessments that are triggered on seizure detections in real time.<sup><xref rid="fcaf106-B85" ref-type="bibr">85-89</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>fcaf106_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="fcaf106_supplementary_data.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Cindy Nelson, Andrea Victoria and Starr Guzman from Mayo Clinic for patient coordination; Abbey Becker, Dave Linde and Scott Stanslaski from Medtronic for providing engineering support for the INSS devices, Certicon a.s. for providing CyberPSG viewer for research, and the OpenMind team for providing community expertise and resources (<ext-link xlink:href="https://openmind-consortium.github.io/" ext-link-type="uri">https://openmind-consortium.github.io/</ext-link>).</p></ack><sec id="fcaf106-s4"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
