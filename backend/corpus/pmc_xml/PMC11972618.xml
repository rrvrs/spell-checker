This population is also prone to a sedentary lifestyle, leading to hamstring tightness. As this population has very little time to spare in terms of long-term treatment, the Mulligan traction straight leg raise (TSLR) technique might be ideal for them as it is effective even in a short amount of time and may help treat LBP and hamstring tightness in a noninvasive manner&#x000a0;and improve&#x000a0;flexibility simultaneously.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>For LBP, an assessment of the pain rating scale was performed. For hamstring tightness, the active knee extension test (AKET), V-sit and reach test, and fingertip-to-floor test were employed with the help of a goniometer, plinth, inch tape, and chalk. Mulligan TSLR was performed for three consecutive days. After three days, an&#x000a0;assessment was conducted to record the level of improvement.</p><p>Results</p><p>The investigations were performed in 100 young adults of which 60 (60%) were females and 40 (40%) were males. Normal BMI was observed in 67 (67%) participants while the remaining 33 (33%) participants were in the overweight category. LBP and hamstring tightness decreased after the application of the treatment, and the difference with the pre-treatment situation was statistically significant(p&#x0003c;0.0001). This signifies that the treatment is effective.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>The present study demonstrated a significant reduction in LBP associated with hamstring tightness after the short-term application of Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR. Our findings show that this method alone can alleviate acute pain and tightness, leading to improvement in range of motion and muscle flexibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>hamstring tightness</kwd><kwd>low back pain</kwd><kwd>mulligan&#x02019;s method</kwd><kwd>traction straight leg raise</kwd><kwd>young adults</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most significant health issues faced by&#x000a0;today's generation, affecting a staggering amount of 568 million individuals, thereby restricting their activities of daily living and reducing their quality of life [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. LBP refers to the pain experienced in the lumbar region of the spine which affects almost every individual at least once in their lifetime. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of LBP is alarmingly high, with estimates showing that up to 84% of the population is affected by it. This number is expected to continue to rise due to various contributing factors associated with modern lifestyles [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several factors contribute to the development of LBP, such as obesity or increased weight, genetic predisposition (family history), stress, smoking, strenuous activity, and sedentary lifestyle or prolonged sitting (&#x0003e;5 hours). Due to LBP, some people experience limitations in activities of daily living. Moreover, the emotional toll of persistent pain can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety, further affecting the quality of life and work productivity [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The hamstring muscles, located in the posterior part of the thigh, play an important role in the function and movement of the lower body. The hamstrings consist of three main muscles: the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris. These muscles are classified as two-joint muscles as they cross both the knee and hip joints, performing the vital functions of knee flexion and hip extension [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Shortening of the hamstring muscle leads to hamstring tightness. Hamstring tightness is quite common due to various reasons such as prolonged sitting or standing, and a sedentary lifestyle, which eventually leads to muscle imbalances and potential postural issues, making one prone to injury. Prolonged sitting can be seen in young adults due to academic and professional demands, which makes their age group more prone to hamstring tightness. This shortening of muscles eventually weakens the core, increases the risk of recurrent injury, and restricts the mobility of the pelvis, leading to alterations in lumbar pelvic rhythm [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The term young adults refers to the population in the age group of 18-25 years. This age group is in their third decade of life, making them more prone to LBP as many individuals within this group are college students or young professionals who spend the majority of their day sitting for long hours, whether in classrooms, at desks, or in front of computer screens [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Currently, this population is leading a lifestyle characterized by minimal physical activity, and sitting with a flexed knee for long hours a day, which causes shortening of the hamstring, leading the pelvis to tilt posteriorly, and lumbar lordosis resulting in LBP due to back muscle strain. In this crucial phase of life, young adults are often unaware of the long-term consequences of such poor posture and inactivity [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Fortunately, many of these issues can be prevented or mitigated through the adoption of an active and healthy lifestyle, as well as early intervention when pain or discomfort first arises. If the symptoms are chronic or severe, seeking appropriate treatment can significantly improve the overall quality of life. One such treatment option is Mulligan&#x000a0;Traction Straight Leg Raise (TSLR): a technique invented by Brian Mulligan, which is a painless intervention with immense benefit for LBP and radiculopathy. There are various methods for the treatment of LBP, such as Mobilization With Movement (MWM) of extremities and Spinal Mobilization With Limb Movement (SMWLM) [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. TSLR is an MWM technique that can be used&#x000a0;as an option for improving hamstring flexibility, which may benefit people with chronic LBP.</p><p>This study aims to investigate whether the TSLR technique alone can effectively reduce LBP linked to hamstring tightness in a short period, while also promoting long-lasting effects that can enhance mobility and help reduce the risk of future pain episodes. By exploring the potential of this technique, the research seeks to offer evidence-based solutions to manage individuals suffering from the combined challenges of LBP and hamstring tightness, ultimately improving both physical function and overall well-being. By assessing the immediate changes in pain intensity and hamstring flexibility, this study seeks to provide insights into the potential clinical benefits of incorporating this technique into treatment plans for individuals suffering from this common, yet often under-recognized, musculoskeletal problem.</p><p>Given the high prevalence of LBP and hamstring tightness in young adults and the potential for substantial impairments in quality of life, understanding the effectiveness of manual therapy interventions like Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR could inform both clinical practice and patient care strategies. We believe our findings can help enhance treatment protocols for young adults, by providing a noninvasive and accessible option to improve both pain management and flexibility. They may also contribute to the broader body of evidence supporting the use of the Mulligan&#x000a0;techniques as a viable treatment for musculoskeletal pain, particularly in younger, active populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The current study of the short-term effectiveness of Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR on LBP associated with hamstring tightness in young adults was carried out at Krishna College of Physiotherapy, Krishna Vishwa Vidyapeeth (KVV), Karad.

Regarding the pain rating scale [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there was almost no difference in values at rest vs. on activity, which concludes that the pre-treatment values are homogeneous. The pain is drastically reduced post-treatment, especially during activity. As for AKET [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it is seen that the right side is slightly more affected than the left pre-treatment, but both ranges improve post-treatment.

In our study, the majority (60, 60%) were females and the rest 40 (40%) were males. This is because the study center had a majority&#x000a0;female population.&#x000a0;Batool&#x000a0;et al. in their study [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] concluded that females are more likely to be disabled due to LBP and hamstring tightness than males due to the anatomical differences and lower mineral density, which can also be one of the major contributing factors. This factor needs to be further evaluated as it was not considered&#x000a0;in the present study. Young adults were picked for this study since they are the most prevalent demographic in terms of LBP [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. More than half of the population&#x000a0;(52, 52%) participants were in the age group 21-23 years. The age group of late teens (18-20) consisted of 32 (32%) participants and that of mid-20s (24-25 years) accounted for only 19 (19%).</p><p>Young adults are a group of people who commonly tend to avoid physical activity, resulting in a sedentary lifestyle, which eventually leads to tight hamstrings and lower back pain. At this age, most of the population is career-focused, and they consequently ignore physical activity, leading to prolonged sitting. Acute LBP can progress to a chronic form, which eventually affects the productivity of these young adults. Similar findings were reported by Kamalakannan et al. in their study [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The proportion of subjects experiencing LBP who were sedentary was 74%, while those who did physical exercise were only 26%, as reported in the study&#x000a0;by Furtado&#x000a0;et al. [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>To associate LBP with hamstring tightness, screening was done by taking a thorough history. People with LBP due to pathology were eliminatedThe study&#x000a0;by&#x000a0;Nelakurthy&#x000a0;et al. stated that a shortening of hamstring muscle, which can be due to various reasons, eventually leads to posterior pelvic tilt; this tilt leads to reduced lordotic curve, alters spinal loading, and results in the alteration in the lumbar pelvic rhythm, which generates strain on the lumbar segment, causing muscle impairment giving rise to LBP [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There is an alteration in the biomechanics, and, to compensate for this, wrong alterations are again made, which lead to tightness, discomfort, and a complex feedback loop, thereby worsening the situation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Batool&#x000a0;et al. described the link between chronic LBP and stiffness in the back of the thigh in their study [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They found&#x000a0;that hamstring tightness leads to chronic LBP and functional disability. Treating hamstring tightness may reduce LBP. The same correlation was reported by Gou&#x000a0;et al. in their study [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They stated that addressing the condition in one area can alleviate pain and enhance functionality in the untreated area. In their study, it was observed that individuals with LBP had weak core muscles associated with hamstring tightness and coordination impairment; however, improving hamstring flexibility and core strength will help enhance spine stability.</p><p>The association between LBP and&#x000a0;hamstring tightness can be due to multiple reasons such as muscle imbalances, facet joint irritation, and&#x000a0;nerve root compression. This compression can be due to repetitive motions&#x000a0;or disc herniation. In our study, LBP and hamstring tightness were assessed before treatment and after three&#x000a0;days of treatment. Based on the data collected, the difference in outcomes was significant (p&#x0003c;0.0001), and hence it was concluded that the treatment was effective. When Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR is applied, there is activation of mechanoreceptors, which inhibits pain&#x000a0;and increases hip flexion range, leading to a reduction of mechanical stress on the painful lumbar structures during the straight leg raise. This method helps reduce tightness, improve movement patterns in the lower back, and help restore neutral spinal alignment. This was explained by Hall et al. in their study [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This study showed that three&#x000a0;days of TSLR alone is sufficient for treating LBP associated with hamstring tightness. In this study, there was a significant reduction in LBP and hamstring tightness.</p><p>While the immediate effects of Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR on pain and flexibility were significant, it is important to note that the long-term impact of this intervention was not assessed in this study. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the short-term benefits of Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR for young adults with LBP associated with hamstring tightness. These findings suggest that Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR can be a useful tool for clinicians, seeking to provide quick relief for patients experiencing this common musculoskeletal issue.</p><p>This study has a few limitations, primarily its small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. While the results showed positive outcomes, larger studies with more diverse populations are needed to confirm the broader applicability of these findings. Additionally, this study focused on the short-term effects of Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR, and long-term follow-up was not conducted to determine the sustainability of the intervention's benefits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on our findings among young adults, a sedentary lifestyle is the main cause of hamstring tightness, which eventually leads to LBP. The patients in the age group of 18-25 do not generally maintain a proper posture or practice posture-correction techniques. Our findings showed that the short-term application of Mulligan&#x000a0;TSLR can help achieve a reduction in LBP and hamstring tightness. Administering this technique over a three-day protocol period helped in reducing the LBP of the patients significantly. This method&#x000a0;can single-handedly alleviate acute pain and tightness, leading to improvement in range of motion and muscle flexibility, and should be considered as a treatment option for LBP and&#x000a0;hamstring tightness in young adults.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
