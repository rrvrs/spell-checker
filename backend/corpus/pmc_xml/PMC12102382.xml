This study reports on resistance against both macrocyclic lactones (MLs) and benzimidazoles (BZs) in northern Germany, highlighting that AR is spreading. The fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) remains the primary tool for AR assessment, yet differing methodologies and recent guideline updates complicate resistance interpretation across studies. Statistical methods, such as Bayesian approaches used by eggCounts and bayescount, yield varying confidence intervals, further influencing results. Notably, the nemabiome analysis identified <italic>Ostertagia ostertagi</italic> and <italic>Cooperia oncophora</italic> as predominant species in the region, though unexpected diversity among farms with additional GIN species occurring sometimes even at high frequency, suggests morphological analysis of coprocultures may underestimate species prevalence. Detecting AR against both drug classes on some farms underscores the urgency of implementing sustainable strategies, such as targeted selective treatment and combinations of anthelmintics with different mode of action, to prevent scenarios of multi-drug resistance observed elsewhere. Effective resistance management requires immediate discussions with veterinarians and stakeholders to steer toward informed, preventive measures in cattle farming.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gastrointestinal nematode</kwd><kwd>Drug resistance</kwd><kwd><italic>Cooperia oncophora</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Ostertagia ostertagi</italic></kwd><kwd>FECRT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Parasitology</kwd><kwd>Pathogens</kwd><kwd>Antiparasitic agents</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobial resistance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Freie Universit&#x000e4;t Berlin (1008)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">For grazing livestock, infections with helminths are inevitable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and may lead to considerable animal welfare problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Associated economic losses attributed to production losses (~&#x02009;80%) and treatment costs (~&#x02009;20%) in 16 European countries plus Israel and Tunisia were estimated to be about 1.4 billion for cattle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

In Central Europe, resistance of cattle nematodes is currently not considered to be widespread and reported resistance levels were generally low to moderate. In Sweden and Germany, no albendazole resistance in GIN was detected when tested on two and ten farms, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In contrast, IVM resistant GIN were frequently detected in the same study on farms in Belgium, Sweden and Germany. While <italic>C. oncophora</italic> was associated with poor efficacy in all three countries, <italic>O. ostertagi</italic> appeared to be still fully susceptible in Belgium and Germany but not in Sweden. For cattle farms in northern Germany, BZ susceptibility and frequent occurrence of ML resistance was also confirmed using the egg hatch and the larval migration inhibition tests, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In Belgium and Germany, El-Abdellati et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> found reduced efficacy of MLs on 39% of 84 farms with <italic>C. oncophora</italic> identified as the species involved in resistance according to coprocultures post-treatment. Geurden et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> confirmed AR in GIN on 40 farms from the countries Germany (1/12 farms), UK (3/10), Italy (10) and France (3/8) employing moxidectin (MOX) and IVM. Similarly, Charlier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> reported IVM resistance in GIN on some farms in France but not Italy while GIN on all tested farms were susceptible to BZs. In contrast, a study from Ireland also detected frequent resistance against fenbendazole (FBZ), levamisole, IVM and moxidectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. It has been shown that frequency of resistance alleles can increase very rapidly upon selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and once resistance is present, it might rapidly expand if the selection pressure is high. The data presented here show resistance to MLs but particularly to BZs and in this respect are among the very first in Central Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. On two farms, actually, resistance to both predominantly used drug classes was detected. In comparison to previous reports, this suggest that AR is spreading in cattle populations and that the problem might increase in importance in the future as suggested by a recent meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">The FECRT remains the most important test to evaluate the susceptibility/resistance status of gastro-intestinal helminth communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, the original WAAVP guideline for the FECRT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> had not been adapted for more than 30&#x000a0;years before a recent revision by Kaplan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The revised guideline did not only change the guidelines for study design and reporting but also changed the criteria (cut-offs) for identification of resistant populations. In addition, several different statistical approaches have been suggested to analyze FECRT data and to include the different sources of variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It is important to understand that the application of different criteria/guidelines and statistical approaches results in different interpretation of the same FECRT data. This complicates comparison of results between studies if they have been interpreted using different guidelines or 90% CrIs were calculated using different statistical approaches. We have, therefore, started to systematically compare effects of the application of the original guideline in comparison to the revised guideline and of the usage of different statistical approaches that at least consider different levels of variation according to technical and biological sources of variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. While eggCounts and bayescount both use Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches to determine the parameters of the model parameters, eggCounts uses a parametric and bayescount a more robust non-parametric model. As typical for non-parametric models, this results in wider 90% CrIs predicted by bayescount as found here but also in previous studies on sheep and goats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. When comparing the inter-rater agreement calculated as Cohen&#x02019;s &#x003ba; for analysis based on eggCounts and bayescounts, previous studies have reported &#x003ba; values of 1 and 0.774, which is considerably higher than the 0.612 obtained in the present study. This can be easily explained by the low level of resistance that was detected here for cattle strongyles. This leads to 90% CrIs being very close to the cut-offs of 99% and 95% and even small changes in the CrIs can lead to entirely different interpretation of the data as e.g. for farm 5 with EPR. On this farm, the upper CrL for eggCounts was slightly below and for bayescount slightly above the 99% cut-off leading to interpretation of susceptible and beginning resistance, respectively. Similarly, Kr&#x000fc;cken et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> observed complete agreement for FBZ and IVM treatment with high levels of resistance but poorer agreement for moxidectin, against which only low-level resistance was found. For the comparison of data obtained employing the original guideline with that obtained when using the revised guideline, a Cohen&#x02019;s &#x003ba; of only 0.345 was observed, which is again considerably lower than the values reported before of 0.444 and 0.740<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In this comparison, it should be emphasized that many strongyle communities that were considered to be resistant according to the revised guideline were still considered to be susceptible when applying the criteria of the original guideline. This makes it difficult or impossible to compare results of FECRT between studies that applied the original and the revised guideline. Most likely, previous studies using the original guideline underestimated the number of farms with a resistant strongyle community.</p><p id="Par35">The nemabiome analysis revealed that <italic>O. ostertagi</italic> and <italic>C. oncophora</italic> were the most prevalent and abundant species. This is in agreement with other studies from Central Europe using coprocultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> in which these species also dominated. Necropsy studies showed a more diverse strongyle community but of course were only rarely conducted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. There were several rather unexpected results, such as the fact of <italic>B. phlebotomum</italic> and <italic>T. axei</italic> being the most abundant strongyles on one farm each. In addition, the number of species detected per farm ranged from two (<italic>C. oncophora</italic> and <italic>O. ostertagi</italic>) to seven, including three genera with more than one species, suggesting that morphological differentiation of larvae from coprocultures, which is typically only done to the genus level, considerably underestimates species diversity in cattle while nemabiome analysis is much closer to the picture obtained using necropsies.</p><p id="Par36">The finding of unexpected species at high abundance suggests that our understanding of cattle strongyle communities is very limited. Usually, the focus is on the main species <italic>C. oncophora</italic> and <italic>O. ostertagi</italic> and studies using only morphological differentiation of larvae to the genus level using typically only 100 differentiated larvae clearly underestimates this diversity. The nemabiome method offers a lot of options to improve our knowledge about cattle strongyle. It could easily be used to compare age groups, cows versus their calves in production systems where calves are not weaned early, different treatment schedules and different management systems. Data to address these questions are currently missing but the nemabiome approach offers the tools to address them.</p><p id="Par37">The fact that resistance against both BZs and MLs was found, especially in parallel on the same farm, shows that efficient control strategies need to be designed and information spread to livestock veterinarians and farmers to improve parasite control. There was no obvious difference between these two and the other farms, as increased treatment frequencies or other management practices, that might lead to faster selection for resistance. Currently, resistance levels are low to moderate and there still are options to prevent that cattle farming in Central Europe moves on to a similar situation as in South America, Australia and New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, where high level multi-drug resistance is widely present. Potential strategies could be e.g. (i) implementation of targeted selective treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, (ii) introduction of drug combinations to decelerate selection of resistant parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and (iii) implementation of effective quarantine and management procedures to reduce spread of resistance.</p><p id="Par38">Although the study provides important new insights into the resistance situation in cattle in Northern Germany, there are also some limitations. First to mention is the small numbers of farms that were included. They are in no way representative for German cattle farms, which have very different farm sizes and management practices in different geographic regions. Moreover, the failure to characterize the parasite communities that survived treatment is an obvious limitation. It would be important to identify those species that already evolved resistance. In particular, it would make an important difference if the resistant survivors of treatment are truly cattle adapted species (e.g., <italic>O. ostertagi</italic>, <italic>C. oncophora</italic>) or if there is a small number of typical sheep associated species present that are known to be frequently resistant in Germany<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A similar situation has recently been described in Sudan, where only <italic>H. contortus</italic> survived treatment in cattle while the cattle typical parasite <italic>Haemonchus placei</italic> was eliminated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. It should be evaluated, whether isolation of eggs from a large fecal sample rather than setting up larval cultures would improve the sensitivity of the nemabiome approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">The present study underscores the emergence of AR to MLs and BZs in cattle nematodes in Germany. Insights in pre-treatment species data yielded a surprising diversity that could provide a more refined understanding of species resistance dynamics with continued observation. However, the inter-farm variability throughout statistical analysis and guidelines results in a more difficult assessment of resistance-data and their interpretation throughout the years. Updated FECRT guidelines, though essential for contemporary assessment, complicate result comparability and emphasize the need for methodological consistency in future AR studies. Immediate adoption of preventive measures, like targeted selective treatment and use of drug combinations, is crucial to mitigate resistance spread. This proactive approach, combined with farmer and veterinary education, can help delay high-level AR development, safeguarding cattle health and productivity in the region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
