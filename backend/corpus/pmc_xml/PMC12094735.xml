</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec005"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first 28 days of a newborn&#x02019;s life are crucial, accounting for 47% of all deaths among children under five worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These deaths are often due to illnesses related to inadequate quality care at birth or the lack of skilled care and treatment immediately after birth and during the first few days [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given this high risk of mortality, immediate interventions such as mother and newborn skin-to-skin contact (SSC) are vital for improving newborn health outcomes.</p><p>SSC involves placing the newborn naked (or in a diaper) on the mother&#x02019;s bare chest [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The importance of SSC within the first hour of childbirth is to promote initiation of early breastfeeding, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that SSC should be immediate after birth and be continued uninterrupted for at least 60 minutes to support mothers to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This practice promotes early breastfeeding initiation, improves thermoregulation, and enhances neonatal survival while boosting maternal confidence [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SSC triggers vital reflexes in newborns, especially those born preterm or via cesarean section [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and facilitates the delivery of colostrum, a highly nutritious first milk that contains essential antibodies and immune-boosting substances [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For mothers, SSC supports early placenta expulsion [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], reduces bleeding [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], lowers stress levels [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and strengthens mother-infant bonding, which is mediated by increased oxytocin levels [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, SSC reduces the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia and the need for admission to intensive care units [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recent WHO studies highlight that starting kangaroo mother care (KMC) with SSC and exclusive breastfeeding immediately after birth greatly improves survival rates of preterm or low-weight infants, and could prevent up to 150,000 infant deaths annually [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In Afghanistan, neonatal mortality remains alarmingly high, with 34 deaths per 1,000 live births, primarily due to prematurity (38%) and birth asphyxia (19%) [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite the proven benefits of SSC, its practice may be limited in Afghanistan, likely due to cultural and systemic barriers [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cultural norms emphasizing modesty may deter mothers from engaging in SSC, as exposing the chest is deemed inappropriate [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This cultural pressure can cause SSC to be viewed as inappropriate or unacceptable, limiting its adoption [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The lack of privacy in healthcare facilities, coupled with overcrowded conditions, further limits SSC adoption [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, during home births, the presence of male relatives and lack of privacy inhibit mothers from practicing SSC [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, there may be limited awareness among healthcare providers and mothers about the importance of SSC for newborns, which hinders its widespread adoption [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Challenges within the healthcare system, such as limited resources, lack of training, and high patient-to-provider ratios, further complicate the implementation of SSC [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The 2016 Afghanistan National Maternal and Newborn Health Quality of Care Assessment reported that while 85% of newborns were dried immediately after birth, only 52% were placed in SSC, and just 62% of skilled birth attendants included thermal protection in essential newborn care [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is particularly concerning as hypothermia is a major contributor to neonatal mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Afghanistan is striving to meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of reducing neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030. To reach this goal, the country must substantially improve essential newborn care, including enhancing the practice of SSC. The latest Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2022&#x02013;23 reported that only 15.8% of newborns in Afghanistan receive SSC for thermal care [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This low prevalence underscores the urgent need to investigate the factors influencing SSC and re-evaluate its practice within the country.</p><p>Given Afghanistan&#x02019;s ongoing socio-political instability, including the increasing humanitarian crises and forced repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], maternal and neonatal health attracts enormous attention because they are at the highest risk of morbidities and mortalities in such situations [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this context, SSC within the first hour of delivery is an essential component of maternal and neonatal care [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, research on SSC in Afghanistan remains limited. This study, therefore, seeks to examine the prevalence, and factors associated with SSC in the Afghan context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design and data source</title><p>This cross-sectional study used data from the Afghanistan MICS 2022&#x02013;2023, accessed on June 10, 2024 [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

In terms of age, there was no statistical difference between women who practiced SSC and those who did not. However, statistically significant differences were observed between the groups of women in terms of education, birth order, wealth status, place of delivery, deliveries conducted by type of health provider, cesarean section, ANC visits, access to media, and mobile phone ownership. These differences were in favor of women who practiced SSC compared to women who did not.

The likelihood of SSC was higher in women with primary or higher education, and those with access to media and mobile phones. On the contrary, the likelihood of SSC was lower in women who delivered at home, those who delivered at private clinics or hospitals, women with deliveries conducted by TBAs/CHWs and by relatives/others, rural women, and those who had cesarean sections.</p><p>The SSC prevalence of 32.9% observed in this study is double that reported by the Afghanistan MICS 2022&#x02013;23 [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in our calculation of SSC prevalence, as we excluded women who did not have a live birth in the past 2 years. The prevalence of SSC practice is lower than the 52% reported previously in Afghanistan [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Considering the importance of SSC within the first hour after childbirth and initiation of early breastfeeding, our definition of SSC covered the placement of the naked newborn on the mother&#x02019;s bare chest and initiation of breastfeeding within 60 minutes of the delivery. Nevertheless, our prevalence aligns with findings from other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where SSC rates range from 28.0% to 45.7% [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The low SSC prevalence remains a pressing concern, emphasizing the need for targeted efforts to improve SSC practices in Afghanistan. The factors identified in our study should guide future interventions and policy developments.</p><p>This study showed that SSC prevalence was significantly higher among women with primary or higher education levels compared to those with no formal education. This is consistent with previous research in LMICs, where maternal education has been linked to a better understanding of neonatal care and improved SSC rates [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our findings underscore the critical importance of women&#x02019;s education, particularly in light of the recent restrictions on female education in Afghanistan [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The findings of this study reinforce the need to support continued advocacy for women&#x02019;s education in Afghanistan. Additionally, public health campaigns aimed at raising awareness of SSC among less-educated women are urgently needed.</p><p>We found that women living in rural areas were less likely to practice SSC than those living in urban areas. This finding is consistent with the studies conducted in Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and Nigeria [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Women living in rural areas tend to have poor access to maternal and child healthcare services, which could explain the observed association [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, earlier studies in Afghanistan [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], revealed that rural women are at a disadvantage in accessing maternal and child healthcare services. Therefore, it is essential to design interventions that specifically target this population. Policymakers must prioritize improving healthcare accessibility for rural mothers and newborns to address these inequalities.</p><p>Consistent with findings from other LMICs, our study found a positive association between deliveries at health facilities and SSC [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Access to maternal and neonatal healthcare in public health facilities can improve breastfeeding practices, including early initiation of breastfeeding [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], SSC [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and exclusive breastfeeding [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Compared to private facilities, public healthcare facilities in Afghanistan are more closely aligned with national health policies and more frequently receive support and training from international partners to enhance maternal and newborn health services, including SSC practices [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, we also observed that women whose deliveries were conducted by TBAs/CHWs and relatives/others were less likely to practice SSC. Therefore, increasing access to institutional deliveries may be a necessary policy consideration for improving SSC practices in Afghanistan [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, the findings highlight the need for targeted qualitative improvement initiatives, continuous training of healthcare workers, and public awareness efforts to ensure consistent SSC practices in Afghanistan. In addition to education for healthcare workers, public awareness campaigns may help to educate TBA/CHWs and relatives/others about the importance of SSC which may contribute to consistent SSC practices in Afghanistan.</p><p>Another important finding is the negative association of cesarean sections with SSC practices in our study, which corroborates with findings from previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A plausible reason could be the delay in initiating breastfeeding due to the recovery of the mother post-cesarean section operation. Additionally, the condition of the newborn after a cesarean section can also impact SSC practices [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Newborns delivered via cesarean section may experience distress or other complications, such as respiratory issues, which can necessitate immediate medical attention and further delay SSC [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This finding suggests that targeted interventions to improve SSC for newborns delivered by cesarean section are needed at health facilities, given WHO emphasizes supporting the dyad to engage in SSC practice, regardless of the mode of delivery [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The evidence from a literature review suggests that with appropriate collaboration of healthcare workers in maternity wards, SSC during cesarean section surgery can be effectively implemented [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To improve SSC after cesarean sections, healthcare facilities can assign a dedicated staff member to monitor SSC, ensuring newborn safety and supporting maternal bonding [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Staff education on SSC benefits&#x02014;such as promoting breastfeeding, calming the newborn, and reducing stress&#x02014;can strengthen team commitment [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Adjusting operating room protocols, like positioning the newborn on the mother&#x02019;s chest with warm blankets, can also facilitate SSC [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Institutional policies should make SSC a standard practice to minimize mother-infant separation, aligning with WHO and UNICEF recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Data from LMICs consistently highlight the strong association between maternal mobile ownership and improved newborn care, such as better child feeding and timely immunization [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Similarly, we found that women with access to mobile phones were 1.2 times as likely to practice SSC compared to those with no access to mobile phones. Access to mobile phones likely enhances exposure to health education on breastfeeding and maternal and child health, as seen in other LMICs [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Recent evidence from Afghanistan identifies mobile health (mHealth) technologies as a potential opportunity to promote maternal and newborn health [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, mHealth interventions may potentially enhance SSC practices, and may also contribute to improving other maternal healthcare utilization and newborn care indicators in the country.</p><p>Finally, consistent with studies from sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Nigeria [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], mothers&#x02019; access to media was strongly associated with SSC practice; e.g., women with access to media were about 1.3 times as likely to practice SSC than those with no access to media. Media plays an essential role in disseminating information on newborn care, particularly to less-educated women [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Educational campaigns through various media platforms have proven effective in improving maternal healthcare utilization and SSC practices in LMICs [<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324758.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, expanding media-based education on maternal and child health in Afghanistan should be prioritized.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, recall bias may have affected the accuracy of the data, as women were asked to report events that took place several months ago. Moreover, there were slightly over 1% (131 observations) with responses of &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; for the SSC outcome, and this percent of responses were coded as &#x0201c;no SSC&#x0201d; for the outcome. This could have led to either under or over-reported SSC practice. Second, the MICS did not collect data on mother&#x02019;s knowledge of breastfeeding; thus, we couldn&#x02019;t examine the association between this important predictor and SSC practice. Furthermore, we were unable to account for other important predictors of SSC practice such as healthcare provider training and attitudes, prenatal breastfeeding intention, counseling on breastfeeding during ANC visits, cultural and social norms, maternal mental health, support from family or birth attendants, and previous birth experience. Hence, further research is warranted to examine them.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Health interventions should be designed and implemented to address the low prevalence of SSC in Afghanistan. These interventions should focus on improving access to public healthcare facilities, enhancing educational opportunities for women, training healthcare providers, and promoting the use of media and mobile phones for health education. Special attention should be given to rural women and women who undergo cesarean sections. Prioritizing these groups is essential to increasing SSC rates and improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes in Afghanistan.</p></sec><sec id="sec015" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324758.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Human_Subjects_Research_Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324758.s001.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the UNICEF for allowing us to access and analyze this data.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0324758.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>World Health Organization</collab>.

This study investigates the prevalence and barriers to SSC implementation. The findings are significant and support the continued promotion of SSC, the highlighted interventions are reasonable and feasible.</p><p>Additional references are needed to strengthen the evidence base. (references are needed in lines 86, 91, 200, and 249).</p><p>Lines 211-212 is not needed here, already mentioned more than once in the manuscript. Please delete.</p><p>The discussion section is redundant, and could be condensed to focus on the key findings and implications.</p><p>Were there any differences in the likelihood of SSC based on the gender of the delivering provider (physician, nurse, midwife, etc.)?</p><p>Did mothers who received breastfeeding counseling during pregnancy have a different likelihood of engaging in SSC?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Thank you for the opportunity to peer review this important research regarding skin-to-skin contact and early breastfeeding initiation. The manuscript is written in a concise manner with strong supporting rationale.</p><p>I would like to offer some suggestions for consideration:</p><p>Line 115- Can you add some details about the MIICS such as number of questions and type of questions (i.e. multiple choice, how it was administered)? In which languages was the survey available? Etc.</p><p>Line 117- suggest use the word &#x0201c;live infant&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;child&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 126 - Suggest to analyze adolescents separately (19 years of age and less). This will make the groups more balanced and helpful to identify targeted education interventions. I see in Table TM 4.2 they have broken down age categories, and list as "less than 20" years of age (p. 75) <ext-link xlink:href="https://mics.unicef.org/sites/mics/files/Afghanistan%202022-23%20MICS_English.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://mics.unicef.org/sites/mics/files/Afghanistan%202022-23%20MICS_English.pdf</ext-link></p><p>Line 128- &#x0201c;infant sex&#x0201d; instead of child; &#x0201c;male vs female&#x0201d; instead of boy vs girl</p><p>Line 130 - suggest to spell out cesarean instead of c-section. Also suggest to reword the sentence &#x0201c;(&#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; if the delivery was by cesarean&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 131-132- the &#x0201c;small-size baby&#x0201d; category seems highly subjective. Was there any data on birth weight? Can you report SGA or LBW instead?</p><p>Line 133- What's the reference for these categories of antenatal care visits? Four visits would not be adequate prenatal care as defined by other authors. There is certainly lots of debate about what is considered to be adequate. See recent integrative review <ext-link xlink:href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.13459" ext-link-type="uri">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.13459</ext-link></p><p>In the Unicef data summary, WHO is cited, with a minimum of 8 antenatal care visits recommended. (p. 72) <ext-link xlink:href="https://mics.unicef.org/sites/mics/files/Afghanistan%202022-23%20MICS_English.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://mics.unicef.org/sites/mics/files/Afghanistan%202022-23%20MICS_English.pdf</ext-link></p><p>Suggest reanalyzing the data including the following categories of number of antenatal visits: 4-7, 8 or more.</p><p>Line 138- correction &#x02013; it is chi-square</p><p>Line 146- add citation for STATA. What variables did you use when running the adjusted analysis? You need to add this.</p><p>Line 156- add the word respectively to the end of the sentence ending in SSC.</p><p>Line 168 - will need to recalculate if using different age group categories as previously suggested.</p><p>Line 176- suggest &#x0201c;vaginal&#x0201d; instead of normal deliveries</p><p>Table 1. Suggest to include standardized differences with a standardized difference of 0.10 or greater indicating an imbalance in groups (instead of p-values). Include a legend at the bottom of the table or spell out ANC in table.</p><p>Line 196-197. Suggest to restate the conclusion for women from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. The second quintile is not much higher than the first quintile. The other quintiles were non-significantly associated in the adjusted analysis</p><p>Line 202 &#x02013; Re inclusion criteria of live birth within the last 2 years. Does this finding suggest that there may be an increasing trend in the use of SSC? Have there been any policy changes or public health campaigns that might have contributed to this? Certainly you reported that public clinics/hospitals were supporting this practice more so than private clinics/hospitals. Suggest to elaborate.</p><p>Line 219- Suggest the following sentence &#x0201c;The findings of this study reinforce the need to support continued advocacy for women's education in Afghanistan&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 222- Suggest &#x0201c;Consistent&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;in line with&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 224-225- Would this also be related to receiving health education about the importance of SSC and early breastfeeding initiation?</p><p>Line 245- Suggest to include citation to the International Childbirth Initiative: 12 Steps to Safe and Respectful Mother-Baby Family Maternity Care. <ext-link xlink:href="https://icichildbirth.org/initiative/" ext-link-type="uri">https://icichildbirth.org/initiative/</ext-link></p><p>Line 253- Suggest &#x0201c;WHO emphasizes supporting the dyad to engage in SSC&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 256- Suggest to describe your recommendation in more detail.</p><p>Often transient tachypnea of the newborn can be resolved by placing the newborn on the mother's chest, with close observation of the newborn. Perhaps this is an education component for staff. Someone on the team needs to be assigned to the baby for safety reasons (to ensure safe postnatal adaptation).</p><p>Can also cite the Global Breastfeeding Collective Advocacy Brief. <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.globalbreastfeedingcollective.org/media/376/file/Breastfeeding%20in%20emergency%20situations.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.globalbreastfeedingcollective.org/media/376/file/Breastfeeding%20in%20emergency%20situations.pdf</ext-link></p><p>Line 269- 1.3 times as likely</p><p>Line 28- 1.2 times as likely</p><p>Line 288- Also, prenatal breastfeeding intention is important as well</p><p>I wish you great success in your continued efforts to improve care for mother-baby dyads.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Thank you for the team for their work in producing this manuscript. While I think it&#x02019;s an important question to understand determinants of SSC and that MICS data is high quality data to utilize for this analysis, I do have some questions or concerns regarding the analytical methodology and rationale behind some considerations.</p><p>Primarily, since this utilizes complex survey data, were appropriate weights applied when running the analyses to consider the survey design? With multi-level survey data, descriptive statistical findings will be incorrect without weighting. It was not clear in the methods whether this was done.</p><p>In the methods, it should also be clarified which variables were included in the multivariate analysis (was it all of the variables?) This can help a reader contextualize the findings in understanding what you controlled for. Also, the alpha level should be clarified.</p><p>For the SSC outcome, were there any &#x02018;don&#x02019;t know&#x02019; responses? How were those coded? This is relevant for an outcome susceptible to recall bias.</p><p>What was the rationale behind including only ever-married women? What percentage of mothers are ever-married, and if it is a non-negligible proportion of mothers, might they be qualitatively different from never-married women?</p><p>I agree that you included several key variables in your analysis, but I would have also included skilled birth attendance, which can greatly affect the quality of care of home births. You note this in the introduction, and also note that a substantial proportion of births occurred at home. In addition, you should include more detail or references on the literature review that led to the selection of variables.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the results section, you should focus on the findings relevant to the outcome of SSC. You write about the characteristics of the whole population, but the relevant text here would be comparisons for how these characteristics differ between those with and without SSC.</p><p>I understand the importance of the data in Figure 2, but I am not sure that it is necessary, as it repeats the findings in Table 1.</p><p>For Table 2, since you don&#x02019;t discuss the findings for the univariate models, I would not include those here (perhaps in an appendix). Since the multilevel analysis implies that controlling for other variables are important, it implies that crude estimates are insufficient.</p><p>In line 171-172, the findings should not only compare two wealth quintiles (which is a somewhat arbitrary division of the population), but rather speak more to the relationship between wealth and the outcome, perhaps including findings from the other wealth quintiles.</p><p>On line 85, I think &#x02018;emphasize&#x02019; should be &#x02018;emphasizing&#x02019;. The discussion and introduction were both well written.</p><p>I hope these comments provide useful guidance.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Not only does SSC help with bonding, but SSC can help with thermoregulation, prevent hypoglycemia, and stabilize respiratory effort among many other benefits. These are very important particularly in rural and remote areas, as you mentioned. I would suggest expanding lines 265-266. In addition to education for healthcare workers, public awareness campaigns may help to educate TBA/CHWs and relatives/others about the importance of SSC which may contribute to consistent SSC practices in Afghanistan.</p><p>Re: lines 232-233. Could your findings of a low rate of SSC be related to how you defined SSC? On lines 124-128 you indicated that to be coded a &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; for SSC, mothers must have said yes to 1) baby was placed on bare chest after delivery and 2) breastfeeding initiated within the first hour of birth. Might this explain the difference in prevalence? Do other researchers using the MICS survey data combine those two actions? To me, they are separate. All babies benefit from SSC. For example, a mother may wish to bottle feed her baby, yet the baby would still benefit from SSC.</p><p>I wish you great success in sharing these findings and improving care for women and babies in Afghanistan.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
