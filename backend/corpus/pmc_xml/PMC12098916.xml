The <italic>POLG</italic> gene encodes the 140&#x02009;kDa POL&#x003b3;A subunit, which possesses polymerase, exonuclease, and lyase activities, while <italic>POLG2</italic> encodes the 55&#x02009;kDa POL&#x003b3;B subunit, which enhances DNA binding and processivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In addition, POL&#x003b3; activity requires the TWINKLE DNA helicase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), which stimulates mtDNA synthesis by increasing both TWINKLE helicase and POL&#x003b3; polymerase activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">With over 300 known variants, <italic>POLG</italic> mutations are the leading cause of mitochondrial disease linked to a single nuclear gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The A467T, W748S, G848S, and T251I&#x02013;P587L recessive mutations, along with the Y955C dominant mutation, are the most frequent amino acid changes found in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The clinical phenotypes associated with POL&#x003b3; impairment are highly heterogeneous and include Alpers-Huttenlocher encephalopathy (AHS), ataxia syndromes such as mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO), and autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These diseases manifest across a broad age range, from infancy to late adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, with genotype-phenotype correlations often proving elusive. An additional factor potentially contributing to the variability of <italic>POLG</italic>-related diseases is the role of POL&#x003b3; in regulating the immune response to viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The recessive W748S mutation belongs to the Finnish disease heritage, and both A467T and W748S occur at a frequency of approximately 1 in 50 in Northern European populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These mutations affect different regions of the POL&#x003b3;A protein: A467T is located in the thumb region of the polymerase domain, while W748S resides in the linker region, which connects the proofreading and polymerase domains and plays a crucial role in POL&#x003b3;A&#x02013;POL&#x003b3;B interactions. The precise mechanisms by which individual mutations impair POL&#x003b3; activity and lead to disease remain incompletely understood. In vitro studies indicate that the A467T mutation reduces POL&#x003b3;A&#x02019;s affinity for the POL&#x003b3;B accessory subunit and impairs its catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. W748S, which is commonly associated with the E1143G polymorphism, causes impaired DNA polymerase activity, low processivity, reduced DNA affinity, and slightly weakened interactions with POL&#x003b3;B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The G848S mutation dramatically reduces polymerase activity and decreases DNA affinity compared to the wild-type enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The Y955C mutation affects the catalytic site of POL&#x003b3;A, impairing its interaction with the incoming nucleotide and reducing dNTP incorporation without altering DNA affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Consequently, the POL&#x003b3;<sup>Y955C</sup> holoenzyme is approximately twofold less accurate than POL&#x003b3;<sup>WT</sup>, despite having a functional 3&#x02032;&#x02212;5&#x02032;-exonuclease domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, increasing dNTP concentrations can partially rescue the DNA synthesis activity of the POL&#x003b3;<sup>Y955C</sup>-variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The three most common recessive mutations, A467T, W748S, and G848S, have been observed in various combinations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg/">https://tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg/</ext-link>). These include compound heterozygous combinations such as A467T/W748S, A467T/G848S, and W748S/G848S, as well as homozygous states (A467T/A467T and W748S/W748S). Notably, while homozygous mutations can still result in severe symptoms, they are generally less severe than compound heterozygous combinations, except for G848S in the homozygous state, which has been identified in only four patients, all of whom died within 2 months from birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

This suggests that these regions are more stable in mPol&#x003b3; but more flexible in hPOL&#x003b3;. Notably, the A467 residue is located near the AID subdomain, which shifts by 4&#x02009;&#x000c5; in the human enzyme during the replication-to-error-editing transition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Since the phenotype of the mouse A449T mutation is relatively mild compared to the human A467T variant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g, h</xref>), it is possible that the rigidity of the mouse AID subdomain provides tolerance against the A449T variant.</p><p id="Par29">To further explore species-specific differences, we assembled chimeric POL&#x003b3; complexes using mouse POL&#x003b3;A with human POL&#x003b3;B (mAhB) and vice versa (hAmB), then analyzed their conformations by cryo-EM (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). While R conformers resembled their wild-type counterparts, E conformers revealed key distinctions. The mAhB complex adopted both human-like and mouse-like E conformations, showing that human POL&#x003b3;B can induce a human-like conformation, but the accessory subunit alone does not dictate species differences (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). In contrast, the hAmB complex exclusively adopted the mouse-like E conformer, with some intermediates lacking DNA in the exonuclease site (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The DNA density in this conformation was weaker than in mAhB, suggesting reduced stability. Overall, hPOL&#x003b3;A, when paired with mPOL&#x003b3;B, adopts a conformation more similar to the complete mouse enzyme (mAmB), whereas mPOL&#x003b3;A remains partially resistant to structural influence from hPOL&#x003b3;B during proofreading (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>mPol&#x003b3;B enhances the thermal stability of mPol&#x003b3;A</title><p id="Par30">Since the accessory subunit plays a key role in POL&#x003b3;A stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and structural differences exist between the human and mouse systems, we performed a thermofluor stability assay to assess WT and mutant Pol&#x003b3;A in the presence or absence of Pol&#x003b3;B.

Replacing hPOL&#x003b3;B with mPol&#x003b3;B increased rolling-circle replication, while the reverse swap reduced DNA synthesis.

Our results establish a strong parallelism between human and mouse POL&#x003b3; variants, underscoring the relevance of the mouse model for studying <italic>POLG</italic>-related diseases.</p><p id="Par58">Enzymatic activity assays demonstrated that mutations followed a clear hierarchy of severity in both species: W748S&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;G848S&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;A467T&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;Y955C in humans and W726S&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;A449T&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;G826S&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;Y933C in mice. While the impact of mutations was consistently milder in the mouse system, the overall trend remained conserved, emphasizing the fundamental similarities between the two species. Notably, the A449T mutation was relatively well tolerated in the mouse system compared to its human counterpart.</p><p id="Par59">Combinations of these mutations led to a highly nuanced picture of increasing severity, which for the mouse mutants is: A449T/W726S&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;W726S/G826S&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;A449T/G826S. In our in vivo data, the A449T/W726S mutants were born and had no clinical or molecular phenotype; the A449T/G826S mice were viable and showed partial depletion of mtDNA in all tissues, and the W726S/G826S mice were embryonic lethal. These findings align well with the corresponding human mutations, where patients with compound heterozygous A467T/G848S or W748S/G848S mutations typically exhibit severe early-onset disease. Interestingly, in vitro data suggested that A449T/G826S had a more severe enzymatic defect than W726S/G826S, yet the latter exhibited greater embryonic lethality in vivo. This discrepancy suggests that factors such as POL&#x003b3;A protein stability and expression levels may contribute to disease severity beyond direct enzymatic impairment.</p><p id="Par60">Furthermore, while the dominant Y933C mutant interferes with WT protein function, the recessive mutants do not exert this effect. Interestingly, the G848S mutant exhibits a slight negatively dominant effect in vitro, raising the question of whether carriers of this mutation might develop a very mild mitochondrial phenotype later in life.</p><p id="Par61">Our findings also reveal that all mutant combinations we examined developed clinically relevant phenotypes, either preventing normal embryonic development or causing early postnatal lethality. For the Y933C mutant, we detected homozygous embryos at 7.5 but not at 9.5 days post-coitum, indicating very early embryonic lethality. This observation mirrors findings from knockout mouse models for components of the replication machinery, such as <italic>Twnk</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>, highlighting the critical role of mtDNA replication at this stage of development.</p><p id="Par62">Importantly, mouse models exhibit in general milder phenotypes compared to human syndromes. This discrepancy can be attributed to intrinsic biochemical and structural differences between human and mouse enzymes. Both wild-type and mutant versions of mPol&#x003b3; exhibit higher activity than their human counterparts, with the increased efficiency primarily driven by the mPol&#x003b3;B subunit. Notably, replacing mPol&#x003b3;B with its human counterpart significantly reduces enzyme activity, underscoring the importance of this accessory subunit in polymerase function.</p><p id="Par63">Our cryo-EM studies reveal structural differences between the human and mouse enzymes in the error-editing state. In mice, the distal POL&#x003b3;B subunit and the AID subdomain exhibit less internal motion during the transition from replication to error-editing mode, which provides a structural basis for the milder phenotypic effects observed in mouse models. Consistent with this, Yin and colleagues have shown that the distinct functions of human POL&#x003b3;B are attributed to its dimeric structure, where the monomer closest to POL&#x003b3;A enhances DNA interaction, while the distal monomer increases the reaction rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Our findings extend this model by demonstrating that species-specific conformational differences influence polymerase efficiency and disease mutation tolerance.</p><p id="Par64">This structural rigidity may also explain why the A449T mutation near the AID domain leads to a milder phenotype in mice compared to humans. Additionally, the reduced flexibility of the mouse holoenzyme appears to enhance nucleotide incorporation efficiency, as POL&#x003b3;B plays a critical role in stabilizing POL&#x003b3;A, improving DNA-template engagement, and accelerating catalytic turnover. Indeed, our kinetic measurements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h&#x02013;j</xref>) show that even subtle repositioning of POL&#x003b3;B can significantly enhance polymerase activity, a mechanism that could broadly counteract the functional deficits caused by diverse POL&#x003b3;A mutations. Given the clinical heterogeneity of pathogenic POL&#x003b3;A variants, targeting POL&#x003b3;B could be a promising therapeutic strategy for restoring polymerase function across multiple disease-associated mutations.</p><p id="Par65">Compensatory mechanisms may further contribute to the milder phenotypes observed in mice. For example, in <italic>Mpv17</italic> knockout mice, which display ~95% mtDNA depletion in the liver, mitochondrial transcripts remain relatively stable, being reduced by only 50% compared to wild-type littermates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This highlights how compensatory pathways can help mitigate mtDNA depletion, suggesting that maintaining mtDNA levels above a critical threshold is crucial for preventing disease.</p><p id="Par66">We conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>+/Y933C</italic></sup> heterozygous mice. The human equivalent mutation Y955C, is associated with autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia and muscle weakness, with muscle biopsies showing accumulation of ragged red fibers and multiple mtDNA deletions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Additional symptoms may include Parkinsonism and ovarian failure. A previous mouse model overexpressed the human <italic>Polg</italic><sup><italic>+/Y933C</italic></sup> in heart, leading to reduced mtDNA copy numbers and cardiomyopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In our study, we did not notice cardiomyopathy. Our in vitro experiments showed that adding an excess of Y933C protein exacerbates the molecular phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), which is in agreement with and explains why the overexpression of Y933C results in more severe phenotypes. In contrast, we detected late-onset neurological and neuromuscular phenotypes, including brain vacuolization, astrogliosis, activated microglia, and skeletal muscle fibrosis with altered COX staining. It is worth noting that we did not detect mtDNA deletions, which is a common observation in other mouse models of the mitochondrial replisome. For instance, the &#x02018;deletor&#x02019; mouse, carrying a pathological dominant mutation in the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle associated with multiple deletions in patients, shows very low levels of deletions only from 20 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Similarly, the thymidine phosphorylase knockout mouse, associated with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) disease characterized by depletion and multiple deletions, does not accumulate mtDNA deletions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par67">The absence of deletions in these models may be due to the shorter lifespan of mice compared to humans, limiting the time available for deletions to accumulate. In support of this, the Y955C mutation causes a relatively late-onset disease in patients, suggesting that the defect needs to accumulate over time. Overall, our findings indicate that the shorter lifespan of mice prevents the development of the fully blown phenotype.</p><p id="Par68">In summary, our work establishes mouse models as valuable tools for dissecting POLG-related disease mechanisms while revealing critical species-specific differences in polymerase structure and compensatory pathways that inform therapeutic strategies to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction across mutations</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Animal work</title><p id="Par69">All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with EU Directive 2010/63/EU (authorization from the Italian Ministry of Health: PR474/2021).
