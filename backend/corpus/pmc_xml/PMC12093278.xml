These interventions are not mere wellness tools; rather, they are rigorously evaluated, often Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared, and designed to deliver clinical benefit for specific medical indications&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As of 2025, PDTs have been cleared for a diverse range of conditions, including substance use disorders&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], major depressive disorder&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], insomnia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], type 2 diabetes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and migraine&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These advancements reflect a convergence of evidence-based medicine, regulatory innovation, and digital design.</p><p>Unlike traditional therapeutics that are built upon a foundation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, PDTs draw from multiple scientific disciplines. To systematically study and support their development, it is necessary to articulate a framework that categorizes the types of science that underlie their conception, validation, and integration. PDTs are grounded in four foundational sciences: clinical science, engagement science, regulatory science, and implementation science&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Clinical science focuses on generating evidence through methodologies such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and validated endpoints. Engagement science investigates how digital interventions sustain user participation, adherence, and behavior change. Regulatory science explores the design and application of evaluation frameworks for software as a medical device (SaMD), including pathways such as 510(k) and De Novo. These regulatory structures continue to evolve in response to the unique characteristics of software-based interventions [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Implementation science ensures that these innovations move beyond controlled environments into real-world settings, accounting for workflows, payer coverage, equity, and scalability.</p><p>While these domains are often referenced in PDT literature, their relative representation in published research remains poorly understood. Most studies focus on clinical efficacy, but it is unclear how often engagement, regulatory, or implementation concerns are explicitly addressed. The lack of visibility into these foundational components presents a gap for strategic research investment, regulatory alignment, and commercial readiness.</p><p>The objective of this review is to evaluate the representation of clinical, engagement, regulatory, and implementation sciences in the published literature on PDTs. By applying bibliometric and thematic analysis methods to PubMed-indexed articles, we aim to identify dominant trends, topic areas, and gaps across these foundational domains.&#x000a0;By doing so, we aim to clarify which areas are well-represented in the literature and which remain underexplored, offering guidance for future scholarship and development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Data sources and selection criteria</p><p>A structured search of PubMed was conducted using the terms &#x0201c;prescription digital therapeutic&#x0201d;&#x000a0;and &#x0201c;prescription digital therapeutics.&#x0201d;&#x000a0;The search spanned from the earliest available to May 4, 2025. Articles were included if they discussed PDTs, clinical trials, real-world evidence, regulatory submissions, or implementation. Metadata including PubMed ID (PMID), title, authors, journal, year, digital object identifier (DOI), and author affiliations were exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format, while full abstracts were collected in a separate text file. Country of first author affiliation and institutional setting (academic, clinical, industry, regulatory, and others) were manually extracted from PubMed records to supplement bibliometric analysis. Abstracts were cleaned and matched to metadata using custom scripts.</p><p>Bibliographic parsing and cleaning</p><p>Using heuristic rules and regular expression-based parsing, we extracted the longest informative paragraph in each entry as the presumed abstract. Copyright lines, conflict of interest disclosures, and redundant identifiers were excluded. The dataset was manually reviewed to ensure alignment between titles, abstracts, and PMIDs.</p><p>Topic modeling</p><p>To identify latent themes, we applied nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix generated from the abstract corpus&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We selected NMF&#x000a0;for topic modeling based on its strong interpretability in sparse textual datasets. Further, we identified five components based on coherence and interpretability. Top keywords from each topic were extracted and used to assign preliminary themes.</p><p>Domain classification framework</p><p>Each abstract was manually or semiautomatically classified into one or more of the following foundational scientific domains based on keyword heuristics (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].&#x000a0;Clinical science pertains to the generation of evidence for safety, efficacy, and outcomes using methods such as clinical trials and validated symptom scales. Engagement science encompasses behavior change strategies, patient adherence, therapeutic alliance, and interaction design. Regulatory science involves FDA clearance, SaMD classification, labeling, and regulatory pathways, including De Novo and 510(k). Implementation science addresses the adoption of PDTs into routine care, health system workflows, payer coverage, and considerations of health equity. The domain classification framework was developed to organize and quantify the representation of core scientific disciplines supporting PDT development. This model allowed systematic tagging of each article by foundational domain to reveal trends and gaps. Keyword matching was implemented in Python (v3.13.3; Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE). Each abstract was tagged with one or more domains based on keyword presence. Ambiguous or borderline cases were resolved through manual review.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Foundational Domain Classification Framework</title><p>This author-created table defines the four core scientific domains used to classify prescription digital therapeutics (PDT) literature.

In total, these classifications resulted in 292 article-level domain assignments across the 61 articles, reflecting that most studies addressed multiple domains. Most papers, 32 (52%), engaged with two domains, while 18 (30%) addressed three. A minority of four (6%) represented just one domain.</p><p>Domain co-occurrence</p><p>A domain co-occurrence heatmap (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) revealed strong alignment between clinical and engagement science, which co-occurred in 45 unique articles. Off-diagonal cells in the matrix represent how many articles were tagged with both domains, while diagonal cells reflect how many article-level domain assignments were made to each domain individually. For example, clinical science was assigned in 98/292 (33.6%) instances across the dataset, engagement in 84/292 (28.8%), regulatory in 67/292 (22.9%), and implementation in 43/292 (14.7%). Because most articles were assigned to multiple domains, total counts in the matrix exceed the number of unique articles.

Specifically, seven (12%) covered all four foundational domains, 18 (30%) addressed three domains, 32 (52%) addressed two, and only four (6%) were confined to a single domain. This distribution suggests that while interdisciplinary integration is occurring, few studies comprehensively incorporate all four foundational sciences.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>This study reveals an asymmetrical landscape in the published literature on PDTs. Clinical validation remains the dominant focus, likely reflecting the emphasis on evidence-based approval pathways and the necessity of demonstrating benefit through trials. Engagement science also appears frequently&#x000a0;but is often addressed in superficial terms such as user adherence or retention, without reference to deeper theoretical models such as the capability, opportunity, motivation, behavior (COM-B) framework [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; self-determination theory [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; or therapeutic alliance [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Regulatory science is moderately represented and typically limited to describing FDA clearance, labeling, or SaMD categorization. However, there is minimal discussion of how regulatory precedents shape product design, labeling, usability, and trial endpoints, despite FDA guidance that increasingly accounts for the distinct lifecycle and risks of digital therapeutics [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Implementation science remains the least represented domain, despite its central role in enabling reimbursement, provider uptake, and integration into clinical workflows. To accelerate progress, future PDT studies should embed engagement and implementation strategies early in the design process and report on real-world uptake outcomes. Funding agencies and journal editors could also help rebalance the field by prioritizing research that goes beyond clinical efficacy to include usability, equity, and health system readiness.</p><p>Future research should more thoroughly incorporate engagement and implementation perspectives from the earliest stages of product development. For researchers, this may involve including digital behavior change frameworks and implementation outcome measures in study design. For developers, it means ensuring that regulatory rationale, usability testing, and workflow compatibility are documented as thoroughly as clinical endpoints. For payers and regulators, establishing expectations for implementation reporting and equity assessments could foster broader uptake and transparency.</p><p>The gaps identified also point to opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. As the digital therapeutics field grows, studies that bring together regulatory experts, behavioral scientists, implementation researchers, and clinical trialists are likely to be more impactful and aligned with real-world needs. Bridging these domains is essential to fulfilling the promise of PDTs.</p><p>This analysis also has implications for the digital therapeutics industry. A more balanced foundation of supporting sciences can enhance credibility, payer trust, and patient benefit. Addressing implementation gaps, for example, could facilitate reimbursement decisions and support integration into formularies. Similarly, articulating regulatory precedents and aligning on labeling conventions could accelerate market entry and reduce uncertainty.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, it relies on PubMed-indexed abstracts, which may not capture the full scope of methodological detail, especially regarding engagement, regulatory, and implementation considerations that may appear only in the full text. Second, our keyword-based classification framework, while systematic and informed by prior domain definitions, may undercount or overcount domain representation due to variation in terminology or phrasing. Third, the topic modeling approach reflects thematic clusters based on word co-occurrence patterns and does not guarantee conceptual exclusivity or completeness. Fourth, author institutional affiliations were classified manually based on PubMed listings, which may not always clearly reflect primary professional roles or dual affiliations. Fifth, the dataset is restricted to English-language, PubMed-indexed publications. Although this may bias general bibliometric studies toward high-income country research, the risk is mitigated in this review due to its focus on US&#x000a0;FDA-cleared PDTs, which are primarily developed, trialed, and published within PubMed-indexed literature. Last, this study followed bibliometric review conventions rather than systematic review guidelines such as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which are more appropriate for meta-analyses of clinical trials. These limitations may bias the representation of foundational scientific domains in the PDT literature and should be addressed in future research using more comprehensive datasets and full-text analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This bibliographic analysis and review provide&#x000a0;the first structured analysis of how foundational scientific domains (clinical, engagement, regulatory, and implementation) are represented in the published literature on FDA-cleared PDTs. Clinical and engagement sciences dominate, while regulatory and implementation aspects remain underexplored, despite their essential roles in bringing PDTs to market and into clinical practice.</p><p>A major strength of this study is the application of a structured domain framework and topic modeling to classify and interpret the literature, offering a replicable method for future analyses.
