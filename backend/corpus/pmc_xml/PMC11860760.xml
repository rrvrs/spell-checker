Though neurons across frontal cortical-basal ganglia circuits have been repeatedly shown to represent decision-related parameters, it is unclear whether and how this information is coordinated. To address this question, we performed large-scale single-unit recordings simultaneously across 5 medial/orbital frontal and basal ganglia regions as rats decided whether to pursue varying reward payoffs available at different effort costs. Single neurons encoding combinations of decision variables (reward, effort, and choice) were represented within all recorded regions. Coactive cell assemblies, ensembles of neurons that repeatedly coactivated within short time windows (&#x0003c;25&#x000a0;ms), represented the same decision variables despite the members often having diverse individual coding properties. Together, these findings demonstrate a multi-level encoding structure for cost-benefit computations where individual neurons are coordinated into larger assemblies that can represent task variables independently of their constituent components.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Neurons were recorded across the frontal-basal ganglia network during cost-benefit decisions</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Firing rate codings of reward, effort, and choice were temporally and spatially heterogeneous</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">An emergent temporal code across these neurons is independent of the rate representations</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Rate and temporal codes may support parallel computations within the same circuit</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>H&#x000e4;rmson et&#x000a0;al. show that single neurons and coactive assemblies across the medial cortico-basal ganglia circuit encode combinations of reward, effort, and choice during cost-benefit decision-making.

A common proposition is that single-neuron responses reflect and contribute to modular processing across specialized brain areas that arrive at a behavioral output through serial information transmission.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In sensorimotor tasks, information from the cortex is transferred reliably and topographically to connected areas of the striatum.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> However, this need not be the case for cost-benefit calculations, where information presented over different timescales needs to be integrated and then utilized to regulate subsequent choice.</p><p id="p0040">One mechanism to achieve such distributed processing is the formation and expression of co-firing assemblies, whereby groups of neurons repeatedly fire action potentials within a short latency (10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;ms) of each other.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> These assemblies have been demonstrated to play a vital role in population-level representations in areas such as the hippocampus.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Short-timescale coincident spiking can effectively be read out by downstream neural populations on timescales that are optimal for inducing plasticity.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Despite the potential of co-firing assemblies to coordinate neural activity underlying cost-benefit decision-making, it is not clear whether they are formed in cortico-basal ganglia circuits and, if so, whether they can encode relevant variables. Determining this requires simultaneous large-scale recording of neurons across the network during cost-benefit decision-making, which hitherto has rarely been conducted.</p><p id="p0045">To address these questions, we performed simultaneous recordings of single neurons across interconnected frontal and basal ganglia regions&#x02014;anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial/ventral orbitofrontal cortex (MO/VO), dorsal medial striatum (DMS), ventral pallidum (VP), and subthalamic nucleus area (STA)&#x02014;while rats evaluated whether to accept or reject cost-benefit offers. Individual neurons across the entire network encoded combinations of reward, effort, and choice, with a particularly pronounced phasic and multiplexed signal in DMS and STA. Importantly, co-firing assemblies were also detected within and across all cortico-basal ganglia sites encoding the three main decision parameters independently from the individual firing rates of the member neurons. Remarkably, these often included individual neurons whose firing rates signaled a parameter <italic>different</italic> from the tuning of the overall assembly. Co-firing assemblies thus coordinate individual neurons with wide-ranging coding properties and give rise to emergent representations that can mediate cost-benefit computations at the network level.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Choice on a novel rat accept/reject cost-benefit choice paradigm is shaped by anticipated costs and benefits</title><p id="p0050">To elicit a trade-off between rewards and associated effort costs, we designed a novel cost-benefit task inspired by foraging scenarios. Rats chose whether to pursue or forgo a reward available at the other end of a linear corridor based on its size and the set level of effort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A; <xref rid="sec9" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Trials were initiated by poking and holding their noses in an initiation port (&#x0201c;pre-cue&#x0201d;) while an auditory cue was presented (&#x0201c;offer&#x0201d;), which signaled the size of the available reward on that trial (4 levels: nil, small, medium, and large; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Once the port light illuminated (&#x0201c;go cue&#x0201d;), rats could then leave the port (&#x0201c;action&#x0201d;) and decide to either (1) pursue the offered reward by running to the opposite end of the corridor (&#x0201c;accept&#x0201d;) or (2) forgo the offered reward by refraining from entering the corridor (&#x0201c;reject&#x0201d;). In both cases, trials were followed by an intertrial interval (ITI), after which a new trial could be initiated. The effort cost of pursuing the reward was manipulated by placing different numbers of barriers in the corridor, fixed across blocks of &#x0223c;20 trials (3 levels: low, moderate, and high; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C) in a pseudo-random order over the recording day.

To this end, the mean expression of the coactivity pattern was modeled as a weighted linear sum of reward, effort, and choice (<xref rid="sec9" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Strikingly, nearly half (48%) of all identified assemblies had a significant degree of selectivity for the prospective reward, current effort cost, and choice, either individually or conjointly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>H). Several distinct assemblies identified in a single recording session could be found encoding the same variable (e.g., <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S8</xref>), suggesting that the coactivity that encodes canonical variables was not a global brain-wide phenomenon but instead resulted from the co-firing of distinct combinations of units.

Jittering the spike trains (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S9</xref>) preserved the mean firing rates over trials and almost all rate coding within the window of analysis (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S10</xref>) but substantially disrupted coding at the level of the assembly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>I).</p><p id="p0120">We next sought to determine if the coactivity and assembly encoding we observed here were a result of the locking of units to task events. In order to investigate this, for each neuron, we shuffled spike trains across trials (for further details, see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S9</xref>) of the same level of reward, effort, or choice outcome.

In these cases where many neurons lock their spiking to an external event, the formation of assemblies cannot be dissociated from event-related firing.

</p></sec><sec id="sec9.2"><title>Experimental model and study participant details</title><p id="p0275">All procedures were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986) and its associated guidelines. We used 12 group-housed Lister Hooded naive male rats (Charles River, U.K.) weighing 300-390&#x000a0;g at the beginning of training. Rats were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.). During testing periods, rats were food restricted to a target weight range of 85&#x02013;90% of their free-feeding weight. Water was available <italic>ad libitum</italic> in their home cages. Following implantation with multielectrode drives, animals were singly housed.</p></sec><sec id="sec9.3"><title>Method details</title><sec id="sec9.3.1"><title>Behavioral apparatus</title><p id="p0280">The operant box was designed in Fusion360 (Autodesk) and consisted of two 17.6cm diameter custom-designed 3D-printed plastic semi-circular arenas, connected by a 130&#x000a0;cm-long Perspex corridor with walls on either side. The corridor had 6 equidistantly placed infra-red (IR) light-gates to register the rats' position and 3 equidistant slots for barriers to increase the travel cost between the ends of the corridor. Each arena housed a custom designed 3D-printed plastic nose-poke and reward port, positioned symmetrically on either side. Nose-poke and reward ports contained a infrared light-gate and a white LED house light. Reward ports were connected with 20-mg food pellet dispensers (Med-associates) fitted outside the walls of the arenas using medical-grade silicone tubing. Each reward port housed a moveable floor that was able to obstruct the port. The electronics were controlled by a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller that ran on custom-written firmware. The apparatus was lit using far-red LEDs to minimise visibility during training and testing.</p></sec><sec id="sec9.3.2"><title>Behavioral paradigm</title><p id="p0285">Rats initiated trials by poking and holding in the nose-poke port of the starting arena ("pre-cue"). The starting arena was randomly allocated on the 1st trial. After a pre-cue period (0.3&#x02013;0.4s), an auditory cue ("offer") was again presented from the distal end of the apparatus to signal the available reward at end of the track from where they initiated. The available reward was pseudo-randomly varied trial-by-trial (4 sizes: nil, low, mid, high, corresponding to zero, one, three or six 20mg sucrose pellets), signaled by a distinct auditory cue. The cue-reward associations were counter-balanced across subjects. Rats were required to maintain nose-poking for another 0.6&#x02013;0.8s until the onset of a visual Go cue, signaled by a white light LED. Premature exiting of the nose-poke either during the pre-cue or offer period would elicit a 5-s error time-out, indicated by a flashing house-light in the nose-poke, followed by a 5s ITI. If rats exited prematurely during the auditory cue, the same cue would be repeated on the next nose-poke attempt. A grace period of up to 100ms during nose-poking - where nose-poke exits did not count toward an error - allowed for minor adjustments in body position. To accept the offer, rats needed to enter the corridor (cross a light-gate 24cm away from the arena) within a time window; otherwise, that offer was rejected. The cost of pursuing reward was pseudo-randomly varied across blocks of 17&#x02013;23 trials (3 levels: low, moderate, high), implemented using varying numbers of barriers (0&#x02013;2 or 1&#x02013;3 in implanted or non-implanted animals, respectively) in the corridor. The barriers were 0.5&#x000a0;cm thick and were 12&#x000a0;cm and 18&#x000a0;cm tall at their lowest and highest points respectively, with a 45-degree slant mid-way between to generate a more effortful zigzag of running between the ends of the corridor.</p></sec><sec id="sec9.3.3"><title>Behavioral training</title><p id="p0290">Rats were handled daily for a week prior to training.

The offer cue was played until the animal made an entry into the distal reward port. Next, the reward port LED was activated for a 1s pre-reward delay, followed by delivery of the reward corresponding to offer cue. 2.5s after reward delivery, the moveable reward port floor was elevated in that same arena, resulting in the blocking of that port to indicate that reward would not be available there on the next trial. After the rats had reached a criterion of initiating 120 trials in &#x000a3; 60&#x000a0;min, rats were taken to step 3.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>(3)</label><p id="p0305"><underline>In step 3</underline> ("nose-poke training"), in v1, rats had to learn to sustain a nose-poke with a jittered 1-1.2s length in order to elicit the offer cue. If rats sustained a 0.3&#x02013;0.4s-long nose-poke ("pre-cue"), one of 4 auditory cues would be played. Importantly, rats were not free to leave until another 0.6&#x02013;0.8s later ("offer") once a visual Go cue, signaled by a white light LED in the nose-poke port, had turned on. This was implemented to ensure a movement-free period following offer presentation for electrophysiological analyses. The pre-cue nose-poke requirement was incremented from 0.1s to 0.4s in increments of 25&#x000a0;ms after every successful trial. Once animals had learned to sustain successful pre-cue nose-pokes, the cue nose-poke requirement was incremented from 0.0s to 0.8s in steps of 20&#x000a0;ms after every successful trial. Once animals had learned to complete 120 trials with the full 1.2s nose-poke requirement, jitters of 0.1s ("pre-cue") and 0.2s ("offer") were introduced. To allow for small changes in body posture that may have caused the nose-poke sensor to stop registering an entry, a 0.1s grace period was introduced which did not result in a nose-poke error. Importantly, if a nose-poke was interrupted for more than 0.1s (the grace period) during the "offer" window, the same offer cue would be repeated during the next trial. This was not an intentional feature, but rather the side effect of using a pre-determined sequence of offers. Once rats had reached a criterion of initiating 120 trials within 60&#x000a0;min, they were taken on to step 4.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0025"><label>(4)</label><p id="p0310"><underline>In step 4</underline> ("barrier training") rats needed to nose-poke to elicit offer cues as outlined previously, but now needed to additionally learn to scale barriers when traversing the corridor between the arenas. Barriers were added in one by one in blocks of 40 trials, starting from 1 barrier and going up to a maximum of 3 barriers. Once rats had successfully managed to complete 120 trials within 60&#x000a0;min, they were taken on to step 5.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0030"><label>(5)</label><p id="p0315"><underline>In step 5</underline> ("final training for non-implanted animals") <italic>r</italic>ats were required to either accept or reject a distal reward offer available at the other side of the corridor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). After the onset of the Go cue, to accept the offer, rats needed to enter the corridor within a 3s time window as determined by a light-gate placed near the border of the arena; otherwise, that offer is rejected. The effort cost which was fixed across blocks of &#x0223c;20 trials (3 levels: low&#x000a0;&#x02013; 1 barrier; moderate&#x000a0;&#x02013; 2 barriers; high&#x000a0;&#x02013; 3 barriers; Table&#x000a0;3). Upon corridor entry, they were allowed a further 5s to traverse the corridor and reach the distal reward port. To ensure that animals did not suffer an additional time cost by choosing to pursue an offer on accepted trials, we sought to match the duration of accepted and rejected trials. This was done by shortening the ITIs on &#x02018;accept&#x02019; trials on each given recording day by the previous day&#x02019;s cohort median reward magazine entry latency (the interval between Go cue onset and reward magazine entry on accepted trials).

The implant was comprised of a lid which housed a 128-pin connector designed for Intan 64-channel head-stages (Intan Technology), a plastic corpus that housed the electrode movement mechanisms, glass tubing and a base. All components were assembled in house. For assembly, the elements of the corpus were first 3D printed and post-processed with UV radiation and propanol. Second, holes were drilled in the corpus to allow threading of electrode wires and the driving mechanisms. Third, driving support mechanisms were created using metal rods, plastic shuttles and screws. Fourth, glass tubing was introduced into the driving mechanisms as electrode supports. Fifth, strands of 50-&#x003bc;m diameter tungsten wire (California Fine Wire) were twisted and heated to create 4- and 6-strand electrodes (tetrodes and hextrodes, respectively). Sixth, these were threaded through the glass tubing and the rest of the implant corpus. Seventh, ground wire stubs (connected to ground wires on the animal during surgery, see below) were introduced into the implant using a dedicated set of stationary holes. Finally, the implant was sealed and the electrodes cut to length by hand.</p><p id="p0335">Three of the subjects (gh001, gh009, gh010) reported here received an implant that targeted all 5 regions, whereas one subject (oh011) received a modified drive without the VP electrodes (Electrode table).

Wherever neurons were detected on days where the anatomical localisation of the electrode tip suggested we were either out of the brain near a target structure or in a nearby white matter tract, but that electrode trajectory was consistent with being in the target areas, we presumed that the error was in the estimate of the electrode tip and these cells were included in the analyzed cell yield for that area.

A number of quality control steps were used in order to verify the single units identified by KiloSort2. Each neuron was manually inspected in Phy, and multiunits were excluded. Single units were first screened by the shape of the waveform. Only neurons with a stable waveform with spikes present across the entire recording block were included in further analysis. Next, we inspected the ISIs of each single unit to ensure that a clear refractory period was present. Cluster cutting was used to remove any contamination by electrical artifacts. Finally, the cross correlation between single units and their waveforms were used to merge those single units with a matching waveform and shared refractory period. Finally, single units with a firing rate less than &#x0003c;0.1Hz were excluded. No multi-units were used in the reported set of analyses.

Spike trains were taken from full trials (on a trial-by-trial basis) on the linear track after cue onset. That is, for accepted trials spike trains were taken from cue onset to 2s after reward delivery. On rejected trials, where the animal did not enter the corridor, spike trains were taken from cue onset to cue offset when the window in which rats could enter the corridor and receive a reward had elapsed.

This is an analytical result from random matrix theory, which bounds the magnitude of the eigenvalues from PCA that can occur due to chance. Principal components with eigenvalues above the upper limit of the bound set by the Marcenko-Pastur law were classified as significant.

PCA also artificially constrains identified assembly patterns to be orthogonal to each other, meaning that a high weighting of a neuron in one assembly pattern limits the weighting of that neuron is subsequently identified patterns. Finally, PCA is only based on pairwise correlations and cannot identify higher order correlations. However, if ICA was applied directly to the z-scored binned spike count matrix, one could identify the same number of assembly patterns as there are neurons. This could result in the extraction of spurious patterns. To address these caveats, ICA is applied to the z-scored binned spike count matrix following dimensionality reduction using PCA.

The general strategy utilized in the linear regressions was to take an epoch in each trial, determine the value of variables such as the spike rate or the mean coactivity in this epoch and use this to predict reward, effort or choice outcome across trials, or vice versa.</p><p id="p0525">For identifying coding ensembles (as in single units), the mean expression strength of an ensemble was calculated from an interval starting with offer cue onset and ending either 0.9s before corridor entry (adjusted corridor entry) or, in instances where the animal did not enter the corridor, the median duration taken for corridor entry on that recording session less 0.9s (see above, in Defining the decision window). This wide bin was necessary because co-incident spiking in shorter time windows was a relatively rare phenomenon and would have precluded meaningful identification of co-active ensembles. The mean expression strength was then fitted as the dependent variable in a linear regression with reward, effort and choice outcome as independent regressors. Significance was determined by comparing the CPD of reward, effort and choice to that of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="M12" altimg="si12.gif"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>95</mml:mn><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> percentile of the null distribution where reward and effort levels or choice outcomes were shuffled across trials. After identifying ensembles with significant modulation by the level of reward, effort or choice, we probed the time course of this modulation. This was achieved by fitting regression models with reward, effort and choice outcome as independent variables to the smoothed assembly pattern expression strength at different time points. Smoothing was achieved by convolution with a Gaussian with a standard deviation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="M13" altimg="si13.gif"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mo linebreak="goodbreak" linebreakstyle="after">/</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and a duration of 2s. The convolved signal was aligned in time with task events such that only coactivity preceding a given time point was available to models. The CPD for reward, effort and choice was compared to that of linear models fitted to the assembly pattern expression strength in jittered spike trains.</p><p id="p0530">The expression strength of assembly patterns was calculated again as part of 2 analytical controls (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S9</xref> for more details).<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0030"><list-item id="u0080"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0535">where the spike trains were jittered randomly in the range of &#x02212;250ms&#x02013;250ms.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0085"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0540">where the spike train of each neuron was randomly shuffled across trials with either the same level of reward, effort or choice outcome.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0545">Simple linear regression or logistic regression with decision variables (i.e., reward and effort level and choice outcome) as the dependent variable and mean assembly coactivity over the decision window as the independent variable was used to evaluate the ability of assembly activity to predict decision variables via R<sup>2</sup> (linear regression-for reward and effort level) or McFadden&#x02019;s pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> (logistic regression-for choice outcome).</p><p id="p0550">We tested the relationship between the coactivity change across levels of canonical variables and related this to the change in firing rate of member neurons across the levels of the same variable. We wanted to exclude the possibility that increases in coactivity were trivially a result of increases in the firing rate of member neurons. An example of this would be an assembly that&#x02019;s coactivity increases with increasing reward driven entirely by more spiking across member neurons as the reward increased. Using the same window described above, for each assembly we modeled coactivity using multiple linear regression with reward, effort and choice as independent variables. We then stored the beta values from multiple linear regressions, representing the change in coactivity that occurs after increasing each of the canonical variables by one level. In the instance of choice, the beta coefficient represents the change in coactivity from a reject to accepted trial. We carried out the same procedure for each firing rate of each of the member neurons of each assembly. That is, we modeled the firing rate of these neurons using multiple linear regression with reward, effort and choice as independent variables. Again, we stored the beta variables from the linear regressions, representing the change in firing rate that occurs with an increase in each of the canonical variables by one level. For choice, the beta variable represents the change in firing rate from a rejected to an accepted trial. We then asked how much variance in the change in coactivity across levels of a canonical variable (using the coactivity-variable beta for each assembly) could be explained by the mean change in firing rate across member neurons (the mean of the firing rate-variable beta values across all of the member units of the assembly).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Additional resources</title><p id="p0250">Data was analyzed using the following open-source python packages/functions listed below (<xref rid="sec9.1" ref-type="sec">key resources table</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adam</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Leff</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bays</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Draganski</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Husain</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dopamine reverses reward insensitivity in apathy following globus pallidus lesions</article-title><source>Cortex</source><volume>49</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>1292</fpage><lpage>1303</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cortex.2012.04.013</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22721958</pub-id>

<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Table&#x000a0;S1. Direction encoding during the decision window</title><p>We regressed reward, effort, and side of the available reward (left/right) on neuronal firing rates on accepted trials during the original decision window used in fig. 2f. Neurons encoding the side of the reward were ubiquitous across the targeted frontal-basal ganglia circuit (all proportions &#x0003e;26%, all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05, one-sided binomial test against a chance rate of 5% with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple tests). To clarify whether including the side of the reward led to a reduction in the proportion of reward/effort coding neurons in the DMS and STA, we compared the prevalence of reward and effort coding neurons between this model and the original firing rate model (fig. 2f) in all areas. We found that the original proportions were preserved (all |z|&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1.17, p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.244, two-sided z-test of proportions) except for reward-encoding neurons in the STA (36.25% in the original vs. 29.44% in the current model: z&#x000a0;= &#x02212;2.08, p&#x000a0;= .038, two-sided z-test of proportions)</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material>

Nose-poke exit latency encoding between go cue onset up to nose-poke exit</title><p>To examine coding of latencies to respond, we focused on encoding of nose-poke exit latencies in the interval between Go cue onset up to nose-poke exit (see latency distributions depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;S1f). A significant proportion of neurons in all structures coded for this variable (all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05, one-sided binomial test against a chance rate of 5% with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple tests). Including this variable in the regression models revealed largely preserved multiplexing tendencies compared to the original model (fig. 2f) with minimal overlap of units encoding nose-poke exit latencies and other variables (all multiplexing units &#x0003c;6%)</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material>
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc4"><caption><title>Table&#x000a0;S3. Nose-poke error encoding during the offer window</title><p>To examine premature nose-poke exit encoding (labeled cue nose-poke exit in this table), we focused exclusively on the Offer window (the interval between the onset of the offer cue and the Go cue) and asked whether the outcome of this interval&#x02013; either a successful nose-poke or a premature nose-poke exit - was encoded in the firing rates of individual neurons, along with the other canonical decision variables. It is important to note that offer windows with successful nose-poke attempts were repeats of the same reward offer as encountered on any previous failed nose-poke attempt(s). Premature exits were coded by significant proportions of units in each area (all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.029, one-sided binomial test against a chance rate of 5% with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple tests). Compared to the original regression model (fig. 2f), this analysis demonstrated a decrease in the proportion of choice-coding units in all regions except the VP (|z|&#x000a0;= 0.90, p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.050; all other |z|&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2.69, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.006, z-test of proportions) - however it is important to note that there was relatively little choice coding during the offer window (fig. 3b). There was very little evidence of multiplexing of the two variables (all premature exit and choice multiplexing units &#x0003c;6%), suggesting that these behaviors have different underlying encoding patterns</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc4.xlsx"/></supplementary-material>
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc5"><caption><title>Table&#x000a0;S4. Run velocity encoding proportions</title><p>To examine how many neurons encoded running speed, we extracted the averaged head movement velocities from our DeepLabCut-processed video dataset during the interval between nose-poke exit and either reward magazine entry on accepted trials or the end of the action period on rejected trials. As expected, the velocity distributions between the two trial types were meaningfully different (fig. S4e, t<sub>8287.63</sub>&#x000a0;= &#x02212;168.95, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001, two-sample student t-test). Again, significant proportions of single units in all areas encoded both the canonical decision variables as well as velocity (all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001, one-sided binomial test against a chance rate of 5% with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple tests). However, in this model reward encoding was less frequent than in the original model (|z|&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2.49, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.012 in MO/VO, DMS and STA; |z|&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1.36, p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.050 in the ACC and VP), possibly owing increased temporal separation from the onset of the offer cue where coding was the strongest. By contrast, effort and choice coding was much more pronounced in this time interval (|z|&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2.06, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.039 in all except the VP; VP: z&#x000a0;= 1.66, p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.050). Velocity was encoded by more than 33% of units in each area, with variable but mostly small degrees of multiplexing (up to 9%) with the canonical decision variables</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc5.xlsx"/></supplementary-material>
