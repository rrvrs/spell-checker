Many clinical trials have investigated the effects of PNE either as a standalone intervention or embedded within a more complex care package, with mixed results. A range of research methods have been used to explore the inconsistent effects of PNE. Together they (i) identify significant shortcomings and limitations of PNE and (ii) raise the possibility that gaining a broadly scientifically accurate understanding of &#x0201c;how pain works&#x0201d; may be critical for subsequent pain and disability improvements. Both learnings strongly suggest that we need to do better. Extensive research incorporating several interest-holders has led to updated content and language and criticisms of both are addressed. The method of PNE has also been updated, with integration of educational frameworks, teaching strategies and tactics, patient resources and clinical tools that all aim to promote the likelihood that patients will learn key concepts and operationalise them to improve their pain, function and quality of life. Pain Science Education is used to differentiate the new approach from PNE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic pain</kwd><kwd>back pain</kwd><kwd>pain education</kwd><kwd>constructivism</kwd><kwd>explain pain</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Health &#x00026; Medical Research Council of Australia</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn001">1178444</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Medical Research Future Fund Clinical Trials Activity</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn003">2023048</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Wilson Foundation</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The content of this education focussed on contemporary understandings of neurophysiology of pain in general, and chronic pain in particular. It first emerged as &#x0201c;intensive neurophysiology education&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and has become best known as &#x0201c;pain neuroscience education&#x0201d;, or PNE (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Over 35 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested it, against active, sham and no intervention/usual care comparators. About a decade ago, a mixed picture of evidence from these RCTs was emerging; health care professionals (HCPs) were sometimes reporting that PNE is too difficult to do; patients participating in PNE were reporting feeling invalidated. Clinical audit data however, were suggesting that if PNE is effective in changing understanding, then pain and disability reductions would tend to follow. These factors led to substantial changes in content and educational strategy and the development of patient education resources, tools, tactics and guides. The interdisciplinary, international PETAL Collaboration renamed these newer versions &#x0201c;pain science education&#x0201d;, for two reasons: (i) to differentiate, from PNE, patient education that incorporates these developments in content and method, and (ii) to reflect that wider range of scientific knowledge (rather than just &#x0201c;neuroscience&#x0201d;) that is now included. Here we aimed to provide the historical context of PNE, outline the impetus for, and evidence by which, changes in content and delivery strategies have emerged, provide the scientific developments that are driving progress in patient pain education, discuss criticisms of the content, and present a snapshot of the current state of this fast-moving field.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Historical context: a new kind of pain education emerges as a new intervention</title><p>About 30 years ago, rapid advance in the scientific understanding of &#x0201c;how pain works&#x0201d;, facilitated by the seminal discovery of central sensitisation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and including pain's protective function, multifactorial nature, dynamic nature over time, and the most effective ways of treating it (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), had created a vast disconnect between scientific and common understanding of the problem of chronic pain. The common understanding remained rooted in a simplistic structural pathology model in which chronic pain was taken to reflect chronic tissue pathology. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioural interventions seemed in contrast to this common understanding. In response to the disconnect, a new educational approach called &#x0201c;intensive neurophysiology education&#x0201d; emerged in 2002 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The intervention became widely known as &#x0201c;explaining pain&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), after the primary resource <italic>Explain Pain</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and subsequently, &#x0201c;pain neuroscience education&#x0201d; (PNE) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This approach is still being widely taught and delivered under that name and in this article we use &#x0201c;PNE&#x0201d; to refer to the original intervention and to differentiate it from more modern approaches to patient pain education.</p><p>The impact of this disconnect between common and scientific understanding of pain, could be seen in patient perspectives on pain management programs that focussed not on pain reduction but on living well despite pain (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The discovery in 1983 of central sensitisation lent weight to the idea that pain reduction was no longer a reasonable expectation. Central sensitisation was demonstrated after peripheral nerve constriction, whereby second order neurones in the spinal cord became upregulated and responsive to non-nociceptive stimuli (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). That discovery led to some seeing chronic pain as an immutable disorder of the spinal cord (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The original biopsychosocial model (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) also lent weight to this idea&#x02014;it posited that the impact of pain involves biological, psychological and social influences. Loeser's 1983 adaptation of the biopsychosocial model to the &#x0201c;onion skin&#x0201d; metaphor (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) brought a more pain-specific framework; psychologists were able to re-purpose cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) that were established for other diagnoses such as depression, to help patients decrease the impact of pain on their quality of life (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Guidelines began to include cognitive and behavioural strategies and education about how to use them in the early 2000's (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Our consumer-focussed research identified a significant challenge with this shift towards CBT-based pain management. Many people with chronic pain and many health professionals who treated them, found it difficult to reconcile a CBT and self-management based approach with their understanding of &#x0201c;how pain works&#x0201d;&#x02014;they found the suggestion confusing and invalidating (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It was an understandable response: if one understands the presence and degree of pain intensity to accurately signal the presence and degree of tissue damage, then interventions that do not directly target those tissues will of course appear to be nonsense. There was a clear need for a new intervention that could provide patients with an understanding of why CBTs and self-management were biologically sensible. PNE therefore, aimed to enable and empower consumers to engage in CBTs and self-management through first explaining why, not just how, to do it. One can readily see the connection between this early mission and the taglines of public-facing modern day public pain education initiatives such as Pain Revolution (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.painrevolution.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.painrevolution.org</ext-link>)&#x02014;&#x0201c;rethink, re-engage, recover&#x0201d; and Flippin' Pain (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.flippinpain.co.uk" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.flippinpain.co.uk</ext-link>)&#x02014;&#x0201c;engage, educate, empower&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Clinical trials of PNE have produced mixed results</title><p>The earliest randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of PNE compared it to conventional pain education matched for dose, setting and resources, or to an active care comparator, a usual care comparator, or to a waiting list comparator. Those RCTs, in individuals with chronic pain, demonstrated medium to large effects on pain-related neurophysiology knowledge, and small effects on movement-evoked pain, pain-related worry, pain-related self-efficacy, usual pain intensity and pain-related disability (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Since those trials, other trials have been undertaken in various countries, in various settings, and with various diagnostic groups, with the content and format of PNE remaining very consistent. Over 35 RCTs and several meta-analyses on PNE as a stand-alone intervention, and over 50 RCTs of more complex interventions that integrate PNE content, have been undertaken (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.petalcollaboration.org/clinical-trials-of-pain-education.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.petalcollaboration.org/clinical-trials-of-pain-education.html</ext-link> for a list of RCTs). Some studies conclude that PNE as a stand-alone intervention imparts small to medium benefits across a range of outcomes, in a range of chronic pain conditions, in a range of settings and languages e.g., (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but others report benefit in variables such as knowledge change, catastrphising and fear of pain and (re)injury, but not in pain or disability (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Opinion pieces advocate for PNE (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), but recent commentaries have identified significant challenges and limitations (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Real world experience of PNE elucidates challenges and limitations</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Barriers for clinicians</title><p>Significant barriers to the implementation of PNE exist. To date, the only major implementation trial in which physiotherapists were trained in PNE (16&#x02005;h, 8&#x02005;h online and 8&#x02005;h face-to-face) or not (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), was a cluster-randomised implementation study that revealed improved pain-related self-efficacy but not better pain or disability outcomes for patients of the PNE-trained physiotherapists. Health professionals have reported significant challenges in delivering PNE such as: limited appointment time; patient-related factors including a lack of perception of education as an intervention in its own right; clinician-specific issues, such as limited confidence in the implementation process (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Anecdotally, health professionals have told us that (i) some patients do incredibly well but others do not, (ii) they &#x0201c;try the pain talk&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;do explain pain&#x0201d;, but most patients &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t buy it&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t want it&#x0201d;. Such anecdotes are also borne out in qualitative analysis of primary care practitioner perspectives, which also suggest health professionals attribute difficulties with PNE to too complex content or patient/learner attitude or capacity, but not to a lack of educational expertise or training (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Some health professionals consider that the learning objectives of PNE contradict early pioneers of sensory neurophysiology or certain philosophical and semantic principles (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) [see (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) for a pragmatic commentary on the latter]. Others perceive that educating patients about how pain works undermines their own clinical framework or authority, but the largest group understand and accept the merit and intent of pain education and feel they lack the skills and confidence to deliver it effectively (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Less experienced clinicians have expressed heightened apprehension about using PNE, concerned that unsuccessful implementation could harm therapeutic relationships (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Although some services, for example many Canadian pediatric pain programs, stipulate education as mandatory before other care commences, health professionals in other jurisdictions (particularly in adult care) have reported that they stopped pain education altogether &#x0201c;because it is too hard and most patients don&#x02019;t want it&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These results are consistent with the apparent ineffectiveness of PNE training for health professionals, at least as it was delivered in one implementation trial (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Taken together, the available evidence suggests improvements are needed in the content and method of PNE and the training and support of health professionals to implement it.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Barriers for patients</title><p>People living with chronic pain have identified that good pain education is a high care priority, but that they seldom receive it (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Our real-world data suggest that even &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; education may not be as helpful as we would like. We have investigated this by looking at PNE-related outcomes in clinical practice, outside of research studies. We collected data on knowledge, worry, pain and disability outcomes in a rolling outcome evaluation of over 1,500 consecutive patients, all of whom participated in PNE, with 93% follow-up rate. We used the only assessment for pain knowledge available&#x02014;the neurophysiology of pain questionnaire (NPQ) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and its 12-item revised version (rNPQ) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We have previously presented data from 799 of the consumer cohort, all of whom used the original PNQ, and full details of the cohort and the range of diagnoses included, are presented there (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

Nociceptors were named over a century ago. Most experiments investigating stimulus-response profiles in human and non-human animals, from Sherrington's field-generating work (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) to current studies, actually do no harm to body tissue. That body of work cannot demonstrate nociceptors as harm detectors, but it does demonstrate that nociceptors code for the intensity of a stimulus [although not necessarily in a linear fashion (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>)]. Considering further the link between noxious stimulation and protection, a wide range of physiological responses have been assessed, for example withdrawal, heart rate increase, inflammatory cytokine release, brain activation patterns, coordinated motor responses. Non-physiological assessments include pain report and willingness to participate in another experiment. When multiple trials from multiple individuals are averaged, the intensity of a noxious stimulus relates well to responses, but there is substantial intra-individual and inter-individual variability, even when the setting and stimuli are highly controlled (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Thus far, all of the responses that have been assessed are consistent with protecting the body from damage either in the moment or when faced with similar threats in the future. Concordantly, most of the pain field has for many decades considered pain a protective response or experience e.g., (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), which is in keeping with an evolutionary lens (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and has long been an idea central to writings as diverse as Henry James's <italic>Principles of psychology</italic> (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and William Cullen's <italic>The institutes of medicine</italic> (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).

Consumers tell us that &#x0201c;sensation&#x0201d; implies something occurring at the tissue level. &#x0201c;Sensation&#x0201d; is also problematic from a neurophysiological and phenomenological perspective: (i) a diverse array of receptors and neurones are involved in monitoring changes in tissue environment (see (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) for one accessible review); (ii) pain is a unified sensory and emotional experience (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), the dimensions of which may be separately investigated but only under highly controlled experimental conditions (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).

Modern pain education takes a constructivist approach to learning, integrates active, constructive, interactive and inventive learning tasks (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>), includes a range of teaching &#x0201c;tactics&#x0201d; during educational encounters, and uses novel clinical tools such as sequential art, storytelling, active tasks and virtual-reality mediated embodied experiences. The theoretical frameworks and some strategies have been drawn from education research, where they have been shown to improve learning in over 300 meta-analyses of data from several million participants (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Other strategies are based on the principles that govern the neurophysiology of learning (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>); others are grounded in social cognitive theory (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). It is important to acknowledge that many clinicians have already begun to use contemporary teaching methods to enhance their educational offerings, although up to 40% of health professionals who regularly deliver pain education are unable to name an educational strategy (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>In 2023, the Pain Education Team to Advance Learning (PETAL) Collaboration was formed. This international, interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers, clinicians and consumers engaged in pain education research and seeking to synergise international efforts, elected to use &#x0201c;Pain Science Education&#x0201d; to describe modern pain education. There were two reasons for this move: (i) to differentiate, from PNE [which is still taught and delivered in its original form (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)], modern patient education that incorporates these developments in content and method, and (ii) to reflect that wider range of scientific knowledge (rather than just &#x0201c;neuroscience&#x0201d;) that is now included.</p><p>The intent of making pain education better is clear: maximise learning about how pain works in order to optimise endorsement and adoption of a graded reactivation and self-management approach to <italic>recovery.</italic> The logic is simple: if the didactic &#x0201c;old school&#x0201d; PNE approach is one of the most effective treatments we currently have for chronic pain (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), then much more effective education (i.e., a &#x0201c;stronger dose&#x0201d;) is likely to be more beneficial, and thus deliver better clinical outcomes. Robust clinical trials will support or refute this logic.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Co-designed resources and sequential art</title><p>Co-designed education involves authentic and meaningful engagement with learners (consumers, clinicians and the public) and health professionals throughout the design and development stages, ensuring that tools and resources resonate with their needs, thereby improving acceptability and uptake (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Pain Science Education draws heavily on co-design methods as well as progress in educational and conceptual change sciences (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Tools and resources are designed to enrich the learning environment, provide learning opportunities for learners with a wider range of skills and previous educational attainment, and make learning more enjoyable and meaningful&#x02014;promoting what Hattie and O'Donoghue call the &#x0201c;will&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;thrill&#x0201d; of learning (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). The strategies embedded in these tools are not unique to patient pain education, but have only recently been integrated into it. One such strategy is sequential art, known colloquially as &#x0201c;comics&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;cartoons&#x0201d;, which can be presented in isolation&#x02014;conveying a specific point&#x02014; and also as a coherent whole in which certain characters assist to build a longer, cohesive narrative (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). For example, character development of Snoopy and Charlie Brown in Peanuts allows their personality and context to infer complex meanings and inferences (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Randomised controlled experiments demonstrate that the use of sequential art enhances learning outcomes across several domains (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>).</p><p>Recent patient-targeted pain education resources for the general public use sequential art (e.g., <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.tamethebeast.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.tamethebeast.org</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://flippinpain.co.uk/formula/" ext-link-type="uri">flippinpain.co.uk/formula/</ext-link>), for children and youth (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) and for adults with chronic pain (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). The development of these resources involved individual stories to target a specific concept, linking concepts and inferring more complex, nuanced concepts through the development of characters across multiple stories. Extensive consumer involvement during development promotes the relevance, readability and acceptability of the resources, but the international use of the resources means that colloquial language and cultural references, which can offer powerful learning opportunities, are necessarily limited.</p><p>We also co-designed a series of brief animated videos in partnership with people living with osteoarthritis to challenge common misconceptions (e.g., osteoarthritis is caused by &#x0201c;wear and tear&#x0201d; of joint cartilage) that reduce participation in guideline-based care. Using Pain Science Education concepts to provide compelling alternative narratives (e.g., &#x0201c;bioplasticity of cartilage&#x0201d;), our pilot data (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;291) showed that a single view trial of these animations led to medium to large reductions in misconceptions in both lay people (with and without OA) and health professionals (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). People with OA also reported reduced fear of movement and an increased intention to exercise, and feedback on the videos was highly positive, with many citing the clear and patient-friendly explanations. The positive reception was unlikely to reflect resonance with pre-held beliefs. To the contrary, the content probably challenged pre-held beliefs: over 70% of consumers reported that it was different from information previously provided to them by health professionals. We do not know whether this reflects poor knowledge or poor education strategy of their previous providers.</p><p>The ancient (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>) tactic of storytelling can foster deeper engagement with the studied material and has long been thought to improve the extent of learning and retention (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). Storytelling interventions, by altering health-related societal norms, have been shown to impact major public health issues, including sexual health, substance use, hypertension control, and vaccination, across diverse international contexts including culturally diverse communities (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). Storytelling can stimulate and maintain interest in the topic, provide a structure for delivery and remembering the material, and improve the connection between the educator and the learner (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). Examples in the pain field include the children's comic book &#x0201c;<italic>Medikidz Explain Chronic Pain: What's Up with Moira's Grandad</italic>&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>) and &#x0201c;<italic>Painful Yarns.

The latter consists of short stories used as metaphors for pain science concepts; a small clinical trial suggested it improved understanding of pain biology (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). Our patient partners have also highlighted the potential of patient testimonial storytelling: &#x0201c;<italic>Storytelling is powerful.

A meta-analysis of 43 trials, undertaken in several education settings, reported medium to large effect sizes on a range of learning outcomes, including cognitive, intellectual, motor and behavioural outcomes (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). VR-enhanced education creates experiences within a virtual environment, usually via head-mounted goggles, that target specific learning objectives. Using VR to enhance health education has been explored in women undergoing breast cancer (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>) or cardiac (<xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>) surgery. VR is not new to the chronic pain space (<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>), and others have delivered the didactic &#x0201c;presentation-based&#x02019; PNE using VR goggles (<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>, <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>), reporting positive results. Using VR to deliver content in a similar way to how it might be delivered face-to-face or online seems a missed opportunity&#x02014;the learning potential created by VR is likely to come from generating compelling and memorable experiences and active learning activities.</p><p>We have assisted one VR-based platform in its objective to generate experiences and activities, to achieve deep learning of PSE's learning objectives. Three independent research groups have undertaken preliminary investigation: Skidmore et al. (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>) found that the Reality Health VR-enhanced pain education platform (Reality Health, Sydney, Australia) is easy for health professionals to use; provides credibility for using education as an intervention; provides users with safe experiences that reinforce and rapidly consolidate PSE's learning objectives. Mardon et al. (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>) found it to be feasible, acceptable and safe for use with war Veterans with and without post-traumatic stress, and health professionals who treat them: key themes were novelty, compelling learning experiences, enjoyable, easy to use, and made complex concepts easy to understand. Kennedy et al. (<xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>) evaluated the platform with patients on a waiting list for specialist pain services in Australia: 28 participants, 11 identifying as Australian Aboriginal origin and 9 as being born overseas, rated highly its ease of use (4.6/5), enjoyment (4.7/5), and their desire to use it again (4.3/5); 23 reported improvement with physical activities and mood, and 19 reported improvement in pain levels after the VR-based program. Clinical audit data appear promising: 315 long-term injured workers completed a VR-enhanced pain education program, showing substantial pre-post reductions in pain, pain interference and self-efficacy (full outcome evaluation data are presented with permission at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.petalcollaboration.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.petalcollaboration.org</ext-link>). Whether or not VR-enhanced PSE improves clinical outcomes more effectively than PSE without VR is yet to be investigated in a clinical trial.</p><p>With or without access to VR-enhanced pain education, a range of tactics can be employed by pain educators to enhance deep learning of PSE's learning objectives (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Using a modified ICAP conceptual change framework (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>), tasks that foster deep learning, from &#x0201c;active&#x0201d;, to &#x0201c;constructive&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;interactive/inventive&#x0201d; tasks, should improve pain education outcomes, just as they have been shown to do in conventional educational contexts. The RECLAIMA acronym (<xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>) can guide clinicians towards simple tactics that they can use &#x0201c;in the moment&#x0201d; to push learners towards deeper learning, and the SALAD task (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) can be used to integrate constructive and inventive strategies into reading, video-based or audio-based &#x0201c;homework&#x0201d;.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>The RECLAIMA tactics list.

RCTs consistently show improvements in cognitive variables such as knowledge, self-efficacy and fear, but evidence around pain and disability improvements is mixed. A range of methods have been used to demonstrate that reconceptualization of &#x0201c;how pain works&#x0201d; may be a key determinant of subsequent clinical improvement. Critically, challenges to the implementation of early iterations clearly identified the need for more relevant content and better educational strategy. These content and strategy changes have led to what is now termed Pain Science Education, which targets specific learning objectives broadly covered by the <italic>Essential Pain Facts</italic>, and includes a range of strategies and clinical tools and resources.</p><p>Where to from here? We contend that the health education field has great scope for improvement and that there is a pressing obligation for us to make pain education better. Our research groups are prioritising co-design with consumers and end users. We are also exploring methods to push modern understanding to the wider public, for example via Pain Revolution (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.painrevolution.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.painrevolution.org</ext-link>), Flippin' Pain (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.flippinpain.co.uk" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.flippinpain.co.uk</ext-link>) and the EQUiPP Project (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equipp.org.au" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.equipp.org.au</ext-link>), which is employing a &#x0201c;micro-community&#x0201d; precision co-design approach to formulating general public pain messaging strategies. Further priorities include increasing knowledge and skills among health professionals across the health system and development of resources to assist health professionals fast track the changes in understanding that seem to most closely relate to subsequent improvement and often recovery.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>GLM: Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
