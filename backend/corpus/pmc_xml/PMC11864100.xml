health systems in high income countries have approached the design and delivery of
care with a view to standardising practices (<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Bohmer, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref057" ref-type="bibr">Pinder
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2006</xref>). These approaches draw on
scientific management principles about how work standardisation leads to
predictability, consistency in quality and the efficient distribution of resources
(<xref rid="ref057" ref-type="bibr">Pinder <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">Schein, 2017</xref>). They are
based on assumptions of correctly characterised single health problems and certainty
about the care that will lead to the best outcomes (<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Bohmer, 2009</xref>). These standardised practices are specified in
guidelines, protocols and pathways, that, until relatively recently, were developed
to address single health conditions. More broadly, the &#x0201c;when&#x0201d;,
&#x0201c;how often&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;how long&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;in what order&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;at what speed&#x0201d; of healthcare activities are handled in
standardized allocations of time for appointments, exams and procedures that are
made visible and managed through a variety of technologies. &#x0201c;Clock
time&#x0201d; dominates here with multiple standardised plans dictating what work
should happen when and clinical performance evaluated against the pre-set time
parameters. Clock time is decontextualised and measurable, and is perceived as
universal and objective (<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Adam, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">Caldeira and Timmins, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">Clissett <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Hendrich
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Healthcare is considerably more variable than these approaches would suggest, and in
fact markedly more differentiated care is needed at an individual patient level in
many cases (<xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Berg, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Bohmer, 2009</xref>). Old age and multiple morbidities are very likely to add
complexity to the nature of healthcare need and uncertainty in the clinical
encounter as to the care that will result in optimal health (<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">Bridges <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2019</xref>). There are
differences between individuals in disease types, symptom profiles and progression,
in addition to differences in how these elements interact with each other and with
personal characteristics such as age-related biological changes, values, health
literacy and available resources including social networks (<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">Bridges <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2019</xref>). When an
individual has complex needs, effective care is personalised, that is specifically
tailored to that individual in that moment (<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">Bridges <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Where healthcare is
taking place in a context of constraint where, for instance, time, information
and/or skills are more limited than the interaction demands, an iterative (rather
than standardised) approach to care is required that enables personalised care that
accommodates the contingencies of that particular context (<xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Berg, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>;
<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Bohmer, 2009</xref>). Process time, rather
than clock time, is highly relevant here. Process time is fluid and context
dependent (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Davies, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">Urry, 2000</xref>). The inherent flexibility
enables the practitioner to continuously adapt to the needs of the older person and
contexts within which they work (<xref rid="ref055" ref-type="bibr">Nowotny,
1992</xref>). Such &#x0201c;necessary improvisation&#x0201d; allows healthcare
practitioners to deviate from standardised practice where appropriate and is a
hallmark of good quality care (<xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">Bourdieu,
1977</xref>).</p><p>Changes in the structure, governance and organisation of healthcare systems can be
viewed temporally (<xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">Meier, 2019</xref>).
Healthcare systems are necessarily pluritemporal, consisting of many temporal
structures and paces, and they are inhabited by people &#x02013; staff, patients and
others whose relationships with time tend be biographical, embodied and highly
individual (<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Adam, 1995</xref>). Research to date
has helped uncover the tensions between the deployment of scientific management
principles to guide how care is organised and the realities facing health care
professionals as they encounter patients with very complex needs (for instance <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Berg, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">Meier, 2011</xref>;
<xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">Colley <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2012</xref>). However, even though clock time is a conspicuous feature of
scientific management principles and process time appears to be a necessary
component of personalised care, contemporary studies that view these tensions and
their impact through a temporal lens are less common.</p><p>Herein, we explore how healthcare workers (HCWs) conceptualise time and navigate
multiple temporalities in the provision of care for older adults with complex health
needs. Drawing on an exploratory study using qualitative methods, we show how HCWs
engage with time as both a valuable commodity to be rationed and prioritised within
a constrained context and as a malleable resource for managing workload and
overcoming &#x0201c;turbulence&#x0201d; in the system. However, participants in this
study also shared how the simultaneous multiplicity and lack of time had a
profoundly personal impact on them through the emotional toll associated with
&#x0201c;time debt&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; time.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Literature review: temporality, standardisation and care</title><sec id="sec002.1"><title>Temporalities in care work</title><p>Organisational structures and processes aimed at streamlining and optimising
organisation of care and treatment are a common feature of contemporary
healthcare. To support the division and coordination of work in healthcare
organisations, work processes and patient pathways are ostensibly organised
according to time. The tempo and pace of care, or the speed at which events take
place, has increased significantly in recent years (<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">Aiken <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref072" ref-type="bibr">Willis <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2015</xref>). Quicker has often been equated with better quality, and such
understandings of quality are usually accompanied by significant focus on
reducing waiting and treatment times (<xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">Kreindler, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Accelerated or &#x0201c;fast care&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">Rushton <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2016</xref>) is perceived to be
vital to reducing waiting times and meeting targets (<xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">Bevan and Hood, 2006</xref>). Fast care is associated with a
high-pace and quick turnover, with HCWs having interactions with an increased
number of patients over a reduced period, thus serving a larger group of people.
However, accelerated care may have harmful impact on individuals, as those
receiving care may perceive interactions as rushed potentially leading to a
reluctance to express doubts, concerns and additional care needs (<xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">Bridges <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">Hope
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">Moyle <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2015</xref>). As
healthcare work is fundamentally uncertain and people&#x02019;s responses to
treatment (as well as their needs and preferences) can vary significantly (<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Bohmer, 2009</xref>), HCWs must be able to be
pragmatic, adaptive and responsive in their work. This can often be at odds with
health care work systems that emphasise speed as a priority. In contrast to fast
care, &#x0201c;slow care&#x0201d; refers to engagement that is maintained over a
longer period, centred on longitudinal awareness of the patient&#x02019;s
need.</p><p>Different illnesses have distinct trajectories, which relate not only to the
physiological unfolding of a patient&#x02019;s disease, but also to the total
organisation of work done over that course, plus the impact on those involved
with that work and its organisation (<xref rid="ref065" ref-type="bibr">Strauss
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1985</xref>). As such, much of
healthcare does not easily align with abstract clock time or standardised,
pre-defined allocation of resources and when only certain, quantifiable, aspects
of healthcare work are measured, other aspects of work tend to be overlooked or
become functionally invisible from a systems perspective (<xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">Meier, 2011</xref>). Yet, standardisation and optimisation
processes can create unintended and undesirable organisational effects,
especially where individuals have multiple co-occurring health conditions (<xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">Pederson and Obling, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec002.2"><title>Standardisation</title><p>From a scientific management perspective efficiency in care should be achievable
through standardisation (<xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">Schein,
2017</xref>). This standardisation has typically been sought through the
introduction of multiple care pathways and protocols, designed to streamline
treatment and care and optimise use of time. Although these tools aim to ensure
equal access to care based on &#x0201c;best available evidence&#x0201d;, they work
in several ways when implemented into clinical micro settings, often with
unintended consequences, requiring substantial amounts of additional work (<xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">Meier, 2011</xref>). Administrative doctrines
described as New Public Management (NPM; <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">Hood, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) seek to
achieve efficient and effective delivery of services, and value-for-money. NPM
is centred on principles of disaggregation or separation of the purchaser and
provider of services, incentivisation and competition or choice (<xref rid="ref046" ref-type="bibr">Lindaas <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2024</xref>). However, NPM has been criticised for promoting
&#x0201c;cost-cutting&#x0201d; rather than effectiveness (<xref rid="ref071" ref-type="bibr">Watson, 2003</xref>). When healthcare is considered primarily
through the lens of protocolised work, reducing the time and cost of providing
care may be incentivised and prioritised over optimising the quality of the care
provided (<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">Bone, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">Colley <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2012</xref>). <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">De Menezes (2023)</xref>
highlights a risk of perceived unrealistic and/or ambiguous targets, evaluations
unrelated to performance-objectives, unethical behaviours by employees striving
to meet expectations and performance-measures that are meaningless. <xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">Glaser and Strauss (1968)</xref> noted long ago
that in hospitals, prescribed schedules govern care, and there is much evidence
to suggest that this remains the case in many settings (for instance, <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">Bridges <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2020</xref>). This routinisation of care is illustrated in attempts to
standardise practices through protocols, guidelines, audited practices and
through a wide variety of technologies monitoring compliance. <xref rid="ref048" ref-type="bibr">McCormack and McCance (2011)</xref> noted that
healthcare systems place a greater emphasis on aspects that can be quantified
(such as time taken), with few indicators that are personalised. Aspects of
&#x0201c;soft skills&#x0201d;, relational care and emotional work are
under-valued, despite potentially impacting quantifiable metrics by promoting
good quality care.</p><p>Core values of the NPM, that is competition, choice and service differentiation
can contradict goals of equity and universality of service provision (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Fotaki, 2010</xref>). <xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">Simonet (2015)</xref> notes that NPM theories view recipients
of public services as customers rather than passive recipients, noting that this
approach may promote social exclusion. Complex cases where patients have
requirements that extend beyond medical needs (e.g. social problems, language or
literacy barriers and limited access to transport) can be left behind as they
are not equipped to advocate or empowered to make the best use of medical
information and alternatives presented to them (<xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">Simonet, 2015</xref>). Standardising methods such as protocols,
by their nature, prescribe the best way to treat and care for a type of patient.
They are general, not situated and thus cannot account for context, nor
unexpected or practical eventualities which may exert greater urgency than the
protocol. They are coordination mechanisms best-suited to relatively stable
settings such as elective surgery or out-patient care in certain specialities,
where our knowledge of the nature and course of illness is well-established
(<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Bohmer, 2009</xref>). Protocols for
managing health trajectories can be highly prescriptive (<xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Berg, 1997</xref>, p. 1083). However, human bodies are complex,
characterised by &#x0201c;temporal unpredictability&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2011</xref>) and can respond in a
variety of ways to different interventions. Protocols frequently fail to capture
the nuances and complexities of healthcare, such as the emotional work that
clinicians engage in. Such work is more difficult to quantify using clock time,
and in turn, is often overlooked, unaccounted for or even viewed as a luxury
(<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Bridges <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2013</xref>).</p><p>Healthcare delivery, research and education was built, and mostly remains
centred, on the treatment of single diseases (<xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">Kingston <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2018</xref>). <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Cohen (2011)</xref> argued that a focus on a
single part of the body or single disease (termed &#x0201c;standardisation by
selection&#x0201d;) can be a deliberate strategy for managing complexity and
limiting variation in the bodily functions of concern. Health service provision
for those with multiple conditions is often duplicative, fragmented, inefficient
and ineffective because of poor coordination and integration (<xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">Barnett <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2012</xref>). The co-occurrence of multiple complex conditions increases the
likelihood of hospital admission, length of stay and readmission, raises
healthcare costs, reduces quality of life and increases dependency, polypharmacy
and mortality (<xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">Kingston
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Complete adherence to
existing clinical practice guidelines is not realistic, leading to inevitable
poor adherence, wasted resources and poor outcomes. Yet, a lingering acute-care
mentality, derived from the previous era of the acute illness, is still deeply
influential in modern healthcare. Indeed, some have indicated that personalised
care has become more about maintaining the current, medically led system and
changing the patient, than about changing the system to meet the needs of
individuals (<xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">Byrne, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec002.3"><title>Ambitions of personalised care</title><p>Recent guidelines for the management of multiple co-occurring conditions
emphasise personalised care, characterised by proactive, interactive and
inherently flexible approaches (<xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">Skou
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Personalised care is
associated with improved care experiences and outcomes, increased satisfaction
among care providers and improved performance of health care organisations
(<xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">Rushton <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2016</xref>). However, the approach appears to contradict clock time which
privileges fast care, and numerous barriers to the implementation of
personalised care have been identified. These include established practices and
traditional work-structures, lack of confidence and perceived capability of the
HCW, as well organisational factors that may disable rather than facilitate
efforts to implement personalised care in practice (<xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">Moore <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Systems
that prioritise quantifiable tasks, schedules and procedures are inherently
misaligned with modern policy recommendations that promote individualised,
personalised and holistic approaches to care (<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The implementation of personalised care is set against a background of crises in
healthcare systems in relation to increased waiting times, treatment
cancellation rates, iatrogenic injury and clinical workloads in many healthcare
systems (<xref rid="ref081" ref-type="bibr">Alderwick and Dixon, 2019</xref>).
<xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">Rushton <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.
(2016)</xref> note that &#x0201c;shortage of time&#x0201d; is often cited as
reason why HCWs feel unable to provide personalised care, particularly in acute
care settings. A perception of &#x0201c;time debt&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref070" ref-type="bibr">Waterworth, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">Menzies, 1960</xref>) can lead to adoption of strategies to manage the
psychological stress associated with healthcare work (<xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">Menzies, 1960</xref>). One such strategy is a tendency to
revert to highly routinized care to reconcile competing temporal demands.
Strategies that aim to alleviate time debt can often prioritise the interests of
the organization rather those of person receiving care, resulting in poorer
outcomes (<xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">Clissett

therefore well-suited as a shared conceptuliasation of time by which activities
may be organised and coordinated. In contrast, &#x0201c;process time&#x0201d; is
time that is fluid and context dependent. In process time, beginnings and
endings are flexible and undefined (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Davies,
1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">Urry, 2000</xref>). <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Davies (1994)</xref> noted that process time is
central to care provision. Process time is particularly compatible with the
concepts of &#x0201c;slow care&#x0201d; and personalised care outlined above.
Obedience to clock time at the expense of process time can constrain healthcare
delivery; yet many healthcare tasks necessitate a recognition of clock-time. An
approach to reconcile both is &#x0201c;pluritemporalism&#x0201d;, which
facilitates flexibility between context, persons and situations.
Pluritemporalism (<xref rid="ref055" ref-type="bibr">Nowotny, 1992</xref>),
refers to the idea that there can be multiple &#x0201c;times&#x0201d;

providing care to older people with multiple health conditions alongside a diagnosis
of cancer.</p><sec id="sec003.1"><title>Data collection</title><p>We conducted one-to-one qualitative interviews with 19 HCWs from the National
Health Service in England between March and August 2019. Interviewees worked in
a variety of roles for a range of providers in primary and secondary healthcare
(See <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Face-to-face
interviews were carried out at a convenient location and lasted around
90&#x000a0;min. All interviews were audio-recorded and fully transcribed. A
semi-structured interview guide was developed collaboratively with HCWs and a
patient representative. Although we based our interview guide on theories of
workload and capacity (<xref rid="ref061" ref-type="bibr">Shippee

questions iteratively throughout the interview process, carefully considering
the experience and context of the interviewees. The research project was
approved by the University of Southampton ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="sec003.2"><title>Data analysis process</title><p>TC independently read the transcripts and identified recurring ideas and
concepts. The data were analysed using systematic reading, familiarisation and
open coding. Initial ideas were discussed by all three authors to explore
initial themes and refine the connections. Following this, we drew on literature
on standardisation and temporality to help us to make sense of the findings.
This provided a backdrop of concepts that help to sensitise us to possibilities
in our data. We focused our analysis on how the participants in this study
conceptualised time and navigated tensions in relation to temporality to
facilitate the practice of good quality care.</p><p>In line with <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">Rushton
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> advice against
dichotomous representations of time, we recognised that a dualistic focus could
limit ones understanding by emphasising the tensions between different temporal
structures. Therefore, we began by discussing the results of the initial
thematic analysis in relation to a variety of conceptualisations of time to
analyse in depth how HCWs navigate the multiple temporal aspects of delivering
care. These included clock time, sovereign time, pluritemporalism and process
time. We used the concepts of fast care and slow care (<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">Aiken <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2013</xref>) and discussed how these conceptualisations of care related to
the different engagements with time that we identified in our material.
We&#x000a0;also considered the implications of a healthcare system mostly defined
by clock time and characterised by invariance, context independence and
precision (<xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">Rushton
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2016</xref>). We&#x000a0;drew on the work
of <xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">Elias (1992</xref>, <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">2000)</xref> to establish an experiential understanding of time
and temporal synchronisation challenges. This enabled us to explore concepts
such as coordination and synchronisation processes within and between different
settings. We also studied the work of <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Berg
(1997</xref>, <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">1999)</xref> and <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">Bohmer and Lee (2009)</xref> who discussed
scenarios whereby protocols can dictate timings which do not align with the
realities of healthcare interactions. We explored the idea of &#x0201c;managing
patients&#x02019; trajectories&#x0201d; as a central aspect of healthcare work
practices. The concept of turbulence (<xref rid="ref085" ref-type="bibr">Jenning
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) was likewise influential in our understanding of
the data, helping us to consider the consequences of misalignment within the
system. These considerations led us to compare temporal tensions in how
work-is-imagined (or promoted by policy) and how work-is-done, drawing on work
by <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">Braithwaite <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.
(2017)</xref>. Further, we considered the tension between the temporal
ordering assumed as feasible in a work system that is task-based and the fluid,
thoroughly contextual nature of &#x0201c;body time&#x0201d; (e.g. <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref066" ref-type="bibr">Twigg, 2006</xref>). We adjusted the coding considering these
sensitising concepts identified in the literature. Themes were developed from
the codes, and iteratively compared and modified through discussion amongst the
co-authors. This led us to question our initial assumptions about the skillsets
or capabilities to engage in personalised care practices, to focus on how
healthcare providers reconcile the fluid and flexible nature of personalised
care within time-poor healthcare systems characterised by standardised pathways
and single-disease focused approaches to care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Findings</title><p>While healthcare systems remain organised largely in line with clock-time, our
findings suggests that HCWs engage with temporality in several nuanced ways. We
found that HCWs conceptualise and navigate time as both a valuable commodity to be
rationed and prioritised within a constrained context and as a malleable resource
for managing workload and overcoming &#x0201c;turbulence&#x0201d; in the system.
However, participants in this study also shared how the simultaneous temporal
multiplicity and lack of time had a profoundly personal impact on them through the
emotional toll associated with &#x0201c;time debt&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d;
time, as we unfold below.</p><sec id="sec004.1"><title>Time debt: time is a valuable finite resource that can be used, but also

the pace of work and break times, overtime and time off. For many participants,
there was a perceived need to engage in continual boundary work to manage their

demonstrated a pressurised context of constraint where time, information and
knowledge about the presenting case is more limited than the interaction

standardisation is desirable in healthcare because it facilitates the
predictable allocation of resources. With little time to spare, power is
retained by HCWs maintaining paternalistic approaches to care and avoiding
scenarios that may take more time. However, the deliberate deconstruction of the
person into &#x0201c;manageable&#x0201d; units is often incongruent with models of
person-centred care and multimorbidity. Following standardised protocols assumes
high certainty as to the right course of action. HCWs in this study illustrated
how the work of managing multimorbidity in older age requires working with a
high level of uncertainty, and of experimenting with what may or may not be the
right course of action.</p><p>Findings reflect that working with older people living with multimorbidity was
complex and labour intensive. Challenges in coordinating aspects of care
associated with multiple health conditions meant that time felt wasted or lost,
both for the practitioner and the individual receiving care. Participants
provided examples of how protocol-driven over-treatment led to escalation that
could reduce the older adults&#x02019; quality of life rather than improve it.
They cited examples of how this could result in prolonged hospital stays and
unnecessary invasive procedures, both of which may be costly to a healthcare
system where time resources are scarce. Health-related work was described as
being pushed back to the older person and their family to reconcile the
misalignment in the system, adding to the emotional impact and cognitive burden
of living with complex needs:<disp-quote><p>If I get older, I&#x02019;d want to
get older without lots of conditions because however positive and robust
old people are the accumulation of those deficits is a burden. And the
burden of treating--- because we treat each individual things

cope with their medication regimes and I would not be able to cope with
the number of people that talk to me. And yet, I expect a ninety-five
year old with short term memory problems to do deal with it. -PPT

when something went wrong, rather than being addressed proactively. The temporal
focus on the immediate was perceived as short-sighted, and often an inefficient
use of resources. Participants recounted examples of how the immediate single
diseases (sometimes perceived as fixable) took priority over the complexities of
multimorbidity. Many highlighted a &#x0201c;<italic>tendency to focus on the
immediate problem</italic>&#x0201d;. In turn, clinicians described their role
as &#x0201c;<italic>firefighting</italic>.&#x0201d; Acute concerns were
prioritised over the chronic, with little emphasis possible on forward planning
to prevent or pre-empt future crises. HCWs also described how they needed to
work in their own time to complete administration tasks that they had previously
abandoned to address the acute needs of patients during their shift. Some
indicated that they &#x0201c;<italic>chose</italic>&#x0201d; to engage in such
work beyond their shift but noted that they rarely received recognition or
reparation for doing so.</p></sec><sec id="sec004.2"><title>Time is malleable (structuring/stretching/moving around)</title><p>Participants also described time as malleable, providing examples of how time
could be structured and stretched to align with care needs and clinician
experience, see <xref rid="F_JHOM-07-2024-0295002" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> below.</p><p>Time pressure necessitated continuous management of numerous, often competing
demands within the temporal boundaries of each shift. Constraints on time led to
task switching (moving to a second task before finishing the first) and
multitasking (doing two things at once; <xref rid="ref069" ref-type="bibr">Walter <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Reprioritising (<xref rid="ref084" ref-type="bibr">Patterson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,

delays. Cognitive stacking (<xref rid="ref063" ref-type="bibr">Sitterding
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2012</xref>) was employed as a strategy
for managing workload when multiple demands occurred simultaneously. In addition
to these tactics, participants also adopted protocolised and boundaried
approaches to care to &#x0201c;manage&#x0201d; interactions with the person
receiving care. Perceived constraints of time (and other resources) meant that
there was often a tendency to keep the interaction limited to what is manageable
in the available time.</p><p>Those with established experience of healthcare work with this client group
described how they had developed a capacity to reconstruct trajectories to
provide person-centered care, manage turbulence in the workflow, while also
leading to more efficient use of their time. This reflected a pluritemporalistic
approach, balancing the demands of clock time while optimising personalised
care. More experienced clinicians described themselves as proactive and less
reliant on protocolised ways of working. These individuals described how they
had developed an ability to responsively alter their plans to ensure patient
safety, as well as flexibility in approaching or delaying certain tasks.</p><p>Conversely, for less experienced or junior colleagues, working in a
pluritemporalistic way was viewed as more challenging. They were reported as
being less able to adjust their practices to the changing requirements of
situations. These individuals were depicted as focusing efforts on basic

more ad hoc, personalised approaches where necessary. This aligns with <xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">Clissett <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.

spend more time with an individual but felt unable to because of a perceived
lack of time. Our findings suggest that effective &#x0201c;switching&#x0201d;
between clock time and process time may be difficult for novice HCWs because
they have not yet learned to navigate competing temporal structures (clock time
versus process time, slow care versus fast care).<disp-quote><p>Structure is
something that [novice HCWs] find really useful. And forms they find

because your dashboard tells you what to do. You don&#x02019;t use
intuition because you don&#x02019;t need to because there is another form
further in this packet which will tell you what to do. So, that
knowledge and experience, I think, for a lot of younger nurses now they
almost don&#x02019;t see it as valuable because there&#x02019;s always a

all alright. - PPT 116</p></disp-quote></p><p>Preparatory work was viewed as a key element in providing good quality,
personalised care. While gathering this information takes time at the outset, it
was generally seen (by experienced practitioners) as saving time later. However,
participants frequently explained how much of this preparatory and
administration work was &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; or unaccounted for. This
time-consuming work was further exacerbated by inefficiencies in the healthcare
system. For example, care was impacted by inconsistent reporting, incomplete
records and cases where certain reviews did not happen routinely or were
administered in a seemingly ad hoc or case-by-case basis. Consequently,
participants described this process as a form of &#x0201c;detective work&#x0201d;,
alluding to the challenging and often tedious nature of the
task.<disp-quote><p>It is about being a detective because there are so
many conditions this can be potentially--- so many medications &#x02026;
it&#x02019;s about getting a really good history &#x02026; and
understanding of their background, of their conditions. Trawling through
their notes.. You know, that you can really have a good look &#x02026; I
hate going in cold &#x02026;.I think, staff will always see it as a very
time consuming--- I see it as frontloading. I see it as: &#x0201c;get
this right in the first place you save, you know, a lot of time
later&#x0201d;. You get a better relationship with your patient early on.
But, I think, for staff out at the coalface they&#x02019;d have
difficult--- difficulty crafting that care plan and they will always say
they haven&#x02019;t got time to.- PPT 105</p></disp-quote></p><p>Information about an individual with multiple conditions needed to be sought from
various sources, some of which may be inaccessible due to disjointed systems
within and between organisations. HCWs observed the variability in response and
timeliness from colleagues asked to provide information, with some services
being significantly less responsive. Online systems were described as difficult
to use and as an inefficient way to share information. Distinct platforms and a
range of different care records made it difficult to find information.
Inaccessibility of information made it difficult for HCWs to ascertain the
status of an individual receiving care, and in turn, to prepare for the
consultation. They described having to meet individuals &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d;,
not cognisant of other patient information, care plans and interventions. This
lack of information threatened patient safety and could also lead to patient
frustration or upset. Delays in receiving information also led to longer
appointments, and a number noted that delays wasted time that could be spent
identifying solutions for the person receiving care.</p><p>High demand on services and shortcomings in the work system created a turbulent
environment in which to work. This turbulence disrupted and complicated workflow
in unnecessary ways, and HCWs found their workload increased, pressuring the
amount of time available. Interruptions in communication, inadequate handoffs,
information overload and impaired decision-making due to a lack of information
impeded HCWs&#x02019; capacity to practice personalised care. Turbulence was
further boosted by large patient caseloads, high patient turnover, simultaneous
demands, time pressures and issues with equipment and supplies, as well as
inadequate space to hold personalised conversations.</p></sec><sec id="sec004.3"><title>Time is personal and felt</title><p>In our third theme, we discuss the feelings of time, the emotional toll created
by perceptions of time debt and &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; time, see <xref rid="F_JHOM-07-2024-0295003" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>
below.</p><p>When the valuable resource of time was &#x0201c;wasted&#x0201d;, work permeated
into personal time. HCWs reflected on the challenge of &#x0201c;switching
off&#x0201d; at the scheduled shift end-time, indicating that clinician shifts
were not necessarily bounded by clock time. Healthcare work is therefore not
only restricted to clinical tasks; it also permeates complex psycho-social
phenomena such as emotional and cognitive work. Consequently, turbulence within
the system may increase healthcare professional&#x02019;s stress, burnout and
diminish well-being (<xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">Jennings,
2021</xref>).</p><p>Emotion regulation was considered a practical skill that is refined through
experience, perhaps facilitated through a process of &#x0201c;ongoing
intersubjective surveillance and self-regulation&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Douglas-Creed <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2014</xref>,
p.&#x000a0;275). Setting clear boundaries on the remit of their role and adopting
structured approaches to care were viewed as protecting the clinician.
Clinicians spoke of how they &#x0201c;manage patients&#x0201d; to regain control
of time, sometimes deviating from personalised practices to address turbulence
in the workflow. For example, one mentioned that if you asked someone how they
were managing their health <italic>&#x0201c;you might not get out of the
room</italic>&#x0201d;, perhaps illustrating the internalising of the
institutional requirement that time is managed efficiently.</p><p>Participants noted how they find themselves continually mentally engaging with
work, even after their shift-has ended. Several participants noted that it was a
challenge to &#x0201c;<italic>let go</italic>&#x0201d; and help people take
ownership of their healthcare. Some described feeling over-involved and
described taking actions beyond the remit of their role to support older adults.
Those who worked in specialised care settings raised concerns about
overstepping, or being unsure about whether it was appropriate for them to
intervene on issues that may be explored by another
practitioner.<disp-quote><p>We would be on the &#x02018;phone to each
other all the time: &#x0201c;but..&#x0201d; or: &#x0201c;I&#x02019;ve done

patient deteriorates?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;do you think I&#x02019;ve made the

differently?&#x0201d; &#x02026; you&#x02019;ll always go home with
(&#x02026;) at the end of the day with certain patients and you&#x02019;re
not quite sure whether you&#x02019;ve done the right or wrong thing. And
that risk taking sometimes seems too much of a risk or too little of a
risk. &#x02013; PPT 111</p></disp-quote></p><p>Concern about potential legal implications left clinicians unsure about the
extent to which they could truly support an individual&#x02019;s choice,
particularly if it did not align with expert opinion. Many raised concerns about
challenges that could arise where the person&#x02019;s priorities were
incongruent with the clinician&#x02019;s recommendations. Practitioners
emphasised that it was important to strike the right balance between
safeguarding and personal choice. Within a risk-averse and time-pressured
healthcare system, documented medical assessments were viewed as central to care
while the older person&#x02019;s wishes were necessarily peripheral. Some
participants viewed extensive record taking was a bureaucratic task in case
legal issues arose, rather than as being for the benefit of service-users. They
described administrative work as &#x0201c;<italic>covering their back, ensuring
you&#x02019;ve a record</italic>&#x0201d;. Fears of litigation and concerns
about the time to engage in administrative tasks meant that clinicians were
hesitant to transfer ownership to the person receiving care. However,
participants who advocated personalised approaches noted that being
risk-avoidant could lead to over-medicalisation and deviations from the
person&#x02019;s values and priorities. This was summarised by a participant who
noted that what the older adult wants &#x0201c;<italic>is lost</italic>.&#x0201d;
Such approaches to care ultimately disempower the person in receipt of care,
impacting their time alongside their experience of care.<disp-quote><p>We often
don&#x02019;t do a particularly good job of finding out what&#x02019;s
important --- to the patients. And we often spend a lot of time imposing
what&#x02019;s important to us onto them. Sometimes, it&#x02019;s
appropriate and apparent and--- you know, it&#x02019;s what you need to
be doing. Sometimes it&#x02019;s not. Other things can become lost in the
pursuit of safety which is a shame. It&#x02019;s not nice because you
want to be doing what&#x02019;s important to the person but you can
become lost in the priorities of healthcare often won&#x02019;t meet the
priorities of the person and the priorities of the patient can become
lost.- PPT 118</p></disp-quote></p><p>The HCWs we interviewed reflected that meaningful engagement with an
individual&#x02019;s specific priorities and needs entailed higher risk,
emotional involvement and took more time. For many (especially less experienced
practitioners), it was significantly less burdensome to opt for more
prescriptive forms of care. Pre-established protocols and scripts closed
conversations, saving time by reducing the need to engage in complex
conversations and shared decision-making. Practitioners described feeling under
pressure, noting that working in healthcare takes its toll emotionally,
especially in relation to difficult and complex caseloads.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper we have investigated how HCWs conceptualise and navigate time in the
provision of care for older people with multi-morbidity. We have examined their
views on the provision of &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; personalised care, as well as
identifying aspects of care organisation that could impact how time is experienced
in the healthcare system. Our analysis demonstrates how HCWs navigated the
turbulence and temporal tensions of working with older adults living with
multimorbidity by adopting a pluritemporalistic approach to achieve personalisation
in care. Our temporal framing enabled us to theorise two main aspects of how
tensions in the healthcare system are experienced by staff caring for people with
complex health needs.</p><p>Firstly, inspired by <xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen&#x02019;s and
Obling&#x02019;s (2020)</xref> point that time is often implicit in studies of
standardisation within medical sociology, we foregrounded temporal aspects of
practicing care and demonstrate challenges associated with the prioritisation of
accelerated and protocolised work processes. Specifically, we demonstrated an
inherent misalignment between standardisation processes in healthcare systems and
the fluidity required to engaged in personalised practices. Our study suggests that
bureaucratic workloads and firefighting require time and attention away from care
provision, while fragmented systems of communication absorb valuable time and
resources. Participants in this study were generally positive towards the potential
of personalised approaches to care, however, as found in previous research (e.g.
<xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">Skou <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2022</xref>), many indicated implementation would require more time, skill and
resource. These issues posed predominant barriers and undermined the implementation
of personalised approaches for those with multiple long-term conditions.</p><p>Secondly, our foregrounding of temporality also allowed us to explore the emotional
toll of balancing and attempting to accommodate these tensions within healthcare.
Here, our findings demonstrate how protocolised working and boundaries can support
healthcare workers, particularly those with less training and experience and that,
in some instances, standardised practices supported a sense of order and safety.
However, our results also suggest that highly personalised and flexible approaches
may lead to perceptions of uncertainty, risk and anxiety, without the scaffolding of
a prescribed approach. Participants frequently raised concerns about risk-taking,
role boundaries and ethical concerns which demonstrate the &#x0201c;greyness&#x0201d;
that comes with the inherent flexibility of personalised care provision. Without
protocolised &#x0201c;black-and-white&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;if-then&#x0201d; solutions,
clinicians are left to navigate complex cases independently in high-stress
environments. In critiques of current policy and education relating to personalised
care (<xref rid="ref080" ref-type="bibr">Entwistle <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2022</xref>), it has been reported that current training and policy models often
fail to explicitly address the uncertainties and difficulties that HCWs may
experience. There is a need to recognise and challenge tensions and
practical-ethical issues that can arise in provision of personalised care (<xref rid="ref080" ref-type="bibr">Entwistle <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2022</xref>). Our findings indicate that a particular area for focus by policy
makers is how to incentivise and adequately support the experimental risk-taking
that may be required by HCWs to ascertain the best outcome for individuals with
complex health needs.</p><p>With this paper, we build on literature that has sought to challenge the rhetoric of
personalised care, by highlighting how healthcare systems inhibit personalised care
practices. <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Byrne <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.
(2024)</xref> note that tensions exist between HCWs' ability to deliver
personalised care in a system designed to maintain NPM efficiency, productivity and
efficacy. Instead, resource management is prioritised above safe, effective care
(<xref rid="ref079" ref-type="bibr">Ljungblom, 2014</xref>, p.&#x000a0;193).
Consequently, care is ineffective and fragmented, characterised by processes that
are overwhelming to both HCWs and patients. While personalised care is promoted to
bridge some of these gaps (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Byrne
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2024</xref>), it remains a challenge to
implement in light of competing priorities. <xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">Cole
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2023)</xref> argue that the current
regulatory ethos of healthcare is not supportive of the ideals of personalised care.
Delivery of care is hampered by multiple layers of legislation, bureaucracy and
standardisation. Stresses on efficiency, calculability, predictability and control
create constraints associated with information overload, work intensification and
role-conflict (<xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">McCann
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Austerity measures lead to
staff reduction (<xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">Kasper
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2023</xref>), further intensifying the
impact on HCW time. Instability and fragmentation can lead to increased incidences
of missed care (<xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">Willis
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Universally, the primary
reasons for missed care are inadequate staffing levels, resource deficits and poor
communication (<xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">Verrall
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2015</xref>), all of which we have discussed
in the current paper. We have highlighted intentional decisions to ration,
reprioritise or omit care as a result of &#x0201c;<italic>multiple demands and
inadequate resources</italic>&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Kalisch <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2009</xref>, p.&#x000a0;1509).
Consequently, although not explicitly mentioned, we can assume that the tensions we
have outlined are likely to be associated with missed, reprioritised or delayed
care. Patient care is compromised when routines are changed; when equipment is
unavailable, and when staff are forced to seek it from another ward, or improvise
(<xref rid="ref083" ref-type="bibr">Henderson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2013</xref>). Lack of time is intensified by time spent managing turbulence,
staffing levels that do not account for patient complexity and pressures that
encourage HCWs to undertake tasks outside of their scope of practice and/or level of
experience (<xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">Verrall
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2015</xref>). In turn, the intensification of
labour and missed care affects employee wellbeing, patients' satisfaction and
outcomes and operational performance (<xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">De Menezes,
2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref060" ref-type="bibr">Schubert
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Personalised care can thus only be embedded within a system that is appropriately
staffed, equipped and responsive. Workload models need to account for the nature of
the modern patient, who is likely to present with multiple and chronic conditions.
Capacity challenges due to inadequate staffing could be addressed by mandating
minimum staff-patient ratios. These have been introduced in some contexts, leading
to lower mortality rates (e.g. <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">Aiken
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Mentoring and clinical
supervision could enable junior HCWs to develop personalised care skills in a
supportive environment. <xref rid="ref082" ref-type="bibr">Musker and Othman
(2024)</xref> note that effective clinical supervision is associated with
reductions in emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and burnout. However, such
initiatives require proactive investment in the workforce. Other initiatives could
focus on prioritising care-work appropriately and reviewing the capabilities of
those providing care (<xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">Verrall
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2015</xref>). There is also potential to
rethink where personalised care interventions are implemented, shifting towards a
more community-based model of care (<xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">Baird
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2024</xref>). A shift to primary and
community services can reduce demand on hospitals, and improve integration of
services (<xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">Baird <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2024</xref>).</p><sec id="sec005.1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This research was conducted between March and August 2019, and the participants
relate to experiences prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings
illustrate the vulnerability of the healthcare system prior to the pandemic,
pointing to/highlighting substantial systemic barriers that have likely become
further entrenched. Our interviews provided valuable insights into the
experiences of those providing care as the NHS national long term plan was
introduced. The experiences recounted here demonstrate that implementation of
the plan would have always been ambitious. Given the timing of the research, and
the country context, caution should be taken in transferring the results to
other contexts.</p><p>This research is strengthened by the inclusion of a range of the healthcare
providers, who shared experiences of the interdisciplinary nature of care for
older people with complex conditions. Despite differences in roles and care
settings, views shared across primary and secondary care complemented each
other, strengthening the validity of our findings. The extensive use of theory
provides a clearly articulated lens for how we approached the analysis,
facilitating coherence and depth to enhance the explanatory power and legitimacy
of our findings (<xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">Collins
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p><p>By analysing healthcare work using temporality theories, our work adds to the
body of knowledge about how healthcare workers conceptualise time and how
workers are able (or not) to manage tensions between the demands of multiple
temporalities. We have also demonstrated the emotional toll on staff that this
navigation and balancing requires, and how more standardised forms of care can
reduce this toll by appearing to save time and reduce risk thus
dis-incentivising the provision of personalised care. Our findings indicate that
as populations age and health need become more complex, healthcare systems
designed to support HCWs with the time, skill and resources to work effectively
with uncertainty may enable the radical shift required from standardised ways of
working to more responsive forms of care.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors thank those who helped them with recruitment for this study, in
