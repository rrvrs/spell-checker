Photonics offers a compelling solution, enabling not only advanced communication but also sensing, imaging, and renewable energy applications. Unlike the mature silicon electronics industry dominated by complementary metal&#x02013;oxide&#x02013;semiconductor (CMOS) technology, photonics lacks a single ideal material platform. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) require a combination of properties, including a wide transparency window, efficient light emission and detection, strong electro-optic (EO) coefficient, and ease of fabrication and integration &#x02013; a challenge no single material can meet. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) is a popular platform due to its compatibility with silicon foundries. However, SOI has limitations that include the inability to create lasers, high two-photon absorption, and the lack of second-order nonlinearities. It also suffers from high absorption in the visible range and low modulator extinction ratios based on the free-carrier plasma dispersion effect. These limitations have spurred the development of alternative material platforms such as silicon nitride (SiN), doped-silicon dioxide, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, aluminum nitride, gallium nitride, and LN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Heterogeneous integration, which combines these material systems on a single substrate, offers a pragmatic solution. Various techniques like epitaxial growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, bonding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and &#x000b5;TP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> have been explored for this purpose. &#x000b5;TP stands out as a simple yet versatile micro-assembly technology with high yield. It enables fast and parallel assembly of micro-scale components under ambient conditions at lower costs as compared to the wafer bonding approach. An elastomer stamp transfers components from a source substrate to a target surface, facilitating the co-integration of dissimilar materials. &#x000b5;TP is particularly advantageous for integrating materials that are difficult to pattern or deposit using conventional methods. Additionally, it allows the utilization of materials that are otherwise incompatible due to processing and chemical limitations by decoupling deposition, patterning, and printing steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In particular, today&#x02019;s data centers deploy hundreds of thousands of servers across multiple hierarchical layers, necessitating an interconnection network that is not only cost-effective but also energy-efficient. New methods for the realizing of switching elements are needed that combine a high radix connectivity architecture and simultaneous bandwidth. Advanced switching architectures have proposed and demonstrated based on cyclic arrayed waveguide gratings and high speed optical modulators are key elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thin film LN modulators are very promising for their low insertion loss and high-speed operation. LN has large Pockels effect, enabling pure phase modulation without spurious amplitude modulation &#x02013; a significant advantage compared to silicon and III-V material modulators. Additionally, LN has emerged as a multifunctional platform offering a unique combination of electro-optic, acousto-optic, elasto-optic, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and non-linear optical properties, making it a highly promising platform for active photonic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, LN is challenging to process, making devices fabricated with non-standard etching techniques and partially etched waveguides difficult to reproduce. To address this, various integration methods, such as wafer-scale bonding, have been explored for LN-on-SiN platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. &#x000b5;TP of a thin LN film onto a pre-patterned waveguide material such as SiN photonic integrated circuits is another attractive solution. This approach eliminates the need for precise LN etching while combining the scalability of CMOS-compatible photonics with the excellent electro-optic modulation capabilities of LN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. While &#x000b5;TP holds promise, it remains a relatively new technique with limited reported implementations in modulators. Existing demonstrations include a 2&#x000a0;mm-long Mach-Zehnder modulator on the LN-on-SiN platform, featuring two 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 multimode interferometers (MMIs) in a push-pull configuration. This design achieved an insertion loss of 3.3 dB and a half-wave voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>&#x003c0;</italic></sub>) of 14.8&#x000a0;V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Another study reported a ring modulator fabricated by micro-transfer printing a 600&#x000a0;nm-thick LN film on silicon, exhibiting an insertion loss of 1.5 dB and an extinction ratio of 37 dB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A mid-infrared modulator has been demonstrated using micro-transfer printed silicon on LN. This modulator achieves a half-wave voltage length product of 12.3&#x000a0;V&#x02219;cm at a wavelength of 3.78&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m and exhibits a maximum extinction ratio of 25.2 dB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. SiN loaded and direct patterned LN cross-sections have also been investigated for achieving improved second harmonic generation through engineered lateral leakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These works highlight that LN on insulator is emerging as a viable PIC platform.</p><p id="Par4">In this paper, we explore the implementation of electro-optic modulators using &#x000b5;TP of thin LN films onto a patterned SiN target. To realize efficient modulators, long device lengths are currently required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Reduced footprints are essential, particularly if the field is to advance to switches with even higher port counts. Resonant enhancement is an important principle to enhance light matter interaction and realize high performance with short device lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The low refractive index contrast LN-on-SiN imposes challenges on bending radius, making Fabry-Perot (FP) microcavities a very promising route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To this end, we demonstrate modulators based on three different architectures: MZI, in-line FP resonator, and side-coupled FP resonators. An in-line FP cavity consists of a resonant region enclosed by two mirrors. Increasing the Q-factor requires higher mirror reflectivity to trap light for longer durations. Minimizing cavity losses can further enhance performance without significantly compromising transmission but, scattering loss tends to be constant for a given fabrication process. Therefore, a fundamental trade-off exists in FP resonators: in the presence of loss, maximizing the Q-factor reduces the transmission peaks, and vice versa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a modulator based on a side-coupled FP resonators, a novel photonic molecule architecture with properties analogous to molecules, to maximize the transmission-Q-factor product. This photonic molecule leverages controlled mode interaction between the coupled resonators, enabling us to simultaneously achieve high Q-factor and increased light transmission, offering superior flexibility for spectral engineering compared to conventional FP resonators. The photonic molecules have found interesting applications such as comb generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, quantum optics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, lasing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Design and simulations</title><p id="Par5">This section details the design considerations and simulations performed for the electro-optic modulators fabricated using micro-transfer printed LN films on SiN waveguides. We analyze the optical transmission characteristics, electro-optic effect, and performance of the aforementioned modulators.</p><p id="Par6">The optical field distribution of the transverse electric (TE) mode in the LN-on-SiN waveguide at the wavelength of 1550&#x000a0;nm is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. The design of the LN-on-SiN waveguide geometry was guided by both fabrication constraints and numerical simulations. The thickness of the SiN, LN, and electrode layers was determined by material availability and fabrication feasibility. Simulations using Lumerical MODE Solutions indicate that reducing the SiN width increases mode confinement in the LN slab but also causes greater lateral mode expansion. This necessitates a larger electrode gap, which in turn weakens the EO effect. For example, at <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>SiN</italic></sub> = 0.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, the mode confinement in LN increases to 65%, whereas at <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>SiN</italic></sub> = 1.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, it decreases to 55%. To balance confinement and EO efficiency, we selected a SiN strip waveguide width of <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>SiN</italic></sub> = 1.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, while the trenches on either side have a width of <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>trench</italic></sub> = 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. Both the SiN layer and the <italic>x</italic>-cut LN film have a thickness of 300&#x000a0;nm. These waveguide parameters result in an optical field confinement of about 57% in LN slab as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. The effective index of the mode is 1.82 while the group index is 2.19&#x000a0;at 1550 nm. LN exhibits a linear electro-optic effect (Pockels effect), making it an ideal material for optical modulator. To achieve efficient modulation, it is crucial to align the applied electric field along the extraordinary axis of the LN film. The 1.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m-thick gold (Au) electrodes are placed on both sides of the waveguide. While reducing the gap would enhance the EO interaction, precise alignment of electrodes at very small gaps poses fabrication challenges. Potential misalignment or variations in electrode positioning could lead to asymmetric field distribution, reduced modulation efficiency, or increased optical loss. To ensure reliable device performance across multiple fabrication runs, we adopted a conservative approach choosing varying electrode gaps. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b illustrates the electric field distribution and the resulting change in the LN&#x02019;s refractive index. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows that, the <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> component of the electric field dominates, while <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> component is negligible and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>=0.

These new frequencies correspond to the modes of the coupled system, often referred to as supermodes. Such coupled resonators are often called photonic molecules since the optical modes in them are similar to the electronic states of diatomic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Here, we present a photonic molecule, i.e., side-coupled FP resonators, to manipulate the mode interaction, resulting in the splitting of the original resonance into two new supermode resonances, including a shorter-wavelength antisymmetric and longer-wavelength symmetric optical modes. In this design, both the Q-factor as well as the transmission peaks of the resonances can be increased simultaneously - a significant advantage compared to simple FP resonators, for example those discussed in the previous section. The proposed structure consists of two FP resonators, namely, the main and auxiliary FP resonators evanescently coupled to each other as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c. Each FP resonator is composed of a cavity and two DBRs on either side of the cavity. We taper the DBRs to transition from the waveguide mode to Bloch mode and vice versa, considerably reducing the DBR-waveguide coupling loss. The sharp tips at the end of the DBRs in the auxiliary FP eliminate the back reflection.

The length of the cavity is the same for both the cavities.</p><p id="Par18">As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, increasing the number of gratings in the auxiliary resonator from <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>BG2</italic></sub> = 50, 100, to 200 leads to a significant improvement in Q-factor, reaching values of 6200, 11,900, and 14,100 at the wavelength of 1551.1&#x000a0;nm, respectively. Simultaneously, the transmission peak also increases from 0.20, 0.72, to 0.96, respectively. Notably, increasing the DBR reflectivity in the auxiliary FP leads to a divergence in the Q-factors of the split resonances. For instance, Q-factors of 12,880 and 14,440 are achieved for <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>BG2</italic></sub> = 200 at the resonance wavelengths of 1549.42 and 1551.10&#x000a0;nm, respectively. The Q-factor of a conventional FP with <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>BG</italic></sub> = 50 is 6,710. On the other hand, no resonances are observed in a single FP with <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>BG</italic></sub> = 200 in the middle of the bandgap, as the increased DBR reflectivity minimizes the light penetration into the cavity. However, close to the bandgap edge&#x02013;where the DBR reflectivity is lower compared to the center&#x02013;there is a resonance (not shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) with a transmission peak of 0.16 and a Q-factor of 618,000. Although the Q-factor of this resonance is higher than that achieved with the photonic molecule, its transmission level is significantly lower. The lower Q-factor of the photonic molecule arises from losses introduced by the bent waveguide and coupling between the FP resonators. Overall, these results highlight that the Q-factor in the coupled FP resonators can be increased while allowing for higher transmission levels at the resonances. The splitting strength is proportional to the inter-FP coupling strength which depends on the gap between the resonators and the coupling length. This behavior is analogous to that observed in coupled ring resonators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, by changing the inter-FP coupling strength, in this case, the gap between the resonators (<italic>G</italic>), the split resonances can be pulled towards each other or pushed further away. For instance, by increasing the gap from <italic>G&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;150, 300, to 450&#x000a0;nm, the split between the resonances decreases from 2.97, 1.67, to 0.96&#x000a0;nm, respectively. Obviously, by further increasing the gap between the FPs, the splitting decreases further and ultimately, we would have two uncoupled FPs.</p><p id="Par19">

We utilize micro-transfer printing to pick the LN coupon up from the Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) source chip and print it onto the desired location on the SiN target chip. Gold electrodes are deposited on both sides of the structure to apply an electric field across the optical waveguide, modulating the light propagation characteristics.</p><p id="Par22">First, we describe the fabrication procedure of the target chip, i.e., waveguide patterning on SiN. The fabrication process begins with a commercially available SiN wafer from LioniX, featuring a 300&#x000a0;nm thick low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) SiN layer on a 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m buried oxide (BOX) grown on a silicon substrate. We utilize electron beam lithography (EBL) with a 100&#x000a0;kV Elionix Ebeam exposure tool to define the desired waveguide patterns on the SiN layer. After exposure, the photoresist is developed to create a patterned resist mask. An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etch process with a mixture of CHF<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gases is used to transfer the resist mask pattern into the underlying SiN layer. Following the waveguide etch, a second EBL step defines the grating coupler (GC) patterns on both ends of the waveguides. GCs facilitate efficient vertical light coupling between the on-chip waveguides and standard single-mode fibers (SMFs). Unlike the fully etched waveguides, the GCs are only partially etched to maintain a defined grating profile for efficient light coupling. Another ICP etch process similar to the waveguide etch is performed to create the grating structures on the SiN layer, defining the GCs. Here, the etch depth is precisely controlled to achieve the desired 150&#x000a0;nm etch depth for optimized light coupling efficiency.</p><p id="Par23">LN coupons, measuring 2.4&#x000a0;mm in length and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in width, are prepared from commercially available <italic>x</italic>-cut LNOI wafer containing 300&#x000a0;nm-thick LN layer on top of 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m thick BOX grown on silicon substrate. The coupon boundary is first defined by optical lithography followed by ICP etching into the silicon substrate. A second optical lithography step is performed to define the tethering structure, which consists of resist features that temporarily hold the coupons in place during the undercut process. The BOX layer is then released by undercutting in buffered oxide etchant (BOE). The integration of LN onto SiN waveguide was accomplished in &#x000b5;TP tool. To achieve adequate print adhesion between LN and SiN, SiN target was treated in O<sub>2</sub> plasma for 5&#x000a0;minutes prior to the printing. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp, with a size slightly bigger than the coupon, is used to pick the LN coupon &#x02014;by breaking the tethering structure&#x02014; and place it onto the target SiN chip with the desired alignment. Any remaining tether resist was removed by solvent, ensuring that the devices are clean and ready for electrode deposition. The final step involves depositing metal electrodes on both sides of the LN-on-SiN structure, which are patterned using lift-off lithography. These electrodes allow us to apply an electric field across the LN layer, inducing a change in its refractive index and modulating the light propagation characteristics within the waveguides. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a presents an optical image of the completed MZI modulator device. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b is showing the transition where LN meets SiN waveguide. The alignment of the LN coupon relative to the SiN structure is not highly restrictive due to the coupon&#x02019;s width (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) being significantly larger than the underlying SiN features. As a result, the 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m accuracy of our &#x000b5;TP process has no significant impact on device performance. However, angular alignment is more critical since LN is an anisotropic material, meaning even slight misalignment can influence the electro-optic response. In our process, angular misalignment is kept below 0.2&#x000b0;, which remains within acceptable limits for structural placement. Nevertheless, further improving angular precision could enhance modulation efficiency. The electrodes were patterned using lift-off lithography with an accuracy of approximately 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. It is important to note that the abrupt transition from the SiN waveguide to the SiN-on-LN waveguide introduces optical loss due to mode mismatch between the two waveguides. This loss could be minimized by incorporating a tapered transition, which would gradually adapt the mode profile and improve coupling efficiency.</p><p id="Par24">

The GCs on either side of the devices vertically couple the light to the single mode fibers (SMF). As the GCs are highly polarization-dependent and designed for TE polarization, we use a polarization controller (PC) to ensure TE mode excitation within the devices. A tunable laser source sweeps across the desired wavelength range, while the output light from the other end is collected and measured by a power meter. The transmission measurements were normalized to the transmission of a SiN waveguide without an LN layer to account for losses introduced at the SiN-LN interface. The interface loss was determined by comparing the transmission of a bare SiN waveguide before transfer printing to that of an LN-on-SiN waveguide, yielding an estimated loss of ~&#x02009;5 dB. This interface loss significantly contributes to the overall insertion loss of the modulators and must be considered when analyzing their performance. A Keithley source-measure unit (SMU) applies voltage to the electrodes via standard direct current (DC) probes. The probe tip is narrower than the electrodes for precise contact.

The MZI modulator demonstrates an insertion loss of less than 8 dB and an extinction ratio of approximately 27 dB. The high extinction ratio of the MZI modulator can be attributed to its significant arm separation, which enhances the interference contrast by minimizing unintentional coupling between the arms. This separation reduces phase noise and fabrication-induced asymmetries, leading to improved extinction performance. The measured wavelength shifts are approximately 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4&#x000a0;nm for applied voltage of 5, 10, 15, and 20&#x000a0;V, respectively.

A route towards the realization of compact devices is shown. High-speed data transmission experiments cannot be performed with these devices due to high <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>&#x003c0;</italic></sub>, a consequence of the large electrode gap. The obvious way to lower the <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>&#x003c0;</italic></sub> is to increase the EO interaction. This can be achieved by shrinking the electrode gap further and increasing the mode confinement into the LN layer. While this strategy would improve the EO interaction, several important design trade-offs need to be addressed. Increasing mode confinement in the LN layer results in a larger mode mismatch at the interface between the SiN and LN-on-SiN waveguides, making it essential to use tapers to minimize reflections. Furthermore, it causes lateral mode expansion in the LN layer, necessitating a larger electrode gap that weakens the EO effect. Conversely, reduced field overlap with the SiN gratings can lower the reflectivity of the DBRs, potentially requiring longer DBRs to compensate for this effect. Furthermore, although shrinking the electrode gap strengthens the applied electric field, it also increases the overlap between the optical mode and the lossy metal electrodes, leading to higher optical absorption. Striking an optimal balance between electrode placement and mode confinement is crucial to maximize modulation efficiency while minimizing loss.</p><p id="Par34">In this work, unpatterned LN is transferred onto SiN waveguide which eases the integration process since no alignment between LN and SiN is required. However, patterning LN will be necessary to lower the <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>&#x003c0;</italic></sub><italic>L</italic> product. LN can be patterned after the transfer which will require a strategy to protect exposed SiN waveguide from being damaged by the plasma during LN etching. Alternatively, patterned LN can be transferred onto SiN waveguide which will require strict alignment accuracy between SiN and LN waveguides. A potential drawback of this approach is that the patterned LN waveguide might give increased waveguide loss due to sidewall roughness. Therefore, waveguide dimensions and fabrication process will be important considerations. There is also further room to improve the SiN waveguide loss by optimizing EBL process and ICP etching recipe. The reliability of printed coupons is also a crucial factor for actual applications and studies of the yield will be performed in future works. It is known that any liquid like solvent or deionized water can flow through the waveguide trench beneath the LN coupon. If that liquid cannot escape, then it may lead to coupon debonding. Therefore, a suitable strategy is required to block the trench where SiN/LN interface will need to be developed. The power consumption of the MZM is estimated based on measured current values. At an applied voltage of 20&#x000a0;V, the measured current was 5.1 nA, resulting in a power consumption of approximately 102 nW.

By leveraging the complementary strengths of SiN&#x02019;s well-established fabrication and LN&#x02019;s superior electro-optic properties, this &#x000b5;TP-based approach presents a promising pathway towards high-performance, miniaturized modulators.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>S.H.B. acknowledges the support of Sparkle program funded by European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) grant agreement No. 847652 and Taighde &#x000c9;ireann - Research Ireland.
