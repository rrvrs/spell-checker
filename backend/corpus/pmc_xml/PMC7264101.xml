Epothilone B (EpoB) is an FDA-approved antineoplastic agent, which shows the capacity to induce &#x003b1;-tubulin polymerization and to improve the stability of microtubules. Recently, it has been increasingly recognized that EpoB has a regenerative effect in the central nervous system. However, the information currently available regarding the potential therapeutic effect of EpoB on peripheral nerve regeneration is limited. Here, we used a rat sciatic crush injury model system to determine that EpoB strikingly improved axonal regeneration and recovery of function. Also, EpoB (1 nM) did not result in significant apoptosis in Schwann cells (SCs) and showed little effect on their viability either. Interestingly, EpoB (1 nM) significantly enhanced migration in SCs, which was inhibited by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Since PI3K/Akt signaling has been implicated in regulating autophagy, we further examined the involvement of PI3K/Akt in the process of EpoB-induced SC migration. We found that EpoB (1 nM) significantly inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in SCs. Further studies showed that both EpoB-enhanced migration and autophagy were increased/inhibited by inhibition/activation of PI3K/Akt signaling with LY294002 or IGF-1. In conclusion, EpoB can promote axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury by enhancing the migration of SCs, with this activity being controlled by PI3K/Akt signaling-mediated autophagy in SCs. This underscores the potential therapeutic value of EpoB in enhancing regeneration and functional recovery in cases of peripheral nerve injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epothilone B</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>peripheral nerve injury</kwd><kwd>remyelination</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7556"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) occur relatively frequently as a result of inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, or iatrogenic causes, resulting in chronic morbidity. PNIs are thought to affect millions of individuals globally each year, resulting in substantial social and economic burdens and rates of disability (Yu et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). PNI can lead to sensory or motor dysfunction as well as to tissue atrophy that cannot be reversed (Chen et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). While there are biological mechanisms capable of facilitating spontaneous recovery within the adult mammalian peripheral nervous system, the process is complex, and often results in unsatisfactory outcomes (Chen et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The current gold standard treatments for PNIs are thus combinations of surgical repair, nerve bridging, and nerve grafting (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, surgical procedures only restore the pathway through which regenerated axons reach their target organs (Huang et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and do not improve the regenerative capability of the injured neurons. It is thus vital to explore drugs capable of promoting nerve regeneration to allow restoration of function after PNI.</p><p>Epothilone B (EpoB) is an antineoplastic agent with FDA approval, which shows the capacity to improve the stability of microtubules and to promote &#x003b1;-tubulin polymerization (Ballatore et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). EpoB can promote OV-90 and ABT-737 ovarian cancer cells apoptotic death <italic>via</italic> respective signaling through the Apo-2L/TRAIL and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways (Rogalska and Marczak, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). More recently, EpoB has exhibited a regenerative effect in the central nervous system. Systemic administration of subtoxic EpoB doses enhances axonal regeneration and attenuates fibrotic scarring following an injury to the spinal cord by abrogating meningeal fibroblast polarization and migration (Ruschel et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Intraperitoneal low-dose EpoB administration has been shown to suppress axonal microtubule deterioration and improve cognitive function in a murine tauopathy model (Ballatore et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Furthermore, systemic EpoD administration has been suggested to protect against a murine MPTP-induced parkinsonism model (Cartelli et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A recent study found that EpoB alleviates nigrostriatal pathway damage while enhancing motor functionality following intracerebral hemorrhage in mice (Yang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Taken together, these results confirm that EpoB has a regenerative effect in the central nervous system. However, reports of the effect of EpoB on nerve regeneration after nerve injury in the peripheral nervous system have been lacking.</p><p>Herein, we conducted a systematic assessment of how EpoB affects axonal regeneration and remyelination in a rat model of PNI. We explored the effect of EpoB on Schwann cells (SCs) and further revealed the underlying mechanisms. Our results show that the administration of EpoB improves axonal regeneration and functional recovery in a rat model of sciatic crush injury. We further show that EpoB (1 nM) significantly enhances migration in SCs, which is controlled <italic>via</italic> PI3K/Akt signaling-mediated autophagy. This work highlights the potential therapeutic value of EpoB in enhancing regeneration and functional recovery in PNI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PNI Modeling</title><p>Adult male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats (200&#x02013;250 g) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University. Animals were housed following the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, with the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of The Fourth Military Medical University having approved all studies described herein. Briefly, five rats were housed in each cage in a climate-controlled facility (23 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C; 35%&#x02013;60% humidity; 12 h light/dark cycle).</p><p>The rat sciatic nerve injury model was generated as described in prior studies, with small modifications (Li R. et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Briefly, 40 mg/kg of 1% pentobarbital sodium was i.p. injected into animals to achieve anesthesia, after which the left sciatic nerve was exposed through the generation of a 1 cm cut in the mid-thigh. Two vascular clips (30 g for 50 s; Oscar, Guangzhou, China) were used to compress the sciatic nerve, thereby inducing a moderate crushing injury. One of these clips was located 2 mm distal to the lesion, with the other being 7 mm proximal to the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve. The wound site was next closed using nondegradable sutures. Animals were then randomized into two model treatment groups: (1) control; and (2) EpoB (<italic>n</italic> = 10 per group). Sham controls underwent identical surgery but were not subjected to a crush injury. Animals in the EpoB group were administered 1 ml of 150 &#x003bc;g/ml EpoB <italic>via</italic> intraperitoneal injection for 7 days (once/day) following injury. Identical volumes of saline were administered to all other animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Walking Track Assessment</title><p>At 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-injury, the behavior of rats was evaluated <italic>via</italic> walking track assessment. Briefly, animals were allowed to walk down a wooden alley (5.0 &#x000d7; 8.0 &#x000d7; 45.0 cm<sup>3</sup>) that had a dark goal box positioned at the far end. To monitor walking behavior, the plantar surfaces of these rat&#x02019;s feet were coated with acrylic paint, and white paper was used to cover the surface of the wooden alley. This enabled the visualization of anatomical landmarks within the resultant footprints. The prints were analyzed and utilized for the calculation of the sciatic functional index (SFI). This was repeated three more times to ensure footprints were clear enough for utilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Von Frey Hair Test</title><p>Von Frey hair test was performed for all animals at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-surgery. Before testing animals were given 1 h to habituate to a glass cubicle, with the bottom of this container containing wire mesh and a surface filled with 5 &#x000d7; 5 mm<sup>2</sup> holes that were 1 mm apart from one another. Rat tactile thresholds were evaluated by placing Von Frey filaments (NC12775; North Coast Medical, San Francisco, CA, USA) perpendicular to the planta pedis and pressing until a perceptible ~90&#x000b0; bend was evident for 6&#x02013;8 s. At the threshold, the animal is expected to respond by quickly flicking its paw away from the hair. Forces sufficient to induce dodging reactions, such as the withdrawal of the paw, licking or avoidance behaviors, jittering, or the like were recorded as a means of calculating withdrawal threshold values. This was repeated thrice by the same investigator, with an interval of 15 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Histological Analysis</title><p>Isolated sciatic nerve portions containing the injured site were separated into two sections at 28 days after sciatic crush injury.

Segments were then dehydrated, epoxy resin-embedded, and the distal nerve was cut to prepare transverse ultrathin sections (50 nm). Uranyl acetate and lead citrate were then used to stain these sections, followed by TEM (TECNAI Spirit, FEI, USA) evaluation. A total of six sections per nerve group were assessed at random to evaluate axonal regeneration, with six random fields of view per sample being analyzed. We measured myelin thickness (MT) and axonal diameter (AD) using the ImageJ software. Fiber diameter (FD) was calculated according to the formula: FD = 2 &#x000d7; MT + AD. The G-ratio (AD/FD) was also determined as a structural indicator including axonal myelination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence</title><p>Primary SCs were collected from newborn SD rats provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University, according to previously published procedures (Xia et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Briefly, animals were euthanized within 3 days of birth using cold alcohol (75%) followed by sciatic nerve extraction. The epineurium of the sciatic nerves was stripped and the endoneurium was combed under a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Scalpels were then used to mince these nerves into small pieces, after which 0.25% trypsin and 0.03% collagenase (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used to digest them for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Isolated cells were then cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 15% FCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and penicillin/streptomycin. At 24 h post-plating, cells were then treated for 48 h using cytosine arabinoside (10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M) as a means of preventing the proliferation of fibroblasts. Cells were then transferred to DMEM containing 2 mM forskolin (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich), 20 &#x003bc;g/ml bovine pituitary extract (Biomedical Technologies, MA, USA), and 15% FCS.</p><p>Cells were put into 6-well plates with coverslips for 24 h, followed by 4% PFA fixation and 0.15% Triton-mediated permeabilization. Then they were washed with PBS thrice and incubated using primary antibodies (1:100) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. These antibodies were specific for S-100 and p75 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Next, secondary antibodies (Cwbio; 1:10,000) were added for 1 h, followed by additional washing using PBS and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich) staining of cell nuclei. The ImageJ software was then used for enumerating p75NTR+ and S-100+ cells, revealing cell preparations to be highly pure (&#x0003e;96% SCs) as determined based upon the assessment of 5 random fields of view <italic>via</italic> confocal microscope (A1+, Nikon, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cell Viability Assay</title><p>SCs were added to 96-well plates (3,000/well, in quadruplicate).

Recent studies have increasingly recognized its regenerative effect in the central nervous system. Herein, the role of EpoB in nerve regeneration, and the mechanism underlying this, were investigated in the peripheral nervous system for the first time. The conclusions of the present study can be summarized as follows: (1) EpoB promotes nerve regeneration and remyelination, and of enhances functional recovery after nerve crush injury, suggesting that EpoB has a strong regenerative effect in the peripheral nervous system; (2) EpoB strongly promotes SC migration, a process which involves EpoB-enhanced autophagy; (3) EpoB inhibits the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which regulates the autophagy-mediated migration of SCs by EpoB. All of these findings indicate that EpoB plays a regenerative role after nerve injury in the peripheral nervous system, highlighting its therapeutic value in enhancing regeneration and functional recovery in cases of PNI.</p><p>PNI is highly prevalent in clinical settings, and generally results in nonreversible tissue atrophy and dysfunction, thereby extolling a significant burden on affected individuals, their families, and their societies (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Although recent research has made great advances in approaches to peripheral nerve repair, including nerve transplantation and the construction of nerve transplants (Fujimaki et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), the prognosis of patients with PNI remains poor. Moreover, surgical procedures that restore the anatomical continuity of the injured peripheral nerve have advanced, but show little effect on improving the regenerative capability of the injured neurons. Therefore, the search for a novel therapy that can enhance axonal regeneration has become urgent, in order to improve functional recovery after PNI.</p><p>EpoB belongs to the epothilone class of drugs, which are the group of microtubule-stabilizing agents. At present, EpoB has been approved for cancer therapy in clinics (Brogdon et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, many studies have identified the regenerative effect of EpoB in the central nervous system (Ballatore et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ruschel et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In an animal model of spinal cord injury, it was found that systemic subtoxic EpoB dosing improves axonal regeneration while also attenuating fibrotic scarring (Ruschel et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Similarly, in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage, EpoB has been shown to improve the integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway neural circuit, increase the number of dopaminergic neurons, and enhance the recovery of fine motor function (Ruschel et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Despite these findings relating to the central nervous system, the effect of EpoB on peripheral nerve regeneration has not been studied thus far. In the present study, we found that EpoB is capable of promoting nerve regeneration and remyelination, and of enhancing function recovery after nerve crush injury. This suggests that EpoB has a strong regenerative effect in the peripheral nervous system. However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of EpoB on nerve regeneration in the peripheral nervous system are unclear.</p><p>It was reported that Wallerian degeneration occurs after peripheral nerve injury. Axonal lesions undergo degeneration and fragmentation, with myelin undergoing transformation into a neutral fat that can be taken up by macrophages. Axonal and myelin sheath debris also produce ovoids that are eventually broken down until no longer evident (Campbell, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). SCs are glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, which are capable of enhancing nerve regeneration in both the peripheral and central nervous system (Aszmann et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Novikova et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). SCs play a key role in facilitating the regeneration of nervous system tissue given that they serve as a soruce of bioactive compounds that can support axonal migration and the release of compounds capable of controlling axonal outgrowth and remyelination (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In addition, the migratory ability of SCs has been widely accepted as a key process for guiding axonal elongation. In PNI, especially in peripheral nerve gap injury, axonal regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> is limited by the extent of SC migration (Torigoe et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Therefore, many studies have attempted to evaluate the feasibility of enhancing peripheral nerve regeneration by promoting SC migration. It has been shown that matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) promotes axonal regeneration and remyelination by enhancing SC migration after sciatic nerve injury in rats (Wang H. et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In addition, enhancing SC migration using concentration gradients of laminin-derived peptides has been shown to support axonal regeneration over a large nerve gap, further confirming the role of SC migration in axonal regeneration (Motta et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Herein, to our surprise, EpoB (1 nM) showed little effect on the viability or apoptosis of SCs, but significantly enhanced SC migration. This indicates that EpoB might promote axonal regeneration by enhancing SC migration.</p><p>Autophagy is a key pathway that controls the breakdown of proteins and organelles, and it plays key roles in maintaining approrpaite cellular homeostasis <italic>via</italic> controlling catabolic activities in response to stress to improve energy and amino acid availability (Mizushima et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Autophagy is associated with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Huntington&#x02019;s disease and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (Bar-Yosef et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In addition, autophagy is critical in the remodeling of presynaptic and postsynaptic constituents to sustain neuronal function (Ger&#x000f3;nimo-Olvera and Massieu, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). An increasing number of studies have identified the role of autophagy in regulating cell migration, with diverse functions in different cell types (Zhao et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) promotes cellular invasion and migration by inducing autophagy in breast cancer cells (Huang et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), while <italic>let-7</italic> activates radial migration of newborn neurons <italic>via</italic> enhancing autophagy (Petri et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In contrast, metformin has been found to enhance levels of autophagy and inhibit the migration of endothelial progenitor cells (Li W. D. et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In a recent study, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1&#x003b1; or CXCL12) showed a pivotal role in regulating SC migration by enhancing autophagy after facial nerve injury (Gao et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). We found that EpoB induced autophagy in SCs, and that inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA was capable of inhibiting the EpoB-enhanced SC migration. All of these findings suggest that EpoB might promote SC migration by enhancing autophagy.</p><p>The molecules and pathways associated with regulating autophagy in SCs are still unclear. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays key roles in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, survival, and metabolism (Yu and Cui, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). PI3K/Akt signaling plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular stability by weakening the expression of neuronal apoptosis-related downstream molecules, such as cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax. This results in Bcl-2/Beclin-1 complex dissociation and subsequently leads to the autophagy response (Gao et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Miao et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It has been reported that the PI3K kinase inhibitor LY294002 is capable of blocking autophagosome formation (Du et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, sevoflurane post-conditioning has been found to attenuate traumatic brain injury-induced neuronal apoptosis by promoting autophagy <italic>via</italic> the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (He et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, thus far, the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in regulating autophagy in SCs has been unclear. In the present study, we examined the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in autophagy-mediated SC migration by EpoB. We found that EpoB treatment results in the inactivation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Further investigations showed that IGF-1, a PI3K/Akt pathway enhancer, is capable of inhibiting the autophagy and migration of SCs induced by EpoB. In contrast, LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor) was found to increase cell migration, an effect which was reversed by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. Circ-Spidr downregulation has been found to suppress DRG neuron axonal regeneration following injury to the sciatic nerve, partially <italic>via</italic> modulation of PI3K-Akt signaling (Mao et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Maybe EpoB increase axonal regeneration of DRG neurons <italic>via</italic> the inhibiting of PI3K/Akt pathway immediately, which needs further research. Thus, these findings raise the posibility that PI3K/Akt signaling plays a key role in EpoB-induced autophagy, which is involved in EpoB-enhanced SC migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, it was found that EpoB is capable of promoting axonal regeneration and remyelination, as well as functional recovery in a rat model of nerve crush injury.
