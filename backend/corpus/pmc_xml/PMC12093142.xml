Pathways monitoring this shuttling rely on the nature of the macromolecules to be exported or imported. Notably, whereas bulk mRNA export occurs via the NXF1/TAP1 pathway after its association with TREX complex, the exportin CRM1 (XPO1) mediates the export of proteins containing a nuclear export signal (NES). These cargoes may be associated or not with a specific subset of RNA such as rRNA, snRNA and some mRNA [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. NES are characterised by a specific stretch of four hydrophobic amino acids with variable interspaced amino acids that influences NES affinities to CRM1. The formation of the complex between CRM1 and the NES containing protein also requires the GTPase Ran to conformationally stabilise the NES binding groove of CRM1 [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the affinity of many NES substrates for CRM1 is rather low, suggesting that the formation of this trimeric transport complex is a rate-limiting step in nuclear export [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>]. At the nuclear pore, Ran GAP catalyses the conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP, inducing the dissociation of the trimeric complex CRM1/Cargo/Ran and the release of the cargo in the cytoplasm. Ultimately, the free CRM1 re-enter the nucleus for a new round of export [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among the plethora of functionally and structurally unrelated protein and RNP cargoes, the mislocalisation of several of them due to CRM1 dysfunction supports a role of CRM1 in disease: that is the case of proteins involved in the control of DNA repair, cell cycle, transcription regulation, or apoptosis such as BARD1, p21, p27, p53, FOXO3, APC, and Survivin [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, CRM1 overexpression and mutations were directly correlated with multiple types of cancer, notably acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a consequence, CRM1 was considered as a valuable target for anticancer therapies. CRM1 inhibitors where shown to sensitise cancer cells to apoptosis and several of them are currently under clinic trials [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>An important subset of CRM1 cargoes includes proteins involved in RNA processing. Notably, the DNA/RNA helicase UPF1 and its partner UPF2 have been reported to shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus via CRM1: interactions were identified by mass spectrometry and treatments with the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B, induced their nuclear retention [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>]. However, the impact of a shuttling perturbation on their cellular functions have never been evaluated. UPF1 works at the crossroad of multiple processes for DNA and RNA maintenance and is directly involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. NMD targets and degrades mRNA harbouring premature termination codons (PTC) due to the assembly of a NMD promoting complex around UPF1 between the terminating ribosome and a downstream Exon Junction Complex [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;30</xref>]. In addition to PTC containing RNA, NMD was shown to target several viral RNA (vRNA), exerting an intrinsic antiviral function [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;37</xref>]. Particularly, the unspliced vRNA from the human delta retrovirus HTLV-1 is destabilised in a UPF1- and UPF2-dependent manner [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To counter this threat and fully express their compact genome, virus evolved different bypass strategies [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. During HTLV-1 infection, the viral proteins Tax and Rex were shown to trans-inhibit NMD [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Tax directly binds UPF1 and exerts a dual inhibiting effect, repressing its ATPase activity and ultimately NMD [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently, Nakano <italic toggle="yes">et&#x000a0;al.</italic> showed that the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-terminal domain of Rex as well as its phosphorylation were critical for Rex/UPF1 interaction, suggesting this could lead to the incorporation of Rex in NMD complexes [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A clear mechanism of inhibition is still to be deciphered.</p><p>Interestingly, viruses also express NES containing proteins, such as the retroviral protein Rex from HTLV-1 [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Its role in the vRNA export to the cytoplasm has been extensively studied: Rex interferes with the host splicing machinery, stabilises vRNA over spliced isoforms and hijacks the cellular shuttling machinery to export vRNA towards translation or viral encapsidation [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;47</xref>]. Notably, its nuclear localisation signal (NLS) favours an importin&#x003b2;&#x02212;dependent&#x000a0;nuclear translocation [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] where it accumulates in the nucleoli and binds the highly basic arginine-rich motif of the vRNA called &#x0201c;Rex responsive element (RxRE)&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It also displays a dual multimerisation motif encompassing the NES [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It was proposed that Rex interacts with CRM1, multimerises and then binds the vRNA, leading to the export of this mRNP. The cytoplasmic accumulation of vRNA, resulting from the hijack of CRM1, then allows the translation of the structural precursor polyprotein GAG and the packaging of two vRNA copies within the newly synthesised viral particles [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>While the causative role of CRM1 in disease strongly stresses the importance of a correct repartition of cargoes between nucleus and cytoplasm, understanding the impact of CRM1 hijacking by retroviral adapters on the cellular homeostasis is barely evoked in the literature. Thus, in this work, we investigated how the hijacking of CRM1 by HTLV-1 Rex affects the relationship between CRM1 and the cargo UPF1: on one hand, Rex stabilises the UPF1/CRM1 interaction, provoking the nuclear accumulation of UPF1 and repressing its association with cellular RNA. As a consequence, this inhibits NMD, one of the cellular functions of UPF1. On the other hand, Rex drives the selective repositioning of UPF1 on the vRNA, irrespective of NMD. We found that UPF1 stimulates vRNA export and viral particles maturation, ultimately supporting the infectiveness of the infected cells. Our work thus demonstrates that Rex and CRM1 orchestrate an unexpected switch in the role of the helicase UPF1 during HTLV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Mutagenesis</title><p>To construct Rex mutant plasmids, directed mutagenesis was carried out as follow: a 20 cycles polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done with Phusion polymerase, 2 &#x003bc;M of complementary primers with the point mutation and 50 ng of the parental plasmid (pCMV Rex WT).

Then colocalisation pixel was performed on 8-bit gray scale images with the function &#x02018;image calculator&#x02019; and &#x02018;AND&#x02019; command between channels of interest. Gray scale was used to identify common pixels. To determine the % of cells with a nuclear accumulation of UPF1, we determine a threshold on the number of common pixels between UPF1 and nucleus to class cells. For the nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio quantification of UPF1 signal, the detection of cytoplasmic and nucleus regions of interest (ROIs) was determined on the signal strength from UPF1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CRM1 channels and Hoechst&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CRM1 channels respectively, then manually verified and/or adjusted. To avoid quantification bias from disparate cell thickness and proximity of different cells, cytoplasmic ROI was restricted to a ring of 20 pixels width around the nuclear ROI. Then, nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was extracted from fluorescence intensity mean in each ROI. These segmentation and quantification processes have been done using Fiji macros available here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://gitbio.ens-lyon.fr/sdebosso/mocquet/" ext-link-type="uri">https://gitbio.ens-lyon.fr/sdebosso/mocquet/</ext-link>. <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;54 for control, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;36 for Rex, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37 for Rev, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;67 for C91PL and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;66 for C8166 conditions. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values were calculated by performing first Fischer test then a Student&#x02019;s t-test (paired, two-tailed) ns: <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05; *<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; **<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01.

The chimeric mCherry is considered as a model of shuttling protein, with a strong NES and an intermediate NLS [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. While the mCherry was distributed among nucleus and cytoplasm with a more frequent cytoplasmic accumulation, the overexpression of Rex led to a significant nuclear retention, as indicated by the nucleo-cytoplamsic ratio measurement (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). To confirm this result with an endogenous protein, we looked at the RNA helicase UPF1, which nuclear export relies on CRM1 as well [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>] (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1A and B</xref>).

First, Rex and CRM1 co-immunoprecipitations (coIP) confirmed that Rex binds specifically to endogenous CRM1, regardless of the expression of the RxRE RNA (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). This supports the hypothesis that Rex can hijack CRM1 before its binding to vRNA. Secondly, we revealed that endogenous UPF1 is able to coIP CRM1 and Rex. As expected, the amounts of CRM1 associated with UPF1 are increased when Rex is expressed, confirming the previously observed accumulation or stabilisation of the CRM1-UPF1 complex by Rex (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref> panel (i)). Moreover, the co-expression of the RxRE containing RNA and/or RNAse treatments did modify neither the UPF1-Rex association nor the UPF1-CRM1 enhanced interaction (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref> panel (i) and (ii)). This indicates that the enhanced association of UPF1 and CRM1 exists independently of cellular and vRNA. Finally, we confirmed the role of Rex in this UPF1-CRM1 association by using 2 Rex mutants (on the NES and the NLS domains). We found that the normal levels of CRM1/UPF1 association are rescued in both Rex mutants&#x02019; conditions compared to Rex WT (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and quantifications in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3B&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><p>Here we found that Rex expression provokes UPF1 nuclear retention as well as the accumulation or stabilisation of UPF1&#x02013;CRM1 complexes, in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm.

First, while the NES of UPF1 was roughly characterised to date, we precisely delineated it, upstream the CH domain between positions 89 and 103 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4A and B</xref>). Then, we performed two molecular dynamic models based on the structural representation of CRM1 interacting with an NES peptide (PDB 3GJX) and the two different resolved structures of UPF1: the closed form, a configuration with the CH domain positioned on the RecA2 domain (PDB 2XZL), and the open form, a more relaxed configuration with the CH domain flipped out on the RecA1 side (PDB 2WJV). After 1000 ns of simulation, the UPF1 open form complexed with CRM1 was stabilised in a more compact configuration (according to the radius of gyration) and with a larger buried surface area (BSA) than the UPF1 closed form (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4C and D</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Movies 1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). The BSA, which measures the size of the interface in a protein&#x02013;protein complex, is directly proportional with affinity. Moreover, it was recently suggested that in the open form of UPF1, unstructured regions are inserted in the RNA-binding channel, rationalising that open UPF1 has a low RNA binding efficiency [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Therefore, we suspected that when Rex is expressed, the enhanced interaction between CRM1 and UPF1 is more susceptible to involve the open conformation of UPF1, leading to a decreased affinity for RNA. To confront this hypothesis, we carried out RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays by UPF1: HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid coding a reporter mRNA (Globin PTC, a globin minigene with a PTC in the second exon [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) as well as Rex coding plasmids. UPF1 was further immunoprecipitated and the amounts of bound Globin PTC were quantified by RTqPCR. Rex expression as well as UPF1 immunoprecipitations were checked by western blot. When Rex is expressed, the level of Globin PTC associated to UPF1 is significantly reduced compared to conditions without Rex (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5A</xref>). In addition, to correlate this effect with the previously described UPF1&#x02013;CRM1 complex, we also carried out UPF1 RIP experiments in cells transfected with Rex NES mutant. As expected, while the Rex NES mutant couldn&#x02019;t enhance the interaction between UPF1 and CRM1, it did not affect UPF1 binding capacity to globin PTC either (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). This recovery confirms that CRM1 hijacking by Rex leads to a decreased association of UPF1 to its RNA substrate.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Rex expression leads to UPF1 reduced association to RNA, what is functionally link to NMD inhibition.

As NMD requires UPF1 recruitment to RNA to initiate their degradation, we checked whether the defect of UPF1 binding on RNA upon Rex expression could correlate with NMD inhibition. To do so, we analysed the decay rate of the Globin PTC mRNA (that is an NMD sensitive reporter mRNA) with or without Rex expression, by monitoring the RNA levels after cell exposure to the transcription inhibitor DRB. Here, Rex expression led to a significant decrease in the decay rate of Globin PTC (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). To control the specificity of this result, the decay rate of an NMD unsensitive RNA (Globin WT, a globin minigene without PTC) was analysed as well. As expected, without Rex, the decay rate of Globin WT is lower than that of Globin PTC. When Rex is expressed, the decay rate of Globin WT is unaffected&#x000a0;and is of similar value as that of Globin PTC. The expression of a RxRE containing RNA did not significantly modify Rex&#x02019; impact on the Globin PTC decay rate (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Finally, by using the sunset assay, we confirmed that these observations are not related to a possible translation inhibition by Rex (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>). These results confirm that Rex specifically and efficiently inhibits NMD. To correlate this Rex-dependent NMD inhibition with our previous observations, we analysed the effect of the Rex NES mutant on Globin PTC mRNA half-life (as another indication of NMD efficiency). Consistently with previous results, Globin PTC half-life is significantly increased by the expression of Rex WT compared to control condition (9.9 versus 2.9 h) reflecting NMD inhibition. Conversely, Rex NES partially lost its ability to inhibit NMD as showed by the restored Globin PTC half-life (3.8 h). As a control, we also monitored the effect of Rex NLS mutant, that couldn&#x02019;t either support NMD inhibition (2.3 h) (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5C</xref>). Finally, to confirm that Rex expression inhibits NMD via the alteration of CRM1 behaviour, we measured the decay rates and half-lives of Globin PTC with different combinations of Rex and CRM1 overexpression (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5D and E</xref>): while Rex stabilised Globin PTC mRNA, the combined overexpression of Rex and CMR1 partially restored mRNA decay. To the opposite, CRM1 overexpression without Rex did not modify Globin PTC decay rate. Confocal microscopy observations were also performed with these four conditions, revealing that the NMD partial rescue was correlated with the partial restoration of UPF1 cellular distribution, as supported by the quantification of the nucleo/cytoplasmic ratio. Interestingly, we also observed a modification of Rex localisation towards the cytoplasm or at the nuclear periphery (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5F</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these results suggest that Rex by favouring the interaction between UPF1 and CRM1 in the nucleus may decrease UPF1 association with RNA and inhibits NMD.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>CRM1 hijacking by another retrovirus also interferes with UPF1 cellular localisation and its NMD function.</title><p>CRM1 hijacking is a hallmark of several complex retroviruses [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For instance, HIV-1 express Rev, a functional homolog of HTLV-1 Rex; although these proteins share low sequence homology, they both display similar functional domains such as RNA binding domain, NLS, dual multimerisation domain, and NES. Rev also shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, hijacks CRM1, and exports the unspliced vRNA [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Moreover, a UPF1/Rev/CRM1 complex has already been described [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. As an alternative method to reinforce our observations that support an impact of CRM1 hijacking on UPF1 activity, we investigated the impact of Rev expression as we did previously with Rex. Thus, we directly looked at the endogenous UPF1 intracellular distribution under Rev expression by confocal microscopy. Rev strongly colocalises with UPF1 and CRM1 in nucleolar compartments (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> (i) and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6A</xref>). As for Rex, a significant nuclear retention of UPF1 can be quantified when Rev is expressed compared to control condition (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> (ii)). To further compare Rex and Rev impact on UPF1, we checked whether the Rev-mediated nuclear localisation of UPF1 can be also correlated with NMD inhibition. We found an increased half-life of Globin PTC after Rev expression compared to control condition (4.3 versus 1.6 h, Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), suggesting that Rev is able to inhibit NMD and to alter the stability of non-vRNAs. Moreover, as Rev-mediated inhibition of NMD is reported here for the first time, we further characterised the specificity of our observations: first, we excluded a translation defect by carrying out a sunset assay, as previously done for Rex (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6B</xref>). Secondly, we monitored Rev impact on the decay rate of Globin WT and compared it to Globin PTC. As expected, the decay rate of Globin WT was barely affected by Rev expression while that of Globin PTC was significantly decreased (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Furthermore, to determine whether these observations could be verified in the context of HIV-1 infection, we analysed HeLa cells pre-transfected with Globin reporters and infected for 48 h with HIV-GFP lentiviral particles (HIV) or lentiviral particles expressing GFP only (VLPCtr) as control. While the decay rate of Globin WT was not affected by HIV infection, that of Globin PTC was significantly reduced, indicating that HIV infection is able to inhibit NMD (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate a specific NMD inhibition during HIV infection, which occurs in a Rev-dependent manner.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>HIV-1 Rev promotes similar defects in UPF1 functions as HTLV-1 Rex.

We correlated it with higher levels of UPF1&#x02013;CRM1 interaction, a reduced affinity for cellular RNA and NMD inhibition. Now, in order to investigate this process in physiologically relevant cellular models, we used three HTLV-1 chronically infected CD4&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;T cell lines: C91PL and HUT102 that express Rex protein, and C8166 that displays a defect in Rex expression, as confirmed by western blot and confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7B</xref>). As a negative control, we also used uninfected Jurkat CD4&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;T cells. CoIP experiments confirm that UPF1 interacts with Rex in infected lymphocytes; moreover, in Rex expressing cells, UPF1 interacts with CRM1 in higher proportions than in Rex-deprived cells (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, compare lanes 1&#x02013;2 to 3&#x02013;4). Then, we examined the intracellular distribution of UPF1 and CRM1 in C91PL and C8166 by confocal microscopy. We found a nuclear retention of UPF1 in &#x0223c;75% of C91PL compared to &#x0223c;30% in Rex negative C8166 cells (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7A</xref>). Z-stack analysis confirmed these conclusions (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Noteworthy, overlapping perinuclear foci of UPF1 and CRM1 were also observed in C91PL (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). In the context of HTLV infection, the direct correlation between intracellular redistribution of UPF1/CRM1 and NMD inhibition is made difficult because both C8166 and C91PL cells express the viral protein Tax, another NMD inhibitor that we characterised in the past [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In these cell lines, the expression of Tax is well documented [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and its localisation is not linked to either Rex or CRM1 distribution profiles (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7B and C</xref> and [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). To evaluate NMD activity in a close model without Tax interference, we measured the half-life of the Globin PTC reporter in HeLa cells transfected with different mutated versions of a HTLV molecular clone (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7D</xref>).

Knowing that the Rex/CRM1 complex binds selectively to unspliced vRNA to drive its nuclear export, and that Rex and CRM1 modify UPF1 localisation and affinity for RNA, we questioned the interplay between UPF1 and vRNA. First, we carried out UPF1 RIP experiments in C8166 and C91PL cells, as well as in Jurkat T cells as a negative control. Unexpectedly, we found that UPF1 RIP were specifically enriched in vRNA in the Rex expressing cells only (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7F</xref>). To investigate whether this association is related to NMD activation, we carried out RIP targeting UPF2, a NMD cofactor of UPF1. We found no enrichment of vRNA after UPF2 RIP in C91PL compared to C8166, in contrast to the RIP targeting UPF1 and Rex (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7G</xref>). In addition, we performed UPF2 coIP in C91PL extracts: an interaction between UPF2 and CRM1 was found as expected since UPF2 is a known cargo of CRM1. However, no specific association between Rex and UPF2 could be found, unlike UPF1 (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Thus, these experiments demonstrate that the increased recruitment of UPF1 to vRNA and its incorporation in the vRNP is independent of UPF2 and subsequently independent of NMD activation. Then, we asked whether UPF1 and Rex can bind concomitantly to vRNA. To do so, we carried out double-RIP experiments. First, an RIP targeting a transiently expressed HA-tagged UPF1 was performed (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, RIP1). Cells without HA-UPF1 expression were used as a control. Secondly, RNAs were natively eluted and further subjected to a second RIP against Rex (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, RIP2) or using a control immunoglobulin. RTqPCR on each RIP revealed a significant enrichment of vRNA associated to UPF1 as well as Rex, but to a lower amount. Thus, UPF1 can be recruited on vRNA concomitantly with Rex, in a Rex-dependent manner but independently of its NMD function. To clarify if this recruitment is controlled by the formation of the previously characterised CRM1&#x02013;UPF1&#x02013;Rex complex, RIP experiments were carried out on 293T cells transfected with the HTLV-R23L molecular clone (deficient for Rex expression) complemented with plasmids encoding Rex WT or Rex NES mutant. As a reminder, we have shown previously that Rex NES mutant can neither interact with CRM1 nor stabilise UPF1/CRM1 interaction (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). RIP Rex experiments showed similar enrichment of vRNA with Rex WT and NES mutant proteins. In contrast, enrichment of vRNA in the UPF1 RIP was drastically reduced with the Rex NES mutant compared with the Rex WT protein (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). Finally, we performed an RIP with UPF1 WT or NES mutant in 293T cells, expressing a WT viral molecular clone: UPF1 NES mutant couldn&#x02019;t bind vRNA to the contrary of UPF1 WT (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7H</xref>).

Cells were then treated twice with doxycycline to ensure the lowest levels of UPF1, prior to expression of Rex and a Luciferase reporter to monitor Rex-dependent export (FLucRxRE) [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

To further link the hijacking of UPF1 in the vRNP and the stimulation of vRNA export, we test the impact of UPF1 NES mutant with this assay since we showed that this mutant is deficient in vRNA binding, even in the presence of Rex: first endogenous UPF1 levels are reduced with siRNA treatments to reduce the background; then different combinations of Rex and UPF1 WT or mutant plasmids are transfected. As expected, we found that UPF1 NES mutant has a reduced capacity to stimulate vRNA export, supporting the importance of the UPF1/CRM1 interaction and UPF1 loading on vRNA in the process (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Accordingly, these results reveal a positive role for UPF1 in promoting Rex-dependent export of vRNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>UPF1 controls different steps of the viral replication cycle.

As previously mentioned, the fate of cytoplasmic vRNA is to be translated into structural viral proteins and enzymes or encapsidated in viral particles. To do so, we proceeded with UPF1 extinction before the expression of a replicative HTLV-1 molecular clone in 293T cells. Viral protein and vRNA from whole-cell extract or from the ECF that corresponds to cell-associated virions contained in viral biofilms) were analysed (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). First, western blots showed that the levels of the GAG precursor, encoded by vRNA, were similar with or without UPF1 (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref> (i)). During viral particle formation, GAG maturation leads to its proteolytic cleavage into the nucleocapsid (NC/p15), the matrix (MA/p19), and the capsid (CA/p24). Unexpectedly, we observed by western blot that mature p19 and p24 were less present in whole-cell extracts deprived from UPF1 (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref> (i)). To confirm this, FACS was performed on permeabilised cells using antibodies against UPF1 or p19. UPF1 knock-down was associated with a &#x0223c;50% decrease in the p19 mean fluorescence (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S8A</xref>). We also performed ELISA on whole-cell extracts as well as on the corresponding ECF. In both fractions, UPF1 decrease was associated with weaker p19 signals (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Western blots confirmed that ECF from UPF1-depleted cells contained less p19 and p24. However, western blot on the ECF showed that the levels of viral envelope (Env) were less, if at all, affected by UPF1 knock-down (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref> (ii)). Corroborating that observation, FACS analysis performed on non-permeabilised cells using the anti-HTLV serum or an anti-Env antibody did not reveal a significant decrease of the cell surface mean fluorescence (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S8B</xref>). Concerning vRNA, qRT-PCR showed an increase in whole-cell extracts deprived from UPF1 that was expected, due to NMD inhibition. To the contrary, qRT-PCR on ECF purified RNA revealed a lower level of vRNA in the absence of UPF1 (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the hijacking of UPF1 by Rex was linked with NMD inhibition. Thus, we checked whether the defect in p19 levels is directly due to the absence of UPF1 or indirectly due to NMD inhibition. Prior infection, 293T cells were treated with siRNA against UPF1 or UPF2: the monitoring of p19 by FACS confirmed that the absence of UPF1 provoked the reduction in p19 levels. To the contrary, UPF2 knock-down exerted no significant effect. The treatment of infected cells with the NMD inhibiting drug SMG1i, although strikingly preventing UPF1 phosphorylation necessary for NMD, had no significant effect on p19 either (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S8C</xref>). The data thus confirmed that the impact of UPF1 on GAG maturation are independent of NMD.</p><p>Having demonstrated the loading of UPF1 on vRNA, as well as the defect in vRNA packaging and viral particle maturation in the absence of UPF1, we wondered whether this might reflect the presence of UPF1 in the viral particles, where GAG maturation would occur after budding. First, we monitored the localisation of the viral matrix (MA/p19) and UPF1 in infected T cells. As expected, C8166 cannot express p19 due to a defect in Rex expression. In C91PL, p19 is displayed as foci at the cell periphery corresponding to the accumulation of virions on the cell surface [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The immunostaining profiles of UPF1 and p19 IF overlap at these foci (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9A</xref>). This suggests that UPF1 is present at budding sites and could effectively be incorporated into viral particles. To address this point, we isolated the ECF of 15&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> infected cells, which contains most of the viral particles produced by the cell, forming a viral biofilm bound to the cell membrane as described previously [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The presence of viral particles was detected in C91PL only, as shown by monitoring p19 using western blot (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>). The absence of cellular contamination of ECF was controlled by probing the cytoplasmic protein RRM2. Finally, UPF1 was clearly identified in ECF from C91PL, but not on that of C8166 or controlled non-infected cells (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>). UPF1 RIP were also performed and revealed that UPF1 is bound to vRNA in ECF (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>). To quantitatively evaluate the levels of UPF1 in viral particles produced by C91PL-infected cells, mass spectrometry experiments were performed on C91PL ECF as well as on purified virions released in C91PL culture supernatants (named &#x02018;free particles&#x02019;). UPF1 was detected in both fractions. As expected, UPF2 and RRM2 cannot be detected (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9B</xref>). The same experiments was also performed with uninfected CEM T-cells known to produce and released membrane bound extracellular vesicles [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A quantitative analysis showed that although UPF1 is present in the fraction derived from uninfected cells, it was significantly enriched in the C91PL one, that specifically contains viral particles (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref> and Supplementary Table). However, UPF1 is identified as a relatively low concentrated protein in the HTLV-1 viral particles (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9C</xref>). Altogether, these data confirm the presence of vRNA bound UPF1 in viral particles.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>UPF1 is loaded into the viral particles produced by the virus.

HTLV-1 transmission occurs via cell to cell contact, through viral biofilm in which viral particles are accumulated, and drastically improve the transmission rate [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. To assess the impact of UPF1 depletion on HTLV infectivity and spread, co-cultures between C91PL (expressing or not a UPF1 shRNA) and Jurkat-Luc reporter cells (expressing luciferase under the HTLV LTR) were performed as previously described [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The significant reduction of UPF1, obtained after 6 days of shRNA induction, was associated with a decrease in p19 levels, consistent with our results on HTLV infected 293T cells (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9D</xref>). Under these conditions, the decrease in UPF1 levels resulted in a drastic reduction (&#x0223c; 60%) of viral transmission to uninfected Jurkat cells after 24 h of co-culture (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). Collectively, these results showed that UPF1 defect altered the packaging of vRNA and the assembly or maturation of HTLV-1 viral particles. Ultimately, this multistep process support the virus capacity to transmit infectious virions to neighbouring cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the hijacking of the exportin CRM1 by retroviral adapter, such as HTLV-1 Rex, is combined with the hijack of the RNA helicase UPF1. On one side, it affects cellular functions such as NMD; on the other side, it favours the loading of UPF1 on vRNA to exerts functions independent of NMD, which promote viral replication and transmission (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>Discussion</title><p>By regulating the intracellular distribution of hundreds of proteins and some specific RNA species, CRM1 export pathway is an important process controlling the cellular homeostasis. As introduced earlier, complex retroviruses like HTLV-1 and HIV-1 use retroviral adapters, respectively Rex and Rev, to export their vRNA via CRM1. While the mechanistic steps of this export are already described, the cellular consequences of CRM1 hijacking have not been addressed yet. Here, we sought to characterise how the hijacking of CRM1 by Rex could affect the CRM1 cargo named UPF1, a RNA/DNA helicase involved in NMD, a well described RNA decay process with antiviral functions.</p><p>Our data showed that in Rex expressing cells, more CRM1 is associated to UPF1 especially in the nucleus. This complex relies on the combined interactions between UPF1, CRM1, and Rex. We hypothesised that we face a sequestration complex, altering UPF1-CRM1 flux and recycling, ultimately repressing nuclear export. In this context, we confirmed that, UPF1 displays nuclear retention. Moreover, we proposed a model for the UPF1/CRM1 complex, based on the characterisation of UPF1 NES domain and molecular dynamic simulations. Consistent with the observed enhanced interaction with CRM1, the most stable complex involves a conformation of UPF1 with a lower affinity for RNA [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These simulations were challenged by RIP experiments <italic toggle="yes">in cellulo</italic>, and we were able to link this UPF1&#x02013;CRM1 complex with a defect in UPF1 binding to all cellular RNA, sensitive or not to NMD. Finally, we confirmed that NMD was repressed following Rex expression, as shown previously [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; more interestingly, we demonstrated that this inhibition can be due to the capacity of Rex to hijack and shuttle with CRM1. Similar results were obtained in HTLV-1 chronically infected cells, confirming their physiological relevance.</p><p>Recently, <italic toggle="yes">Nakano et al</italic>. published that overexpressed UPF1 can interact with Rex in the cytoplasm and P-bodies and that the inhibition of NMD depends on several domains of Rex including its Nter part (ARM NLS and X domains) [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Here, we report an interaction between Rex and endogenous UPF1, which is sensitive to a mutation in the NLS domain of Rex, in accordance with their observations. In addition, PLA experiments indicate that this interaction occurs in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic complexes could match with the hypothesis of <italic toggle="yes">Nakano et al</italic>., who suggests that Rex is recruited to NMD complexes via UPF1, while nuclear foci would be relevant to the UPF1/CRM1/Rex complex that we described here and would support a model for UPF1 nuclear accumulation under Rex control. Indeed, using PLA, we also quantified an increase of nuclear UPF1/CRM1 foci upon Rex expression. In our model, to the contrary of <italic toggle="yes">Nakano et al</italic>., Rex ultimately prevents the incorporation of UPF1 in NMD complexes, as indicated by the lower affinity for RNA and the exclusion of UPF2. This inhibition is partially rescued when the cytoplasmic localisation of UPF1 is restored after overexpression of CRM1. This highlights that the Rex-mediated NMD inhibition can rely on its ability to alter CRM1 export.</p><p>In order to reinforce the demonstration that CRM1 hijacking by a retroviral adapter can alter NMD, we alternatively investigated the effect of HIV-1 Rev: Rev is the functional homolog of Rex encoded by HIV-1 but both share little sequence identity. Although the sequential steps leading to the formation of an export complex with Rex and Rev may diverge, both result in the formation of a viral adapter multimer interacting with vRNA and CRM1. As expected, Rev expression led to similar observations with slight differences: strikingly, Rev induced stronger UPF1 nuclear retention, essentially in nucleolus, while the nuclear staining of UPF1 was diffuse in the presence of Rex. These divergences may be due to specific mechanisms of CRM1 hijacking. Interestingly, this demonstration also points out for the first time that HIV-1 is able to trans-inhibit NMD in a Rev-dependent manner, affecting the stability of non-vRNA. In the cell, NMD exerts an important role during post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Notably, it controls pathways involved in the equilibrium between proliferation and differentiation, stress response, and immune response. With regards to this role, it is expected that CRM1 hijacking by Rex and Rev lead to specific post-transcriptional deregulations due to NMD inhibition. Some of these deregulations have already been addressed [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], but a dedicated study is still needed to unravel the significance of these effects during viral infection.</p><p>During HIV-1 replication, UPF1 is involved in vRNA export with Rev and CRM1; moreover, <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> protein-protein docking analyses suggested that these interactions occur in a region that overlaps with the UPF2 binding site of UPF1, thereby protecting vRNA from NMD activation [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], [<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. UPF1 does not affect the viral particle formation but is encapsidated and favors post-entry steps of the infection [<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. With HTLV-1, we found that CRM1 ability to interact with Rex and UPF1 favours this latter recruitment onto vRNA. Considering our observations about UPF1&#x02013;CRM1 complex affinity for RNA, it is probable that Rex mediates this recruitment via its RNA binding motif and the RxRE motif of vRNA. Thus, UPF1 undergoes a switch from cellular mRNA to vRNA that is not linked with NMD activation, as it occurs independently from UPF2. We clearly established that UPF1 plays a positive role in the Rex-dependent vRNA export. Furthermore, we found that in the absence of UPF1, the maturation of structural proteins MA (p19) and CA (p24) was impaired: a decrease in MA and CA levels was observed in cell extracts as well as in the ECF where infectious viral particles accumulate. This reduction is unlikely to be due to the repression of vRNA export, since the GAG precursor (pr53GAG) levels were barely affected. Moreover, NMD inhibition by UPF2 extinction or SMG1 inhibition didn&#x02019;t affect MA maturation, confirming that UPF1 acts in an NMD independent manner. Importantly, the expression of the viral envelope was not significantly affected. Altogether, those observations revealed a role of UPF1 in establishing a correct balance between the different structural proteins that compose the viral particle. We may hypothesise that at the site of viral particles budding, UPF1, bound to vRNA, controls specific maturation steps leading to the production of complete, infectious virions. In support of this hypothesis, we provided evidence that (i) UPF1 is loaded itself into viral particles bound to vRNA and that in its absence, vRNA are less incorporated in the viral particles; (ii) viral infectivity from C91PL was clearly repressed when UPF1 levels were reduced. The importance of helicases during the packaging steps has been reported for some viruses in the past: Rep52/40 DNA helicases from AAV-2 are required to translocate single-stranded DNA genomes into preformed empty capsids [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] while NS3 is required for the packaging of YFV vRNA [<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Retroviruses that lack viral helicases rely on the host's ones : DDX6 is re-directed to the assembly site of foamy virus particles and drags vRNA into them [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]; for HIV-1, DDX6 directly facilitates capsid assembly while DDX24 promotes the packaging of vRNA [<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The new function revealed in this work for UPF1 during HTLV-1 maturation might be in line with this. However, deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms will require further investigation.</p><p>Finally, this work opens new perspectives on the regulation of NMD: in the past, the nuclear import of UPF1 by the importin &#x003b2;1 was stressed out as a sensitive step [<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Here, the expression of viral proteins shows that the modulation of the CRM1-dependent export also impacts on NMD, underscoring the importance of the nucleo/cytoplasmic shuttling process as a node of NMD regulation. In line with this, our study led to the precise delineation of the NES domain of UPF1 and a model of interaction between both proteins. Further investigations are needed to understand how the NMD can be controlled at this step in the absence of viral infection.</p><p>In conclusion, these results are the proof of concept that CRM1 subjugation by retroviral proteins can affect cellular pathways. Notably, it trans-inhibits the NMD via the formation of a complex trapping UPF1 in a conformation with low affinity for RNA. Unexpectedly, the hijacked UPF1 shifts from an antiviral to a proviral function: it is redirected on the vRNA with Rex, where it is isolated from its NMD partner UPF2 to stimulate vRNA export and viral particles maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>gkaf434_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="gkaf434_supplemental_files.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Derse&#x02019;s lab for the pCMV-HTLV-1 plasmids and A.
