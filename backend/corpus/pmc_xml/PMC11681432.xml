This study investigates the public interest in MS and its treatment options in the United States over the past decade, utilizing Google Trends data. The aim is to analyze how search trends reflect public engagement with MS, particularly about managing relapses, slowing disease progression, alleviating symptoms, and enhancing quality of life.</p><p>Methods</p><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing Google Trends to analyze search interest related to MS and its treatments from January 2014 to December 2023. The data was divided into two five-year periods: 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. Specific search terms for MS and various treatment modalities were analyzed, including traditional therapies (e.g., interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate) and newer treatments (e.g., ocrelizumab, siponimod). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare relative search volumes (RSV) between the two periods.</p><p>Results&#x000a0;</p><p>Significant fluctuations in RSV were observed over the study period. A notable increase in RSV was found for treatments such as rituximab, ocrelizumab, ublituximab, siponimod, and ponesimod in the 2019-2023 period compared to 2014-2018 (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05). Conversely, a significant decrease in RSV was observed for glatiramer acetate, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, fingolimod, and plasmapheresis during the same periods (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05). Treatments like beta interferon, ofatumumab, and teriflunomide showed no significant change in RSV between the two periods (p&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;0.05).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Dividing the search period into two five-year intervals revealed shifting public interest toward newer MS therapies over the past decade. The increased interest in recent treatments aligns with advancements in MS management and may influence patient inquiries and treatment decisions.

As no human participants were involved and only publicly available data sources were used, ethics committee approval was not required by standard research guidelines.</p><p>Google Trends, a public web facility of Google Inc., was utilized to analyze the popularity of top search queries in Google Search across various regions and languages. This tool provides graphical representations to compare the search volume of different queries over time, allowing exploration of topics, search terms, and trending data. It offers insights into how search interest evolves globally and locally&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The key metric used was RSV, which quantifies the frequency of a specific search term relative to the total search volume within a defined period and region. RSV is expressed on a scale from 0 to 100, indicating the term's popularity compared to its peak search volume during the timeframe. This normalized measure facilitates comparison across different terms and periods. While RSV was the primary metric used in this study, other parameters such as absolute search volume and geographical distribution data could also be analyzed, though these were not included in this study due to data access limitations.</p><p>For this study, data was collected from the United States, focusing on search trends from January 2014 to December 2023. The keyword &#x0201c;multiple sclerosis&#x0201d; was used to assess overall interest in the disease. To explore public interest in treatment options, specific search terms corresponding to various treatment modalities were individually analyzed and categorized as follows: beta interferon, glatiramer acetate, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab, ublituximab, fingolimod, siponimod, ponesimod, teriflunomide, Methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin.</p><p>Data obtained from Google Trends was exported to Microsoft Excel for organization and preliminary analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.2 (R Core Team, 2023), a comprehensive statistical software environment. Trends in the RSV for MS over the study period were visualized using line graphs to illustrate fluctuations over time. For the analysis of RSV related to treatment modalities, the data was divided into two five-year periods: January 2014 to December 2018 and January 2019 to December 2023. The Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric test appropriate for comparing two independent groups without assuming normal distribution, was employed to assess the statistical significance of changes in RSV between these periods. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The analysis of Google Trends data revealed notable fluctuations in the RSV for &#x0201c;Multiple Sclerosis&#x0201d; in the United States from January 2014 to December 2023. During the initial period (2014-2018), the RSV generally remained in the 40s, with minor variations. The lowest RSV was recorded in December 2016 (RSV of 34), while the highest peaks occurred in April 2014 and April 2015 (RSV of 53). From January 2019 onward, more pronounced fluctuations were observed, with significant spikes in February 2019 (RSV of 61) and November 2022 (RSV of 100).

The fluctuations in RSV observed for specific MS treatments indicate evolving public and clinical interest in these therapies.</p><p>The findings of this study align with previous studies that utilized Google Trends to assess public interest in various health-related topics, highlighting the utility of Google Trends as a proxy for gauging public awareness and behavior in the context of chronic diseases&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For instance, the significant increase in RSV for drugs such as ocrelizumab, rituximab, and methylprednisolone during the period of 2019-2023 is consistent with their increased clinical adoption and growing evidence supporting their efficacy in managing MS&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ocrelizumab has been noted for its effectiveness in both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, which may explain the heightened public interest observed in this study&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The decline in RSV for therapies like glatiramer acetate, alemtuzumab, and fingolimod could reflect a shift in therapeutic preferences toward newer, more efficacious treatments&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This trend aligns with a broader paradigm shift in MS management, where higher-efficacy DMTs are increasingly utilized earlier in the disease course to improve long-term outcomes, as highlighted by recent studies&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The stability in RSV for beta interferon, ofatumumab, and teriflunomide suggests that while these treatments remain relevant, they have not experienced the same surge in interest as other therapies. This could be due to their established role in the treatment landscape, with less novel information being generated or fewer ground-breaking studies being published in recent years&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the increased interest in treatments such as siponimod and ponesimod, which are relatively newer entrants to the MS treatment arsenal, aligns with recent studies highlighting their potential benefits and the need for continuous monitoring of their long-term efficacy and safety&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The rise in RSV for these medications suggests that the public is increasingly seeking information about emerging therapies, possibly reflecting a broader awareness of the advancements in MS treatment options.</p><p>While this study provides valuable insights into public interest trends in MS treatments, several limitations should be considered. First, Google Trends data represents search behavior, which may not directly correlate with treatment utilization or clinical outcomes. The RSV is influenced by multiple factors, including media coverage, health campaigns, and even specific events that may temporarily skew search volumes. Therefore, caution should be exercised in interpreting these trends as direct indicators of treatment popularity or clinical efficacy. Second, the study is limited to search data from the United States, which may not be generalizable to other regions or countries with different healthcare systems, treatment availability, or cultural perceptions of MS. The selection of search terms and their categorization into specific treatment modalities may also influence the results, as different search queries might capture varying levels of public interest. Third, the use of Google Trends as a data source is inherently limited by the platform's algorithms and data processing methods, which are not fully transparent. The study's reliance on RSV rather than absolute search counts further complicates the interpretation, as it reflects proportional rather than absolute changes in public interest. Fourth, Google Trends does not provide detailed demographic information about the individuals conducting the searches. As such, it is not possible to determine whether the search behavior represents patients, caregivers, or healthcare providers, nor is it possible to analyze how age, gender, socioeconomic status, or other demographic factors might influence search trends. Addressing these gaps in future research could provide a more nuanced understanding of public interest in MS treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study reveals significant fluctuations in public interest regarding MS and its treatment modalities over the past decade, as evidenced by Google Trends data. The increasing RSV for newer therapies such as ocrelizumab, rituximab, and methylprednisolone indicates a growing public interest aligned with recent advancements and clinical adoption of these treatments, while the declining interest in older therapies like glatiramer acetate and fingolimod suggests a shift toward more effective or recently approved options. These findings demonstrate the utility of Google Trends as a valuable tool for monitoring public awareness and can help healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers understand which treatments are gaining attention and potentially influencing patient inquiries and treatment decisions. This kind of data can be leveraged to design targeted public health campaigns that address knowledge gaps and misconceptions about MS treatments. Additionally, the efficacy of such campaigns can be evaluated using Google Trends. Integrating these insights into patient-centered communication strategies could ultimately improve adherence to treatment plans and enhance patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors of this study, affiliated with different institutions and locations, collaborated through the coordination of Dr. Shreya Deoghare.
