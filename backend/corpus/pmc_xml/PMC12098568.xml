These complications notably increase the risk of adverse outcomes in affected individuals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Among these, atherosclerosis, a major cause of mortality worldwide, is exacerbated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to lipid metabolic disorder and chronic inflammation. Although there are some substantial advances in understanding diabetic complications, the research on diabetes vascular aortic complications is still limited.</p><p>Atherosclerosis progression is influenced by adipose tissue metabolism. Recent studies have shown that adipose tissue-derived exosomes (AT-Exosomes) serve as significant intercellular communicators to target various organs through signaling mediated by surface receptors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). AT-Exosomes play an important role in regulating key processes such as inflammation resolution, angiogenesis, and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additionally, they are recognized for their protective effects on cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>These small membrane-bound vesicles carry molecules including DNA, mRNA, and microRNAs, reflecting the physiological conditions under which they are released (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Under metabolic homeostasis, AT-Exosomes have a function of tissue repair and regeneration (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For instance, exosomes from adipose mesenchymal stem cells can protect endothelial cells from atherosclerosis via microRNA-342-5p and miR-221-3p (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, exosome component can be changed by micro-environment <italic>in vivo</italic>, it has been showed that diabetic AT-exosomes reduced protective effects and heightened contributions to vascular dysfunction in diabetic mice (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). High glucose conditions further drive endothelial cell-derived exosomes to stimulate calcification and senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells, linking T2DM to atherosclerosis, periarterial sclerosis, and coronary heart disease (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This highlights that exosomes can be investigated not only as potential therapeutic modalities for diseases but also as the key factors in disease progression. Due to the paracrine effects, exosomes are particularly applicable in studying disease complications, allowing for a deeper exploration of the pathogenic pathways involved. For instance, this includes examining the biological molecular mechanisms behind complications like cardiovascular disease in diabetes.</p><p>Adipose tissue can be broadly divided into white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), with the latter being highly active in glucose and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). BAT plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, improving <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cell function, and reducing insulin demand (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, in T2DM, BAT exhibits pro-apoptosis properties, releasing inflammatory factors and exosomes that contribute to vascular damage (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Recent studies have shown that BAT-derived exosomes are potent regulators of immune and vascular endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, AT-exosomes can be studied as potential interaction vectors in vascular complications of diabetes.</p><p>This study investigates the role of AT-Exosomes, particularly from BAT, in vascular endothelial dysfunction in T2DM. By analyzing exosomes from diabetic and non-diabetic mice, we aim to uncover key factors underlying the endothelial damage in induced by BAT-derived exosomes, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis in diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Exosome preparation and identification</title><p>Male diabetic mice and non-diabetic mice (Cavens, China) aged 6&#x02013;8 weeks were used to obtain brown adipose tissue from the interscapular region, intact epididymal white fat from the vicinity of the testis, intact perirenal white fat from the kidney and intact subcutaneous white adipose tissue from the subcutaneous area under aseptic conditions. 0.4&#x02005;g of each adipose tissue was isolated for the tissue culture sample. Adipose tissue was cut into small pieces and cultured in the medium mixed with 1.8&#x02005;ml Minimum Essential Medium (MEM Alpha 1X, Gibco, Gaithersberg, MD, USA) and 0.02&#x02005;ml of the antibiotic penicillin-streptomycin (Pen Strep, Gibco, Gaithersberg, MD, USA) for 3 days at 37&#x02103; and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The supernatant of the Petri dishes was collected after 12,000&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g 10&#x02005;min centrifugation to remove tissue fragments.

TBST of 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit Calnexin antibody (Zen-bioscience, China) was used as a protein marker in negative control samples. After being washed with TBST for 3 times, 10&#x02005;min each time, the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody (Zen-bioscience, China) was incubated with membrane for 1&#x02005;h.

Using ultracentrifugation, we successfully isolated high-purity exosomes from the culture medium of epididymal, subcutaneous, and BAT of both diabetic and non-diabetic mice. NTA confirmed that the exosomes had a similar size range (115.9&#x02013;164.3&#x02005;nm) across different adipose tissue, with no significant differences in size or concentration between the two groups. Western-blot analysis showed consistent expression of exosomal markers (CD81, CD63, and HSP70) across all samples, confirming the successful isolation of exosomes.</p><p>To explore the functional impact of these exosomes on vascular function, we cultured mouse aorta with AT-derived exosomes and assessed vascular contractility and relaxation function using a myograph. Epididymal, subcutaneous, and BAT-derived exosomes from diabetic mice significantly impaired aortic vasorelaxation compared to those from non-diabetic mice. This dysfunction was restored with exogenous NO supplementation, suggesting that adipose-derived exosomes can induce endothelial-dependent vasodilation impairment in diabetes. It showed that, WAT-exosomes and BAT-exosomes can cause the endothelial cells&#x02019; injure, which consistented with the conclusion in the previous literature that the pathological environment could make exosomes secreted by tissues have pathogenic effects (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Further validation through <italic>in vitro</italic> endothelial cell culture revealed that exosomes from diabetic mice suppressed eNOS activity, and decreased NO production in in both MAECs and HAECs. Notably, brown adipose-derived exosomes from diabetic mice exhibited the most significant and stable effects on endothelial dysfunction. Previous studies have highlighted the favorable proliferation and reparative properties of brown adipose. However, their role in the pathological context of diabetes appears to differ (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). We hypothesize that it is due to alterations in the underlying pathological conditions, which may modulate the functionality of BAT-derived exosomes. Specifically, when internalized by vascular endothelial cells, BAT-derived exosomes may impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). To investigate this, we performed gene sequencing analysis on MAECs co-cultured with BAT-derived exosomes from both diabetic and non-diabetic mice, aiming to identify potential target genes.</p><p>RNA sequencing of MAECs revealed significant differences in gene expression between BAT-derived exosomes treatment groups from diabetic and wild-type mice. Genes down-regulated in BAT-derived exosomes treatment groups, particularly those involved in cell proliferation, were further validated through a comparative analysis with the GeneCards database, and their expression in diabetic mouse AT-exosomes was confirmed. Among them, we identified the ITPR3 gene, which encodes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor located on the inner surface of the cell membrane, including the endoplasmic reticulum. The receptor plays a key role in regulating the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This suggested that BAT-derived exosomes mediated endothelial dysfunction may be linked to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>To further investigate this, we focused on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAMKII/eNOS/NO signaling axis, a critical pathway for endothelial function (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Our results indicate that exosomes derived from brown adipose tissue (BAT) in diabetic mice downregulate the CAMKII/eNOS/NO signaling pathway in endothelial cells. This occurs through a reduction in ITPR3 expression, which leads to decreased mobilization of Ca2&#x02009;+&#x02009;and a lower level of CAMKII/eNOS phosphorylation. Consequently, this results in diminished nitric oxide (NO) production and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Using models with both ITPR3 knockdown and overexpression in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs), we observed a correlation between ITPR3 expression levels and cytosolic Ca2&#x02009;+&#x02009;concentration. The lack of highly specific fluorescent reagents to accurately determine the location of Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of vascular endothelial cells, coupled with the presence of the mitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM), which links Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow from the ER to the mitochondria, presents a challenge in studying these processes. MAM-mediated calcium transfer can cause a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, triggering endothelial cell apoptosis and contributing to plaque rupture in atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). To address this, we stained both the cytosol and mitochondria with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-specific dyes to observe the effects of ITPR3 on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Our results showed that ITPR3 expression positively regulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. When cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration increased, more Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound to CAMKII, thereby enhancing its phosphorylation, which in turn elevated the phosphorylation of eNOS, resulting in increased NO production. These findings suggest that, under diabetic conditions, exosomes secreted by brown adipose tissue can be internalized by vascular endothelial cells, reducing ITPR3 expression and impairing Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. This inhibition of CAMKII phosphorylation decreases eNOS activity and NO production, ultimately causing impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This underscores the essential role of Ca2&#x02009;+&#x02009;signaling in endothelial cell function and suggests that exosomes derived from brown adipose tissue (BAT) may have the ability to remotely influence Ca2&#x02009;+&#x02009;channel activity. Future research should focus on developing strategies to restore Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance within endothelial cells, which could provide potential therapeutic approaches for addressing the vascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerosis. Additionally, key genes regulating ITPR3 in BAT-derived exosomes will be examined in detail.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>T2DM is associated with macrovascular complications such as atherosclerosis, with endothelial dysfunction serving as an early indicator of disease progression. Identifying the underlying pathways and key genes driving endothelial dysfunction in T2DM is essential for developing targeted therapies to address atherosclerotic complications. In this study, we suggest that ITPR3 gene as a critical player in this process, as its altered expression in BAT-derived exosomes under diabetic conditions disrupt cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vascular endothelial cells. This dysregulation is associated with the CAMKII/eNOS/NO signaling axis, reducing phosphorylation levels of CAMKII and eNOS, and promoting vascular endothelial dysfunction. These findings offer novel therapeutic insights for managing atherosclerotic complications in T2DM.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks for Prof. Jack Wing Tak Wong's Lab in CUHK, who supported me to do the previous experiment, like myograph detection, exosome extraction and identification.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from NCBI but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available.
