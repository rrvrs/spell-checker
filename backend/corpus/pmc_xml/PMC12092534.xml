These probabilities may be stationary, such as that of rolling a 6 on a die, or changing over time, like the probability of rainfall over the year. Research on how people estimate and track changing probabilities has recently reopened an old epistemological issue. A small, mostly recent literature finds that people accurately track the probability and change their estimates only occasionally, resulting in staircase-shaped response patterns. This has been taken as evidence that people entertain beliefs about unknown, distal states of the world, which are tested against observations to produce discrete shifts between hypotheses. That idea stands in contrast to the claim that people learn by continuously updating associations between observed events. The purpose of this article is to investigate the generality and robustness of the accurate, staircase-shaped pattern. In two experiments, we find that the response pattern is contingent on the response mode and prior information about the generative process. Participants exist on continua of accuracy and staircase-ness and we only reproduce previous results when changing estimates is effortful and prior information is provided&#x02014;the specific conditions of previous experiments. We conclude that explaining this solely through either hypotheses or associations is untenable. A complete theory of probability estimation requires the interaction of three components: (i) online tracking of observed data, (ii) beliefs about the unobserved &#x0201c;generative process,&#x0201d; and (iii) a response updating process. Participants&#x02019; overt estimates depend on how the specific task conditions jointly determine all three.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13423-024-02604-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Probability learning</kwd><kwd>Probability estimation</kwd><kwd>Hypothesis testing</kwd><kwd>Associative learning</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Uppsala University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Uppsala University.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A small, mostly recent literature has presented participants with a task where they track a latent, nonstationary Bernoulli parameter (Gallistel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Khaw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>; Robinson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1964</xref>, &#x0201c;Bernoulli paradigm&#x0201d;). Participants observe consecutive draws with replacement from the Bernoulli distribution and provide an estimate after each draw. Here, one consistently finds &#x0201c;stepwise&#x0201d; response behaviour: participants do not change their estimate for many trials, and when they do, they adjust by large or small steps (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Participants are also often quite accurate, closely tracking the true latent probability. These accurate, &#x0201c;staircase shaped&#x0201d; response curves have been presented as a ubiquitous and robust phenomenon deriving from participants&#x02019; mental shifts between discrete hypotheses<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>&#x02014;thus tying them to a long-standing debate between cognitivist and associationist frameworks (see Fodor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1983</xref>). <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Examples from previous experiments. <bold>A</bold>: participant in Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>) who exhibits a staircase shaped response curve, with long periods without an update.

Gallistel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>) suggest that &#x0201c;trial-by-trial updating models cannot explain the statistics of the step-like pattern of estimates seen in all subjects&#x0201d; (p. 99). Similarly, Khaw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>) report in the abstract that &#x0201c;subjects adjust in discrete jumps rather than after each new piece of information&#x0201d;&#x000a0;(p. 88). These claims are surprising given the prominent role played by trial-by-trial updating models in related neuropsychological paradigms which do not find stepwise updating (e.g., McGuire et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; Nassar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Norton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>)&#x02014;there, even demographics who update particularly infrequently (Bruckner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>; Nassar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>) update more frequently than the average participant in the Bernoulli paradigm literature.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we will show that the accurate and stepwise response curves are in fact not ubiquitous even in the Bernoulli paradigm. Rather, participants exist on continua of more or less accurate responses and more or less stepwise updating and can be moved along these continua by adjusting design choices in the experiment task. We argue that this invites a theory that allows a role for trial-by-trial tracking of the observed events (e.g., associations), beliefs about the task (hypotheses), as well as an adaptable response process. Rather than either/or, people may simultaneously be intuitive statisticians (Peterson &#x00026; Beach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1967</xref>) and intuitive scientists (Szollosi &#x00026; Newell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>) whose overt responses correspond only imperfectly to their covert representations.</p><p id="Par5">We concentrate on two quantitative measures to capture the important properties of data of the sort presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. One measure concerns the estimation error, calculated as the average absolute distance between the participant&#x02019;s response and the true probability (a low error implies high accuracy). The other measure concerns the step widths in the response curves, calculated as the number of trials between changes to the estimate.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, the data from the periodic condition in Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), for example, have a mean absolute error of 0.156 (95% bootstrapped confidence interval [0.129, 0.183], <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and a mean step width of 12.2 trials (CI [8.98, 15.4], <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4).</p><p id="Par6">In a pilot study (unpublished), we tested 60 participants in a conceptual replication of the Bernoulli paradigm. Our version (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) manipulated the functional form of the generative function and the cover story of the task (blue or green ball drawn vs. the stock market going up or down) between subjects. We also added a &#x0201c;blind phase&#x0201d; at the end of the experiment, where the outcomes were obscured and participants had to extrapolate from what they had learned. We had expected to find stepwise patterns similar to those in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A. Surprisingly, however, accuracy was poorer than in other Bernoulli paradigm studies, there was little evidence of staircase-shaped response curves, and participants seemed unable to track the parameter in the blind phase (i.e., no signs of extrapolation based on an explicit hypothesis; see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This initial attempt made us suspect that stepwise updating may not be as robust a phenomenon as had been assumed.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Results from an unpublished pilot study. <bold>A</bold>: Six groups of participants provided trial-by-trial estimates of the value of a non-stationary Bernoulli parameter based on observed outcomes from the Bernoulli process. Conditions differed in how the&#x000a0;parameter changed over time (thick grey curves) and the cover story of what the Bernoulli process described (blue or green colour ball being drawn; stock market index going up or down). The last 100 trials were &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d;: the outcomes of the Bernoulli process were hidden to reveal if participants had inferred the underlying pattern. <bold>B</bold>: Means and 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals by condition for two summary statistics.

An immediate limitation of Gallistel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>), Khaw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>), and Robinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1964</xref>) is that the Bernoulli parameter itself changed in a staircase-shaped pattern in those studies. Hence, the discreteness seen in the response patterns might simply have reflected the discreteness in the stimulus patterns, rather than being a property of the cognitive process. Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>) addressed this confound by including one condition where the parameter changed periodically according to a sine function and one where it changed aperiodically.</p><p id="Par8">In Experiment <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">1</xref> we aimed for a direct replication of the periodic condition in Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), but again we were unable to replicate the high accuracy and ubiquitous staircase curves. In Experiment <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, we scrutinized the remaining difference between our and previous experiments: explicitly telling the participants that the probability distribution was nonstationary.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> We also investigated the effect of the amount of effort required to select a new response, because we had noticed that this required more effort in the paradigm of Gallistel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>), Khaw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>), Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), and Robinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1964</xref>; i.e., the studies that found mostly stepwise updating) compared with our pilot and the paradigms of McGuire et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>) and Nassar et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; i.e., the studies that found very little stepwise updating).</p><p id="Par9">To preview our results, we find that response curves are noticeably affected by minor changes to the amount of effort required to change a response and instructions about the nonstationarity of the tracked parameter. Although some participants produce staircase-shaped response curves, this is not the general case. We take this as evidence that accurate, stepwise updating is not a ubiquitous and robust phenomenon but one that occurs more often in specific circumstances. In addition, we replicate previous anecdotal reports (Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>) that participants can extract and report some description of the generative function. These results suggest to us that a complete theory of the cognitive process should include the ability to (i) track the association between observed events online, (ii) hold beliefs about the unobserved generative process, (iii) regulate when and how often the overt estimate is updated to correspond to the covert, internal estimate (see Forsgren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2023</xref>), and adapt (i), (ii), and (iii) depending on available information and task interface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>General methods</title><p id="Par10">The experiment task was to repeatedly estimate a continuously changing Bernoulli parameter&#x02014;the proportion of targets in a box&#x02014;based on draws with replacement. The latent Bernoulli parameter changed over trials according to a sinusoidal function. Here, we describe the methods for the two main experiments. Methods, materials, and data for the pilot study and both experiments are available&#x000a0;at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/zhv2r/">https://osf.io/zhv2r/</ext-link>.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>General design and materials</title><p id="Par11">We replicated the interface described in Gallistel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>) and Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> It consisted of a box labelled &#x0201c;Box of RINGS&#x0feff;&#x0201d;, a bar with a slider, and a rectangle filled with red and blue dots, which visualised the current slider value (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At the beginning of each trial, a single ring would be drawn from the box and remain visible for the duration of the trial. The task was to estimate the proportion of blue rings<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> in the box using a slider on a bar labelled &#x0201c;0%&#x02009;=&#x02009;no blue&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;100%&#x02009;=&#x02009;only blue&#x0201d; on the left and right end, respectively. Adjusting the slider caused the proportion of red and blue dots in the rectangle labelled &#x0201c;My current estimate: % blue rings&#x0201d; to change to reflect the new proportion indicated by the slider position. This was intended as a visual aid to help the participants to &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; their currently chosen estimate. After locking in their response (see Design sections below for details on how), the trial ended by the ring being returned to the box. The animation of returning and then drawing a ring imposed a minimum trial time of about 1.1&#x000a0;seconds, depending on frame rate latency. Importantly, participants could choose to repeat their last estimate by locking in their response without adjusting the slider. The next trial commenced immediately after responding, starting with a new ring being drawn. The experiment consisted of 2000 trials with an optional break halfway through. The task was performed using the mouse. The mouse cursor was never repositioned automatically but remained where the participant positioned it.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Experimental paradigm.

Firstly, Gallistel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>) also included two buttons labelled &#x0201c;I think the box has changed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I take that back,&#x0201d; which participants could use to report declarative perceptions of there having been a discrete change in the latent probability distribution. We followed Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), who argued that the buttons make little sense under continuously changing generative functions (where the box is changed every trial), in excluding them. Secondly, we removed the possibility of clicking left or right of the slider to make it jump a set distance, just like Khaw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>). This feature decreased response effort for responding with certain estimates while keeping them high for the rest. Removing it allowed unequivocal manipulation of the amount of effort required to update (see Experiment <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). Our participants could thus only move the slider via the mouse cursor (see Design sections below for details). Lastly, like Ricci &#x00026; Gallistel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), we used the written instructions from Gallistel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>) but excluded the passages relating to reporting that the box had changed (since those buttons had been removed). The instructions were translated to Swedish by the first author (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/zhv2r/">https://osf.io/zhv2r/</ext-link>). All participants gave their informed consent to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par13">Participants read an informed consent form and the instructions for the task and confirmed to the experimenter that they had no questions. Importantly, they were not given any information regarding whether the content of the box would, could, or could not change throughout the course of the experiment. We manipulated availability of such prior information in Experiment <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. The participants then carried out the task (see Materials) for 1000 trials, before they were prompted to take a break. When they felt ready, participants commenced the final session of 1000 trials.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref></p><p id="Par14">After finishing the experiment, the participants filled out a questionnaire with questions concerning their beliefs about the generative function, self-assessed statistics proficiency, age, gender, and education. Finally, they were asked to draw a graph of what they thought the probability of drawing a blue ring had been as a function of trial count. We will return to these graphs in the General Discussion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par15">Because of the nonnormal nature of our dependent variables (accuracy and step width), we used a (nonparametric) permutation approach adapted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) models (Anderson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>) for statistical analysis. We employed an unrestricted sampling algorithm (see Gonzalez &#x00026; Manly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>; Howell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Manly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>) with 1,000,000 resamples but note here that other algorithms should produce comparable results (Gonzalez &#x00026; Manly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>). The algorithm begins by calculating the <italic>F</italic> values for the main and interaction effects on the original data. Next, the data are shuffled 1,000,000 times, randomly redistributing the values among the cells of the factorial design. For each of the shuffled datasets, the <italic>F</italic> values are computed. This process generates an empirical null distribution of <italic>F</italic> values for each main effect and interaction. Finally, the <italic>p</italic> value for an effect is calculated as the proportion of <italic>F</italic> values in the null distribution that equal or exceed the <italic>F</italic> value observed in the data.

They used a sine function with a period of 200 trials to create a smoothly changing, periodic Bernoulli parameter that participants were to track. In addition to that condition, our experiment also included a condition in which the period of the sine wave was increased to 500. We expected this slower-changing parameter to be easier to track and thereby rule out that any pattern was an artefact of excessive difficulty.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par17">Thirty-one participants (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.9&#x000a0;years, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.07) were recruited from university campuses in Uppsala.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> The sample thus mainly consisted of students.

This would suggest that staircase-shaped response curves are a general feature of (diligent) estimation of a Bernoulli probability.

To respond with a different estimate than last trial, they needed to move the mouse cursor to the slider, press the left mouse button and hold to drag the slider to the desired position, and then click the &#x0201c;Next&#x0201d; button. Providing a different estimate than on the last trial thus required greater response effort and took more time. For the other group, the cursor and &#x0201c;Next&#x0201d; button were removed and the slider was &#x0201c;stuck&#x0201d; to the mouse (Low effort): when the mouse was moved to the right, so was the slider and vice versa.

If this kind of &#x0201c;teleological&#x0201d; reasoning indeed is the explanation for the interaction, it underscores how important participants&#x02019; declarative beliefs are for their trial-by-trial responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>General discussion</title><p id="Par38">These results show that the accuracy and step widths of response curves are not robust but sensitive to (fairly minor) design choices. We take them to suggest that people possess, at least, three capabilities. Firstly, people are able to estimate a nonstationary Bernoulli probability online&#x02014;albeit with varying accuracy (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Secondly, they can modulate the estimation based on beliefs about the generative process (interaction effect on mean absolute error, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Thirdly, there seems to exist some kind of process which regulates when and how often the overt estimate is updated to correspond to the covert, internal estimate (see &#x0201c;response threshold&#x0201d;; Forsgren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2023</xref>). This too appears modulated by declarative beliefs (interaction effect on mean step width). In the Supplement, we show that there are main effects of Effort on the mean size of updates when made (&#x0201c;step heights&#x0201d;) and the number of times the updating direction is reversed (&#x0201c;direction reversals&#x0201d;). Those results are consistent with an &#x0201c;economising&#x0201d; threshold that implements an accuracy&#x02013;cost trade-off. In addition, and less surely, we found that people seem able to extract a vague, qualitative belief about the generative function which is retained at least for a while after they have completed the task (posttest drawings of generative function).</p><p id="Par39">This invites the following speculation: maybe trial-by-trial updating is indeed how people <italic>track</italic> probabilities from moment to moment, but these estimates are never encoded in long-term memory. Instead, a belief about the generative function is extracted and stored (cf. Brehmer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1980</xref>; Mcdaniel &#x00026; Busemeyer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>). Online tracking thus affects beliefs but the reverse holds too: There exists a literature which investigates how learning rates can be <italic>learnt</italic> from experience (Behrens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007</xref>; Rushworth &#x00026; Behrens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>) by estimating the volatility in the environment (Silvetti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>) but our results suggest that the learning rate can also be <italic>calibrated</italic> by beliefs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> That is, it is not a question of either associative learning or hypothesis testing but always both and there exists a feedback loop between the two. If so, any theory that purely focuses on explaining the online estimates in the present paradigm, rather than encoded beliefs, would only give us insight into a very local form of probability learning. This includes various versions of the delta rule (e.g., Forsgren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2023</xref>; Nassar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par40">Previous models in the Bayesian tradition (e.g., Mathys et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>; Nassar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Piray &#x00026; Daw, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>) assume a (fixed) structural representation of the task but (flexibly) update that representation&#x02019;s parameters. They thus allow effects of beliefs on online estimation by including priors that could be set by initial beliefs. Those priors will, however, eventually be overcome by data. This is not compatible with how some participants appear to maintain the qualitative characteristics of their response curves throughout the sessions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, &#x00026; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/zhv2r/">https://osf.io/zhv2r/</ext-link>). One way of explaining persistent effects of information would be through a model that, in parallel with online estimation, holds and (flexibly) tests hypotheses about the structural representation of the task (cf. Szollosi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2023</xref>). In a nutshell, we envision a theory where people simultaneously possess the intuitive statistician&#x02019;s capacity for data compression (Peterson &#x00026; Beach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1967</xref>) and the intuitive scientist&#x02019;s capacity for structural modelling (Szollosi &#x00026; Newell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">Future research should test the influences of experience versus beliefs on learning rates by varying prior information within-person and measuring some statistic related to information-discounting over the course of the task. It should also be investigated whether the response curves per se are encoded into long-term memory or whether the coding only preserves the gist of the generative function through posttests (cf. Mason et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>). This is important since it may be our long-term memories that we act on when making real-world decisions.</p><p id="Par42">Compared with any real-life probability estimation task the information about the generative function provided in the Information conditions here was extremely impoverished. When estimating the risk of the train coming in late, for example, we have a rich cognitive causal model (Sloman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) of train punctuality and can use prior information (e.g., reading in the paper that there will be maintenance work done) to inform how we weight past observations or infer regime changes. A complete theory must account for how beliefs about such things can affect my estimate of the risk of the train being late but also how seeing other trains repeatedly come in on time can make me reevaluate my belief about the effects of the maintenance work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2604_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 410 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par49">In Forsgren et al.
