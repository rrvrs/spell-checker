Currently, very little is known about the pathogenesis of many of these lineages, thus limiting our understanding of the potential biological factors favoring each lineage in these outbreaks. In this study, we aimed to determine the potential phenotypic differences between two VSV Indiana (VSIV) serotype epidemic strains using a pig model. These strains are representative of the epidemic lineages that affected the US between 1997 and 1998 (IN98COE) and between 2019 and 2020 (IN0919WYB2), the latter responsible for one of the most extensive outbreaks in the US. Our initial genome analysis revealed the existence of 121 distinct mutations between both strains, including the presence of a 14-nucleotide insertion in the intergenic region between the G and L genes observed in IN0919WYB2. The levels of viral RNA in clinical samples between pigs infected with IN98COE or IN0919WYB2 were compared. Overall, higher and prolonged expression of viral RNA in pigs infected with IN98COE was observed. However, clinically, IN0919WYB2 was slightly more virulent than IN98COE, as well as more efficient at producing infection through contact transmission. Additionally, infectious virus was recovered from more samples when the pigs were infected with IN0919WYB2, as revealed by virus isolation in cell culture, indicating the increased ability of this virus to replicate in pigs. Sequence analyses conducted from isolates recovered from both experimental groups showed that IN0919WYB2 produced more variability during the infection, denoting the potential of this strain to evolve rapidly after a single infection&#x02013;contact transmission event in pigs. Collectively, the results showed that epidemic strains of VSIV may represent disparate phenotypes in terms of virulence/transmissibility for livestock, a situation that may impact the intensity of an epidemic outbreak. This study also highlights the relevance of pathogenesis studies in pigs to characterize phenotypic differences in VSV strains affecting livestock in the field.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>vesicular stomatitis virus</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>epidemics</kwd><kwd>transmissibility</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>USDA Research Service</funding-source><award-id>3022-32000-062-000-D</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was conducted under the USDA Research Service CRIS Project &#x0201c;Predicting and Mitigating Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) in North America&#x0201d; No. 3022-32000-062-000-D.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01915"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is a viral disease that annually affects livestock in the Americas [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and can cause sporadic large outbreaks in the US [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. VS is an arboviral disease caused by the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a negative sense RNA virus belonging to the <italic toggle="yes">Rhabdoviridae</italic> family, genus <italic toggle="yes">Vesiculovirus</italic> [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The genome of VSV contains five genes encoding five proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), glycoprotein (G), and the large RNA-dependent polymerase (L) [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, diverse nonstructural proteins are encoded by alternative reading frames in the P (proteins C&#x02019; and C) [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and M (M2 and M3 proteins) [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] genes. Two main serotypes have been described: VSV New Jersey virus (VSNJV) and VSV Indiana virus (VSIV) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Pathogenesis studies conducted in pigs have concluded that the VSNJV strains are generally more virulent than VSIV [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, a recent pathogenesis study showed that some VSIV strains could be as virulent as VSNJV [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], indicating that more pathogenesis studies are needed to gain insights into the phenotypic differences among VSV strains.</p><p>VSV is maintained in well-established endemic settings in Mexico and multiple countries in Central America, where clinical cases are reported annually in livestock [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Outbreaks of VSNJV in the US have been documented during 1995&#x02013;1997, 2004&#x02013;2006, and 2012&#x02013;2015 [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. VSIV has been associated with outbreak events occurring in 1997&#x02013;1998 [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and 2019&#x02013;2020 [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In all cases, these outbreaks have been related to single monophyletic lineages, which display a high level of genome identity with viral strains that circulate in the endemic zones of Mexico [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Very little is known about the molecular factors associated with the emergence of epidemic lineages in the US and the potentially diverse viral phenotypes associated with these viruses. A previous pathogenesis study in pigs suggested that an epidemic strain of VSNJV observed in the US (Strain NJ0612NME6, lineage 1.1) might represent a more virulent phenotype than its endemic relative (Strain NJ0806VCB, lineage 1.2) [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This virulent phenotype was associated with an increased number of vesicular lesions produced during the acute stage of the disease, a condition linked to the potential ability of the epidemic strain to better evade the host&#x02019;s innate immune response [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Based on the current evidence, it can be hypothesized that during epidemics, the maintenance and spread of epidemic lineages is achieved by infections in both livestock and insect vectors [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Within affected farms, VSV can be maintained in herd animals by direct contact with infected animals or fomites [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the absence of viremia, the role of livestock as amplifier hosts has been questioned, suggesting that these species are the end hosts in the natural cycle of VSV [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, alternative mechanisms have been experimentally proposed, pointing to livestock as non-conventional amplifier hosts [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These mechanisms imply that livestock are a virus source during vector feeding from active vesicular lesions or infected tissues without lesions [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This observation suggests that VSV strains showing increased levels of virulence in livestock may have potential adaptive advantages, allowing them to survive and thrive in epidemic conditions and thus possibly impacting the intensity of the outbreak events. This advantage might be associated with increased levels of replication in the vertebrate host, providing an optimal condition to produce new viral variants during the infection, a situation poorly explored until now.</p><p>The emergence and evolution of an epidemic VSIV lineage in the US was recently observed during the 2019&#x02013;2020 outbreak [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After more than 20 years of absence, this lineage emerged in the US and produced one of the largest outbreaks in the US (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This epidemic lineage was highly related to VSIV strains from endemic zones in Mexico. Throughout the outbreak, it diverged into four distinct phylogenetic groups [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A unique feature of this lineage is the presence of a 14&#x02013;22 nucleotide insertion in the intergenic region between the G and L genes, a characteristic that was observed also in the ancestral endemic relatives of this lineage [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on the high number of clinical cases reported during the outbreak [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it is possible to hypothesize that the epidemic VSIV 2019&#x02013;2020 lineage may represent a virulent phenotype of VSIV in livestock.</p><p>This study aimed to determine the phenotypic characteristics of the VSV strain IN0919WYB2, a virus representative of the epidemic VSIV lineage from 2019&#x02013;2020. For this purpose, a pathogenesis study was conducted using a well-established pig model [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as pigs are a natural host of VSV. The VSIV strain 98COE, a virus related to the epidemic US lineage from the 1997&#x02013;1998 outbreak, was used as a control. Epidemiologically, this lineage produced a considerably lower number of affected premises than lineage 2019&#x02013;2020 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In this context, based on the epidemiological dynamics of the 2019&#x02013;2020 VSIV outbreak, we hypothesized that the viral strain IN0919WYB2 represents a more virulent phenotype in pigs than the strain 98COE.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01915"><title>2.

The main goal was to compare the virulence levels of 98COE and IN0919WYB2 by evaluating the capability of these viruses to infect pigs both by direct inoculation (scarification of the snout) and infection by direct contact between infected and na&#x000ef;ve animals (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Signs of virulence were evaluated using clinical parameters including the presence of fever, development of vesicular lesions, as well as the shedding of infectious particles recovered from nasal, oral, and rectal swabs. For vesicular lesions, the evaluation was based on the ability of these viruses to produce secondary lesions in inoculated animals. The number of animals used in this study was chosen based on previous studies evaluating the pathogenesis of VSNJV and VSIV in pigs [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The studies were conducted at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD), a biosafety level 3 agricultural (BSL-3Ag) facility that is part of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Two duplicate in vivo experiments were conducted, one with each representative strain. In each experiment, six landrace/duroc pigs (~7 weeks old and 13&#x02013;15 kg in weight) were housed together in the same animal room. After one week of acclimation, on the inoculation day, three of the pigs (contact group) were moved into a different room to avoid contact with the inoculated pigs for 24 h. The three remaining pigs (inoculated group) in the room were sedated using 0.3 mL of Stresnil (40 mg/mL Azaperone, Elanco Canada Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada) administered intramuscularly in the left hamstring. Afterward, pigs were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. Inoculation was conducted by scarification of the snout via microneedling with a 20 G needle up to the bevel of the needle. The snout was pricked 20 times prior and after the addition of 10<sup>7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of virus (in 50 &#x003bc;L of Alpha Minimal Essential Medium ((AMEM), Wisent Inc., Saint-Jean-Baptiste, QC, Canada) on the scarified area. The inoculum was allowed to soak for 3 min. The remaining inoculum was returned to the lab for back titration. After 24 h, contact pigs were returned to the room to co-mingle with the inoculated group for the duration of the experiment (21 days) (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-16-01915"><title>2.4.

Furthermore, this pattern was also characterized by the recovery of infectious virus from all six pigs infected with IN0919WYB2, contrasting with the detection of infectious particles in just three pigs of the group infected with 98COE (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Overall, despite viral RNA in nasal swabs, infectious virus was not recovered beyond 6 dpi (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>In oral swabs, minimal differences were observed between groups. At 4 dpi, infectious virus was recovered exclusively from two pigs in the group infected with IN0919WYB2, while a single viral isolate was obtained from the group infected with 98COE at 6 dpi (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). Like the pattern observed in nasal swabs, despite CT values, no infectious virus was recovered beyond 6 dpi (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). The minimal detection of infectious viral particles in both groups clearly suggested that the shedding of infectious particles from the oral cavity was not an important source of infectious virus induced during the infection with these two strains. No viral isolates were obtained from either animal group&#x02019;s rectal swabs.</p><p>Due to the apparent lack of correlation between the recovery of infectious virus and the presence of CT values, a Pearson r correlation analysis was performed. This analysis indicated a significant negative correlation (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value = 0.0081, r = &#x02212;0.8459) between the CT value in the sample and the proportion of viral isolates recovered at specific CT values (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). In samples with CT values between 17 and 19, the percentage of infectious particles recovered was 100%. However, above this range of CT values, there was a decrease in the recovery of infectious viruses (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). Overall, 73% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 19) of the viral isolates obtained in both groups were associated with CT values between 26 and 34 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E).</p><p>Additionally, a DAS ELISA was performed to infer if the lack of viral isolates observed in RT-qPCR positive samples was associated with the absence of viral antigens, denoting the presence of viral RNA in the clinical samples only. First, using several ten-fold dilutions of the viral stocks 98COE and IN0919WYB2, we determined the limit of detection of the DAS ELISA for both antigens. RT-qPCR was performed for each dilution. Limits of detection associated with CT values of 21.29 (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5.43</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) and 22.26 (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6.00</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) were observed for IN0919WYB2 and 98COE, respectively (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="app">Figure S2A,B</xref>). Overall, all nine of the viral isolates recovered during the experiment used as a control came positive by DAS ELISA, indicating the ability of this test to detect viral particles recovered from pigs (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="app">Figure S2C</xref>). In this sense, based on the detection limit predicted for the DAS ELISA, a total of six samples with CT values ranging between 22.75 and 26.49, all negative by viral isolation, were evaluated by DAS ELISA. Positive results by DAS ELISA were obtained in three (CT values 22.97, 23.46, and 24.76) of the six samples (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="app">Figure S2C</xref>), indicating the presence of viral antigens in some of these samples. Two of these samples came from nasal swabs from the inoculated pig #307 (98COE group) and from the contact pig #305 (IN0919WYB2 group) collected at dpi 6 and 8, respectively. The last sample was an oral swab collected at 8 dpi from the contact pig #310 (98COE group).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-16-01915"><title>3.5. Postmortem Sample Evaluation</title><p>A total of 12 postmortem tissues were collected from all pigs in each group at 21 dpi to evaluate potential differences in the viral distribution in tissues between pigs infected with either 98COE or IN0919WYB2. Overall, higher levels of viral RNA, based on RT-qPCR CT values, were observed in multiple tissues in pigs infected with IN0919WYB2 versus 98COE (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In inoculated pigs, significantly (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value = 0.04) higher levels of viral RNA were found in the tonsil of the soft palate in animals inoculated with IN0919WYB2, contrasting with pigs inoculated with 98COE, where no evidence of viral RNA was found in this tissue (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). Furthermore, while no viral RNA was present in the popliteal, parotid, prescapular, or gastrohepatic lymph nodes or in the snout skin from animals inoculated with 98COE, evidence of viral RNA was found in one of two inoculated animals from the IN0919WYB2 group (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). Evidence of viral RNA was found in the popliteal lymph nodes of animals 301 and 302, correlating with the presence of vesicular lesions in both hind coronary bands of these pigs and confirming the ability of IN0919WYB2 to disseminate away from the inoculation site.</p><p>In contact animals, viral RNA was undetectable in the tissues of the 98COE group (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). In contrast, significantly (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value = 0.04) higher levels of viral RNA were observed in the submandibular lymph nodes of contact pigs in the IN0919WYB2 group. In these animals, the presence of viral RNA was also detected in two pigs in the tonsil of the soft palate and one pig in the nasopharyngeal tonsil (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B).</p><p>No viral RNA from either group was detected in the following: neck skin, anterior tongue epithelium, or liver. In all cases, no infectious isolates were obtained from either group. However, based on the potentially high concentrations of predicted viral titers (predicted TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL based on CT values) (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A), we decided to look for the presence of viral antigens. Viral antigen was detected in inoculated animal #300 in the submandibular and parotid lymph nodes (corrected ODs 0.227 and 0.183, respectively) and in #307 in the submandibular lymph node (corrected OD 0.193), showing the presence of viral antigen at 21 dpi in both infected groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-viruses-16-01915"><title>3.6. Neutralizing Antibody Response</title><p>To assess potential differences in the adaptive immune response produced by the infection of pigs with either 98COE or IN0919WYB2, serum samples collected during the experiment were tested for virus neutralization. Overall, no differences were observed between inoculated animals from the different groups (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A).</p><p>Overall, at 6 dpi, neutralizing antibodies were recorded in all inoculated animals of both groups. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was consistent until the end of the experiment (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A). However, a dissimilar pattern was observed in contact animals between the groups. While the presence of neutralizing antibodies in contact pigs from the IN0919WYB2 group was evident between 7 and 9 dpc, all contact pigs from the 98COE group failed to develop neutralizing antibodies during the time of the experiment (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B). This lack of neutralizing antibody response clearly correlates with the absence of viral RNA in multiple tissues collected from contact pigs in the group 98COE (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B), providing evidence of the absence of contact transmission for 98COE.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-viruses-16-01915"><title>3.7. Evolutionary Dynamics of 98COE and IN0919WYB2 During Infection in Pigs</title><p>Finally, we explored potential differences between 98COE and IN0919WYB2 regarding their ability to induce viral variants during the infection in pigs. Our results showed that inoculation with IN0919WYB2 resulted in more genetic variability during the infection in pigs compared with 98COE (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Overall, a total of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found distributed in genes N, P, G, and L among viruses recovered from the pigs infected with IN0919WYB2, half of which were associated with nonsynonymous changes (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). Additionally, an insertion was found in the intergenic G-L region from pig #302 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A), which corresponds to the addition of an extra A in the highly conserved seven adenine polyadenylation signal present in the intergenic regions of VSV [<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our sequencing analysis revealed an interesting infection dynamic pattern, where seven viral variants at the consensus level were identified during the infection of pigs with IN0919WYB2 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). The consensus sequence associated with the viral stock (variant #0) was observed in only 2 of 20 viral isolates recovered during the infection, indicating that multiple viral variants dominated the infection dynamics in this experimental group. Specific changes at codon positions N/20, P/77, G/352, and L/2066 were observed in different variants, affecting multiple pigs at different time points during the infection. In this context, variant #1 was the most prevalent, identified in three pigs at multiple dpi (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A).</p><p>The synonymous mutation GCA-GCC in gene N/codon 20 was the most prevalent mutation during infection and was observed in seven isolates involving variants #1 and #6. It was the only mutation observed in the isolates recovered from all pigs at specific time points during the infection (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). Additionally, in pig #304 at four dpi, two different variants (#0 and #7) were recovered from oral and nasal swabs, respectively (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). The diverse nature of the mutations observed does not preclude the reversion back to the original state (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). Conversely, in pigs infected with 98COE, the infection was dominated by variant #0 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>B). In this group, two different variants were identified (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>B), one in pig #309 at 4 dpi and the other in pig #310 at 4 dpi. In pig #310, we observed the same pattern described in the other group, where the original viral phenotype was recovered later during the infection (<xref rid="viruses-16-01915-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-16-01915"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Recently, the epidemic 2019&#x02013;2020 VSIV lineage IN0919WYB2 emerged in the US, producing one of the largest outbreaks in the country [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The epidemiological characteristics of this lineage starkly differ from those of the previous VSIV lineage that impacted the US during 1997&#x02013;1998 [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], suggesting potential phenotypic distinctions between the two. In this scenario, similar to observations in other well-documented arboviruses like the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], it is uncertain whether the emergence of these epidemic lineages could be associated with the ability of specific viral phenotypes to be more efficient at replicating in either vertebrate hosts or vectors or even during outbreaks.</p><p>In this study, pigs, a natural host of VSV [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], were used to determine phenotypic differences in the vertebrate host between the strains 98COE and IN0919WYB2 associated with the epidemic lineages affecting the US in 1997&#x02013;1998 and in 2019&#x02013;2020, respectively. Since a previous study showed the host predilection of different VSV strains [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a possible concern in the interpretation of the results from our study is the distinct host origin of 98COE (horse) and IN0919WYB2 (bovine). In this sense, it has been shown that pigs represent a neutral host model for pathogenesis studies, being unaffected by the host predilections seen in some VSNJV strains from bovine origin. However, at this point we cannot rule out the possible effect in the pathogenesis in pigs produced by the strain 98COE. Future studies are needed to determine the neutrality of pigs as a model for pathogenesis studies from strains of horse origin.</p><p>Multiple genomic differences between 98COE and IN0919WYB2 may be potentially linked to the phenotypic differences observed in this study. Indeed, one of the most remarkable differences between both strains was the 14-nucleotide insertion located in the G-L intergenic region of IN0919WYB2. The presence of insertions in the G-L intergenic region has been described in VSIV strains from North American and Central American origin [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. At this point, we do not have an explanation regarding the possible role of this insertion in the phenotype displayed by IN0919WYB2 in pigs. Our results are consistent with a previous pathogenesis study in pigs [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showing that VSIV strains from a Central American origin carrying long insertions in the intergenic G-L region appeared more virulent than VSIV strains that originated in North America without insertions, suggesting the potential role of this insertion as a promoter of virulence in VSIV. Future experiments using reverse genetics are needed to acquire more insights about the possible role of the insertion in the phenotype observed in IN0919WYB2 infections in pigs.</p><p>Furthermore, our genomic analysis identified multiple putative mutations between both strains. Among these, three mutations at gene/codons P (CGA<sub>(R)</sub>-239-CTA<sub>(L<bold>)</bold></sub>) and L (CCA(P)-1622-CTA<sub>(L<bold>)</bold></sub>), (CGG<sub>(R)</sub>-1748-CAG<sub>(Q)</sub>) previously found under positive selection on natural populations of VSIV [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], might be considered to explain the phenotypic differences between both viruses. However, since analysis to identify the evolutionary significance of these mutations was conducted in silico [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], future studies using reverse genetics are needed to assess the possible role of these mutations in the pathogenesis of VSIV.</p><p>Previously, the epidemic VSNJV NJ0612NME6 was characterized, resulting in a highly virulent phenotype in pigs when compared with its closet endemic ancestor (NJ0806VCB) [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], suggesting that increased virulence is a hallmark of the epidemic VSV lineages. However, clinically, our results were consistent with previous publications, indicating the overall low virulence displayed by VSIV strains in pigs [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], even though the strains used in our study were associated with epidemic lineages. In our study, it was impossible to establish any statistically significant difference in terms of virulence between the strains based on the development of vesicular lesions. However, based on the development of small secondary vesicular lesions in two of three pigs infected with IN0919WYB2, it is possible to hypothesize that this virus may represent a slightly more virulent phenotype for pigs than 98COE. On the other hand, the fact that just two of three inoculated pigs at each group developed vesicular lesions in the inoculation site in the snout strongly suggests that both strains have similar levels of infectivity.</p><p>Regarding the evaluation of viral RNA in clinical samples, our results contrast with a previous study in pigs, where viral RNA in nasal and tonsil swabs was inconsistently found in infected animals [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Conversely, our results were consistent with previous studies on VSNJV using RT-PCR [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], showing shedding of viral RNA occurring as early as 1 dpi and 1 dpc in all pigs. A finding in our study was the lack of correlation between the presence of viral RNA in clinical samples and the recovery of infectious viruses. Despite detecting viral RNA in both groups, live virus, especially from nasal swabs, was mainly recovered from pigs (inoculated and contact) infected with IN0919WYB2. This observation highlights the efficiency of IN0919WYB2 to produce infectious particles during the infection in pigs. In this context, as seen in other viruses like Crimean&#x02013;Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and yellow fever virus [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], our results make it possible to hypothesize that IN0919WYB2 might be more efficient than 98COE in synchronizing the genome and particle production. In terms of transmissibility, this ability might be considered a critical difference between the strains evaluated in our study. Future studies are needed to assess potential differences between both viruses in terms of infectiousness.</p><p>To find a possible explanation for the lack of correlation between viral RNA and infectious virus seen in multiple clinical samples, we attempted to detect the presence of viral antigen using the DAS ELISA. However, because of the low sensitivity showed by this assay, the presence of viral antigen was confirmed in just three of the six clinical samples that tested negative for the presence of infectious particles from three distinct pigs. Despite the limited number of samples detected by DAS ELISA, it is possible to propose some conclusions. Two of the samples, from pigs #305 and #307, were collected at 8 dpi and 6 dpi, respectively, when the levels of neutralizing antibodies were between 2.5 and 3.5 log 10 VSIV neutralizing titer, suggesting that the presence of antibodies was responsible for our failure to isolate infectious particles from these clinical samples and others collected later during the infection. However, based on the positive sample detected from pig #310 at 8 dpi in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, we may suggest the potential presence of defective interfering virus particles (DIVPs). Additionally, three samples collected from postmortem tissues at 21 dpi from two pigs were also found positive by DAS ELISA, indicating that VSIV may persist in pigs after an acute infection. This result is consistent with a study showing the existence of a prolonged antigen presentation after an acute infection in mice, potentially contributing to an ongoing immune response [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Future studies are needed to understand this finding in pigs.</p><p>DIVPs are well known for their properties to modulate virulence by triggering the innate immune response and interfering with viral replication [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our study, the lack of correlation between viral RNA and infectious virus was more evident in the group of pigs infected with the 98COE strain, suggesting that increased levels of DIVPs might have been produced during the infection of pigs with this strain and, therefore, providing a possible hypothesis for the reduced levels of virulence seen in this experimental group. Our results may be consistent with a previous study, which found that there was cycling production of infectious virus in the brains of mice infected with VSV [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], a condition wherein there is alternating dominance between infective and interfering viral particles during the infection. In other arboviruses like the Zika virus, it has been demonstrated that DIVPs are antiviral in vivo, in both mice and mosquito vectors, reducing the transmission in the vector by up to 90% [<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Further experiments are needed to probe the potential relevance of DIVPs during the infection of VSV in pigs.</p><p>A postmortem lymph node evaluation was performed in our study to contrast the ability of both strains to disseminate along the seven lymphatic territories previously described in pigs (parotid, mandibular, dorsal cervical, ventral cervical, subiliac, inguinal, and popliteal) [<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Overall, in contrast to the group of pigs inoculated with 98COE, the positive results in the PTON and SLMN lymph nodes in all three pigs inoculated with IN0919WYB2 suggest the ability of this strain to replicate at higher levels in the parotid and mandibular lymphatics, respectively. This observation was consistent with the higher levels of infectious virus recovered from pigs infected with IN0919WYB2, supporting that this strain may represent a more virulent phenotype than 98COE for pigs. Furthermore, considering the inoculation route used in this study and the presence of positive samples in the PopLN (popliteal territory) in two of three pigs inoculated with IN0919WYB2, it can also be suggested that IN0919WYB2 has the potential to disseminate systemically during infection, which may reflect the claimed increase in virulence of this strain. However, most positive results were found in the parotid (PTON and NTON) and mandibular (SMLN and ParLN) lymphatic territories in both groups, suggesting that during the infection in pigs with these two strains, the majority of viral replication takes place locally, close to the primary site of the infection. This situation highly contrasts with our previous results with VSNJV [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], showing the intrinsic differences between both serotypes to produce a systemic infection in pigs. This situation can be correlated with the severity of the clinical outcomes observed during the infection with VSNJV in pigs [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Unlike the contact pigs evaluated from the IN0919WYB2 group, no positive results (for nucleic acid or live virus) were obtained from postmortem samples collected from the contact pigs from the 98COE group. In this context, the limited number of viral isolations obtained from this contact group (n = 1) may reflect the extremely low levels of infectious particles circulating in these pigs, providing a possible explanation not only for the absence of neutralizing antibodies but also the lack of RNA detection in postmortem samples. These results also stress the value of including contact pigs in experimental groups during pathogenesis studies to assess differences in levels of transmissibility among VSIV strains.</p><p>Finally, in this study, we evaluated a poorly understood aspect of the evolution of VSV during an in vivo infection in a natural host. Overall, we consider that the results of this approach generated an interesting perspective, not only due to the possible differences in the evolutionary dynamics between the two VSIV epidemic strains but also to an increase in our insights about the potential role of the vertebrate host during the infectious cycle of VSV in nature. Our results also showed the possible relevance of the vertebrate host in the occurrence of viral diversity during infection, a condition dependent on the intrinsic characteristics of specific viral strains. Based on the above statements, we conclude that the ability of IN0919WYB2 to induce an increased number of viral variants during the infection in pigs might have represented an evolutionary advantage for the VSIV lineage associated with the epidemic outbreak of 2019&#x02013;2020 in the US. This characteristic may be considered an additional factor to help understand the epidemiological differences recorded between the epidemic VSIV lineages from 1997&#x02013;1998 and 2019&#x02013;2020 [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In this sense, among the multiple mutations reported during our study, the GCT<bold><sub>(A)</sub></bold>-GTT<bold><sub>(V)</sub></bold> mutation at codon G/352, associated with a neutralizing epitope [<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], was the only mutation found that was previously reported in VSIV in nature [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The report showed that the substitution GCT<bold><sub>(A)</sub></bold>-GTT<bold><sub>(V)</sub></bold> was a putative mutation linked to the group of viruses dominating the VSIV outbreak in the US during 2020 [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on the results of our pathogenesis study, we suggest that the emergence of the mutation GCT(A)-GTT<sub>(V)</sub> during the outbreak was probably the result of an infection in livestock instead of an insect vector. However, because neither this mutation nor the other mutations reported in this study became dominant during the infection in pigs, we speculate that genetic drift instead of natural selection may be responsible for the evolutionary pattern observed in this study, suggesting that the mutation GCT<sub>(A<bold>)</bold></sub>-GTT<sub>(V)</sub> might not be implicated in the adaptation of VSV in livestock. In this context, the fact that the mutation GCT<sub>(A)</sub>-GTT<sub>(V)</sub> was fixed and maintained in the sub-lineage dominating the infections in the outbreak during 2020 after multiple transmission events [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] strongly suggests that this mutation might have represented an adaptive advantage for this sub-lineage to replicate in a specific insect vector during the outbreak. More studies are needed to assess the potential role of the multiple mutations described in this study in viral adaptation in livestock and insect vectors.</p><p>In conclusion, our study indicates that the VSIV epidemic strains 98COE and IN0919WYB2, which represent the epidemic lineages of 1997&#x02013;1998 and 2019&#x02013;2020, respectively, constitute two different phenotypes in terms of transmissibility for pigs. This phenotypic difference may be correlated with the epidemiological discrepancies observed between the outbreaks produced by both lineages in the US [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01915" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The recovery of infectious virus from contact pigs was obtained from animals in a subclinical state, suggesting that this situation may be a confounding factor during epidemic outbreaks, favoring the transmission of VSIV by the movement of apparently uninfected animals. In this sense, our results make it possible to hypothesize a scenario where in the absence of clinical disease, other sources of infection beyond the vesicular lesions should be considered as a potential source of the infection of susceptible animals or insect vectors. Finally, our results indicate that protocols for pathogenesis studies of VSV should be redefined beyond the typical assessment based on just the detection of vesicular lesions. Some important limitations must be considered in this study. One is the lack of characterization of the specific viral RNA particles detected in the clinical samples (genomic RNA, antigenomic RNA, and messenger RNA) by RT-qPCR. Second is our inability to produce full-length genome sequences directly from clinical samples that were positive by RT-PCR but with an absence of infectious viral particles. We consider that these approaches might have given insights about the lack of correlation observed in this study between viral RNA and infectious virus and the potential relevance of DIVPs during the replication of VSIV in pigs. Additionally, the lack of in vitro characterization to assess possible differences in the gene expression related to the innate immune response between both strains should be considered an additional limitation during this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the Animal Care staff for their valuable help with experiments.

Two groups of pigs were used to evaluate the pathogenesis of the strains 98COE and IN0919WYB2, representative of the epidemic lineages responsible for outbreaks of VSIV in the US during 1997&#x02013;1998 and 2019&#x02013;2020. Each experimental group comprised six pigs, with three of the pigs in each group being inoculated in the snout. In comparison, the remaining three pigs evaluated the ability of each strain to be transmitted by direct contact. Contact pigs in each room co-mingled with inoculated pigs after 24 h post-inoculation (hpi). Pig# reflects diverse pigs&#x02019; roles during the experiment (inoculated or contact).
