This is acutely relevant to the now undeniable evidence that many diseases develop differently between the sexes and may also be affected by gender. Current health and medical practices across the globe generally fail to cater for sex and gender effects in common diseases. Inadequate policy frameworks to guide the comprehensive inclusion of sex and gender in research jeopardises scientific rigour and ultimately the practices they underpin. To ensure that Australian health and medical research is fit-for-purpose, we realised that potent initiatives would be necessary to expedite strategic reframing of thought and behaviour. Here we report on our innovative engagement of end-users for democratic self-determined policy reform to guide health and medical research, based on robust data. We draw upon our specific study to outline seven key steps that can be adopted to accelerate effective change, across a breadth of evidence-based initiatives to reform health policies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>public health and medical research policy</kwd><kwd>health and medical research equity</kwd><kwd>innovative methodology</kwd><kwd>evidence-based change</kwd><kwd>democratic policy reform</kwd><kwd>sex-gender</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

If data underpinning a procedure is not reliable though, patients are at risk of suboptimal health management. This is a danger if biological sex differences are not adequately considered in experimental models adopted in health and medical research. In human studies, this is exacerbated if gender is insufficiently factored into analyses.</p><p>Compelling evidence now indicates that health can be significantly influenced by a person&#x02019;s sex and gender (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Traditionally, sex has been reported female or male at birth, largely based on genitalia. Some people have innate variations in sex characteristics that do not align with features typically associated with their sex. In contrast to sex, gender is a socially constructed concept that includes: woman, man and many other terms that do not fit this binary, including gender diverse people (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Gender identity may or may not align with sex. The relative disease risks for people with innate variations of sex characteristics, and trans and gender diverse people are under-studied (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Although environmental exposures can affect health, there are many disparities in health outcomes that cannot be adequately explained by external influences alone and these point to biological differences. For example, while healthier lifestyle habits are more common among women than men and likely contribute to extended longevity, these extra years are often overshadowed by poor health, for reasons that are not fully explained by exposures and behaviours (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Discriminant health outcomes between the sexes are evident across major causes of death, including cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), that encompass ischemic heart disease (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and stroke (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); cancers of non-reproductive organs (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); and many other diseases across the globe (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition, gender can be an important influence on health, and health equity is at risk when populations are inadequately included in studies (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Male disease symptoms have typically guided diagnosis and treatment of many diseases (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). There are many reasons for this asymmetry, including: higher prevalence of many diseases in males, often at younger age (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); medical practice and research historically being a prerogative of men (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); dismission of feminine emotions (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); the complexity of female genetics (where a double dose of X chromosomes in females involves complex regulation to equate the gene dosing of males with single X chromosomes) (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); and female biology and reproductive capacity (exemplified in reference) (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). But if sex and gender difference in diseases are overlooked, there is a risk that heath care outcomes will not be equitable (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Prompted by these concerns, governing and regulatory bodies in North America and Europe (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), have primarily adopted top-down tactics to introduce corrective measures. These include: guidelines formulated over the past 10&#x02013;15&#x0202f;years by publishers [e.g., SAGER (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)]; policies by funding agencies in Canada (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), United States, Europe (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); and recommendations of cultural change in the United Kingdom (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Education has been introduced into some universities and research institutions (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); and Japan and South Korea have held forums to promote awareness and change (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The Canadian policy initiatives have been reviewed to evaluate effectiveness. Introducing policy without support proved poorly effective though and over time, auxiliary interventions were added to promote compliance (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Inclusion of biological sex in research design and reporting in science publications has now risen from ~22% in 2010 to 83% in 2019, with many human studies also considering gender (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The Canadian experience indicated that sector-wide behavioural change on this topic is accelerated when policy reform is supplemented by direct researcher engagement.</p><p>Australia (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and numerous other countries lag behind North America and Europe regarding sex and gender policies in health and medicine. Australia has been slow to recognise the importance of sex and gender in health and medicine, and even slower to take action (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The Australian research sector is in dire need of correcting its course to be appropriately fit-for-purpose. Delayed actions on the other hand, offer opportunities to tackle this situation, guided by the experience of others.</p><p>Since undertaking our initiative, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Department of Health and Aged Care (that oversees the administration of the Medical Research Future Fund, MRFF) has responded to this void with an on-line statement published as recently as 2024 (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), encouraging consideration of sex and gender variables in the research they fund. Learning from the Canadian studies (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) though, it is evident that additional measures are necessary for rapid transformation of recommendations into practice. Our manuscript outlines a creative scheme for policy revision to drive fundamental shifts in the mind-set and operation of discovery science- and clinical-researchers, in response to new evidence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Project aims and rationale</title><p>Our novel approach to fostering policy transformation has been to engage the target sector at its grass-roots, and in turn leverage their influence to catalyse change across all levels. The overall goal of our specific initiative is to ensure genuine and strategic consideration of biological sex, throughout all stages of discovery studies and clinical trials; with gender also addressed where relevant; leading ultimately to advanced and equitable patient care. Our immediate aims from our 2023 initiative were: first, to engage representative stakeholders from across the Australian health and medical research community; to second, facilitate their drafting of evidence-based guidelines for self-directing routine considerations of biological sex and gender in medical research; that would third, accelerate transformative practice across the sector.</p><p>We reasoned that by consulting with people who would be impacted by the proposed changes, and integrating their peer feedback, we would achieve quality decision-making, that would foster trustworthy and constructive change. We conjectured that exposure of end-users to evidence would drive rational transformation in thought and behaviour. We expected that this would be far more effective than tokenistic compliance to satisfy bureaucratic regulations that are frequently perceived as stumbling blocks. Our base-up, guideline formulation strategy is distinct, yet complementary to the important, top-down approaches adopted by regulatory bodies in Australia (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and other countries (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Design</title><p>We identified seven steps to fast-track evidenced-based policy change, to transform practice. Adopting a deliberative democracy approach was core to our course of action. The deliberative democratic process in this context requires facilitated: recruitment of representative participants from a target population; participant exposure to diverse angles of the on-topic evidence base around a chosen remit; thoughtful and open engagement with the subject matter; inclusive, reasoned, on-topic discussions; in advance of consensus decision-making around chosen aspects of the selected topic (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Seven steps to effective policy formation through deliberative democracy.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

This approach has broad reach and could be applied to any evidence-base underpinning practice. Our method is a fresh, bottom-up strategy, that cultivates change by engaging sector stakeholders in policy design workshops where they are exposed to robust data.</p><p>We capitalised on our specific Australian experience to formulate this universal blueprint for self-guided, fact-centred governance reform. We understand this adaption of the democratic deliberative process is a first-in-kind approach to overhauling sex and gender policy in health and medical research.

Choosing a receptive cohort, performing unbiased selection of its representatives to participate in a deliberative panel and establishing courteous rules of engagement, are fundamental elements to this process. In recruiting the panel members, it is important that the overall goal and the process is explained, together with on outline of the expected level of time commitment. It is relevant to explain that the process involves a &#x02018;Deliberative Panel&#x02019; approach that is a creative adaptation of a &#x02018;Citizens Jury&#x02019;, with the goal of facilitating end-users to self-impose policy reformation. This contrasts the more familiar consultative approaches adopted by researchers to inform [as reviewed (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)].</p><p>From the outset it is crucial to establish respectful interaction protocols both between participants, and towards the data to be delivered from a range of sources across the workshops.

Panel members were drawn from the institutes who responded to the requests of AAMRI&#x02019;s CEO for nominations of participants. A clear request for diverse participants was conveyed during the recruitment process and this was respected.

</p><p>Exposing scientifically accurate, objective and comprehensive data is the crucial component that underpins the quality of the drafted guidelines.

The panel members were asked to focus their line of questioning towards better understand the remit of: <italic>What should AAMRI do to support the improved use of sex and gender in research practices and decision-making</italic>? At the completion of these rotations, the panel members wrote down their thoughts around: <italic>What should we stop doing? What should we start doing? What should we continue doing?</italic> These were shared as a group, discussed, and emerging common ideas were noted and knowledge gaps identified. This information fed into Workshop 2.</p><p>Pre-Workshop 2: Written and recorded responses were circulated to fill information gaps identified in Workshop 1, including: Details of the on-topic commitments and actions initiated from AAMRI, the academic leads, and the Australian government health funders; Evidence from identified international sources that policy change has impact; Resources for terminology; Additional personal examples of poor health outcomes when sex and gender and other intersecting factors (i.e., ethnicity and age) are not properly considered.</p><p>Workshop 2: Additional requested perspectives presented and discussed included: Commitment of AAMRI president elect to the process; Policy initiatives from the Australian government funding agency NHMRC; Different perspectives of health issues facing nonbinary people; Influence of ethnicity on health in the context of sex and gender considerations.</p><p>In summary: Evidence was delivered by the team&#x02019;s academic leads in advance of the first meeting, as a customised information pack that presented a breadth of pertinent peer-reviewed publications and discussion points. This was complimented over the workshops, by topic experts, and people with relevant knowledge, across a range of perspectives, including those with lived experience.</p></boxed-text><p>
<bold>Step 5: Deliberate and democratically draft policy.</bold>
</p><p>Deliberation in this context involves thoughtful reflection on the evidence base of a chosen topic, approached from various perspectives in a non-coercive manner. Thorough critical deliberation on available evidence is central to exposing biases, gaps in knowledge and suboptimal behaviours. Recommendations for solutions must be guided by evidence.</p><p>Concentrated review of robust evidence is in turn crucially partnered with democratic decision making and inform policy drafting in this process. Clear and effective deliberative democracy relies on thorough explanation of the principles of the process. Recruiting expert and experienced facilitators to introduce the process in a workshop format ensures professional delivery and expedites outcomes.</p><p>Effective deliberation requires: dedicating time and attention by each participant to the process; embracing discussions and contributing constructive input; fostering functional spontaneous group dynamics to ensure all voices are heard and ideas adequately recorded and shared among the group. Productive outputs evolve from a repetitious cycle of topic engagement - deliberation - decision making; oscillating around an axis of divergence-emergence-convergence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Consensus on the proposals is crucial for democratic-decision making within the panel (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Key elements for successful progression to consensus include: realistic expectations of drafted policy recommendations; willingness to listen to alternative views and compromise for consensus; and capacity to reach decisions democratically within the given timeframe.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The cyclic processes of the deliberative policy drafting process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpubh-12-1522213-g002" position="float"/></fig><p>A three-day immersive, deliberative process spaced at two-week intervals between meetings is a minimal model for achieving recommendation consensus. In person meetings are recommended but virtual elements, such as an on-line session, may also be considered. Extended programmes that are entirely in-person, involving a fourth day for expanded deliberation to reach consensus, are highly recommended as best practice for many applications.</p><boxed-text id="box5" position="float"><p>

</p><p><bold>Deliberate and democratically draft policy:</bold> Maximising policy drafting success requires clear explanation of the principles of the process of deliberative democracy: Engagement with the evidence; Deliberation upon it; Democratic proposal of changes. These activities are performed as a repetitious cycle to advance consensus and ultimately policy drafting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To effectively address the AAMRI remit, a three-day immersive, deliberative workshop, spaced at two-week intervals between meetings was adopted. In our case, the first and third workshops were in person and the second was virtual.</p></list-item></list><p>The guiding principles of the deliberative process were introduced to the panel in workshop 1 to equip them to contend with the evidence base. Prepared in this way, the panel members were equipped to identify holes in the evidence base and brainstorm deficits in practice. The academic leads worked to provide supplementary information by engaging additional topic experts in advance of the second workshop to feed the cycle of informed topic engagement and deliberation, to ultimately achieve consensus.</p><p>The evidence-base was further enhanced in the on-line workshop 2, with additional speakers recruited into interactive small-group discussions with the panel members. Panel members were divided into groups of four and each group rotated in turn with every speaker. Panel members were each asked to list their top two insights into the central AAMRI remit. Through interactive discussion with all the panel members together, these ideas were clustered into five topic areas for in-depth deliberation. The topics related to terminology deficits; implementation; accountability; quality research and education.</p><p>The panel was again broken-up into groups for on-line extended deliberation of the major challenges associated with each of the listed topics. Each group was assigned one topic and tasked with listing what they considered to be its most challenging aspects. Panel members were then asked to individually propose up to three ideas for possible actions for change around these topics, prompted by the statement&#x02014;&#x02018;How might we address&#x02019;&#x02014;the identified challenge. Subsequent deliberation in assigned groups focused on developing these &#x02018;crowd-sourced&#x02019; proposed actions into a series of refined, draft recommendations to mediate the desired changes. An important aspect of each group&#x02019;s job was to represent the entire panel, not just their own perspective, when drafting recommendations.</p><p>At the end of Workshop 2, an initial preliminary draft of policy recommendations had been developed for review. Topic experts, and AAMRI and the academic leads provided brief written responses to the recommendations in advance of the final workshop&#x02014;outlining their understanding of the recommendations, what they would do with that advice and asking further questions of the group&#x02014;to aid them in finalising the recommendations. These were circulated to all panel members prior to Workshop 3. Panel members requested to complete an online survey at this stage, voting on how comfortable they were with each recommendation (according to a scale of: Love, Like, Live-with, Loath) and were requested to suggest tangible improvements.</p><p>In Workshop 3, the policy recommendations and comments were opened for further review and discussion in response to the topic experts in the final session. Panel members worked cohesively within the given timeframe to understand outstanding concerns and resolve these in updated versions of each recommendation. An advanced draft was democratically developed by the panel, building from small group discussions to panel-wide elections. To measure consensus, each recommendation was voted for majority approval prior to inclusion. Approval was set to 80% acceptance of each policy recommendation. A consolidated set of four policy recommendations were accepted by the end of the Workshop.</p><p>Achieving collective decisions was the task of the facilitators. Their professional expertise in mediating amicable consensuses relied on their capacity to: direct respectful discussions, establish a realistic pass rate to each democratic vote (set at 80% in each round), and introduce realistic time constraints. Setting reasonable expectations and defining time boundaries was crucial. Clear understanding of the benefit of reaching concrete outcomes was a strong motivation that led to the timely success of our process.</p><p>The facilitators were also responsible for supporting the process of leading the panellist members to grapple with the evidence-base to develop the final recommendations. The facilitator&#x02019;s lack of expert knowledge on the chosen topic strategically avoided introducing pre-conceived biases, whether unconscious or conscious. The process would not have achieved such successful outcomes without the support of experienced deliberative facilitation. In summary: Throughout the first two workshops, in collaboration with the academic leads, the facilitators guided panel members to interrogate evidence, share knowledge and evaluate the current state of sex and gender considerations in Australian health and medical research. Gaps in knowledge and practice, barriers, challenges, and potential opportunities for improvement were uncovered. These formed the basis for the formulation of new policy recommendations that were produced from the third workshop to address the AAMRI remit.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Step 6: Endorse and disseminate the policy among the target population</bold>.

In our prototype example, through collaborative efforts, the panel members generated policy recommendations that aim to systematically address the current deficiencies in the integration of sex and gender in health and medical research practices in Australia. Four specific measures are recommended to catalyse sector-wide change from the grassroots up (<xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These recommendations ultimately seek to enhance equitable health outcomes across populations. The essence of AAMRI&#x02019;s commitments for change are to include sex and gender considerations in research; to dynamically review terminology to remain contemporary; to promote compliance through monitoring; and to introduce on-topic education to its constituent member organisations. Each policy recommendation was accompanied by a list of advised supporting actions (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p>Introducing organisational change is reputed to be challenging (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Changing practice in medicine specifically is notoriously slow, and on average, translating a research finding to implementation takes 17&#x0202f;years (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This predicts that early sex and gender policy initiatives by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) from 2010, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from around 2016 (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), are yet to fully benefit patients, leaving many practices still disproportionately catering to males [e.g., (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)]. A Canadian study identified primary barriers to change were: inadequate knowledge and skill; perception of irrelevance and lack of feasibility; deficient funding support; and insufficient culture at an institutional level (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Investigation by our co-authors of Australian obstacles to sex and gender policy development and implementation, also identified a lack of knowledge and skills (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); and funding deficiencies. An uneven availability of high-quality evidence-based research was also recognised as an impediment to change. This has arisen at least in part, from systematic biases in existing studies, caused by the failure to adopt representative inclusion on the basis of sex and gender (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Additional impediments relate to: inadequate training and tools; a paucity of leadership to champion change; ill-defined terminology (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); a shortage of content experts, and few local examples of successful (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Our method offers a new way to speed-up policy reformation and overcome barriers linked to slow uptake. Our innovative variation of the Citizen&#x02019;s Jury (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) approach directly empowers the impacted sector to script informed policies to lead responsible self-governance. This is based on open engagement with the available evidence and personal discovery of the shortcomings of existing practices. This pathway of research and analysis is the core business of academic scientists and is highly suited to their mind-set.</p><p>This process also offers a vigorous approach to delivering additional enablers. Overcoming resistance to change is an example. By fostering a respectful environment for open appraisal of multiple facets of an evidence base, participants are given the opportunity to rationally re-evaluate preconceived opinions. The concise output of our Australian process was a list of recommendations and supporting actions (<xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) to surmount the barriers to change. The specific actions can be distilled down to: advocacy, definitive language, monitoring change and education (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Dedicated Australian funding is required to achieve these changes.</p><p>Our work towards sex and gender policy introduction highlights the value of tapping into existing leadership networks to access sector representation: in our case AAMRI, comprising ~50% of the medical research sector in Australia. AAMRI provided a framework of compliance obligation from its members and a mechanism for its own ongoing commitment to lead enduring change - to ensure that initiatives are not static but are dynamically maintained and nurtured into the future. Notably, AAMRI will draw on the support of the newly launched Australian Centre for Sex and Gender Equity in Health and Medicine to meet its obligations (officially inaugurated March 2024). This concerted leadership for change on this front is timely, as the major government health and medical research funders in Australia issued a joint statement in mid-2024 (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) requesting that sex and gender be considered in its funding applications.</p><p>Beyond the immediate success of our policy draft, this initiative offers vision for application on several fronts. First, our pilot work is an excellent proof of principle of feasibility and encourages expansion to the remaining half of the Australian health and medical sector that are not under the AAMRI umbrella. Second, this approach is pertinent to other countries that are yet to advance policies on this topic. Third, these methods offer scope for adaptation for modifying a host of other issues where a solid evidence base provides a logical rationale for change, for public health and beyond. Australian researchers must rapidly and comprehensively embrace policy reform initiatives on sex and gender to drive game changing practices that are necessary for medical relevance. Adopting improved procedures is fundamental to medical advancement. This aligns with the nimble adoption of protocol transformation. Delays between discoveries and their implementation risk lives, which emphasises the benefits of accelerating translation. A direct advantage of our frame is that can be progressively moulded as new information comes to light, to keep regulations contemporary and relevant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This strategy of end-user policy design is a constructive approach to changing the culture of thinking and acting on a given topic. Exposing overwhelming evidence, hand-in-hand with outlining a path to reform, through personalising responsibility across the sector, is identified as a potent change catalyst. Our specific instance of introducing sex and gender policy recommendations exposes important general principles for innovating transformations that avoid bureaucratic stagnation and draconian threats. The outcomes of our specific initiative have driven policy directives that are currently cascading into practical, self-driven initiatives to spread the uptake of this paradigm shift. In addition to pioneering change, our work also emphasises the need for ongoing education, support and fostering to maintain momentum that sustains the uptake of altered behaviours.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the philanthropic donation for this work.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec8"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec9"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval was not required for the studies involving humans because all humans in this study were consented and are authors on this work.
