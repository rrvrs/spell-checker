The calls received in that first session were few and included numerous hang-ups, but after a few weeks of operation requests for information about sex and sexuality, access to contraception, relationship problems, unplanned pregnancy and cross-dressing, amongst other issues, began to trickle in.<xref rid="dbae018-en1" ref-type="fn"><sup>1</sup></xref> This telephone line, called the Adolescent Confidential Telephone Service (ACTS), was established by the Irish Family Planning Association (IFPA) youth group in Dublin in October 1984 (<xref rid="dbae018-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). It operated on Saturday afternoons between 1 and 5 p.m. as a pilot project until December 1984, before being formally launched in January 1985 to mark International Youth Year, and it ran until July 1990. The youth group had been established by Christine Donaghy, then information and education officer, and Dr. Mary Short, an IFPA doctor.<xref rid="dbae018-en2" ref-type="fn"><sup>2</sup></xref> The group&#x02019;s initiatives also included a Young People&#x02019;s Family Planning Centre (set up in November 1986), problem pages in two magazines for young people, the production of educational leaflets and visits to local secondary schools. Their activism culminated in the &#x02018;Virgin Condom Case&#x02019; (1988&#x02013;91) where youth volunteers set up a counter in the Virgin Megastore in Dublin and sold condoms illegally in order to challenge the law around the sale of condoms.<xref rid="dbae018-en3" ref-type="fn"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><fig position="float" id="dbae018-F1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>ACTS poster, 1985.

Reflecting on the broader context and the important gap that the ACTS filled in providing sexual health information to young people who may have been too embarrassed or too young to seek help from other sources, former volunteer John Callaghan explained:<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Of course, at the time you couldn&#x02019;t, your local library didn&#x02019;t stock this information. The chemist could have been a conservative, religious person who didn&#x02019;t want to talk about these things with you or didn&#x02019;t want to be dispensing contraceptive pills or whatever, where did you go for the information? Where did you go to look for it? It wasn&#x02019;t available, literally it wasn&#x02019;t available. It was very difficult for people to access it unless they would come, often people outside of Dublin would be making trips to Dublin or to Cork or to Galway or whatever, to get into a family planning centre &#x02026; Then they had to deal with the shame and embarrassment and inhibition that traditional church teaching and their communities have put on them. Not having the language, not knowing what questions to ask. Being terrified that by accident their priest will be there, or their neighbours will be on the street outside and everybody will know that they are a dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, whatever, fill in your own blank in there.<xref rid="dbae018-en7" ref-type="fn"><sup>7</sup></xref></p></disp-quote></p><p>Callaghan&#x02019;s testimony here highlights the legal, societal, religious, and in some cases emotional restrictions on young Irish people&#x02019;s access to both sexual information and contraception. An examination of the operation of the ACTS thus reveals much about the impact of this landscape on young people, the experiences of activists who were actively trying to change sexual health provision in Ireland, and the intergenerational tensions around this change.</p><p>In recent years, the work of teen and young adult-led activist movements such as March for Our Lives and School Strike for Climate has led to greater recognition of the important role of young people in political activism today. As Hava Rachel Gordon has emphasized, this phenomenon reminds us that we should consider young people as &#x02018;political agents in their own right, rather than as citizens-in-the-making who develop into actual political actors and engaged citizens only when they reach adulthood&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en8" ref-type="fn"><sup>8</sup></xref> However the longer history of youth activism, with a few important exceptions, has been relatively neglected. In the case of Ireland, while there is a significant emerging scholarship on the history of activism, including valuable studies of feminist and gay activism as well as the activism of organizations involved in the illegal provision of contraceptives in Ireland pre-legalization,<xref rid="dbae018-en9" ref-type="fn"><sup>9</sup></xref> the role of younger people in this area has been ignored.<xref rid="dbae018-en10" ref-type="fn"><sup>10</sup></xref> Similarly, young people, with the exception of valuable recent research by Caroline Rusterholz and Hannah Charnock, have not been the focus of research in the history of sexual and reproductive health more broadly.<xref rid="dbae018-en11" ref-type="fn"><sup>11</sup></xref> The case study explored here sheds new light on the motivations and experiences of the young activists who volunteered with the ACTS. It also explores their activism in the context of their own emotional labour. The significance of emotions in activism and social protest, as both a mobilizing and uniting force, has been investigated by a number of historians, but less attention has been paid to the emotional labour of the activists themselves.<xref rid="dbae018-en12" ref-type="fn"><sup>12</sup></xref> The concept of emotional labour as something which &#x02018;requires one to induce or suppress feeling in order to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others&#x02019; was coined by Arlie Hochschild in 1983, and has since become widely used.<xref rid="dbae018-en13" ref-type="fn"><sup>13</sup></xref> More recently Karissa Patton has highlighted the importance of gender in such labour; her research on the Calgary Birth Control Association &#x02018;epitomises how gendered and undervalued labours of care became woven into feminist health models during the 1970s&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en14" ref-type="fn"><sup>14</sup></xref> In the case of operators of a telephone line, as we shall see, we might deem emotional labour to refer to the operators&#x02019; withholding of their own emotions and feelings in order to create a safe space for the caller to present their problem.</p><p>The 1980s was an unsettling period for many young people internationally. As Gavin Brown and Helen Yaffe have recently demonstrated, young people in the 1980s faced high unemployment, rapid social change, the threat of nuclear war, and the panic of the AIDS crisis, a combination of factors which &#x02018;made many young people fear for the[ir] future&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en15" ref-type="fn"><sup>15</sup></xref> Yet the early 1980s were also witness to what has been described as the &#x02018;second youth revolt&#x02019; in Europe, characterized by &#x02018;a focus on occupations and militant defence of squatted places, dismissal of political parties and political organisations, a renewed focus on the subjective aspect of politics and a focus on locality&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en16" ref-type="fn"><sup>16</sup></xref> Within Europe, youth organizations exchanged ideas, strategies and perspectives.<xref rid="dbae018-en17" ref-type="fn"><sup>17</sup></xref> Moreover, as Daniel Laqua and Nikolaos Papadogiannis have recently argued, young people could gain empowerment from their involvement in internationalist initiatives, and a sense of belonging to a transnational community.<xref rid="dbae018-en18" ref-type="fn"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>The IFPA was a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) which enabled the youth group to tap into international networks. In December 1985, IFPA youth group volunteer Jon O&#x02019;Brien attended a workshop organized by the IPPF Regional Adolescent Services Project in Milan, Italy.<xref rid="dbae018-en19" ref-type="fn"><sup>19</sup></xref> Individuals from family planning groups in other European countries who were considering setting up similar services visited the IFPA to discuss the telephone line and the youth clinic with volunteers.<xref rid="dbae018-en20" ref-type="fn"><sup>20</sup></xref> O&#x02019;Brien was personally inspired by Elise Ottesen-Jensen, the founder of the Swedish RFSU Group and a founder of IPPF, recalling, &#x02018;I had her on my wall because we very much felt solidarity internationally with people. We felt solidarity with the Poles, you know, living in a Catholic environment.&#x02019; Some of the initiatives of the youth group were inspired by projects such as Grapevine in the UK and the Swedish RFSU youth clinics. In O&#x02019;Brien&#x02019;s view, &#x02018;that international solidarity was important and inspiring and really gave us energy and kept us going&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en21" ref-type="fn"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p>The foundation of the Adolescent Confidential Telephone Service (ACTS) by the IFPA in 1984 followed a longer history of telephone counselling internationally as well as of radical health activism in relation to reproductive rights in the Irish context, particularly around the issue of contraception.<xref rid="dbae018-en22" ref-type="fn"><sup>22</sup></xref> While volunteers on telephone counselling services might not identify as &#x02018;activists&#x02019;, in Cait McKinney&#x02019;s words, &#x02018;caring for others using information is vital service work that builds basic movement infrastructures&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en23" ref-type="fn"><sup>23</sup></xref> Early crisis counselling hotlines were established in Britain and the United States by religious ministers, such as Chad Varah, a British Anglican vicar who founded the world&#x02019;s first crisis hotline in 1953 in England (this later became the Samaritans); Reverend Kenneth B. Murphy, a Catholic priest who founded the first American suicide hotline in 1959 in Boston; and Bernard Duncan Mayes, who founded the second in San Francisco in 1961.<xref rid="dbae018-en24" ref-type="fn"><sup>24</sup></xref> As McKinney has shown, &#x02018;hotlines responded to conditions of discontent and the unmet needs of &#x0201c;those who felt alienated by established helping agencies&#x0201d;, including sexual minorities&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en25" ref-type="fn"><sup>25</sup></xref> In her history of teletherapy, Hannah Zeavin similarly comments, &#x02018;the phone further allows for an intimate anonymity between peers, where the historical power dynamic and relationship of clinician-patient and priest-parishioner can be left behind for new roles: that of the empowered user and the lay volunteer who can provide something a trained professional can&#x02019;t, a spontaneous &#x0201c;anonymous ear&#x0201d;&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en26" ref-type="fn"><sup>26</sup></xref> In the UK, gay activists were also instrumental in establishing telephone counselling services for the queer community; these included the telephone service Friend founded by the Campaign for Homosexual Equality in 1971, and Gay Switchboard, which was set up in 1974.<xref rid="dbae018-en27" ref-type="fn"><sup>27</sup></xref> Gay and lesbian telephone lines emerged out of the international gay liberation movement of the 1970s, and sought to &#x02018;address isolation from social services, fear of judgement by homophobic hotline operators, and resistance to a counselling psychology that pathologized same-sex desire as mental illness&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en28" ref-type="fn"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p>The experiences of individuals using sexual health services can be difficult to uncover due to restrictions on access to client records, and young people&#x02019;s experiences with sexual health services are particularly difficult to locate in the historical record.<xref rid="dbae018-en29" ref-type="fn"><sup>29</sup></xref> The detailed logbook kept by the IFPA youth group of telephone calls to the ACTS during the course of its existence represents an important window into the key problems facing Irish young people in relation to sexuality and sexual health in the 1980s, and in particular, the experiences of men, who have tended to be excluded from histories of contraception in particular.<xref rid="dbae018-en30" ref-type="fn"><sup>30</sup></xref> I also draw here on the uncatalogued archives of the IFPA, which include press clippings, project reports, memos, as well as newspaper articles, and on oral history interviews I conducted with former members of the IFPA youth group. These interviews were carried out as part of a Wellcome Trust-funded project on the history of contraception in Ireland which entailed 103 interviews with Irish men and women born before 1955, and forty-two interviews with individuals involved in activism from the 1970s to the 1990s. Six interviews were conducted with former members of the IFPA youth group; all except one of these took place in person.<xref rid="dbae018-en31" ref-type="fn"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p>This article makes three key arguments. Firstly, through a close reading of the ACTS logbook, it illustrates the impact of the lack of sexual education and of Ireland&#x02019;s restrictive laws relating to sexual and reproductive health on Irish teenagers and young people in the 1980s. I argue that the work of the IFPA youth group was not simply an attempt to make contraceptives and sex education more accessible to young people; rather, the young volunteers were motivated by deeper activist aspirations to challenge the conservatism of Irish society and its laws. Secondly, I show that the backlash faced by the IFPA youth group is also emblematic of the inter-generational tensions around sexual health and the modernization of the country and sheds light on broader concerns around young people&#x02019;s sexuality. Finally, this article also seeks to develop understandings of the emotional labour involved in sexual health activism and show how this was often gendered.</p></sec><sec><title>THE IFPA YOUTH GROUP: ASPIRATIONS AND TENSIONS</title><p>The IFPA youth group operated within a strict legal context in relation to access to reproductive healthcare. Contraception was only legalized in Ireland in 1979 with the introduction of the controversial Family Planning Act, described by Charles Haughey, then Minister for Health, as an &#x02018;Irish solution to an Irish problem&#x02019;. The act had been a disappointment to campaigners both in favour of and against legalization.<xref rid="dbae018-en32" ref-type="fn"><sup>32</sup></xref> It made contraception available for <italic toggle="yes">bona fide</italic> family planning purposes on prescription only; this was widely interpreted as meaning that it was only available to married couples. An amendment to the Act followed in 1985 removing the need for prescriptions for non-medical contraceptives, which could then be sold through licensed premises such as chemists and family planning clinics to individuals over the age of eighteen.<xref rid="dbae018-en33" ref-type="fn"><sup>33</sup></xref> Access to contraception remained restrictive and largely depended on class and location, even after the liberalization of the law; some chemists refused to sell non-medical contraceptives, and not all doctors would prescribe them. Thus in 1985, only 20.5% of Irish chemists stocked condoms. This rose to 45% in 1986, 70% in 1987, and about 80% in 1988.<xref rid="dbae018-en34" ref-type="fn"><sup>34</sup></xref> But even once condoms were legally available for sale from pharmacies they were rarely on display, meaning that their purchase could be a furtive experience.<xref rid="dbae018-en35" ref-type="fn"><sup>35</sup></xref> Without doubt, this was heightened in rural areas and small towns.</p><p>Young people were thus particularly affected by both a lack of sex education and a lack of access to contraception, due to legal age restrictions for under-18s, a wider climate of fear and repression around sexual health, and a lack of &#x02018;sympathetic&#x02019; doctors and chemists in some areas. A survey conducted by the IFPA in 1983 found that young people were struggling to gain access to sexual health information. The survey revealed that 20% of visitors to IFPA clinics in 1983 were between the ages of seventeen and twenty; among these, 85% had been sexually active for an average of 1.8 years before seeking contraceptive advice, and more than 33% of these had been pregnant in the past.<xref rid="dbae018-en36" ref-type="fn"><sup>36</sup></xref> Access to contraception remained restricted well into the 1990s.<xref rid="dbae018-en37" ref-type="fn"><sup>37</sup></xref> The ACTS therefore was set up in response to the IFPA&#x02019;s concerns about young people and sexual health and the lack of existing sex education provision in Ireland.<xref rid="dbae018-en38" ref-type="fn"><sup>38</sup></xref> In an interview with <italic toggle="yes">In Dublin</italic> in 1986, volunteers on the ACTS expressed their outrage around the lack of sex education in the country. As Miriam Watchorn, then aged seventeen, stated: &#x02018;There is a very serious problem here in that young people are blamed for getting pregnant, getting VD or whatever, but it&#x02019;s not their fault if they haven&#x02019;t been told anything, I think it&#x02019;s the fault of teachers and parents and society itself. It expects you to know what you haven&#x02019;t been told.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en39" ref-type="fn"><sup>39</sup></xref></p><p>The 1983 referendum which introduced the Eighth Amendment into the Irish constitution, thus effectively outlawing abortion, was particularly acrimonious. It came about because of the mobilization of a number of anti-abortion groups such as the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign (PLAC) and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC).<xref rid="dbae018-en40" ref-type="fn"><sup>40</sup></xref> The following year, 1984, Ireland witnessed two distressing cases. The first was the death of Ann Lovett, a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl, who died after giving birth to a stillborn baby at a grotto in Granard, Co. Longford, in January 1984.<xref rid="dbae018-en41" ref-type="fn"><sup>41</sup></xref> The second was the Kerry Babies case, a seventeen-week public inquiry after two new-born babies were found dead within 100 kilometres of each other in April 1984. Joanne Hayes, the mother who had concealed one of the babies, was arrested and charged with murder of the other baby, on the basis of the erroneous claim that she was the mother of both.<xref rid="dbae018-en42" ref-type="fn"><sup>42</sup></xref> As Moira Maguire argues, these two cases were significant &#x02018;because they created a space, for the first time in Irish history, for a wide-scale discussion of the issues that increasingly divided Irish society into &#x0201c;conservative&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;liberal&#x0201d; camps&#x02019; &#x02013; discussion that was facilitated and fuelled by the Irish media.<xref rid="dbae018-en43" ref-type="fn"><sup>43</sup></xref></p><p>Yet the period was also witness to radical forms of activism which had their roots in the 1970s, including several telephone counselling services. Members of the Irish queer community played a pivotal role in developing these phone lines; the most prominent was Tel-a-Friend, a counselling and befriending telephone service established by members of the Irish Gay Rights Movement in 1974 and modelled on the London Gay Switchboard.<xref rid="dbae018-en44" ref-type="fn"><sup>44</sup></xref> Other telephone support and befriending services included the Irish Gay Switchboard, housed at the Phoenix Club in Dublin in the 1980s, and Lesbian Line (in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Belfast and Derry in the 1980s).<xref rid="dbae018-en45" ref-type="fn"><sup>45</sup></xref> Members of Ireland&#x02019;s first pro-choice group, the Women&#x02019;s Right to Choose Group, established the Irish Pregnancy Counselling Centre (IPCC) in Dublin in June 1980 to provide counselling (and abortion referral if needed) to women facing unplanned pregnancies.<xref rid="dbae018-en46" ref-type="fn"><sup>46</sup></xref> In 1983, following the closure of the IPCC, Ruth Riddick established Open Door Counselling, which included a telephone counselling service called Open Line Counselling. Thus, before the establishment of ACTS, there existed a network of telephone counselling services in Ireland for queer men and women and for individuals facing unplanned pregnancies. ACTS was established, however, out of an acknowledgement that there was a need for support, advice and education relating to sexual health specifically for young people.</p><p>IFPA youth volunteers joined the group for a variety of reasons. For most youth group members interviewed, the Ann Lovett and Kerry Babies cases had an important influence on their decision. Miriam Watchorn, who joined the group aged sixteen, reflected on the moral climate of the 1980s in Ireland:<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>It was terribly repressed, and sex was just a bad word. We&#x02019;d lived through things like the Ann Lovett case. I don&#x02019;t know if you&#x02019;ve heard of that one, but that very strongly affected me because I was the same age as them. And yeah, very, very, very, repressed. Really Catholic, and not a nice place to be for anybody who was slightly different or deviant.<xref rid="dbae018-en47" ref-type="fn"><sup>47</sup></xref></p></disp-quote></p><p>Similarly, John Callaghan, another volunteer, explained:<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>We all knew how messed up Ireland was. We all knew that the Kerry Babies was happening. There were so many tragedies in the news &#x02026; There was a palpable sense in the country at the time of anger and outrage and a sense of, &#x02018;This can&#x02019;t continue. We can&#x02019;t allow this to happen.&#x02019; I can&#x02019;t remember how old she was [Ann Lovett], she was like 14 or 15 years old. Nobody knew she was pregnant, supposedly. She&#x02019;s going to a Catholic school with nuns. Conceals this pregnancy right up until the end and then dies giving birth at the foot of the Virgin Mary. The tragedy of that, the ridiculousness of that it gets overwhelming for you, and it&#x02019;s just, &#x02018;I&#x02019;ve got to do something. I can&#x02019;t do much, but I can do that.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en48" ref-type="fn"><sup>48</sup></xref></p></disp-quote></p><p>Both Watchorn and Callaghan&#x02019;s testimonies illustrate the personal impact the Ann Lovett case had on them, and how this, along with emotions of anger and sadness, served as mobilizing forces for them to get involved. As James M. Jasper has argued, &#x02018;anger is a crucial motivation for protest. Without outrage over an injustice, without a villain to blame, there simply is no cause&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en49" ref-type="fn"><sup>49</sup></xref> For other volunteers, motivation came from their own personal experiences. Jon O&#x02019;Brien, then a self-described &#x02018;punk rocker&#x02019; from Drimnagh, a working-class area on the southside of Dublin, explained how he noticed that several women he socialized with at the Magnet Bar in Dublin<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>became pregnant when they didn&#x02019;t want to be and they either terminated the pregnancies over in England or went on to become single mothers which meant that they weren&#x02019;t in the bar anymore. Quite a lot of the lads I was with had a real problem getting access to any type of contraception whatsoever.

In 1984 the Irish branch of the Responsible Society, a British morally conservative group, condemned the ACTS.

For Miriam Watchorn, staff concerns were twofold: there were apprehensions firstly that the youth group was a drain on resources, and secondly, that the members were too young to be involved in the provision of sexual health advice. She explained: &#x02018;Maybe just our youth. Maybe we were too young for some people. We were underage. I was certainly under the legal age for sex at the time I got involved.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en79" ref-type="fn"><sup>79</sup></xref> Moreover, the societal change and the new approaches to sexual health that the volunteers were seeking were unsettling for older members of the organization. According to John Callaghan, &#x02018;I think that some professionals, nurses, counsellors, psychotherapists, social workers might say, &#x0201c;Are you sure you want a 20-year-old, 19-year-old talking about abortion, talking about contraception? What if there&#x02019;s a plant in there? What if some journalist or one of the opposition groups get you saying, making mistakes, or are these young people mature enough to handle what&#x02019;s happening?&#x0201d;&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en80" ref-type="fn"><sup>80</sup></xref> Jon O&#x02019;Brien similarly recalled, &#x02018;It was very new, the idea of young people being involved in service provision, and we had to work very, very hard to gain acceptance.

As O&#x02019;Brien explained in a 1990 project report reflecting on the IFPA youth group, because the IFPA had had a strong medical model since its inception, &#x02018;The idea of bringing in non-medical young people, training them and working with them was a difficult transition process and it required time and patience to gain acceptance and support among our membership&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en82" ref-type="fn"><sup>82</sup></xref> When the ACTS was first established, many staff in the IFPA were concerned that young volunteers would not possess the skillset to answer questions and provide advice on the telephone. In order to offset these concerns, older IFPA staff members volunteered to supervise the young people; however, &#x02018;after a few months, it became apparent that there was no need for this supervision to continue, especially when a supervising top gynaecologist admitted that he did not know the answers to some of the questions but that the young volunteers did&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en83" ref-type="fn"><sup>83</sup></xref> Similarly, following the establishment of the Young People&#x02019;s Family Planning Centre, an executive committee member wrote to the youth group to complain about the provision of free pregnancy testing, &#x02018;as young people may rely on preg. tests rather than use contraceptives&#x02019;. She also pointed out that there should not be a discount price for contraception for young people because &#x02018;cut pricing contraceptives is bringing &#x0201c;making love&#x0201d; into a Quinnsworth [Irish supermarket chain] arena and therefore cheapening it.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en84" ref-type="fn"><sup>84</sup></xref> Other staff shared concerns about the involvement of youth volunteers in the operation of the service. A staff meeting was held to allay these fears; however, the group found &#x02018;that for the duration of the project new fears and reservations arose on a regular basis&#x02019;, a problem believed to have more to do with &#x02018;the culture and structure of the Association rather than a failing on behalf of those in charge of the project&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en85" ref-type="fn"><sup>85</sup></xref></p><p>Ultimately, it is evident that volunteers were motivated by a combination of personal experiences, tragedies in 1980s Ireland, and wider aspirations to change attitudes towards sexual health provision and Irish society more broadly. Acknowledging the prejudices around their relatively young age, volunteers worked to create a professional service through the use of rigorous training and resources. Yet the concerns expressed not only by conservative members of the public but also by older members in the IFPA around their activities highlight the intergenerational tensions around the type of change they were aspiring to create, and how controversial this work was in the Irish setting.</p></sec><sec><title>CALLS TO THE ADOLESCENT CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE SERVICE</title><p>A closer examination of the nature of the phone calls received by the ACTS allows for analysis of what they reveal about Irish society and young Irish people&#x02019;s experiences of sexual health in the 1980s (<xref rid="dbae018-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). Like many other telephone counselling services, the individuals staffing the ACTS kept a detailed logbook outlining the calls received to the service and the advice given.

This might suggest that our tendency as historians to look at contraception as a &#x02018;woman&#x02019;s issue&#x02019; is restrictive; the logbooks are a rare window into men&#x02019;s agency around this issue. In the first year of the telephone service 80% of callers were male and 20% were female, and this preponderance of male callers continued throughout the lifetime of the project.<xref rid="dbae018-en86" ref-type="fn"><sup>86</sup></xref> Male callers made up 79% of callers in 1986, 74.8% of callers in 1987, 87% in 1988, and 85% in 1989.<xref rid="dbae018-en87" ref-type="fn"><sup>87</sup></xref> There are a number of possible explanations for this pattern. It could suggest that young men were active agents in seeking information around sexual and reproductive health, or that young men were particularly affected by the country&#x02019;s sexually repressive environment and lack of information. Alternatively, the logbook entries might indicate that it was often men who took responsibility for a sexual health issue within a relationship; for example, there are numerous entries where the male partner phoned the line to ask for support regarding an unplanned pregnancy. It may also suggest that women were more affected by embarrassment and shame, and hence reluctant to phone the telephone line, as well as being more acutely concerned about confidentiality, particularly in the case of an unplanned pregnancy.</p><p>Moreover, the telephone logs offer a glimpse into the dynamics of individuals&#x02019; personal relationships. In April 1988, for instance, a phone call from a male in his twenties was logged as follows: &#x02018;Wanted to know how a girl gets pregnant. Told him all about conception and contraception. He then told me he was having sex with his girlfriend and wasn&#x02019;t taking precautions. Recommended use of condoms/pill.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en88" ref-type="fn"><sup>88</sup></xref> Similarly, a call from a male teenager in June 1989, was logged as, &#x02018;Had started having sex with girlfriend &#x02013; was worried about her getting pregnant. He didn&#x02019;t like using condoms &#x00026; she felt embarrassed about going to doctor for pill. Told him he would need to use something &#x00026; using condoms would be better than her getting pregnant.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en89" ref-type="fn"><sup>89</sup></xref> These two calls illustrate the impact of Ireland&#x02019;s legislation regarding contraception on individuals&#x02019; relationships and the risk-taking that often ensued. They also complicate the picture in relation to responsibility for family planning in relationships. In the case of earlier generations of Irish people, it appears to have been predominantly women who took responsibility for family planning in heterosexual relationships, yet the logbook entries suggest that young men coming of age in the 1980s were taking more responsibility for this issue.<xref rid="dbae018-en90" ref-type="fn"><sup>90</sup></xref></p><p>Over forty-three weeks of operation in 1986, 653 calls were logged, an average of fifteen calls per Saturday afternoon.

They don&#x02019;t often like to admit to another man that they have a problem.&#x02019; O&#x02019;Brien also alluded to wider societal stereotypes around women&#x02019;s natures, stating, &#x02018;I think also many men would believe women are more compassionate. It&#x02019;s not as bad for them to admit their inadequacies to women and there is the female image there for men too. Women tend to talk more openly with each other about sex and their bodies.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en111" ref-type="fn"><sup>111</sup></xref> There was just one instance in the logbook, recorded in July 1988, where &#x02018;Fella wanted to talk to a man, told him to phone next Saturday or during the week.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en112" ref-type="fn"><sup>112</sup></xref></p><p>There was also a wider fear among some callers about confidentiality, or that their parents might find out about the issues they were having.

We would kind of know, &#x0201c;Okay, I&#x02019;m not going to pick up the phone for the next 30 minutes in case this person wants to call back.&#x0201d; They would talk to women more freely about &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m in trouble.

It also provides a glimpse into the fear, trauma and anguish experienced by women in this period without access to information on how to deal with an unplanned pregnancy, or access to legal abortion. For example, a distressed 25-year-old female caller from Dublin phoned the ACTS in August 1985. The call was recorded as &#x02018;Female thought she was pregnant &#x02013; condom burst he hadn&#x02019;t come yet though. Period was three days late&#x02019;. Later that afternoon, the same woman called back and &#x02018;asked about taking a bottle of gin &#x00026; a hot bath. Advised her against it. Told her not to worry.

It also re-emphasizes that it was not just young, single people utilizing the phone service. Other calls shed further light on the challenges facing Irish women who sought or had abortions in England in the 1980s. A 21-year-old woman from Dublin, for example, rang the ACTS in February 1988:<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Wanted abortion referral &#x02013; 21 weeks pregnant.

More broadly, as this section has sought to show, it was not just young people who were affected by the legal, religious and societal restrictions relating to sexual and reproductive health. The ACTS offered individuals, particularly young men, a way of openly accessing information and being listened to in a way that fought against a wider culture in Irish society that insisted on secrecy, shame and silence around sexuality and sexual health.</p></sec><sec><title>EMOTIONAL LABOUR, CHALLENGES AND BACKLASH</title><p>As well as providing insights into the nature of calls to the service and the key problems affecting young Irish men and women, the ACTS logbook also provides insights into the significant emotional labour and empathy of the activists, as well as the practical, and often gendered, challenges of doing this work. Occasionally the young volunteers had to deal with difficult calls concerning rape and incest. For instance, in February 1985, the logbook recorded a 19-year-old male caller from a rural part of Ireland who explained that he was being sexually abused by his 25-year-old brother. The volunteer &#x02018;referred him to the rape crisis centre. His brother has moved out of the house now but was sleeping in the same bed as him.

Later in our interview, Miriam returned to this incident, stating, &#x02018;I wasn&#x02019;t concerned for myself, but I was concerned that she would get the proper help and attention she needed.

This was logged as, &#x02018;Siobh&#x000e1;n: this guy keeps on calling wanting to talk to you. He said he was following your advice and it was good so far.

Such calls illustrate the challenges which were particularly faced by female volunteers on the phone line and the vulnerable position they were placed in through doing this work.<xref rid="dbae018-en125" ref-type="fn"><sup>125</sup></xref> For example, a call logged by a female volunteer in January 1985, recorded, &#x02018;Male masturbating dressing up in women&#x02019;s clothes, worried, gave him no. of psycho-sexual clinic and said I preferred if he didn&#x02019;t masturbate over the phone.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en126" ref-type="fn"><sup>126</sup></xref> A call logged by a female volunteer in April 1985 from a 50-year-old male caller was described as &#x02018;Had marital problems.

As well as the in-person debriefs, the logbook enabled volunteers to air their frustrations regarding such calls and communicate with each other about these. For example, in August 1985, a call logged by a female volunteer from a man in his twenties, stated, &#x02018;Man wanted to know how to masturbate to get maximum satisfaction. Told him there was no set way, just whatever suits you best.&#x02019; The volunteer wrote beside this &#x02018;(how come I always get these calls?)&#x02019;, and another female volunteer, Lesley, responded &#x02018;(I get all the rest of them.

Masturbates 3/4 times a day. Does everybody do it? How do married people do it?? (This guy is weird). I got a full description of how he masturbates (great fun). He is living with his aunt.

The harassment from male callers in the above examples again emphasizes how the emotional labour of the phone line was gendered, with female volunteers having to deal with issues that male volunteers did not.</p><p>There were also hoax calls made to the service. For example, in March 1985, a series of prank calls by a young male caller were recorded. In his entry describing these in the logbook, Jon O&#x02019;Brien noted, &#x02018;This is the guy who is the crank who phones every week I talked to him about it.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en130" ref-type="fn"><sup>130</sup></xref> Similarly, a series of hoax calls during a session in August 1986 were recorded as following:<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>3.35. &#x0201c;What is masturbation?&#x0201d; This is the little shithead who rings all the time.</p><p>4.02.

As Cait McKinney has suggested, &#x02018;By descriptively logging emotionally challenging calls, volunteers might imagine others on subsequent shifts helping them to hold these difficult conversations. Reading in the margins of call-log sheets, it seems that volunteers needed places to put all the bad feelings they weren&#x02019;t going to reveal to callers.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en132" ref-type="fn"><sup>132</sup></xref></p><p>Moreover, the young volunteers often had to deal with backlash or abusive phone calls directly on the phone, and the group also received hate mail.

For example, a woman calling the ACTS in 1987 was logged as, &#x02018;Thought she might be pregnant, period 18 days overdue. Referred to Limerick F.P. clinic for test.

For example a call recorded by Lesley Smyth in 1986, supposedly from a 25-year-old woman in Dublin, was described as &#x02018;Wanted info on termination &#x02013; sounded a bit iffy so I referred to Well Woman &#x02013; sounded as if we were being sussed out.&#x02019;<xref rid="dbae018-en142" ref-type="fn"><sup>142</sup></xref> Similarly, in January 1987, the logbook recorded the following call taken by Jon O&#x02019;Brien, supposedly from a 45-year-old woman from the country: &#x02018;was married with 4 children, wanted to know about abortion. <underline>This was a set up</underline>.

Siobh&#x000e1;n Nowlan went on to become a family planning and sexual health nurse in England. Jon O&#x02019;Brien went to London to work for the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1992, after which he returned to the IFPA on secondment before going on to help set up family planning associations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as well as helping with the reform of associations in Poland, Hungary and Cyprus. He also worked as press officer for the 1992 Irish campaign in support of the successful referendum on freedom to travel for an abortion and freedom of information on abortion. He later became president of the pro-choice organization Catholics for Choice. Other members went into disparate careers, but each recognised the significant role the youth group had played in their lives, and the important friendships formed from it. John Callaghan, who moved to the U.S. in 1994, stated that he continued &#x02018;in, around left-wing politics, but not in a terribly active way&#x02019;, but that the youth group &#x02018;was very important for me. It was great work. I loved it.

There were many calls logged where the volunteers recorded the positive feedback received and the palpable relief and gratitude of callers. For example, a call received in May 1986 where the person &#x02018;wanted to know about contraceptives and about different books&#x02019;, stated &#x02018;He said he thought the service was a really great thing&#x02019;.<xref rid="dbae018-en147" ref-type="fn"><sup>147</sup></xref> Another call on the same day was logged as &#x02018;masturbation is bad &#x00026; harmful &#x02013; felt guilty.

The fact that men comprised the majority of callers to the phoneline, as discussed above, suggests that they were particularly affected by this climate, or perhaps that they were more likely, in the case of heterosexual relationships, to be the partner who sought advice. The controversy and backlash in relation to the work of the IFPA youth group is indicative of wider tensions around the modernization of Ireland, and around young people&#x02019;s sexuality, in the wake of the legalization of contraception in 1979 and the death of Ann Lovett in 1984. Members of the youth group effectively confronted three challenges: young people and sexuality, the power dynamics within health organizations, and young people&#x02019;s involvement in social change. The young volunteers on the telephone line not only had to deal with the task of providing information to those who needed advice, but also had to learn to manage demanding situations including hostile calls, the emotional labour of responding to distressed callers, and potential entrapment. Reading between the lines of the calls logged by the ACTS, the fear, worry, anguish, shame and embarrassment of the callers are ever-present. Yet it is clear that this phone line, operated by young, and in some cases sexually inexperienced, volunteers, also had a positive effect for callers, empowering them to take responsibility for their sexual and reproductive health and providing them with reassurance, resources and support in relation to a myriad of issues.</p><p>While historians have explored the emotions of activism, there has been less focus on the emotional labour of activist work. This case study of the IFPA youth group illustrates both the power of emotional labour in social movements and also the impact of this labour on activists; I encourage scholars of activism to pay further attention to emotional labour as a form of radical activism as well as considering how this was often gendered. Moreover, we should expand our definitions of what activism means; while former volunteers might not have described themselves as &#x02018;activists&#x02019;, it is clear that their work was powerful in terms of its impact for clients and in generating wider discussion around sexuality and sexual health in Irish society. The IFPA youth group activists were empowered by this work and by a sense that they were helping to change Irish culture and attitudes.</p><p>Indeed, by the time of the disbandment of the group in 1990, this cultural change was on the horizon. In 1993, the Health (Family Planning) Amendment Act removed the restrictions on where condoms could be sold and the minimum age requirement for those buying them, and in the same year homosexual acts were decriminalized. In 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized after a referendum. In 2018, the Eighth Amendment of the constitution was repealed, also by popular vote; abortion is now legal up until twelve weeks of pregnancy, as well as after twelve weeks in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or where the pregnant person&#x02019;s life or health is at risk. Nonetheless, recent research by Grimes and others has shown that there are still significant barriers in terms of access after twelve weeks.<xref rid="dbae018-en154" ref-type="fn"><sup>154</sup></xref> In addition, individuals seeking an abortion have to undertake a statutory three-day waiting period between their first consultation and having the abortion, necessitating at least two visits and sometimes leading to delays.<xref rid="dbae018-en155" ref-type="fn"><sup>155</sup></xref> More broadly, the issue of sex education remained controversial well into the 1990s. And while the introduction of free contraception since 2022 is a positive move, its restriction to female forms of contraception for those aged between seventeen and thirty-five reminds us of the persistence of anxieties around young people&#x02019;s sexuality which, along with tensions over sexual health more generally, have continued to characterize recent legislation.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Funding support for this article was provided by the Wellcome Trust (106593/Z/14/Z).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I am extremely grateful to the former members of the IFPA youth group who took part in oral history interviews with me about their experiences &#x02013; I really appreciate them giving up their time and sharing their reflections on their activism with me.
