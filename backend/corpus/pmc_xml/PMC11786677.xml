However, the impact of social deprivation on gut microbiome remains largely unknown. We examined the health status and gut microbiota of female cynomolgus monkeys housed in isolation or social conditions and found that social deprivation brought adverse effects to monkeys by inhibiting their growth, remodeling the immune status, and decreasing the level of beneficial biochemical parameters. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the gut microbial composition and function differed between grouped and isolated monkeys. Specifically, grouping the single-caged young monkeys to socially housed condition could decrease the relative abundance of Firmicutes and increase the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, while separating the socially housed middle-aged monkeys into single cages showed the opposite trend. Besides, training female monkeys to detect menstruation under socially-housed condition could increase their body weight change and adjusting their immune status, thus attenuating the adverse effects of separating them to single cages. Our results verified the significant role of grouping in mitigating adverse health and microbiota alterations caused by isolation in female cynomolgus monkeys and emphasized the importance of training NHPs to cooperate with experimental procedures under socially housed condition, which could not only improve the welfare of cynomolgus monkeys but also enhance the accuracy and reliability of scientific results.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Environmental enrichment plays vital roles in maintaining the normal behavior and physiological state of laboratory animals, and ultimately enhances their well-being [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>]. However, experimental animals face various environmental stressors during scientific research. Among these factors, the variation of housing conditions occurs frequently. In rodents, social deprivation can induce anxiety-like behaviors, leading to adverse effects on capacity for learning and memory [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In NHPs, these social animals are commonly subjected to a series of environmental stresses in scientific experiments. For example, to acquire oocytes for assisted reproductive technology (ART), female cynomolgus monkeys are commonly isolated into single cages for menstruation detection [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Besides, the NHPs should be housed in social deprivation conditions for a long time when they were subjected to the following experiments, e.g., evaluating the efficacy of drug therapy, investigating the food and water intake, and recording the corresponding parameters in neurobehavioral analysis, etc. Notably, the genetically modified NHPs that exhibited poor health state (e.g., BMAL1-deficient monkeys) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] would also be housed singly. As previously reported, housing NHPs in individual cages (<italic>i.e.</italic>, single-cage housing) can affect their physical and physiological states, as well as inducing depression-like and autism-like behaviors [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. In addition, social isolation has been shown to increase the heart rate of female cynomolgus monkeys that fed with high cholesterol high fat diet, consequently potentiating atherosclerosis [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, housing conditions can also affect the immune status of NHPs [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the impact of housing conditions on the health status of NHPs has emerged as a critical issue for ensuring both their welfare, as well as their normal physiological status and behaviors.</p><p id="p0015">Gut microbiota is complex microbial ecosystem that colonized in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. It can affect host fitness by modulating host behavior, nutritional status and immune function [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that social interactions exert significant influence on the composition of gut microbiota. For example, frequent social interactions in socially-housed primates can increase their gut microbial richness [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In rodents, social deprivation induces short-term alterations of gut microbiota in a sex-dependent manner [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Notably, gut microbiota is viewed as essential factor for the social development of mice [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In NHPs, although the gut microbiome has been reported to be affected by various factors (e.g., sex, aging, diet, habitat and seasonal factors) [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>], the influence of housing conditions on gut microbiome has been largely overlooked.</p><p id="p0020">Here, we applied two strategies to investigate the impact of housing condition on the health state and gut microbiome of female cynomolgus monkeys. In the first strategy, the single-caged young monkeys were grouped into socially housed condition. In the second strategy, the socially housed middle-aged female cynomolgus monkeys were separated into single cages. By comparing the physical and physiological parameters of different monkey groups, we found that social deprivation could bring adverse effects to monkeys by inhibiting their growth, remodeling the immune status, and decreasing the level of beneficial biochemical parameters. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the gut microbial composition and function differed between grouped and isolated monkeys at specific time point. Besides, training female monkeys to detect menstruation under socially-housed condition attenuated the adverse effects of assigning them to single cages. In summary, our results not only deciphered the impact of housing conditions on the health state and gut microbiome of female cynomolgus monkeys, but also emphasized the importance of training NHPs to cooperate with experimental procedures under socially housed condition.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Social deprivation impairs the health status of female cynomolgus monkeys</title><p id="p0025">We designed two strategies to better understand how housing conditions may affect the health of female cynomolgus monkeys. In the first strategy, twenty-eight young female cynomolgus monkeys (2&#x02013;3 years old) were housed singly for at least one month, then were randomly assigned into two groups: single to single (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) and single to group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Monkeys included in the &#x0201c;single to single&#x0201d; group were housed alone in single cages throughout the whole experiment and served as single-caged control. The other monkeys assigned to the &#x0201c;single to group&#x0201d; treatment were housed together in one cage sufficiently large to accommodate all animals throughout the experiment. In the second strategy, twenty middle-aged female cynomolgus monkeys (10&#x02013;15 years old) that lived in socially housed conditions for longer than one month were divided into two groups: group to group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8) and group to single (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Monkeys in &#x0201c;group to group&#x0201d; treatment were housed together in one large cage throughout the whole experiment and served as the grouped control, while monkeys in &#x0201c;group to single&#x0201d; treatment were separated into individual cages during the experiment. The time points for physical examination, blood and feces collection were illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A and B, respectively.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Examining the physical status of female cynomolgus monkeys housed in isolation and social conditions (A) Schematic diagram illustrating the strategies for grouping single-caged young monkeys to socially housed condition.

In the first strategy, the body weights of monkeys in the two groups were comparable at the beginning of the experiment (day 0) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). However, the percentage body weight gain of monkeys subjected to the &#x0201c;single to single&#x0201d; housing condition was significantly lower than that of &#x0201c;single to group&#x0201d;, especially from day 60 to day 210 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Accordingly, the body mass index (BMI) values of &#x0201c;single to group&#x0201d; monkeys were higher than that of single-caged controls (single to single) from day 90 to day 210 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Both the average heart rate (bpm) and body temperature (&#x000b0;C) of these two monkey groups varied significantly during the experiment (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1A</xref>). In the second strategy, the monkeys belonging to &#x0201c;group to single&#x0201d; treatment exhibited significant decreases in percentage body weight and BMI change when compared to the &#x0201c;group to group&#x0201d; controls from day 7 to day 120 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D). The heart rate (bpm) and body temperature (&#x000b0;C) of two monkey groups in the second strategy were stable over the experimental timecourse, with no significant differences observed between two groups (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1B</xref>). These results suggested that social deprivation can inhibit the weight gain of young monkeys and lead to a reduction on body weight in middle-aged monkeys.</p><p id="p0035">Next, the routine blood and biochemical indexes were measured to gain thorough insights into the physiological conditions of single-caged and socially-housed monkeys. In the first strategy, the white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LYMPH), and monocyte (MONO) counts increased significantly from day 0 to day 30 in the &#x0201c;single to group&#x0201d; monkeys, then remained at this plateau from day 30 to day 210 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Specifically, the value of WBC, LYMPH, and MONO in the &#x0201c;single to group&#x0201d; monkeys were increased nearly 50&#x000a0;% as compared to that of the &#x0201c;single to single&#x0201d; monkeys during the period from day 30 to day 210. Accordingly, the ratio of LYMPH increased in the &#x0201c;single to group&#x0201d; monkeys, while the neutrophil (NEUT) ratio decreased (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2A</xref>). However, these routine blood indexes showed negligible change in the &#x0201c;single to single&#x0201d; monkeys during the experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). In the second strategy, no significant differences were detected in LYMPH or MONO between the &#x0201c;group to single&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;group to group&#x0201d; monkeys throughout the whole experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Notably, both WBC and NEUT counts sharply increased in the &#x0201c;group to single&#x0201d; monkeys from day 0 to day 7, then both parameters exhibited a gradual, consistent decrease from day 7 to day 120 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). At day 7, the value of WBC in &#x0201c;group to single&#x0201d; monkeys were increased nearly 25&#x000a0;% as compared to that of the &#x0201c;group to group&#x0201d; monkeys, while the value of NEUT in the &#x0201c;group to single&#x0201d; monkeys was two-fold higher than that of the &#x0201c;group to group&#x0201d; monkeys. Consistent with these data, the NEUT ratio was also increased in &#x0201c;group to single&#x0201d; monkeys, whereas LYMPH and MONO ratios decreased (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2B</xref>). Additionally, to assess the health state of monkeys, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an index of systemic inflammation [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], was calculated for all monkey groups. This analysis revealed a significant decrease of NLR in single-caged young monkeys following relocation to social housing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A), while it increased in middle-aged monkeys that moved from group housing to single cages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). These results, in conjunction with changes in body weight described above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C and D), indicated that the overall health of socially-housed monkeys was better than that of monkeys kept in single cages.<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The routine blood and biochemical indexes of single-caged and grouped female cynomolgus monkeys (A) The comparison of routine blood indexes between the &#x0201c;single to single&#x0201d; (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) and &#x0201c;single to group&#x0201d; (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) young monkeys.

reproductive technologies (ARTs) are fertility related treatment used to achieve pregnancy which involve the manipulation of both oocytes and sperm. As an essential step of ART in NHPs, menstruation is commonly monitored by isolating female monkeys in single cages [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As reported, positive reinforcement training (PRT), which teaches animal to voluntarily perform desired behaviors, can be applied to improve behavior and reactivity, thus reducing the stress-induced experimental confounds. For example, PRT had been used to enhance macaque cooperation during blood collection procedures, thus avoiding to confine the monkey in a squeeze cage [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; Assisted with PRT, the macaque can insert their arms into a sleeve mechanism for venipuncture [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, PRT acted as a useful strategy for enhancing the welfare of animals. Here, in light of the observed adverse effects on monkey health associated with single-cage housing (<italic>e.g.</italic>, reduced body weight or BMI and increased NLR) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), we next sought to determine whether PRT could be used to improve the health status of female cynomolgus monkeys by checking menstruation under social housing condition. To this end, twenty female cynomolgus monkeys (3&#x02013;4 years old) that housed in two large cages (10 monkeys each) for longer than one month were used for detecting menstruation assisted with PRT. The monkeys that left untrained were set as controls (control group), while monkeys in the other cage were trained for menstruation detection (trained group) at days 2, 13, and 27 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). The time required for detecting menstruation was recorded at days 0, 14, and 28. The fecal and blood samples were collected at days 0 and 28 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). Compared with untrained monkeys, the time used for menstruation detection was significantly decreased in trained monkeys at day 14 (untrained, 97.4s; trained, 62.2s) and day 28 (untrained, 139.8s; trained, 35.3s) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Furthermore, the serum cortisol concentrations showed no significant difference between the trained and untrained monkeys (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C), suggesting that the training process did not impact stress level in these female monkeys. In addition, the trained monkeys showed a higher percentage of body weight increase (8.7&#x000a0;%) than that of the untrained controls (4.9&#x000a0;%) from day 0 to day 28 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D), potentially due to trained monkeys showing greater cooperation when monitoring menstruation. Thus, PRT can be used to improve the health status of NHPs during scientific research.<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Facilitating menstruation detection through PRT and its effect on the health status of female cynomolgus monkeys (A) Schematic diagram showing the strategy for PRT.

Given the fact that social housing can benefit the health of female cynomolgus monkeys, we improved their welfare by checking menstruation under socially housed condition through positive reinforcement training (PRT).</p><p id="p0105">As reported, chronic social separation can increase the afternoon (13:00&#x02013;17:00) heart rates of female cynomolgus monkeys and exacerbate atherosclerosis [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, this periodic increase of heart rate was not observed in our single-caged monkeys although the heart rate was assayed at around 14:00 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). Different from the monkeys that fed with normal diet in our study, the female monkeys with afternoon heart rate increase were fed with a cholesterol and fat containing diet. Then, diet and housing condition might jointly lead to the periodic increase of heart rate in female cynomolgus monkeys.</p><p id="p0110">Since NEUT can respond to virtually all forms of inflammation and propagate itself [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the increased NEUT in isolated middle-aged monkeys indicated that these monkeys might suffer from inflammation. This assumption needs to be further verified by assaying the changes of inflammatory factors in serum.</p><p id="p0115">Phosphorus is an essential element that associated with many metabolic processes. Given the fact that chronic phosphorus deficiency can lead to growth retardation in children and skeletal abnormalities in adults [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the lower phosphorus level in the single-caged young and middle-aged monkeys could be an important reason for their growth inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C and D). Meanwhile, it needs to be further studied whether the decrease of phosphorus will bring additional adverse effects (<italic>e.g.</italic>, skeletal abnormalities) to the isolated middle-aged monkeys (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D).</p><p id="p0120">It has been reported that acute psychological stress can impair the cholesterol absorption of intestine and decrease serum cholesterol [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consistent with this result, the serum cholesterol concentration was decreased in isolated middle-aged monkeys (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). However, it showed no differences between the grouped and single-caged young monkeys (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The possible reason for this phenomenon might be caused by the different growth stage of young and middle-aged female monkeys. This hypothesis will be verified by studying the influence of aging on the stress-induced variations of routine biochemical indexes in our future work.</p><p id="p0125">Although cortisol was closely related to the stress state of animals [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>], Koyama et al. reported that the changing of plasma cortisol showed sex differences under different housing conditions in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys and the concentration of plasma cortisol showed no significant difference between the female monkeys housed in isolation and in pair [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, no obvious changes in serum cortisol were observed between the grouped middle-aged female monkeys and its single-caged controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F). Thus, the mechanism for sex-dependent variations of stress-induced parameters needs to be further verified and it will promote the consideration of sex difference in scientific research. Differently, when the single caged monkeys were grouped and lived in social housing condition, the cortisol levels increased in a short period and then returned to normal levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E). This was quite in accordance with the previously reported results that the increased activity in social housing might stimulate higher cortisol levels [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Notably, it had been reported that moving the single-housed rhesus macaques to pair-housing and group-housing could reduce the rate of abnormal behaviors, while the serum cortisol level was less affected [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similarly, when the rhesus macaques were experienced with quarantine-like procedures, the pair-housed macaques exhibited lower undesirable behaviors and less diarrhea than single-housed subjects, while no significant differences in cortisol levels were observed [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All these results indicated that the behavioral and physiological outcomes do not always cohere and then emphasized the importance of evaluating the behavioral outcomes of NHPs that suffered from the variation of housing conditions.</p><p id="p0130">Deprivation of social interaction can reduce the richness and diversity of gut microbiota in rats [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, in our study, this phenomenon was not observed in the monkeys housed in isolation condition (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3</xref>). This microbial difference between rats and monkeys might arise from the fact that rats were coprophagic, a habit that will facilitate the fecal-oral transmission of gut microbiota between animals housed together. So, the gut microbial richness and diversity was changed greatly in individually housed rats, but not for NHPs. As to the function of specific genera, the bacteria belonged to <italic>Prevotella</italic> had been well studied for its complex carbohydrate consumption ability and could benefit the host by promoting adsorption of nutrients [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Then, the decreased <italic>Prevotella</italic> in single-caged young monkeys (day 30) might be one possible reason for their growth inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> microbes can inhibit the growth of pathogenic organisms and were considered as protective organisms in intestine. However, in some cases, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> had been viewed as pathogens in immunocompromised hosts [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>]. In our study, the immune status was suppressed in single-caged young monkeys as illustrated by decreased WBC, LYMPH, and MONO (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Accordingly, the relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> was higher in these single-caged young monkeys at day 30 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). Whether the increased relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> could bring adverse influences on female cynomolgus monkeys was an important issue that need to be further studied. Thus, verification of the function of these altered microbial taxa will help us to improve the health status of isolated monkeys by adjusting their gut microbiota composition.</p><p id="p0135">Since non-human primates are prosocial animals and social deprivation could lead to stress that alters physiology, especially HPA axis dysregulation, social housing, either in pairs or groups was highly recommended by the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (National Research Council, 2011) as well the animal welfare act. As reported, PRT, a useful method to bridge cooperation between trainers and subjects, had been used to teach animal to voluntarily perform desired behaviors during specific scientific experiment, thus reducing the stress-induced experimental confounds. To facilitate the process of PRT in research facilities, the experienced trainers should be familiar with the socially-housed animals firstly and then gained trust from animals by rewarding them when they performed the desired actions. Until now, PRT had been used in various NHPs and regarded as useful strategy for enhancing the welfare of experimental animals [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, we found that housing in isolation can affect the health status and gut microbial composition and function of female cynomolgus monkeys. Notably, social housing with PRT rather than isolation for common protocols such as menstruation monitoring can preserve the normal physiological function and health of female monkeys. Besides, assisted with PRT, a series of scientific experiments including medicine injection, blood collection, and behavior monitoring could be performed by housing the NHPs in pairs or groups. All these results stressed the notion that PRT was an effective strategy for improving the welfare of laboratory NHPs during scientific research.</p><p id="p0140">In summary, our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding about the impact of housing conditions on the health and gut microbiome of female cynomolgus monkeys. Given that laboratory NHPs are commonly subjected to social deprivation in a series of scientific researches, the results derived from these stressed animals might mislead the researcher and affect the outcome of scientific or pre-clinical studies. Thus, training NHPs to cooperate with scientific procedures under socially housed condition will not only ensure their welfare but also enhance the accuracy and reliability of scientific results.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0145">This study had some limitations. As reported, the responsiveness of juvenile monkeys to environmental changes differs between males and females [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this work, constrained by the shortage of male cynomolgus monkeys, the effects of housing in groups or isolation on health and gut microbiota were studied in females, thus our conclusions should not be extended to males without further verification. Moreover, the variation in gut microbiota was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Thus, the stress-related changes in microbiota only reflect the genus level. Future work will use the metagenomics sequencing strategy to identify the specific bacteria that affected by housing conditions. Besides, although our study analyzed the correlations between the gut microbial alternations and the changes of weight, blood routine, and biochemical indicators, it is still curious whether the change of housing conditions leads to the changes in the physiological parameters firstly, which in turn leads to changes in gut microbiome or vice versa. Thus, more efforts should be done to deciphering the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and the host physiological parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0150"><bold>Yunpeng Yang:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Supervision, Project administration, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Yong Lu:</bold> Resources. <bold>Changshan Gao:</bold> Resources. <bold>Yanhong Nie:</bold> Resources. <bold>Hongfei Wang:</bold> Resources. <bold>Yufei Huang:</bold> Project administration. <bold>Haiyan Dong:</bold> Resources. <bold>Qiang Sun:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision, Project administration, Investigation, Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="inclusion-and-diversity" id="sec5"><title>Inclusion and diversity</title><p id="p0155">We support inclusive, diverse, and equitable conduct of research.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Ethics declaration</title><p id="p0160">This study was reviewed and approved by the animal use and care committees of the CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with the approval number: CEBSIT-2022016.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec7"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="p0165">Raw data files for 16S sequencing available at BioProject database, ID number: SRP371903, SRP370609 and SRP371852.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0170">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jennings</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Batchelor</surname><given-names>G.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Brain</surname><given-names>P.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dick</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Francis</surname><given-names>R.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubrecht</surname><given-names>R.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hurst</surname><given-names>J.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Morton</surname><given-names>D.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>A.G.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Refining rodent husbandry: the mouse.

The size of single cages used in this study were 0.7&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.9&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;m and the size of big cages were 2.15&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;m. At the end of our experiment, all the single-caged monkeys were grouped and housed in big cages.</p><p id="p0210">In the training experiment, twenty female cynomolgus monkeys with age ranging from 3 to 4 years old and housed in two big cages (10 monkeys each) for at least one month were used. The monkeys in cage 1 (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) were kept untrained and served as control, while monkeys in cage 2 (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) were trained for menstruation detection at days 2, 13, and 27. The monkeys were trained once a day at day 2, 13, and 27 and the intervention time was set as 2&#x000a0;h. Menstruation detection was performed to all the monkeys in two groups at days 0, 14, and 28.</p><p id="p0215">Cynomolgus monkeys were housed with controlled 12-h light/12-h dark schedule, controlled temperature (21&#x02013;25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), humidity (&#x0223c;50%&#x02013;60&#x000a0;%) and continuous access to municipal water. These monkeys had no antibiotic exposure within 2 months during sample collection. All the monkeys were fed with nutritional granules twice a day (200&#x000a0;g per monkey at 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.) and vegetables and fruits (100&#x000a0;g per monkey at 10:00 a.m.) to provide essential nutrition and vitamins.</p></sec><sec id="appsec6.2"><title>Physical examination, routine blood examination and biochemical analysis</title><p id="p0220">All the monkeys were carefully examined by experienced working staffs. The physical examination items include weight (kg), BMI, heart rate (BMP), and body temperature (&#x000b0;C). For the blood routine and biochemical analysis, the blood samples of female cynomolgus monkeys were collected at 7:00 a.m., the time point before feeding, and analyzed with chemistry analyzer (Catalyst One, IDEXX).</p><p id="p0225">To evaluate the weight of monkey, the experienced working staff will fix the monkeys by putting their hands on the back. Then, both the staff and monkeys were weighted simultaneously and the weight was labeled as &#x0201c;staff&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;monkey&#x0201d;. Finally, the weight of monkeys was calculated by subtracting the weight of staff from the weight of &#x0201c;staff&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;monkey&#x0201d;. For blood draws, the monkeys were fixed as described above. Then, the working staff performed blood draws by putting the hands of the monkey out of the cage. To calculate the BMI, the height of the fixed monkeys was assayed by measuring the distance between the head and the bottom of tail. The heart rate of the fixed monkeys was assayed by using the portable digital heart rate stethoscope. The body temperature was assayed by measuring the anal temperature. These descriptions were added in the methods section in our revised manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="appsec6.3"><title>Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p id="p0230">Serum was collected and used for enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

During the training process, the trainer will show a hand and give explicit instructions (good/stop) to stop the monkey from moving and touch the back and tail gently for 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min. All the trained monkeys will be rewarded with peanuts at the end of the training. Then, the trained monkeys will be subjected to menstruation detection the day after training and the time spent on this process is recorded. The training process will be stopped when all the monkeys can keep still after giving the good/stop instruction and be touched by the trainer.</p></sec><sec id="appsec6.5"><title>Fecal sample collection and 16S rRNA gene sequencing</title><p id="p0240">Fresh fecal samples were collected directly into sterile tubes by experienced working staffs, frozen into liquid nitrogen immediately and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Total genomic DNA samples were extracted using the OMEGA Soil DNA Kit (M5635-02) (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The sample collected from the environment was used as negative control. During the PCR amplification, no-template-controls were also involved. The quantity and quality of genomes were measured with NanoDrop NC2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Then, the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA was amplified using the primer pairs 338F (5&#x02032;-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3&#x02032;) and 806R (5&#x02032;-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3&#x02032;). The primers were labeled with sample-specific 7-bp barcodes for multiplex sequencing. After amplification, the PCR amplicons were purified with Vazyme VAHTSTM DNA Clean Beads (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Equal amounts of amplicons were used for paired-end 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;250 bp sequencing using the Illlumina NovaSeq platform with NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit (500 cycles) at Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Raw sequence data were demultiplexed using the demux plugin following by primers cutting with cutadapt plugin. Sequences were then quality filtered, denoised, merged and chimera removed using DADA2 plugin [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="appsec6.6"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="p0245">The sequences were analyzed using QIIME2 and R packages (v3.2.0). &#x003b1;-diversity was calculated using the OTU table in QIIME2; &#x003b2;-diversity was performed using Jaccard metrics to investigate the structural variation of microbial communities across samples. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of weighted UniFrac distances between monkey groups was displayed by WGCNA package, stat packages and ggplot2 package in R software (Version 2.15.3).
