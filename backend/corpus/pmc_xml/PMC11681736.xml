There is a good evidence-base for interventions which can improve sleep, however currently they are not being implemented into NHS practice. To address the evidence-practice gap, we have conducted early-phase development for an inpatient sleep intervention (ASLEEP); a multi-level intervention to improve inpatient sleep in UK hospital wards.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We used an iterative development process incorporating Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement, ward staff surveys and stakeholder consultations (orthopaedic and acute medicine), and theoretical mapping using behaviour change theories. Development took place in four stages: identification of existing patient-level intervention components to improve sleep in hospital; identification of environmental barriers and facilitators to sleep in hospital; consultation with health professional stakeholders; and final theoretical mapping using the COM-B model and Theoretical Domains Framework, also considering who holds &#x02018;change power&#x02019; for each change construct.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We identified 18 variables contributing to inpatient sleep, which are malleable to change universally across hospital wards. Central domains for change were identified as the ward environment context and resources; to reduce noise from equipment (material resources), and social influence; to modulate staff and patient noise awareness and behaviours (group norms). Change power mapping identified key stakeholders as patients, ward staff, procurement/estates, and NHS management.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Improving sleep in hospital requires a whole-systems approach which targets environmental factors, staff behaviour, and patient behaviour. We have provided recommendations for a multi-level intervention, highlighting core areas for change and essential stakeholders who must be involved to progress implementation. The next stage of development will involve operationalising recommendations and piloting, including evaluating mechanisms of change. It will be important to continue working with a broad range of stakeholders to bridge the evidence-practice gap and support sustainable practice adoption.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40359-024-02281-9.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Inpatient Sleep</kwd><kwd>Orthopaedic inpatients</kwd><kwd>Acute Medicine</kwd><kwd>Hospital inpatients</kwd><kwd>Intervention development</kwd><kwd>Behaviour Change</kwd><kwd>Sleep Behaviour</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Everyday approximately 115,000 people in the UK stay overnight in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sleep disturbance in hospital is a substantial problem with approximately 50&#x02013;70% of inpatients reporting reduced sleep quality and duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The ward environment is a central barrier to good sleep with noise, lighting, and nursing care highlighted as affecting sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Poor sleep can delay recovery and extend hospital stays by 1&#x02013;8 days, with significant NHS cost implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Shortening hospital stay is an NHS priority, with sleep deprivation highlighted as important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A government green paper further emphasised that guidance to improve sleep in hospitals requires review and update [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, no research has yet addressed this or implemented evidence-based changes.</p><p id="Par7">Sleep directly impacts wound healing and immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Reduced sleep increases the risk of post-surgical complications, including delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and can lower memory function, energy, and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Reduced sleep increases pain sensitivity by activating proinflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], where pre-operative sleep disturbances are associated with increased post-operative pain severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Undergoing surgery is a common reason for staying overnight in hospital. Total knee and hip replacements are the second and third most common elective surgical procedures in UK, with approximately 200,000 annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Most patients spend 1&#x02013;3 nights in hospital after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recovery programmes aim to reduce recovery time and length of stay by controlling pain and supporting mobilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nonetheless, poor sleep can be a barrier to timely recovery and discharge through delayed healing, increased pain, and increased risk of post-surgical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">There is strong evidence that existing interventions can improve inpatient sleep. Patient-level interventions targeting noise, light, and patient anxiety have shown effectiveness, based on meta-analysis results incorporating data from 5375 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Environment-focused interventions, such as reducing night-time care interruptions, also show promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Despite existing evidence, there is an evidence-practice gap in integrating sleep interventions into NHS practice. Hospital contexts are challenging for the development of sleep interventions, as the physical and sociocultural environment, including existing policies, require consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Research indicates that ward staff are supportive of improving sleep, but lack knowledge and guidance for making changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To successfully integrate evidence-based changes to improve sleep within NHS practice, research must identify barriers and facilitators to change, and work with NHS stakeholders to address issues.</p><p id="Par11">For multi-level interventions which require engagement from various stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, staff, patients), behaviour change theories offer valuable insight into how to enact successful, sustainable change within complex systems. This study conducted the first stage of work to bring together evidence-based approaches for improving inpatient sleep, into a new intervention package; the ASLEEP intervention. This included exploring patient views of sleep interventions, health professional views of the barriers and facilitators to inpatient sleep, and organising evidence using theoretical mapping.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par12">Ethical approval was given by the University of Bristol Faculty of Health Sciences Ethics Committee on 13/07/2022 (reference 10490).

Results were discussed with a PPIE group comprising five patient-partners with recent experience of overnight hospital stays. Three were recruited using an advert circulated by People in Health (West of England).

The aim of the meeting was to review the findings of our previous meta-analysis of sleep interventions, and explore acceptability and preferences for the sleep intervention approaches. The meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] identified six interventions that were effective at improving inpatient sleep:</p><p id="Par24">

They saw benefit in all approaches, but felt that counselling and massage may not be suitable for everyone, and possibly difficult to access due to needing trained staff and a suitable location for the massage treatments. The two most acceptable approaches were physical sleep aids and relaxation because they could be easily provided and used individually as desired.</p><p id="Par42">The group additionally highlighted that worry and anxiety about being in an unfamiliar environment as important. They suggested a leaflet could be sent to patients to help them prepare for their stay including what to expect on the ward, and a list of recommended items to enhance comfort (e.g., earphones, pillow spray). For unplanned stays, a leaflet could be given on admission with information and advice for what their family or friends could bring for them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Phase 2: Ward environment-level factors</title><p id="Par43">Objectives: To understand the sleep environment and sleep-related practices on NHS hospital wards, and identify target areas for change.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par44">Orthopaedic ward staff from 19 UK hospitals were invited to take part in a survey.

This study supports that a whole-systems approach is needed to implement evidence-based approaches to improving inpatient sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par106">Insights from NHS patient and staff stakeholders identified key target areas for change at patient, ward, and hospital-level, which must be addressed synchronously. We have identified that reducing noise levels is pivotal to giving patients the opportunity sleep well. To achieve this, several material resource variables require change, including equipment and ward structure (e.g. doors), as well as staff and patient group norms that contribute to noise levels, such as talking and device use. This reflects findings from previous studies, which all highlight noise as a central issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par107">A major challenge this work has identified is bridging the gap between research evidence on sleep in hospitals and real-world implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance highlights the importance of working with a range of stakeholders throughout intervention development, including those whose personal or professional interests are affected, to enhance potential for real-world implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition to conducting consultation with patient and staff stakeholders, this study sought to bridge the evidence-practice gap by considering the wider hospital context and identifying other stakeholders who hold &#x02018;change power&#x02019;. By adding change power to the theoretical map, we identified that the people who hold responsibility for factors impacting sleep in hospitals differs between constructs, with additional stakeholders identified as domestic staff, estates and procurement, and NHS management. Further work to develop ASLEEP will actively seek to involve these broader stakeholders in consultations.</p><p id="Par108">Stakeholder consultation undertaken in this study also highlighted that ASLEEP could benefit patient groups beyond orthopaedics, as the domains and constructs impacting inpatient sleep are universal across wards. Good sleep is essential to wound healing, reduces the risk of post-surgical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and can reduce pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whilst pertinent to orthopaedic surgical recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], patients in acute wards can equally benefit from improved sleep. Poor sleep in acute hospital settings is known to increase pain, reduce strength, and adversely affect respiratory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par109">This development work took a combined theory- and systems-based research perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which has been useful for breaking down a complex issue into areas of change that are targetable within an intervention. This breakdown has been equally useful for presenting target areas for change to stakeholders throughout consultations. The TDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] has been important in understanding and explaining environmental factors to stakeholders, and we have mapped the TDF to the COM-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] to present a holistic view of how inpatient sleep can be tackled through organisational, group, and individual behaviour change.</p><p id="Par110">The next step in ASLEEP development is operationalisation into a useable toolkit, and pilot testing in NHS orthopaedic and acute hospital ward settings to ensure the intervention is acceptable and sustainable. To enhance potential for real-world implementation, further stakeholder work using knowledge mobilisation approaches is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This involves seeking consultation from broader stakeholders that hold power to enact change. At a hospital-level, this study has identified domestic staff, estates, procurement and NHS management as important. Additionally, this broader stakeholder group should include policymakers and commissioners. Whilst there is little practical guidance on how to onboard high-level stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], they can provide valuable insight on how best to operationalise intervention recommendations, and help develop a sustainable practice adoption plan.</p><p id="Par111">At intervention piloting stage, a process evaluation will be needed to understand mechanisms of change or &#x02018;how&#x02019; the intervention works, as well as any other contextual or moderating factors that have not yet been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Some variables identified within the current study represent moderators, such as hospital-wide bed shortage. These factors are marked as not malleable to change, however, should be considered as moderators when conducting a process evaluation.</p><p id="Par112">In summary, the current work has identified an extensive list of target variables that are malleable to change in an NHS context, through sequential integration of stakeholder input and iterative organisation of findings using behaviour change theories. These targets for change provide a foundation to operationalise and refine ASLEEP as a toolkit that can be flexibly used to improve inpatient sleep in UK hospital wards.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par113">This work used behaviour change theories to inform early-stage intervention development, and is strengthened by the range of stakeholders involved. Findings help bridge the gap between sleep research and hospital practice by highlighting the variety of people and processes that are necessary to ignite change at multiple system levels, with the mutual goal of improving inpatient sleep. A further strength is the flexible approach to development. As a result of initial stakeholder consultation, this research was quickly adapted during Phase 4 to include input from acute care clinicians. Rapid, adaptive approaches are supported by the intervention development literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], with emphasis on centrality of stakeholder input throughout development. A limitation of rapidly adapting is that clinician role details were not collected from acute care staff. Nonetheless, this broadened the potential reach of the intervention in practice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par114">We have provided recommendations for ASLEEP, a multi-level intervention to tackle the complex issue of poor sleep experienced by hospital inpatients. These intervention recommendations could benefit patients across hospital wards, including orthopaedic and acute care. Improving sleep in hospital requires a whole-systems approach which targets environmental factors, staff behaviour, and patient behaviour. This work has provided an applied example of how behaviour change theories can be used in early-stage intervention development to breakdown complex healthcare issues. Theoretical mapping has helped identify core areas for change and key stakeholders who should be engaged to progress implementation, including patients, hospital staff, and NHS management. The next stage of development will involve operationalising recommendations and piloting, including evaluating mechanisms of change. It will be important to continue working with stakeholders, and broader policymakers, to bridge the evidence-practice gap and develop a robust service adoption plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
