Despite its importance, there are limited data on the vaccination coverage for this group, and no studies have examined the vaccination status of patients&#x02019; close contacts. Objectives: To assess vaccination rates among patients on biologics and their household contacts, identifying reasons for inadequate vaccination and examining factors influencing vaccination status and attitudes is crucial. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2022 to February 2023 at the two hospitals in Heraklion, Crete, including adult and pediatric patients on biologics. Data were collected through medical records and interviews and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2016 and MedCalc2006. Results: Among the 446 adults, vaccination rates were as follows: 83% for COVID-19, 73.8% for influenza, 64.5% for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 29.6% for the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and 4% for Tdap. Among the 26 children included, those with basic immunization schedule coverage exceeded 96%, but rates for the vaccines usually administered at adolescence were lower (Tdap: 47.8%, HPV: 42.1%, MenACWY: 66.7%). COVID-19 vaccination was at 38.5%. Regarding the additional vaccines recommended due to treatment-induced immunosuppression, 69.2% of pediatric patients received the annual influenza vaccine, while only 19.2% received the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Household contacts demonstrated low vaccination rates (&#x0003c;59%), except for COVID-19 (81%). Female gender (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.007) and older age (by 1 year, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) were associated with favorable attitudes and higher coverage in adults, while in pediatric patients, no statistically significant associations were found. A lack of physician recommendation was the primary reported reason for not being vaccinated. Conclusions: Significant vaccination gaps exist among patients on biologics and their close contacts, largely due to inadequate physician recommendations. Raising awareness and strengthening healthcare provider roles are essential to improve coverage in this high-risk group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vaccination status</kwd><kwd>biologic agents</kwd><kwd>cocooning strategy</kwd><kwd>infectious diseases</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00152"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Biologic agents are increasingly used as immunomodulators, often in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs, for the management of various chronic inflammatory conditions. These include juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Their use has expanded significantly in recent years, reflecting advancements in treatment strategies and growing recognition of their efficacy. These agents primarily take the form of monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with small molecules like Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Biologic therapies have been shown in randomized control trials and clinical practice to effectively delay disease progression, alleviate pain and edema, and improve quality of life in patients with arthritis, skin conditions, and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>However, their immunosuppressive effect increases the risk of infection, necessitating additional vaccinations for these patients [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Also, due to their immunomodulatory effect that persists throughout treatment and even for weeks post-treatment, it is advised that patients complete their vaccination schedules before initiating therapy. While on treatment, patients can safely receive all inactivated vaccines, but live vaccines are generally contraindicated for a period of at least 3&#x02013;6 months following the cessation of treatment due to the possible risk of infection from the live attenuated pathogens they contain [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In addition to vaccinating patients, vaccinating their environment is also recommended&#x02014;a strategy known as &#x0201c;cocooning&#x0201d;. This approach aims to shield immunocompromised individuals who may be unable to receive certain vaccines, such as live vaccines, or may exhibit diminished immunogenicity from inactivated vaccines [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite the clear importance of vaccination in this high-risk population, vaccination rates among patients undergoing biologic therapy present a significant concern in clinical practice, while published data regarding this topic are limited. The primary cause behind inadequate vaccination rates appears to stem from a lack of information. This is further compounded by various factors, including skepticism regarding vaccine efficacy and potential side effects, perceptions of vaccination as unnecessary, fear of disease exacerbation, and pervasive anti-vaccination attitudes [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Within the medical community, healthcare providers face their own hurdles, such as the ambiguity between general practitioners and specialists regarding vaccination recommendation responsibilities, the absence of clear vaccination guidelines for patients on biologic therapies, and sporadic patient&#x02013;physician interactions [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to assess vaccination coverage and identify potential barriers to vaccination among individuals on biologic agents. Moreover, it seeks to elucidate potential associations between various demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors and the adequacy of vaccination with each recommended vaccine. Additionally, this study aims to identify factors associated with the overall willingness of patients to undergo vaccination. Understanding these factors is crucial for creating better healthcare policies and interventions aiming at improving vaccination rates and mitigating the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases in this growing patient population. In this study, the vaccination status of household contacts was also assessed, to our knowledge, for the first time in such a big cohort.</p><p>Through a systematic examination of vaccination coverage, the results of this study aim to highlight the need for the development of tailored strategies that promote immunization adherence and safeguard the health and well-being of individuals receiving biologics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-vaccines-13-00152"><title>2.

Design and Methods</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2022 and February 2023. Informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from adult patients and parents of pediatric patients prior to enrolment. Inclusion criteria were the receipt of a biologic agent and willingness to participate in the study. There were no exclusion criteria apart from refusal to participate. The parents of pediatric patients were asked to present their children&#x02019;s vaccination records. Adult patients were asked to recall whether they had been vaccinated with specific vaccines, and their response was cross-checked with the electronic prescription system and other available records (medical booklets and files). Vaccination against <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, influenza, Diphtheria&#x02013;Tetanus&#x02013;Pertussis, and COVID-19 was evaluated for adult patients, while for pediatric patients, all childhood vaccines were examined. Vaccination coverage was assessed according to National Recommendations for high-risk groups. The vaccination status of patients&#x02019; household members against influenza, Diphtheria&#x02013;Tetanus&#x02013;Pertussis, COVID-19, Measles&#x02013;Mumps&#x02013;Rubella, and Varicella was also assessed to investigate whether the recommended cocooning strategy was followed. In addition, demographics, medical history, intention to vaccinate, and reasons for undervaccination were assessed.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of both hospitals (University Hospital of Heraklion: Approval Code: 2530, Approval Date: 25 January 2023, Venizeleio General Hospital of Heraklion: Approval Code: 158, Approval Date: 22 November 2022) and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-13-00152"><title>2.3. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis used absolute and relative frequencies to describe the study population and vaccination status for each vaccine. Comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were performed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for nominal variables, the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test for ordinal variables, and the t-test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test for quantitative variables was used, depending on data distribution. Significant parameters identified were included in a multivariate logistic regression. Similarly, this procedure was utilized to explore the association between various parameters and the willingness to be vaccinated. The results were expressed as the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI95%) with corresponding <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values. The level of statistical significance for all analyses was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05; thus, results with a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 (two-tailed) were considered statistically significant.

Discussion</title><p>The present study assessed vaccination coverage and barriers to vaccination among individuals on biologic agents, examining how factors like age, gender, education, smoking, and comorbidities affect vaccination adequacy and willingness. This study also evaluated the vaccination status of household contacts.</p><p>According to the results, the majority of adult patients were vaccinated against COVID-19 and influenza. Fewer than two-thirds of patients had received the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, while a much smaller proportion had received the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and the adult-type Diphtheria&#x02013;Tetanus&#x02013;Pertussis vaccine within the last decade.</p><p>The vaccination rate in the household environment of adult patients was low for all vaccines examined, except for vaccination against COVID-19.</p><p>The moderate vaccination rate for Pneumococcus demonstrated in the present study is consistent with other studies conducted in immunocompromised patients, including patients on biologic therapy. In a cohort of 499 patients on biologics, the vaccination coverage for Pneumococcus was 49% [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The same vaccination rate (49%) was found in two other studies, one including a cohort of 208 patients under biologic therapy [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a large cohort of patients with autoimmune diseases who were treated with immunosuppressive drugs, including 1378 patients on biologic agent [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In fact, being treated with a biologic agent was negatively associated with pneumococcal vaccination [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, when patients with dermatological diseases receiving biologic therapy were evaluated, only 17% received the pneumococcal vaccine [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Prada et al. showed high coverage with PCV13 (80.2%), PPSV23 (77.9%), or both PCV13 + PPSV23 (75.2%) among rheumatology patients receiving biologic therapy [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Regarding influenza vaccination, the results of our study show increased vaccination coverage compared to a study of 208 patients on biologics (28% vaccinated) [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but are similar to another study of patients on biologic therapy, in which 78.8% of patients were vaccinated against the flu [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A recent publication from Greece showed an increase in the vaccination coverage of patients with rheumatic diseases during the pandemic from 76% to 83% [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while another Greek study conducted 2 years before the aforementioned study showed a vaccination rate of 54% for influenza in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The high vaccination rate against COVID-19 found in the present study is consistent with other studies, in which vaccination rates reach up to 94.4% [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and can be attributed to the fact that this vaccine was compulsory.</p><p>Regarding vaccination coverage in the environment of patients, the present study is the first to address this issue to our knowledge. Our findings show that people in the environment of immunosuppressed patients on biologics are suboptimally vaccinated. If we take into account that many of the people in the patients&#x02019; environment may have a variety of other indications for vaccination, i.e., age, comorbidities, etc., we conclude that the percentage of those who are vaccinated due to adherence to the cocooning strategy is extremely small.</p><p>Pediatric patients on biologics were sufficiently vaccinated with the vaccines of the basic immunization schedule but inadequately covered with adolescence and group-specific vaccines. A cross-sectional study from a Russian tertiary center, including 82 juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients on biologics found a vaccination rate of 61% for MMR and 31% for Diphtheria [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A scoping review of various studies conducted in children with autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases treated with immunosuppressive regimes, including biologics, showed varying vaccination coverage rates by vaccine, but overall they were lower than those found in the present study (DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB 67&#x02013;99.3%, pneumococcal 7&#x02013;42%, MMR 86&#x02013;92%, VAR 18.4&#x02013;74%, MCC 9.4&#x02013;76%, HPV 5.9%, influenza 1.7&#x02013;84.3%) [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The differences observed in different studies reflect the design of the studies, the vaccination program, and health systems of different countries, and cultural differences, as well as increasing awareness about vaccinations nowadays.</p><p>The vaccination coverage rates of family members of pediatric patients were moderate for influenza (59.2%) and COVID-19 (73.2%) and very low for MMR-VAR (26.2%) and Tdap (16.4%). This suggests that the recommendation for vaccination in the setting of immunocompromised children is likely neglected as a strategy to protect them.</p><p>Another interesting finding of the present study is that there were several deviations from the recommended vaccination schedule. These include delays in initiating vaccination, sometimes occurring years after starting biologic therapy, the administration of more than one dose of PCV13, incorrect sequencing of PCV13 and PPSV23 administration, administering vaccines at intervals much longer than recommended, irregular rather than annual influenza vaccinations and receiving fewer doses than recommended.</p><p>Of all the vaccines, except for the vaccine against COVID-19, the flu vaccine seems to be the most well-known one and the one with the widest public acceptance. In contrast, pneumococcal and tetanus vaccines are not widely known and are used by patients only after recommendation from their doctor. This is reflected in our study, where the majority of patients who were not vaccinated with these vaccines stated a lack of knowledge since they had not received a recommendation from their doctor for vaccination. This has been shown by published studies that have highlighted the lack of recommendation by the attending physician as the primary cause of insufficient vaccination coverage [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The role of healthcare professionals is crucial in promoting vaccinations for both the general population and vulnerable patient groups. Educating healthcare professionals in different specialties is of the utmost importance for the efficient implementation of special vaccine recommendations for high-risk groups of patients. Other causes that have emerged in the literature and which were identified in the present study are the view that vaccination is unnecessary, the fear of possible negative effects of vaccination, and the prevailing fear of disease exacerbation, denial, and neglect [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All patients should have the opportunity to discuss their fears and misconceptions about vaccines with their physicians, and any potential side effects should be addressed prior to immunization in accordance with good clinical practices. Further reasons reported in the literature were patients&#x02019; doubts about the efficacy of immunization and, interestingly, discouragement from health workers [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Also consistent with findings from prior research, this study observed higher rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among the elderly [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is plausible that the elevated coverage in this age group is driven, on the one hand, by age itself serving as an indication for these vaccines, and on the other hand, by the more frequent contact with medical services rather than solely by the immunosuppression status. Additional insights from the literature, including the inverse relationship between vaccination coverage and the receipt of biologic agents, as well as the positive correlation between comorbidities and higher coverage, suggest that the biologic agent treatment may constitute an overlooked risk factor for vaccine-preventable infections [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, the finding that female sex, advanced age, and the presence of comorbidities were positively associated with willingness to be vaccinated is consistent with previous research [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00152" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These findings underscore the fact that the incentive for vaccination in this group may not solely stem from the risk of serious infections due to immunosuppression and suggest that vaccination recommendations might neglect younger and otherwise healthy individuals.</p><p>A major advantage of the study is the large sample size of adult patients and the large total number of subjects included. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first study to assess the cocooning of patients on biologic therapy. In addition, the study included patients on biologic treatment irrespective of disease to examine the receipt of a biologic agent as an independent factor that constitutes an indication for vaccination.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the potential inaccuracy of information provided by patients and parents, primarily due to recall biases. This includes possible errors in recalling vaccination statuses and details of their conversations with physicians, particularly regarding vaccine-related advice. However, the first was largely overcome through the verification of information from medical files and the electronic prescription system. Also, the patients of the present study were followed at tertiary centers, and their care and behaviors may be different from patients treated in the private sector. Lastly, the sample number of pediatric patients is too small to draw firm conclusions, yet it represents the total number of children who were treated with biologic therapy in the study area at that time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00152"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study show that vaccination coverage rates of patients undergoing treatment with biologic agents and their environment is suboptimal and is a key preventive measure that needs to be strengthened. For this purpose, it is considered necessary to take appropriate actions that focus on improving information about the indications and benefits of vaccination and promoting knowledge, primarily among doctors but also among patients and their close contacts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study team would like to acknowledge and express thanks for the support received from Maria Bitsori (Pediatric Nephrologist), George Vasilogiannakis (Pediatric Gastroenterologist), and Maria Maragkoudaki (Pediatric Gastroenterologist), who provided contact with the pediatric patients of the study and their families.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
