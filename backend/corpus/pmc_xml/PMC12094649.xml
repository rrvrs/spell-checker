A better route is to develop an alternative belief that can coexist with the delusion. The best such beliefs function as counterweights to the delusion. Over time, the scales shift. The alternative belief becomes more powerful than the delusion. In this paper, we set out such a model of persecutory delusions (or severe paranoia) and describe how it inherently translates theoretical understanding into treatment routes. Severe paranoia occurs when the adaptive cognitive processes of deciding whether to trust become overly weighted to mistrust. An inaccurate threat belief is formed, and the person feels very unsafe. Hence, overcoming the delusion means developing a counterweighting belief. It means building the alternative view that the world is safe enough for the person now and going forward. This, in turn, is done by <italic toggle="yes">experiencing</italic> safety. However, the pull of paranoia is strong due to multiple factors such as past history, anxious arousal, hallucinations, feelings of vulnerability, use of defenses, withdrawal, worry, difficulties distancing from fears, and a sense of defeat. These factors can prevent the person from feeling safe in even the most benign environments. Therefore, counterweights must be developed for these factors. For instance, feeling vulnerable can be counterweighted by developing self-confidence. Excessive time spent worrying can be counterweighted by devoting more time to thinking about meaningful activities. The counterweight approach provides a non-confrontational, empathic, personalized way to lift the burden of paranoia from a patient with persecutory delusions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Delusions</kwd><kwd>Persecutory</kwd><kwd>Paranoia</kwd><kwd>Cognitive</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Psychosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="aw01"><funding-source>

Finding that light and opening doors to other people and actually letting people in to help you to then realise that you are actually safe and other people can make you feel safe, and you actually can feel safe in yourself as well, made me then start to have more lights, and then that pit got smaller and then eventually it was like a pothole, which I could just step out of</italic>.

She mistrusted most people. Over the course of the Feeling Safe program (Freeman et al., <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) Rachel realized that her past trauma was a key driver of her fears. An alternative view was raised: that perhaps people could be trusted now. Over many months, Rachel practiced trusting people. She learned that she was safe. Her paranoia faded away. In other words, Rachel developed a sense of safety that functioned as a counterweight to her fears. Over time, the scales tipped and safety &#x02013; rather than fear &#x02013; became her dominant belief. Persecutory delusions, such as those experienced by Rachel are one of the most common difficulties in psychosis presentations (Lemonde et al., <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Collin, Rowse, Martinez, &#x00026; Bentall, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Pappa et al., <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>) but are all too often resistant to standard treatments. In this paper, we describe a way of understanding paranoia, of talking about it with patients &#x02013; and of overcoming it.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2"><title>What are persecutory delusions?</title><p>Persecutory delusions are strongly held, but incorrect, beliefs that others are deliberately trying to harm the person. That harm may, for instance, be psychological, social, financial, or physical. Such beliefs can produce extremely negative consequences. The attempt to deal with the perceived threat &#x02013; for example, by withdrawing &#x02013; can be highly disruptive to everyday life. Negative affect, especially anxiety and depression, but sometimes also anger, is common. Life can feel like a battle. Often, persecutory delusions are an extension of delusions of reference, in which people believe that others are talking about them behind their back or that messages are being sent to them, or of hallucinatory experiences such as hearing voices.</p><p>We conceptualize persecutory delusions as inaccurate threat beliefs that are attempts to make sense of events (Freeman et al., <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). They are the extreme end of a spectrum of paranoia in the general population. Many people have a few paranoid thoughts, and a few people have many paranoid thoughts (Bebbington et al., <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Freeman et al., <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Neidhart, Mohnke, Vogel, &#x00026; Walter, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). This is unsurprising. Decisions about whether to trust or mistrust other people are an inescapable part of human cognition &#x02013; after all, real dangers exist, people do bad things to others, and safety can seldom be completely guaranteed. Paranoia is what results when that decision-making skews excessively to the negative so that judgments are inaccurate (Freeman, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In other words, it arises out of everyday risk estimation gone awry. Paranoia occurs transdiagnostically (e.g. Alsawy, Wood, Taylor, &#x00026; Morrison, <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; D&#x02019;Agostino, Monti, &#x00026; Starcevic, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Varghese et al., <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In conditions such as anxiety and depression it has been found &#x02013; most likely due to the negative effects on interpersonal relationships &#x02013; to be a marker of poorer outcomes (Bird et al., <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Wiedemann et al., <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Of course, paranoia can be an understandable reaction to events. Patients are more likely to live in difficult settings and experience hostility. A person can both have paranoia and face genuine threats. But &#x02018;the dose makes the poison&#x02019;. Too much paranoia &#x02013; a high concentration &#x02013; can create damaging effects. In persecutory delusions, the estimation of danger has become so dominant that the person feels extremely, and often debilitatingly, unsafe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3"><title>The weight of paranoia</title><p>

I was convinced about them&#x02026;and because my beliefs became so loud and just dominated me, they weren&#x02019;t helping me at all.</italic> Steve.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Why do persecutory beliefs become such a persuasive way of understanding events? Why does their voice drown out other perspectives? Our view is that they carry such weight because so many factors contribute to their existence and maintenance &#x02013; though the number and relative influence of those factors will vary from person to person. This complexity is illustrated in our study of 22 cognitive and social causes of paranoia (Freeman &#x00026; Loe, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). We found that all 22 causes were individually associated with paranoia, and in a combined model, 13 factors explained two thirds of the variance in paranoia. The 13 factors were: within-situation defense behaviors, negative images, negative self-beliefs, discrimination, dissociation, aberrant salience, anxiety sensitivity, agoraphobic distress, worry, less social support, agoraphobic avoidance, less analytical reasoning, and alcohol use. Another illustration is the wide range of other factors researchers are examining to understand paranoia, including aberrant belief updating (Sheffield, Suthaharan, Leptourgos, &#x00026; Corlett, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Barnby, Mehta, &#x00026; Moutoussis, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Rossi-Goldthorpe et al., <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), social group threat detection (Raihani &#x00026; Bell, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), amplified threat processing and impaired emotion regulation (Lincoln, Sundag, Schlier, &#x00026; Karow, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Walther et al., <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), social isolation (Contreras et al., <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Fett et al., <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), early life adversity (Bentall, Wickham, Shevlin, &#x00026; Varese, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), PTSD symptoms (Hardy et al., <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Panayi et al., <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), and attachment style (MacBeth, Schwannauer, &#x00026; Gumley, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Sood, Carnelley, &#x00026; Newman&#x02010;Taylor, <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). At a neurobiological level of explanation, overactivation and hyperconnectivity of the amygdala &#x02013; reflecting amplified detection of salience and threat and insufficient top-down regulation &#x02013; have been repeatedly linked to paranoia (Pinkham et al., <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Fan et al., <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Pinkham et al., <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Walther et al., <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>In our counterweight model of paranoia, we list 10 categories of factors that provide weight to the inaccurate threat belief (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and online Supplementary materials Figure S1). The focus is on factors that are tractable to intervention and that patients want treated (Freeman, Taylor, Molodynski, &#x00026; Waite, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The factors are designed to accommodate the influence of past experience on current processing (e.g., trauma may have had effects on, for example, self-beliefs, beliefs about others, anxious arousal, and imagery). The model is designed to provide structure to a clinical assessment of persecutory delusions and to do so from the patient&#x02019;s perspective. The conversation in that assessment starts at the belief itself. We discuss how much feeling unsafe pervades the person&#x02019;s life, and the types of direct evidence supporting that feeling. Often, the person&#x02019;s threat belief is fueled by the physiological effects of anxiety. The anxiety can sometimes be accompanied by negative images (Kingston et al., <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>; Morrison et al., <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Sometimes the person hears a voice telling them that they are vulnerable and will be attacked, which is then believed (Sheaves et al., <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). The long shadow of negative past events is often perceptible. Such events may involve things others have done to the person or actions the person feels guilty about. We then move on to a discussion of the defense behaviors &#x02013; safety-seeking behaviors (Salkovskis, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) &#x02013; that the person adopts to reduce the likelihood of harm. Often, the person avoids situations they find threatening. If they do enter such situations, they use subtle strategies for protection (e.g., rushing, choosing a quiet time of day, making themselves inconspicuous). Next, we assess how much the person is anticipating and thinking about threat, and, conversely, the time they spend in positive activities, such as social contact. Most patients devote considerable time to worrying about the threats and much less to other activities. We then broaden out into a discussion of how the person may feel inherently vulnerable in regards to other people due to negative self-beliefs (Collett, Pugh, Waite, &#x00026; Freeman, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Humphrey et al., <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Waite et al., <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). We may note that it is hard for the person to view events in different ways, and that the situation is not helped by disruption to sleep and routines (Freeman &#x00026; Waite, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). Typically, we conclude by exploring how much control the person feels the persecutors possess. This signposts that we want the person themselves to have greater control. In sum, the process we follow in the assessment allows us to build a personalized picture of the individual&#x02019;s situation. It gives us a tailored appraisal of the weights pulling the person&#x02019;s understanding towards paranoia.

I found out a) it was okay b) there was life outside my house that I wanted to be part of and c) people smiled.</italic> Gill.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Many patients lack alternative explanations for the delusion and its associated evidence. If they do have alternative ideas, these may be unpalatable and limited in explanatory power (e.g., &#x02018;mental illness&#x02019;, &#x02018;brain damage&#x02019;) (Freeman et al., <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We therefore provide a series of counterweighting beliefs or behaviors that are positive; can coexist with the person&#x02019;s existing position; and if adopted will inherently tip the scales away from the persecutory fears. The primary counterweight is a belief that the person may be safe <italic toggle="yes">now.</italic> This is a position that does not dispute the past. And the counterweight can be even more circumscribed: that the person is safe enough now in certain places at certain times (to do things that they would like to do). Of course, absolute safety cannot be guaranteed for anyone, and certain environments at certain times can be dangerous. The development of safety is best learned from direct experience. Within an inhibitory learning framework of understanding (Craske et al., <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the new learning of safety will constrain and dampen the old learning that others intend harm. Relatedly, the counterweight approach has similarities to a retrieval competition account of cognitive behavior therapy for emotional disorders, in which the principal mechanism of action of intervention is considered as &#x02018;strengthening competitor representations in memory that are positive rather than negative in valence&#x02019; (Brewin, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). It is also consistent with the general reasoning literature: considering an alternative, accessible, and plausible explanation is more likely to debias judgements (Hirt &#x00026; Markman, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Wharton, Cheng, &#x00026; Wickens, <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Sanna, Schwarz, &#x00026; Stocker, <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Hirt, Kardes, &#x00026; Markman, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>However, relearning safety can be extremely difficult when so many weights still pull in favor of the persecutory delusion. These weights can make even benign situations feel unsafe (e.g., &#x02018;If I had not left early, I would have been harmed&#x02019;, &#x02018;I had an image of the harm they were going to do to me&#x02019;, &#x02018;Later I realized that the smile was because they were up to something&#x02019;). Therefore, at least some of these weights must be lightened. Our framework for the introduction of counterweights is provided in <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It is important to convey to the person that the existence of the particular weight is understandable &#x02013; that it makes sense, for example, given their life experiences or as a response to their fears. But that forces a heavy burden upon them. A positive counterweight can then be introduced, and its potential benefits described. The merit of this approach is that many routes for treatment become evident. For example, increasing activities, sleeping better, building up self-confidence, looking for signs of safety, letting down one&#x02019;s guard to find out how the world is now, learning to tolerate anxious feelings, letting oneself rather than the voices decide what is going on, and getting some distance from troubling thoughts. It is notable that the approach intrinsically introduces flexibility into thinking about difficulties because of the introduction of counterweights.<table-wrap position="float" id="tab2"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Examples of how to pivot with patients to a counterweight</p></caption><alternatives><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" width="1*" span="1"/><col align="left" width="1*" span="1"/><col align="left" width="1*" span="1"/><col align="left" width="1*" span="1"/><col align="left" width="1*" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The weight</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stating the problem (with understanding why it occurred)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The problem with the problem</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">New counterweight position</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The benefits of the counterweight position</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02018;It is true that there are risks in the world. But to live our lives, we need to find enough safety to do ordinary activities.

Early in the intervention, we want to understand the weights pulling the person towards the delusion. But we then shift to identify and build up counterweights. A person with severe paranoia will typically need to follow several treatment routes, one at a time. But the counterweight approach typically identifies many options, allowing patient choice to be built into treatment provision. This approach generally produces a range of positive outcomes (Freeman et al., <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Jenner et al., <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). For some people, the weight of paranoia is lifted a little. For others, the change is enough to balance the scales. And sometimes the scales shift so dramatically in favor of safety that the burden of paranoia is lifted entirely.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec5"><title>Models are indispensable</title><p>A suitable model is essential for powerful psychological intervention. It allows us to identify treatment targets, share understanding with patients, and guide the focus of sessions. The counterweight model we describe here was developed to guide both psychological understanding and treatment, and underlies the face-to-face Feeling Safe program (Freeman et al., <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and the guided online program Feeling Safer (Freeman et al., <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">in revision</xref>), both of which have shown strong treatment effects. For example, in a randomized controlled trial, Feeling Safe produced a large further reduction in persecutory delusions above an alternative psychological intervention delivered by the same therapists (Freeman et al., <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Indeed, the principal counterweight (a feeling of safety) is signaled from the outset by the name of these programs. But an appropriate model alone is insufficient. Successful treatment requires other elements too. Elsewhere, we have described 10 key principles, including the use of counterweights, for developing psychological treatment for psychosis (Freeman, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). These include respect for patients, contributions from people with lived experience, and precise and rigorous treatment delivery. We also highlight the fundamental importance of collecting outcomes at each intervention session. We must be able to gauge whether a mechanistic target is being successfully addressed and whether there is improvement in the persecutory delusion. There is still work to be done on developing a comprehensive, patient-focused set of assessments to guide paranoia research and treatment. As we seek to improve the treatment of persecutory delusions, identifying further significant and tractable intervention weights and counterweights, that set of assessments must evolve accordingly.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec8"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="sm01" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Freeman et al. supplementary material</title><p>Freeman et al. supplementary material</p></caption><media xlink:href="S0033291725001242sup001.docx" id="d67e571" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the individuals who agreed to provide quotes for this article.</p></ack><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="nts1"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>The supplementary material for this article can be found at <uri xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291725001242">http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291725001242</uri>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="funding-statement" id="sec6"><title>Funding statement</title><p>The work was funded by a NIHR Programme Grant for Applied Research (PGfAR) (reference: NIHR204013).
