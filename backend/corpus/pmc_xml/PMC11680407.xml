Data on ISL resistance are currently limited, particularly to HIV-1 non-B subtypes. This study aimed to assess prevalent nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutations in HIV-1 subtype C for their phenotypic resistance to ISL. Prevalent single and combinations of NRTI-resistant mutations were selected from a routine HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance testing database and introduced into HIV-1 subtype C-like pseudoviruses, which were then tested for ISL susceptibility. Single NRTI-resistant mutations were susceptible or showed only a low level of resistance to ISL. This included thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs, i.e., M41L, D67N, K70R, T215FY, and K219EQ) and non-TAMs (i.e., A62V, K65R, K70ET, L74IV, A114S, Y115F, and M184V). Combinations of M184V with one or more additional NRTI-resistant mutations generally displayed reduced ISL susceptibilities. This was more prominent for combinations that included M184V+TAMs, and particularly M184V+TAM-2 mutations. Combinations that included M184V+K65R did not impact significantly on ISL susceptibility. Our study suggests that ISL would be effective in treating people living with HIV (PLWH) failing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/lamivudine (3TC) or TDF/emtricitabine (FTC)-containing regimens, but would be less effective in PLH failing zidovudine (AZT) with 3TC or FTC-containing regimens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>antiretroviral therapy (ART)</kwd><kwd>antiviral drugs</kwd><kwd>NRTI</kwd><kwd>islatravir (ISL)</kwd><kwd>phenotypic</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>subtype C</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Poliomyelitis Research Foundation (PRF)</funding-source><award-id>21/66</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the Poliomyelitis Research Foundation (PRF), grant number 21/66.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01888"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a significant threat to human health globally. HIV has infected an estimated 85.6 million individuals worldwide and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has claimed the lives of approximately 40.4 million people [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, substantial advances have been made in the treatment of people living with HIV (PLWH). Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has proven to be effective in managing HIV infections to allow for a near-normal quality and span of life in PLWH [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) cannot cure an HIV infection and cART is required for life to ensure sustained viral suppression. However, optimal cART adherence can be difficult to maintain in the long-term [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with sub-optimal adherence driving the development of antiretroviral drug resistance [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Alternative treatment options and novel ARVs with efficacy against resistant viral variants are required that could address these shortfalls.</p><p>Islatravir (ISL, EFdA, or MK-8591) is a novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTtI) with a unique dual mechanism of action. Apart from acting as an atypical chain terminator, it also prevents HIV Reverse Transcriptase from translocating further on the viral RNA template [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. ISL was shown to be well tolerated and effective in several clinical trials investigating dual-drug therapies [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Early studies on ISL showed an in vitro potency that was 10-fold higher than the approved NRTIs tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), zidovudine (AZT), and lamivudine (3TC) [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The common HIV-1 NRTI mutation M184V showed a nine-fold decrease in ISL susceptibility in HIV-1 subtype B NL4-3 [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the K65R, L74V, and Q151M mutations were more susceptible to ISL [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ISL was also shown to retain its potency against the multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 strain A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is resistant to all current NRTIs except tenofovir [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Due to its long half-life, ISL is being investigated for use in extended dosing intervals, such as weekly dosing in combination with Lenacapavir [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, dose-dependent decreases in the CD4 cell and total lymphocyte counts in ISL-containing regimens in some of these clinical trials [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] set the stage for the re-evaluation of ISL at lower doses. ISL has a high genetic barrier to the development of resistance and has shown to be effective against variants with major single nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug-resistance mutations (i.e., M41L, K65R, L74I, and V90I) [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Since ISL is still in an early stage of clinical development, most data available on ISL drug resistance rely largely on observations in HIV-1 subtype B. However, the high genetic diversity among HIV-1 subtypes could have an impact on drug resistance selection pathways, and subsequently, the degree of ARV resistance imposed by resistance mutations [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HIV-1 subtype C predominates globally [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and is the predominant circulating subtype among South Africa&#x02019;s 7.7 million PLWH [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Currently, all recommended cART regimens in South Africa include at least two NRTIs, some of which (i.e., lamivudine) are often recycled between regimens [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To inform HIV clinicians and caregivers on the potential role of ISL in cART in the context of HIV-1 subtype C NRTI-experienced PLWH, this study evaluated the in vitro susceptibility of prevalent NRTI drug-resistance mutations to ISL.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01888"><title>2.

Bacterial cells were pelleted through centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The bacterial pellets were used to extract plasmid DNA with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany; Cat. No. 27106). The eluted plasmid DNA was quantified on a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

The thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, T215FY, and K219QE) were more prevalent in combination with other mutations than in isolation. This was also observed for the non-TAM mutations (i.e., K70ET, L74IV, and Y115F) and for K65R.

Discussion</title><p>Considering the integral role of NRTIs in all cART regimens, the development and exploration of novel NRTIs that are capable of effectively addressing prevailing NRTI-resistant viral variants is needed. ISL, a novel NRTtI with a unique mechanism of action, has an extended half-life in vivo and a characteristic resistance profile. Data on ISL phenotypic resistance is limited, particularly for HIV-1 non-B subtypes. To gain insight into the potential value of ISL as a treatment option in NRTI-experienced PLWH with HIV-1 subtype C, this study assessed the in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility of HIV-1-like subtype C PSVs with common NRTI-resistant mutations to ISL. Prevalent NRTI-resistant mutations were identified from a routine genotypic drug resistance testing database, and PSVs containing the NRTI-resistant mutations were generated and tested for susceptibility to ISL in vitro. Phenotypic data for most PSVs with single or combinations of mutations were in agreement with the limited published phenotypic data available. No single NRTI-resistant mutation caused intermediate or high-level resistance to ISL. The highly prevalent M184V mutation conferred only a low level of resistance to ISL, whereas the K65R mutation was found to cause potential hyper-susceptibility to ISL. PSVs with combinations of NRTI-resistant mutations, all containing the M184V mutation, were generally less susceptible to ISL than those with single NRTI-resistant mutations. Combinations with the K65R, L74V, and K70E non-TAMs were either susceptible or had potential low-level resistance to ISL. Combinations with TAM-1, and particularly TAM-2 mutations, showed low- to high-level resistance to ISL. Both the type and number of TAMs impacted on the degree of ISL resistance.</p><p>The genotypic drug resistance testing database that was employed for this study included sequences from routine drug resistance testing performed during 2016&#x02013;2020. The South African National Treatment Guidelines recommended cART initiation on TDF with either FTC or 3TC and efavirenz (EFV) [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PLWH, failing this first-line regimen, were switched to a protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line regimen containing either AZT or abacavir (ABC) with 3TC and either ritonavir(r)-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) or atazanavir (ATV/r). In May 2019, the guidelines changed to replace EFV in the first-line regimen with dolutegravir (DTG), an INSTI [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The majority of sequences were obtained from PLWH, managed under the 2015 guidelines, with a minority managed under the 2019 guidelines. Routine genotypic drug resistance testing for PLWH failing cART was only recommended for those failing a PI-based second-line regimen. As such, the majority of sequences that were scrutinized in this study were from PLWH who failed a PI-based regimen that contained AZT or ABC, and 3TC as NRTIs in their current regimens, and with d4T, FTC, or TDF in their previous regimens. This was reflected in their drug resistance profiles as we observed TAM-1 (i.e., M41L and T215Y) and TAM-2 (i.e., D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219EQ) mutations, typically associated with the sub-optimal use of AZT or d4T [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as well as the L74IV and Y115F mutations which are typically associated with the sub-optimal use of ABC [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The M184V mutation was most prevalent and is typically selected for the sub-optimal use of either 3TC or FTC [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The presence of this mutation among the sequences is likely a result of the sub-optimal use of 3TC/FTC (XTC) during first-line cART and the sub-optimal use of 3TC during second-line cART. The presence of the K65R mutation is most likely a consequence of the sub-optimal use of TDF [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] during first-line cART, but could also be a result of the sub-optimal use of ABC during second-line cART [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Mutations at K70 (i.e., E/R/T) were also observed, likely as a consequence of the sub-optimal use of ABC or TDF [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The A62V mutation, usually observed in combination with other NRTI-resistant mutations [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], was also observed in two combinations (i.e., A62V/M184V and K65R/A62V/M184V) among the sequences.</p><p>A South African National Survey showed the M184V- and K65R NRTI-resistant mutations to be highly prevalent (78.2% and 57.5%, respectively) among PLWH who were failing a TDF-based regimen [<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This highly prevalent M184V NRTI-resistant mutation typically decreases XTC susceptibility by 100- to 1000-fold in in vitro settings [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the contrary, the M184V mutation is approximately three-fold more susceptible to AZT [<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and causes hyper-susceptibility to TDF [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our data showed that this mutation conferred potential low-level resistance to ISL (FC = 4.63, IQR 3.27&#x02013;5.41). This is in agreement with previous reports from Kawamoto et al. (FC = 7.0) [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Grobler et al. (FC = 5.0) [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Diamond et al. (FC = 4.7&#x02013;12.0) [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, this contrasts with the FC values reported by Ohrui et al. (FC = 45.5) [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Oliveira et al. (FC = 78.9) [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An in vivo animal study performed on rhesus macaques showed no viral breakthroughs when infected with an M184V-containing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in the presence of ISL [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This implies that ISL would still be efficacious in the treatment of PLWH with M184V-containing viral variants, which is much needed due to the mutation&#x02019;s high prevalence. When appearing alone, the K65R mutation has been reported to cause resistance to XTC, ABC, and TDF (8.4- and 8.8-fold) [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but increases susceptibility to AZT [<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our data showed that K65R alone was significantly more susceptible to ISL (i.e., FC = 0.35, IQR 0.09&#x02013;0.61) than the wild-type reference, possibly suggesting its hyper-susceptible nature. This is in agreement with the existing literature [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The mechanism of the hyper-susceptibility of K65R to ISL has been shown to be mainly through the decreased excision of ISL from the DNA terminus [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Both the K65R and M184V mutations cause a deficit in viral replication [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. An in vitro passage study showed that the single K65R mutant rapidly reverted to the wild-type in the presence of ISL, whereas no reversion was noted for M184V [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This points towards a sustained efficacy for ISL on K65R-containing viral variants.</p><p>Separately and in combination, the K65R and M184V mutations are two of the most common NRTI mutations to develop in those infected with HIV-1 subtype C, who are failing on a first-line NNRTI-backbone regimen containing TDF and 3TC [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This was also observed in our routine genotypic drug resistance testing database, which showed that the K65R/M184V combination was the second highest in terms of prevalence (i.e., 2.35%). While K65R and M184V are antagonistic mutations and cause a viral fitness deficit [<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Algorithm [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<uri xlink:href="https://hivdb.stanford.edu/">https://hivdb.stanford.edu/</uri>, accessed 29 March 2024) predicts the combination to confer high-level resistance to ABC and XTC, and intermediate resistance to TDF. Our data showed that this combination conferred potential low-level resistance to ISL. The K65R mutation potentially sensitized the M184V mutant to ISL as it led to a 2.35-fold reduction in the median FC. This increase in the ISL susceptibility of K65R+M184V has also been observed in previous studies [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interestingly, such an increase in susceptibility with K65R+M184V has also been observed with AZT [<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, we observed that combinations that contained other NRTI mutations (i.e., A62V, K70T, Y115F, or K219E), in addition to K65R+M184V, were susceptible to or conferred only a potential low-level resistance to ISL. The presence of other NRTI-resistant mutations in combination with K65R+M184V did not cause an additional decrease in ISL susceptibility. This finding is significant, especially in the context of subtype C, as we observed that 13.11% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 724) of the sequences from PLWH failing second-line therapy, that contained NRTI-resistant mutations, contained the K65R+M184V mutations in combination with other mutations.</p><p>Although AZT or ABC were occasionally included in first-line treatment, AZT was one of the main NRTIs used in PI-based second-line treatment. AZT has a low barrier to the development of drug resistance and often selects for TAMs [<xref rid="B50-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. TAMs occur in two distinguishable, yet overlapping patterns [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B53-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]: Type 1 TAMs include M41L, L210W, and T215Y; Type 2 TAMs include D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219E/Q. As 18.2% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4275) of patients in the routine genotypic resistance database received AZT in their current regimens, several Type-1 (M41L and T215Y) and Type-2 (D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219E/Q) TAMs were observed. The TAMs were observed either alone, or in combination with other NRTI drug-resistance mutations. Individually, most of the PSVs with single TAMs were susceptible to ISL, although the T215Y mutant conferred potential low-level resistance to ISL. According to the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Algorithm (<uri xlink:href="https://hivdb.stanford.edu/">https://hivdb.stanford.edu/</uri>, accessed 29 March 2024), T215Y is predicted to be susceptible to XTC, whilst conferring potential low-level resistance (~1.5-fold) to ABC and TDF. The remaining TAMs are predicted to be susceptible to XTC, ABC, and TDF, with the exception of T215F, which is predicted to confer potential low-level resistance to ABC and TDF. Limited data are available on the susceptibility of single TAM-containing variants on ISL susceptibility. A previous study reported an FC &#x02264; 2.5 for three single TAMs (i.e., M41L, L74I, and T215Y) [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which is in agreement with our findings for these single mutations.</p><p>Although individual TAMs did not affect ISL susceptibility in our study, the combination of TAMs with other NRTI drug-resistance mutations led to a decrease in ISL susceptibility in most cases. This was most evident for combinations with TAM-2 mutations. The combination of TAM-1 mutations (i.e., M41L+M184V+T215Y) did not decrease ISL susceptibility. However, M41L+M184V, with the addition of the T215F TAM-2 mutation, caused a significant decrease in ISL susceptibility. Furthermore, the addition of other TAM-2 mutations (i.e., K70R/K219EQ, K70R/T215F/K219Q) to D67N/M184V significantly decreased ISL susceptibility. On the contrary, the addition of K70E (a non-TAM) or K70R (a TAM-2) to D67N/M184V increased ISL susceptibility, relative to that of D67N/M184V. Brenner et al. [<xref rid="B55-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] showed that the combination of three TAM-1 mutations (M41L+L210W+T215Y) conferred low-level resistance to ISL (FC = 2.1). However, in combination with M184V, it conferred high-level resistance to ISL (FC = 40) [<xref rid="B55-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In addition, Diamond et al. [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that four TAM-2 mutations together (D67N+K70R+T215F+ K219Q), in the absence of M184V, conferred only low-level resistance to ISL (3.8 FC). Previous studies have reported that the combination of M184V with TAMs can resensitize TAMs to TDF [<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, as we have shown in this study, the opposite seems to be true for ISL, and the mechanism(s) by which the combination of TAMs with M184V increases the phenotypic resistance to ISL is unclear. ISL functions primarily as an immediate chain terminator and less frequently as a delayed chain terminator [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The M184V mutation causes NRTI resistance through discrimination between the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and the chain-terminating NRTIs before incorporation into the elongating DNA strand during reverse transcription [<xref rid="B58-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. TAMs, on the other hand, cause resistance by removing the NRTIs from the DNA terminus after incorporation [<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We, therefore, hypothesize that the combination of the two mutations could (i) prevent immediate chain termination by ISL through the action of the M184V mutation, and (ii) excise ISL during the delayed chain termination through the action of the TAMs. However, the inclusion of the K65R mutation in this mix could potentially swing the scales (as hypothesized above). The interaction between ISL and these antagonistic mutations are likely complex, and these hypotheses would need to be tested in future studies to confirm their validity.</p><p>The A62V mutation has been observed mostly in conjunction with the K65R mutation, partially correcting the viral fitness deficit caused by the latter [<xref rid="B60-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, in this study, the A62V+K65R+M184V mutation was found to be susceptible to ISL, most likely due to the hyper-susceptible nature of K65R+M184V. Contrasting this, the absence of the K65R mutant had a notable effect, as the A62V+M184V combination conferred a low to intermediate level of resistance to ISL. Although this may be a point of concern, the prevalence of the A62V+M184V combination was observed in only 1.01% of sequences with NRTI drug-resistance mutations in the genotypic drug resistance database.</p><p>We observed three variants at position 70 (i.e., K70E, K70R, and K70T) with FC values below the TCO. Two of these (i.e., K70E and K70T) showed a significant hyper-susceptibility to ISL. When in combination with D67N+M184V, K70E and K70R seemed to sensitize the D67N/M184V mutation to ISL. However, the addition of more TAM-2 mutations to D67N/K70R/M184V significantly reduced ISL susceptibility.</p><p>The L74V mutation showed a potentially low level of resistance to ISL (FC = 2.61, IQR 0.83&#x02013;4.13) in our study, which was higher than that reported by Grobler et al. (FC = 0.21 &#x000b1; 0.07) [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Kawamoto et al. (FC = 0.4) [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further evaluation of the L74V mutation in both subtypes B and C PSVs in this study did show potential hyper-susceptibility in one of the four HIV-1 subtype B PSVs (i.e., DS9-L74V), although this was not significant. However, this was not observed in the remaining subtype B or C PSVs, and although unexplored, we suggest that hyper-susceptibility may be strain-specific for this NRTI-resistant mutation. An additional mutation at position 74 (i.e., L74I) was observed at a low frequency among our sequences and did not affect ISL susceptibility by itself. However, in combination with M184V, it significantly reduced ISL susceptibility.</p><p>The A114S+M184V NRTI-resistant mutation was initially identified in a selection study which showed that it incurs a high level of resistance to ISL (24-fold) [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similarly, another in vitro dose-escalation study reported the A114S+M184V combination to have an FC of 37.9 to ISL, as well as confer very high levels of resistance to XTC (3TC: FC &#x0003e; 368, FTC: FC &#x0003e; 990) [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, both studies reported the hyper-susceptible nature of the dual mutation against TDF (50-fold [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]/0.03 FC [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) and AZT (0.4 FC) [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although the A114S mutation alone did not decrease the susceptibility to ISL in our study (i.e., 2.17, IQR 1.69&#x02013;2.54), a significant reduction in ISL susceptibility (i.e., FC &#x0003e; 60) was observed for the A114S+M184V combination. However, this mutation is uncommon, as the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database [<xref rid="B61-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] (<uri xlink:href="https://hivdb.stanford.edu/">https://hivdb.stanford.edu/</uri>, accessed 29 March 2024) depicted its frequency as &#x0003c; 0.01%. In addition, the A114S+M184V mutant combination was shown to cause a deficit in viral fitness, leading to a significantly decreased infectivity when compared to the wild-type [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, although the A114S+M184V combination is of concern as it severely impacts ISL susceptibility, its low prevalence in PLWH and its detrimental impact on the virus fitness is reassuring.</p><p>This study has its limitations. There is a possibility that more than one genotypic drug resistance test could have been performed for some patients. However, according to the South African National Antiretroviral Treatment Guidelines, an HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance test is only performed after confirmed virological failure with two or more consecutive viral loads &#x02265;1000 copies/ mL on a TDF/3TC/DTG (TLD) regimen or a boosted PI-based regimen for two years with confirmed adherence [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, resistance testing first requires authorization by a member of the National Third-line committee, a helpline consultant, or a nominated provincial expert. Since genotypic drug resistance is tightly controlled, it is unlikely that the genotypic drug resistance database could contain more than one result per patient. The different classifications of phenotypic resistance were placed at increments of the TCO and are not linked to clinical outcomes. These classifications merely served as a means to contextualize the degrees of ISL resistance in the assay that was employed. Additionally, the mean FC value of at least three independent screens for the resistance classifications of each mutant PSV was utilized. For some PSVs, the phenotypic responses were either on the cusp of two neighboring classifications or the standard deviations overlapped two or three neighboring classifications. However, despite this, this study&#x02019;s results were mostly in agreement with the limited literature on phenotypic ISL resistance currently available. We also observed large variations in the FC values in the repeat assays for some of the single and combinations of NRTI-resistant mutations. This may also be strain-specific, since we did not observe similar variations in the strain-derived PSVs compared to the L74V-MJ4 PSV. However, these variations (up to &#x000b1;1.7 FC) were greater than the assay variation for the wild-type MJ4 PSV (i.e., &#x000b1;0.6 FC), suggesting that there may be some other mechanisms in place that impact on the interaction between ISL and certain mutated amino acids in the active site of Reverse Transcriptase. We argue that this is a plausible hypothesis, considering the unique mechanisms of the action of ISL. Lastly, since all the NRTI mutation combinations observed among the sequences in our database contained M184V, TAMs in the absence of M184V were not investigated in this study. However, the results of our study reflect on a &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; setting and its implication on ISL as a treatment option following failure on AZT/XTC-containing regimens.</p><p>ARV resistance and cross-resistance is the Achilles heel of cART. As we have shown in this study, regimen choices may have an impact on the efficacy of novel ARVs, even those with novel mechanisms of action. This study implies that failure on a TDF/XTC-containing cART would possibly have a minimal impact on ISL efficacy in PLWH. However, due to the frequent selection of TAMs in conjunction with the M184V NRTI-resistant mutation, PLWH failing AZT/XTC-containing cART would most likely not benefit from ISL. With the shift from NNRTI-based first-line regimens (e.g., TDF/3TC/EFV) to INSTI-based regimens (e.g., TLD) [<xref rid="B63-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], ISL would remain efficacious since prevalent NRTI-resistant mutations, selected for by TDF (i.e., K65R) and 3TC (M184V), would have a low impact on ISL susceptibility. Despite the effectiveness of PI-based second-line regimens that contain AZT/FTC, the selection of TAMs in the presence of M184V could negate the efficacy of ISL. The Nucleosides and Darunavir/Dolutegravir in Africa (NADIA) Trial demonstrated that TDF/3TC was non-inferior to AZT/3TC in second-line cART [<xref rid="B64-viruses-16-01888" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The data from this trial support maintaining TDF and 3TC at the time of a switch to second-line treatment. Due to the absence of AZT in such regimens, ISL could potentially be used effectively as an alternative switching option, or in subsequent third-line cART.
