Consequently, responses to individual agents cannot be easily delineated at the single patient level, even though some patients might not require all drugs in the combination. Herein, we conduct multi-omic analyses of orthotopic TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) treated with single agent carboplatin, docetaxel, or the combination. Combination responses were usually no better than the best single agent, with enhanced response in only ~13% of PDX, and apparent antagonism in a comparable percentage. Single-omic comparisons showed largely non-overlapping results between genes associated with single agent and combination treatments that could be validated in independent patient cohorts. Multi-omic analyses of PDXs identified agent-specific biomarkers/biomarker combinations, nominating high Cytokeratin-5 (KRT5) as a general marker of responsiveness. Notably, integrating proteomic with transcriptomic data improved predictive modeling of pathologic complete response to combination chemotherapy. PDXs refractory to all treatments were enriched for signatures of dysregulated mitochondrial function. Targeting this process indirectly in a PDX with HDAC inhibition plus chemotherapy <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> overcomes chemoresistance. These results suggest possible resistance mechanisms and therapeutic strategies in TNBC to overcome chemoresistance, and potentially allow optimization of chemotherapeutic regimens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and low/no expression of HER2. Consequently, there is a lack of effective molecularly targeted therapeutics and chemotherapy remains the mainstay of systemic therapy. In the neoadjuvant setting, taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin), cyclophosphamide, and platinums (cisplatin, carboplatin) are used, often in series and/or in combination. Identifying patients who will respond to chemotherapy, and finding optimal chemotherapy regimens to treat TNBC, is an area of intense investigation. Recently, approved immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors are now available for TNBC patients and PARP inhibition has also been approved as adjuvant therapy for the ~15% of TNBC patients harboring deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The addition of taxane to adriamycin/cyclophosphamide (AC)-based regimens improved outcomes<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and was the standard-of-care to treat breast tumors for many years. The discovery that a subset of TNBC may be sensitive to DNA damaging agents<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> prompted the investigation of platinum derivatives for TNBC. Most recently, taxane/platinum combinations with or without AC have proven promising as they improve pathologic responses above historic single-agent rates. Although the exact treatment regimen was different among clinical trials such as GeparSixto<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, BrighTNess<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and CALGB 40603<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, TNBC patients enrolled in treatment arms receiving combination platinum and taxane achieved pCR rates of over 50%, which was significantly higher than the pCR rate of patients in arms receiving either drug as a single agent.</p><p id="P4">Because platinum-based agents can increase the frequency of adverse events<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, more current studies such as NeoCART<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and two TNBC clinical trials (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02547987" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02547987</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02124902" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02124902</ext-link>), analyzed by the National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), have investigated less intensive neoadjuvant regimens for TNBC patients consisting of platinum + taxane and excluding anthracyclines<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, in ~50% of cases, pCR is not achieved, and these individuals experience dramatically shorter relapse-free and overall survival<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the two drugs interact to enhance responses beyond an additive effect. Results from the KEYNOTE-522<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> TNBC trial led to approval of adding an immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, to an already intensive chemotherapy backbone of carboplatin + paclitaxel followed by AC. However, addition of pembrolizumab improved the pCR rate by only ~7% compared to the control arm<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Thus, identification of predictive markers for the efficacy of individual drugs would be useful in order to enhance response rates and to optimize and individualize treatments, as all chemotherapy agents have potentially life-threatening short- and long-term toxicities.</p><p id="P5">Our previous study identified weighted gene co-expression network analysis followed by Connect The Dots (WGCNA/CTD) informed mRNA-based biomarker panels that can predict differential response to single agent platinums and taxanes in multiple PDX and clinical datasets<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, these predictive models were evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) without performance assessment of a fixed model on unseen, independent test data. Predictive biomarkers for the platinum + taxane combination were not identifiable. Furthermore, the mRNA-based biomarker panel did not provide insight into potential resistance mechanisms or therapeutic targets. Here, we analyzed treatment response data to single agent carboplatin and docetaxel for a cohort of 50 TNBC PDXs derived from 46 different TNBC patients. Of these, we also generated combination response data for 42 PDXs to carboplatin + docetaxel combination. Treatment response data were integrated with baseline proteogenomic (DNA/mRNA/protein) profiles to perform a set of unbiased analyses to address several key questions: 1) What are the molecular associates of and predictors of response and resistance to single agent and combination treatments? 2) What molecular features can inform the selection of a single agent for individual tumors? 3) For the few PDXs where combination was beneficial vs single agents, what features are associated with these tumors, and what features are associated with cases where the combination was worse than the best single agent, and 4) What are possible therapeutic options for tumors that lack treatment response to all chemotherapy regimens?</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Combination carboplatin and docetaxel is largely ineffective at generating enhanced responses over the best single agent in TNBC PDXs</title><p id="P6">TNBC patients frequently receive combination chemotherapy treatments based on clinical data suggesting improved response from combination chemotherapy compared with single-agent chemotherapy<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, averaging effects observed in group level data from clinical trials may not be applicable to individual patients<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.

This is consistent with our above observation that distinct genes may regulate tumor responsiveness and resistance to different chemotherapy treatments. At the pathway level, RNA and protein data converged on upregulated metabolic pathways in PDXs resistant to all treatment types while upregulated E2F/G2M related pathways associated with PDXs responsive to all treatment types.

ProMS identifies a group of minimally redundant, and therefore complementary, markers associated with an attribute label, which for this study is chemotherapy response, where each marker represents a biological function or pathway defined by co-expressed genes. Although initially developed for protein marker selection using single or multi-omics data, ProMS can also be implemented for RNA marker selection, which is how it was applied in this study. Individual datasets from this study, and previously described external resources (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4B</xref>), were used to train separate logistic regression models using ProMS selected features to predict CR/pCR for platinum, taxane, and their combination, respectively, using transcriptomics profiling data (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>). Due to the small sample size of each dataset, five features were selected for model training. For each treatment type, a clinical dataset, or the largest clinical dataset when more than one exists, was selected as the independent test data to evaluate fully trained model performance. Prediction performance of models trained using single datasets were highly variable and close to random (0.50) as measured by area under ROC curve (AUROC) in the set-aside cross-validation data from the same dataset (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>).

Gene level changes reinforced geneset findings where individual genes were elevated in PDXs whose response to carboplatin was better than docetaxel such as Zinc Finger Protein 367 (ZNF367) (transcriptional regulation gene), and Anaphase Promoting Complex Subunit 5 (ANAPC5) (cell cycle gene) (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4B</xref>). These genes at the RNA level were also associated individually with neoadjuvant cisplatin response in TNBC tumors from the DFCI cohort where the AUROC was the highest compared to AUROCs for the same genes in other neoadjuvant TNBC clinical datasets where patients received either single agent taxane or carboplatin + taxane before response assessment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, in PDXs for which docetaxel response was better than carboplatin, both RNA and protein data associated higher levels of genes positively regulating the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton such as Rac Family Small GTPase 1 (RAC1), Peptidylprolyl Isomerase B (PPIB), Migration And Invasion Enhancer 1 (MIEN1), Coronin 1B (CORO1B), and Cofilin 1 (CFL1) (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4B</xref>), suggesting microtubule-actin coordination<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> may impact responses to taxanes.

Both KRT5 mRNA and protein abundance were able to discriminate non-pCR CPTAC-TNBC samples from pCR samples with an AUROC of 0.69 and 0.65, respectively (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6D</xref>). Importantly, both AUROC curves demonstrated appreciable sensitivity with a 0% false positive rate, indicating high specificity of KRT5 to distinguish non-pCR tumors to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We further validated KRT5 by IHC staining of baseline tumors prior to treatment from our PDX cohort (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) where staining intensity and frequency were quantified to generate an Allred score (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). By using the Allred score, we achieved an AUROC of 0.83 in discriminating PDX tumors responsive to any chemotherapy arm in our cohort (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>) suggesting the potential use of KRT5 as a biomarker of responsiveness to non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens consisting of carboplatin, docetaxel, or the combination.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Targeted agents can enhance chemotherapy response</title><p id="P26">In resistant PDXs, we also observed higher expression of several &#x0201c;cancer stem-like cell&#x0201d; associated pathways previously implicated in breast cancer, including Hedgehog, VEGF, Notch, and MET/RAP1/RAC1 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), inhibitors of which have all been evaluated in clinical trials, and all of which have not been approved for clinical use as single agents. A gamma secretase (Notch) inhibitor MK0752 was evaluated in combination with docetaxel and showed enhanced response but is not approved for clinical use<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. For a partial analysis of these results we used our previously completed SPORE/U54 PDXNet preclinical trial (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>) in which we investigated responses to seven agents targeting these &#x0201c;cancer stem-like cell&#x0201d;-associated pathways alone and in combination with carboplatin in 11&#x02013;20 randomly selected PDX models in a manner similar to unselected clinical trials without molecular matching (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Four models were included that were resistant to all chemotherapy regimens, BCM-0046, BCM-7821, BCM-15029, and HCI-028. Of the seven targeted agents evaluated, only niraparib (PARP inhibitor) and EPZ011989 (EZH2 inhibitor) resulted in significant tumor shrinkage (PR or better) as single agents, but in only two and one PDX models, respectively (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Of these three models responsive to single agents, only BCM-15029 was in the chemoresistant group. The response to single agents indicates a 2.6% overall success rate for candidate investigational agents in the absence of appropriate biomarkers. Although these sparse positive data prevent us from learning the biological mechanisms underlying drug response, we hypothesized that shared features between the responsive PDX models with other breast tumors that have high similarity to these PDXs could predict the observed therapeutic vulnerabilities.</p><p id="P27">To test this hypothesis, we applied a multi-omic computational approach that uses publicly available human data to prioritize agents for PDX testing by first querying the RNA profiles of the three PDX models that showed significant tumor shrinkage against the CPTAC cohort with proteogenomic profiling on breast tumors<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="S12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). For each PDX, the top 20% of the CPTAC breast tumors with the highest similarity by RNA profiles to the PDX were considered as a PDX-like group. Since the direct targets of these agents are proteins, proteomics profiles were then compared to those from the remaining tumors to identify significantly up-regulated proteins as putative targets. Remarkably, when HCI-015, which showed a high sensitivity to Niraparib, was used as a query, PARP1 (target of niraparib) ranked first among all 841 quantified druggable proteins (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, for all three PDX models, the targets of effective agents (PARP1/niraparib for HCI-015 and BCM-15029, EZH2/EPZ011989 for BCM-15006) ranked the best among targets of all tested agents (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>) which was reflected in drug response profiles for these models (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), providing strong support to our prediction approach. These data further suggest a single sample, tailored therapeutic strategy to treat a chemotherapy refractory TNBC PDX model, BCM-15029, and validates the general approach from our previous studies that selects PDX models for pharmacologic intervention based on drug target abundance<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Targeted agents were able to enhance carboplatin responses, albeit infrequently (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). For example, consistent with single agent response to niraparib in BCM-15029, niraparib enhanced response to carboplatin in this chemoresistant model (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In another chemotherapy refractory model, BCM-0046, both romidepsin, an HDAC inhibitor, and carboplatin were completely ineffective as single agents, however, the combination induced a partial response (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Protein abundance of romidepsin&#x02019;s targets HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 were highest in BCM-0046 out of all PDXs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Romidepsin decreases mitochondrial membrane potential which results in reduced mitochondrial function and increased generation of reactive oxygen species and that contributes to DNA damage and apoptosis<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Sensitivity to the combination of romidepsin and carboplatin, but not with either single agent alone, may be explained by both high protein abundance of romidepsin&#x02019;s designated targets and the observation of highly enriched mitochondrial and OXPHOS pathways in chemotherapy resistant PDXs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, DNA damage driven by romidepsin may enhance the cytotoxicity of platinum DNA damaging agents such as carboplatin. Future follow-up studies will be required for confirmation.</p><p id="P29">In contrast to previous preclinical studies that use positive data from a limited number of PDX models (usually 1&#x02013;2 PDX models) to drive clinical trials, our study demonstrates that benefit from targeted agents alone and in combination with chemotherapy is limited in unselected populations, similar to trials that are not biomarker driven. Indeed, two out of the four chemotherapy refractory models, BCM-7841 and HCI-028, remained insensitive to all seven targeted agents alone and in combination with carboplatin. Curiously, addition of either romidepsin or EPZ011969 to carboplatin in the HCI-015 PDX showed some evidence of antagonism such that CR to carboplatin alone converted to only a PR in combination (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">L</xref>) similar to the effect of added docetaxel in that model (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, HCI-015 PDX demonstrated clear multi-agent antagonism along with other models such as BCM-4013 and FCP699 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">L</xref>) suggesting that negative interactions with chemotherapy agents can occur with targeted agents in addition to other chemotherapy agents we previously described (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In summary, our results highlight the potential of our approach to facilitate rational design of pre-clinical drug studies using PDX models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for TNBC patients frequently include several agents given in combination, or in series, without knowledge of whether a given agent would be effective or ineffective for individual patients. This is impossible to address in clinical trials since individual patient responses can only be evaluated to one treatment arm as it is not possible to assign the same patient to multiple arms. We addressed this critical issue by leveraging a clinically-relevant, large cohort of 50 orthotopically transplanted PDXs where each model was assessed for response to human equivalent doses of single agent carboplatin, docetaxel, or the combination. We also leveraged multiple publicly available PDX and neoadjuvant TNBC datasets in which mice or patients were treated with similar chemotherapy regimens for validation throughout the study to suggest clinical relevance of our findings, particularly if these gene panels can be refined. Our investigation into the lack of enhanced combination response compared to the best single agent for a given TNBC PDXs has numerous important biological and clinical implications discussed below.</p><p id="P31">Molecularly guided therapy is largely lacking for TNBC, and the underlying molecular associations of treatment response to platinum derivatives, taxane compounds, and their combination is poorly understood. Molecular profiling data from multiple omic platforms in baseline PDX tumors prior to treatment associated gene sets related to chromatin regulation that were upregulated in tumors with better response to single agent carboplatin vs docetaxel (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Changes in chromatin accessibility have been linked to sensitivity and resistance to DNA cross-linking, platinum chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin and these changes have been associated with impacts on the transcriptional landscape<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. In contrast, in PDXs for which docetaxel response was better than carboplatin, both molecular data associated higher levels of genes with roles in metabolism and structural integrity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4B</xref>). More specifically, metabolism genes such as Glutathione Synthetase (GSS) and Glutathione S-Transferase Kappa 1 (GSTK1) are involved in the synthesis of a detoxification enzyme, glutathione, and conjugation of glutathione to substrates promotes elimination of toxic compounds from cells. There is evidence for glutathione promoting resistance to alkylating agents including platinum agents<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. After cisplatin enters cells, it can be complexed with glutathione and subsequently exported out of cells<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. This may explain higher levels of GSS and GSTK1 observed in PDXs with better response to docetaxel than carboplatin where these genes may contribute to a degree of platinum insensitivity due to carboplatin being inactivated by elevated glutathione metabolism. In addition, genes positively regulating the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton were found to be higher in PDXs that responded better to docetaxel than carboplatin, suggesting a level of microtubule-actin coordination<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> which may impact responses to taxanes since their mechanism of action involves microtubule disruption. Together, these data provide biological insights into the distinct underlying associations to different chemotherapy agents.</p><p id="P32">There is a great need to identify additional biomarkers for precision diagnostics beyond ER, PR, and HER2.

Although the immune-checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab is now approved for neoadjuvant use in combination with carboplatin/taxane/anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, this regimen provided a 7% improvement in pCR rate compared with chemotherapy alone<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, suggesting a critical need for predictive biomarkers to identify patients that will benefit from immune-checkpoint inhibition.</p><p id="P33">The high performance and high specificity of our protein-informed, multi-omic pCR predictor for platinum + taxane (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) has important implications for identifying patients that will respond to chemotherapy without the need for additional pembrolizumab and anthracycline/cyclophosphamide. Integrating proteomic data with transcriptomic data demonstrates the added value of incorporating diverse molecular profiles to enhance chemotherapy response predictions. Moreover, the ProMS and ProMS<sup>mo</sup> selected biomarkers that comprise our chemotherapy response predictors to single-agent platinum, taxane, and their combination form a relatively small set of genes that is tractable for further validation and clinical translation and therefore attractive for future development into a precision diagnostic. We have trained a final composite model using all available datasets for each treatment type and these are ready to be applied to any additional dataset, such as the BEAUTY<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02022202" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02022202</ext-link>), TBCRC 030<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01982448" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01982448</ext-link>), and RESPONSE (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05020860" ext-link-type="uri">NCT05020860</ext-link>) clinical trials.</p><p id="P34">Our previous WGCNA/CTD work employed pseudo-bulk RNAseq data in which the mouse stromal reads were added to the human epithelial tumor cell reads in an attempt to mimic bulk RNAseq data from human-only clinical samples. Unfortunately not all datasets were appropriate for such analysis. However, going forward, using stromal genes from pseudo-bulk data could also help improve our predictions as these genes have been demonstrated to be highly informative, especially for taxane response prediction, in our previous study that used a complementary approach (WGCNA/CTD) for chemotherapy response prediction<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Together with a recently described high-performance 20 gene biomarker panel to predict pCR to neoadjuvant taxane plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens in TNBC<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>, these predictors cover the multitude of chemotherapy regimens given to TNBC patients and provides strong rationale for incorporation into future clinical trials. Models of negative biomarker combinations will also be very useful to predict progressive disease or residual cancer burden, but will require more studies that include these measurements together with molecular profiling.</p><p id="P35">Despite finding differences in molecular associations to various chemotherapy agents described above, our investigation into associations with response to any treatment arm tested identified KRT5, a basal cytokeratin associated with basal-like breast cancer, as a potential biomarker to stratify TNBC tumors for treatment. Immunohistochemistry for basal cytokeratins 5/6, 14, and 17 have been used previously to define basal-like breast cancer and examine associations with chemotherapy responses to different treatment regimens<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. Further stratifying TNBC tumors using positivity for at least one of these basal cytokeratins identified patients with better adjuvant response to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and to capecitabine<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> but also identified patients with worse adjuvant response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> compared to patients without these markers. The presence of these markers was also associated with worse response of TNBC patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Here, we observed high KRT5 protein abundance by mass-spectrometry-based measurements in TNBC tumors responsive to non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy consisting of single agent carboplatin, docetaxel, or their combination. These data suggest basal-like markers may be either positive or negative markers of TNBC response to chemotherapy depending on the regimen and also provide rationale for further investigation for KRT5 as a companion diagnostic. We confirmed KRT5 findings by IHC in PDX tumors and a KRT5 Allred IHC score achieved a high AUROC of 0.83 for discriminating responsive PDXs from this study to any chemotherapy (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Additional validation of KRT5 IHC in human breast cohorts with chemotherapy response information is ongoing. We also identified a group of genes in PDXs quantified at the RNA level, aided by protein level measurements, that was predictive of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in TNBC tumors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Future diagnostic assays and prospective clinical trials will be required to evaluate the clinical utility of these candidate biomarker or biomarker combinations.</p><p id="P36">In PDXs resistant to all treatment arms we also found elevated levels of OXPHOS and lower levels of glucose metabolism/glycolysis related pathways (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). These findings of high OXPHOS but low glycolysis in our resistant PDXs is consistent with a previous study that also showed elevated OXPHOS and decreased glycolysis in a residual TNBC PDX tumor post adriamycin/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy treatment that was generated from a treatment-naive TNBC patient<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. In addition, mitochondrial gene expression and protein synthesis were among the top pathways enriched in resistant PDXs, as was OXPHOS, which may be fueled by an increase in respiratory chain complex components (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The finding that OXPHOS may also interfere with optimal response to combination treatment (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) is inline with a recent study where transcriptomic profiling of TNBC tumors prior to sequential taxane and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant therapy associated an OXPHOS signature with greater risk of recurrence and also observed that pharmacological targeting of OXPHOS suppressed tumor growth of many PDX models generated from patients with residual tumors<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. This also aligns with other studies that implicate divergent effects of platinum vs taxane agents on mitochondrial metabolism<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> and demonstrate distinct effects of platinum plus taxane combination vs single agents on mitochondrial structure<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. The contribution of OXPHOS may therefore be critical to identify tumors insensitive to chemotherapy and/or used in treatment decisions for combination carboplatin + docetaxel and deserves further study.</p><p id="P37">Although using PDXs in our study addresses many challenges in TNBC, it faces limitations that may impact clinical translation. Immune-deficient PDX models lack an effective immune response, a critical biological process that is well-established to become altered during cancer. The presence of specific immune cells in human tumors, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, have been shown to be not only predictive of response to some chemotherapeutics, but also prognostic for TNBC patients<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. Another immunity-related issue is our previous observation where immunologically &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d; TNBC tumors have higher engraftment rates as PDX models compared to immune-enriched &#x0201c;hot&#x0201d; TNBC tumors<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> leading to the vast majority of the TNBC models analyzed in the current study to be immunologically &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d;. It is not completely understood what the impact of an intact immune system would have on our study&#x02019;s findings. However, we found a substantial overlap of genes associated with drug responses in tumors from PDXs and clinical trials (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) and also found groups of genes predictive of chemotherapy response (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Similarities between PDX models and patients were also highlighted in our previous study that showed highly concordant drug responses between PDX and patient-of-origin, especially for taxanes<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Lastly, our study investigated tumor responses after four cycles of chemotherapy similar to evaluating patient responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Evaluation of longer term measures such as tumor recurrence is an ongoing area of investigation by our team.</p><p id="P38">In conclusion, our proteogenomic characterization identifies candidate molecular mechanisms underlying response and resistance, as well as putative predictive biomarkers for stratifying TNBC tumors for single or combination chemotherapy treatments. These results also support evaluation of rationally selected targeted agents and rationally selected PDX most likely to respond to such agents (or not) that may augment chemotherapy response to a meaningful extent, and provide a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>RESOURCE AVAILABILITY</title><sec id="S14"><title>Lead Contact</title><p id="P39">Further information and requests should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead author, Michael.

Single agent carboplatin, docetaxel, and untreated/vehicle control data were derived from three separate preclinical trials (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>) with further details as described previously in Petrosyan et al<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Response to chemotherapy was assessed by tumor volumes measured at pre- and post-treatment timepoints. Log<sub>2</sub> transformed fold change in tumor volume at 28 days after initiation of treatment was calculated. If the tumor completely disappeared after treatment, a tumor volume of 0.05 was used in the calculation to avoid log transformation error. After log<sub>2</sub> transformation, a general linear model within each PDX was computed to compare the differences between treatment groups, and to estimate the average log<sub>2</sub> fold change in tumor size and its associated 95% confidence interval for each treatment within a PDX. These data were also plotted for visual presentation. Response was classified based on modified RECIST 1.1 criteria<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>: Complete response (CR) was defined as non-palpable tumors. Partial response (PR) was defined as PDXs with &#x02265; 30% reduction in tumor volume but not reaching the non-palpable state. Stable disease (SD) was defined in PDXs with &#x0003c; 30% decrease but no more than 20% over baseline tumor volume. Progressive disease (PD) was defined for PDXs with tumor volume increases of &#x0003e; 20% over baseline tumor volume. Thresholds for quantitative responses were also determined. For example, since partial response (PR) is defined as &#x02265; 30% decrease in tumor volume below baseline at day 28 of treatment, a PDX model with an average log<sub>2</sub> fold change in tumor size of &#x0003c; &#x02212;0.515 [30% shrinkage ~ log<sub>2</sub>(0.7)] would be deemed PR.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Drug combination effect using Bliss independence model</title><p id="P44">The Bliss independence model<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> was used to evaluate drug combination response. This model assumes the combined effect of two drugs in the product of their individual effects. The expected response of carboplatin + docetaxel combination for each PDX model was computed as A + B &#x02212; (A &#x000d7; B) where A is the log<sub>2</sub> fold change response to carboplatin alone and B is the log<sub>2</sub> fold change response to docetaxel alone. A lower limit of &#x02212;12 was given to models whose expected response was lower than &#x02212;12 since this value was the lowest possible change based on palpable tumor size (see above). A paired t-test and paired Wilcoxon signed rank test was then performed to test for significant differences between computed expected vs observed log<sub>2</sub> combination tumor response values. No statistical difference was found and therefore the combination response is interpreted as additive between the two single agents.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p id="P45">PDX tumors were harvested, formalin-fixed for 24 hours, and then preserved in 70% ethanol.
