Brain fog may lead to sub-health conditions, such as forgetfulness, difficulty thinking, and other related symptoms. Although they are not immediately life-threatening, these sub-health conditions could gradually erode the quality of life. Currently, there is no relevant screening tool for brain fog.</p></sec><sec id="sec3812"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study was to develop a reliable screening tool.</p></sec><sec id="sec3813"><title>Methods</title><p>
A web-based brain fog screening questionnaire was developed in the study. It was based on previous studies, which summarized five parts of the most common clinical symptoms after COVID-19: forgetfulness, difficulty thinking, difficulty concentrating, feeling confused, and difficulty finding words or phrases to speak. Unfortunately, these items were used only in a way of yes or no answers in previous studies. Each of these items was expanded to five anchors to evaluate their severity in the study. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient was used to assess internal consistency. K-means clustering was used as a second method to validate the cutoff points. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to validate the appropriateness of the cutoff point.</p></sec><sec id="sec3814"><title>Results</title><p>There were 534 participants who completely finished the questionnaire. It includes 183 males and 351 females, and all of them aged between 19 and 81 years. The Cronbach&#x02019;s Alpha value was 0.821. The cutoff point was at a total score of 6 in terms of K-means. Based on the result, the ROC curve revealed that an area under the curve (AUC) was 0.816 with a confidence interval of 0.784 to 0.849.</p></sec><sec id="sec3815"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of the web-based screening test for brain fog.</p></sec><sec id="sec3816"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
