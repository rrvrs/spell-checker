However, its governance presents significant ethical challenges, particularly around individual ownership and privacy. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a sustainable and ethical framework that integrates biometric data with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We developed a customized NFT framework with advanced smart contract functionalities that enhance privacy protection and decentralized authentication of biometric data ownership. This approach ensures the secure and ethical management of digital health data while reinforcing individuals&#x02019; control over their biometric information. By leveraging cryptographic techniques for privacy protection, this framework enhances both the security and efficiency of personal health data management, offering a new perspective on ownership in digital health. Furthermore, a sustainable economic model is proposed to facilitate ethical transactions of tokenized biometric data within the NFT marketplace. The implications of this study extend beyond technology and commerce, offering valuable insights into human behavior in emerging digital economies and contributing to the creation of a more sustainable and equitable digital health ecosystem.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-02516-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biological techniques</kwd><kwd>Computational biology and bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Health care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by Ministry of Science and ICT</institution></funding-source><award-id>RS-2024-00451383</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>company of Mobicus</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">The rapid evolution of technological innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is reshaping numerous sectors at an unprecedented pace. These advancements critically depend on the availability and quality of data, following the principle that higher-quality data lead to more significant insights and outcomes. Among various data types, biometric data stand out for their depth and potential utility, ranging from daily health indicators to complex genomic profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This vast array of data enables a sophisticated understanding of health and lifestyle patterns, enhancing predictive models for pharmacological interventions and physiological simulations conducted in silico<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">However, the accumulation and management of such sensitive biometric data pose significant ethical and governance challenges, particularly regarding ownership rights, which are rarely conferred upon the data creators. This misalignment between data generation and proprietary rights raises serious concerns about privacy, control, and the equitable use of personal information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Traditional methods&#x02014;such as encryption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, secure hardware<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, anonymization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>&#x02014;ensure privacy and security, but they primarily focus on access control rather than decentralized ownership or monetization. While ZKPs support privacy-preserving authentication, they are computationally intensive and lack data portability. Privacy-focused databases ensure regulatory compliance but depend on centralized trust, limiting user autonomy. In contrast, NFTs offer a decentralized framework enabling verifiable ownership, secure transactions, and traceability. When combined with advanced cryptographic methods, NFTs provide a scalable and privacy-enhancing solution for sensitive data management.</p><p id="Par12">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a transformative solution to these challenges. NFTs are unique digital tokens powered by blockchain technology, representing scarce digital assets with distinct value within a blockchain network. While previous studies have explored the integration of biometric data with NFTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, they have primarily remained conceptual, focusing on theoretical discussions rather than practical implementation. In contrast, the objective of this study is to develop a secure and decentralized framework&#x02014;Cell-NFT&#x02014;for the ownership, management, and application of biometric data using NFT technology.</p><p id="Par13">Unlike previous research focused on domains like the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the Cell-NFT framework introduces innovations specifically tailored for healthcare. These innovations include standardized data management, robust ownership mechanisms, and cryptographic privacy-enhancing techniques, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in healthcare and biotechnology.</p><p id="Par14">Traditional database systems, while efficient at storing and retrieving data, rely on centralized control for access management and data integrity. This centralized approach introduces risks such as unauthorized modifications, lack of transparency, and dependence on intermediaries for trust. In contrast, blockchain technology offers a decentralized solution, where data integrity is cryptographically verifiable, and records are tamper-proof. By integrating these features, the Cell-NFT framework ensures that biometric data ownership and transactions are transparent, auditable, and resistant to manipulation.</p><p id="Par15">The metadata schema for Cell-NFTs is not a simple replication of traditional database functions but is designed to leverage blockchain&#x02019;s unique advantages in data security and provenance tracking. Unlike conventional databases, where data integrity depends on a central authority, blockchain-based metadata guarantees tamper-proof records, cryptographically verifiable ownership, and decentralized access control. This approach is particularly valuable in biomedical applications, where regulatory compliance, transparency, and auditability are essential. Traditional databases are vulnerable to unauthorized modifications and require extensive trust in intermediaries, whereas blockchain mitigates these risks by providing a transparent and immutable ledger of all recorded interactions. By incorporating these features, our approach offers significant improvements in data integrity, security, and long-term reliability compared to conventional storage solutions.</p><p id="Par16">Our research presents a pioneering methodology that integrates biometric data into NFTs to establish robust ownership records. By tokenizing biometric information, this framework preserves individual uniqueness and represents biological identity within the digital sphere, enabling secure certification of data ownership. Biometric NFTs contain comprehensive digital life data, enabling their governance and exchange across diverse digital platforms and marketplaces. The accompanying metadata schema is designed to boost both accessibility and practical use by streamlining data sharing and transactions, thereby enhancing management workflows and reinforcing the foundation of a secure and efficient digital health infrastructure.</p><p id="Par17">Tokenized biometric data have diverse applications, including use by hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. To address limitations in current NFT-based healthcare and biotechnology solutions, our framework employs a metadata schema and ecosystem designed to achieve enhanced data security, streamlined processes, and improved accessibility. This tokenization introduces societal benefits, such as improved data management security and the emergence of new industries centered on innovative digital assets. Additionally, the work underscores the concept of individuality in the digital age, presenting both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of human behavior, ethics, and societal norms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Issuance of Cell-NFTs using biometric data</title><p id="Par18">

</p><p id="Par19">Biometric data can be generated from various human physiological functions, including facial recognition, cardiac and pulmonary metrics, and biological sample analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). These data are crucial for understanding individual health, identity, and physiological function. A central aim of this research is to tokenize such biological information, with a particular focus on cardiomyocytes, given their central role in heart function. By tokenizing these cells, we enable virtual ownership of an individual&#x02019;s heart through NFTs. These NFTs encapsulate encrypted metadata on the blockchain, which includes key information such as genetic data, experimental details, and ownership records.</p><p id="Par20">In addition to cardiomyocytes, other types of biometric data&#x02014;such as those derived from various cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b)&#x02014;can be tokenized using NFTs. The metadata from these cells can be utilized for identity authentication. The study protocol received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Kangwon National University Bioethics Committee (Republic of Korea) (KWNUIRB-2024-02-008-001).</p><p id="Par21">For this study, cells were derived from noninvasive, easily collectible urine samples and subsequently dedifferentiated into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Notably, iPSCs can differentiate into various cell types, including osteocytes, neurons, and muscle cells. Cardiomyocytes, a specific type of muscle cell, were selected for the issuance of Cell-NFTs. Given that NFTs can be produced in video format, dynamic representations of the cardiomyocytes&#x02014;such as heartbeats&#x02014;are provided as supplementary videos (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2), enhancing the personal connection to the tokenized data and their market value.</p><p id="Par22">The encrypted metadata within these NFTs can be classified into three categories: Biological data, Image data, and Experimental data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Biological data can include unique identifiers such as cell-specific DNA and RNA sequences obtained from whole-genome sequencing (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Image data consist of captured cell images that are minted as NFTs. Experimental data provide a comprehensive overview of the processes involved, such as the dates on which cells were acquired, the differentiation methods used, and the timeline of NFT creation. Within the Image and Experimental data, it is feasible to demonstrate the process of obtaining cells from an individual to establish ownership rights over the NFTs.</p><p id="Par23">Cell imaging serves a dual purpose: it is both scientifically valuable and aesthetically engaging. This dual function has been recognized by companies like GE Healthcare, which organizes cell imaging competitions, as well as by renowned academic institutions such as the University of Queensland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Stanford. These institutions host contests to showcase beautiful cell images, further highlighting the appeal of cellular imagery. Such collections not only attract attention for their visual impact but also provide a rich dataset, capturing the interest of the scientific community eager to extract detailed biological and experimental information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Reprogramming UDC into cardiomyocytes</title><p id="Par24">Cardiomyocytes derived from urine samples are isolated through three critical steps, as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and detailed in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The first step involves isolating urine-derived cells (UDCs) from urine samples.

For example, a cell derived from a notable individual could command a higher value. As illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, these Cell-NFTs are available for acquisition in the contemporary metaverse marketplace using digital currencies such as Ethereum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">Ethereum utilizes the environmentally sustainable Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which significantly reduces the energy consumption typically associated with mining. This eco-friendly approach offers substantial environmental benefits, particularly for large-scale applications. In contrast, Proof of Work (PoW) mining requires considerable electrical energy and computational resources for block creation and verification, resulting in enhanced security. Moreover, PoW&#x02019;s decentralized nature fosters a secure, independent network. As such, many blockchain platforms suitable for the creation of these added-value tokens will emerge, with the most effective methods likely evolving through collaboration with major projects like Bitcoin, Bitmobick, and Ethereum.</p><p id="Par31">Similar to conventional NFTs, each Cell-NFT is accompanied by a descriptive section that provides potential investors with a summary of the tokenized cell, thereby enhancing its appeal.

Building on these insights, the Cell-NFT framework not only advances biometric data management but also contributes to broader economic efficiency and blockchain innovation. This reinforces the social value of secure, self-sovereign digital identity solutions, particularly in healthcare.</p><p id="Par44">A key element in this transformation is the valuation of biometric data, which varies based on factors like rarity, sensitivity, and application. Establishing a robust valuation framework that accounts for data scarcity, its significance in healthcare, and its research potential is essential. Ensuring fair compensation for individuals while promoting ethical trading practices is crucial for fostering a sustainable and transparent Cell-NFT marketplace.</p><p id="Par45">The implications for medical diagnostics and therapeutics demand careful consideration of ethical and regulatory frameworks. As NFT adoption grows, legal standards continue to evolve, requiring ongoing compliance. Our framework does not facilitate the commercialization or unrestricted trading of biometric data but functions as a cryptographic mechanism for access control, ensuring individual ownership and autonomy. It enforces explicit, revocable consent while adhering to ethical guidelines that prioritize privacy and prevent unauthorized use. By design, the system prevents biometric data from being commodified, reinforcing responsible and compliant management.</p><p id="Par46">Recent studies highlight the cybersecurity concerns and legal complexities of blockchain regulations across jurisdictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These studies underscore the need for alignment with NIST and ISO standards to ensure compliance. The Cell-NFT framework strengthens trust, security, and legal compliance in biometric data management by aligning with global regulations. It enables individuals to maintain control over their data via NFTs while adhering to laws such as HIPAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, GDPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and the Australian Privacy Act<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These regulations require explicit consent, breach reporting, and user rights to access, modify, or delete data. Ethical standards like the Australia&#x02019;s National Statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and global standards like the Declaration of Helsinki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> further emphasize informed consent, confidentiality, and responsible data handling.</p><p id="Par47">Ensuring ethical and legal compliance in NFT-based biometric data management is critical, especially in the context of data breaches, misuse, and privacy violations. Key risks include unauthorized access, data manipulation, and accidental loss, which can compromise privacy. The Cell-NFT framework mitigates these risks through encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and real-time monitoring. Smart contracts enforce compliance, while automated audit trails and breach notification mechanisms ensure transparency and regulatory adherence (GDPR, HIPAA). These strategies collectively strengthen trust, security, and accountability in decentralized biometric data management.</p><p id="Par48">To safeguard ethical data usage further, we propose using smart contracts to enforce data usage conditions. These contracts would ensure secure, automated transactions and transfer ownership of Cell-NFTs only when ethical standards are met. By implementing these measures, biometric NFTs align with global privacy regulations, ethical standards, and emerging regulatory requirements for digital assets. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and local data protection laws is essential to responsibly manage biometric data. Trust in the Cell-NFT framework is reinforced through blockchain&#x02019;s immutable data storage, verifiable ownership via NFTs, and decentralized authentication via smart contracts. This trust is further bolstered by cryptographic security, decentralization, and blockchain transparency, which protect the integrity and confidentiality of biometric data.</p><p id="Par49">Market dynamics, including demand, supply chains, and secondary sales, will significantly impact the value and liquidity of Cell-NFTs. Pricing models will incorporate factors like data uniqueness, demand for health data, and research potential. Ensuring fair trade and robust market mechanisms will be essential for the widespread adoption of the system.</p><p id="Par50">A formal threat model has been developed to address risks such as data leakage, unauthorized access, smart contract vulnerabilities, and Sybil attacks. To mitigate these risks, the Cell-NFT framework employs encryption, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure data security and integrity.</p><p id="Par51">Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Cell-NFT system requires continuous optimization, adaptive strategies, and efficient user management. A dynamic metadata structure supports regular updates, while a user-friendly interface with role-based access controls enhances both security and accessibility. To address scalability, our framework incorporates Layer 2 solutions like rollups and sidechains, improving transaction throughput while reducing gas fees and computational overhead. A hybrid storage model securely stores biometric data off-chain, recording only cryptographic proofs on-chain to minimize storage costs and enhance blockchain efficiency. Additionally, off-chain processing and decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) ensure data integrity, regulatory compliance, and tamper-proof record-keeping. These improvements collectively enhance performance, scalability, and cost-effective decentralized access control in an evolving technological landscape.</p><p id="Par52">While we acknowledge the limitation of not conducting direct experimental validation, this literature-driven comparative analysis provides a solid foundation for assessing the feasibility and potential impact of Cell-NFT. Traditional databases typically process transactions at approximately 500 TPS, while Cell-NFT, using Layer 2 scaling solutions, achieves 50 TPS while enhancing security. Centralized databases offer lower storage costs, whereas Cell-NFT mitigates high on-chain storage expenses by leveraging IPFS for off-chain data management. Furthermore, blockchain ensures immutable, decentralized security, whereas traditional databases rely on centralized administration, making them more susceptible to unauthorized modifications and security breaches.</p><p id="Par53">Future work will focus on metadata standardization and retrieval within the Cell-NFT framework. The JSON-based schema will ensure interoperability, adhering to RDF and DCAT standards. Cross-platform adoption will be facilitated through integration with RESTful APIs, OData protocols, and schema validation. Key attributes such as &#x0201c;name,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;description,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;experimentation&#x0201d; will support interoperability testing and data transformation, enhancing data accessibility, security, and regulatory compliance. Additionally, we plan to collaborate with healthcare institutions and industry partners to conduct pilot studies, evaluating the feasibility, security, and regulatory compliance of the Cell-NFT framework. These empirical investigations will bridge the gap between theoretical design and real-world implementation, ensuring scalability and adoption in secure data transactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Collection of human urine from the participants</title><p id="Par54">Urine samples were collected from individual donors in compliance with the ethical guidelines outlined in the 64 th World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the Kangwon National University Bioethics Committee (Republic of Korea) (KWNUIRB-2024-02-008-001). Informed consent was obtained from all donors before sample collection. A total of four human donors participated in this study (three male, one female), though the gender of the donors was not relevant to the outcomes of the study. Human urine samples were pooled to isolate epithelial cells, with the results not being influenced by the characteristics of the individual participants.

The sample was washed with the washing buffer, followed by a second centrifugation and washing step. After aspirating the supernatant, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of primary medium containing 10 &#x000b5;M ROCK inhibitor and transferred to a single well of a 12-well plate, where the cells were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C (day 0). On days 2 and 3, 1 mL of primary medium was added to the well each day. On day 4, most of the medium was aspirated, leaving 1 mL, to which 1 mL of REMC medium was added. From day 4 onward, 1 mL of the existing medium was removed and replaced daily with 1 mL of fresh REMC medium. Upon observing cell colony formation around day 9, the medium was replaced with fresh REMC medium.

The plasmids containing the reprogramming factors (hOCT3/4, hSK, and hUL) were introduced into the cells through electroporation at 1650 V, 10 ms, and 3 pulses. After electroporation, the cells were transferred to a 35 mm dish containing EM (day 0), and the cultures were maintained in E8 medium with daily medium changes. After 14 days, cell morphology transitioned from elongated to rounded, indicating the formation of iPSCs. The areas with rounded morphology were isolated by mechanical passaging, and a ROCK inhibitor was added to the E8 medium to ensure stable passaging. Stable iPSC lines were established after several rounds of mechanical passaging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Differentiating cardiomyocytes from iPSCs</title><p id="Par59">Cardiomyocyte differentiation from iPSCs was carried out as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. To differentiate iPSCs into cardiomyocytes, RPMI Media (Gibco) and B-27 Supplements, both with and without insulin (Gibco), were used to prepare the cardiomyocyte differentiation media. Insulin is known to inhibit cardiac differentiation during the initial five days of iPSC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Consequently, RPMI media supplemented with insulin-free B-27 was used up to day 5, after which the medium was switched to RPMI with B-27 containing insulin. To promote differentiation into the mesodermal lineage, a GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR 99021 (Sigma Aldrich), and a Wnt ligand production inhibitor, IWP (Sigma Aldrich), were added to the media.
