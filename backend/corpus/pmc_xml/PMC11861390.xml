Surgical resection remains the gold standard treatment in early NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; however, the surgery itself can cause significant pulmonary function impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) plays an important part in recovery from treatment post-lung resection surgery. PR is a comprehensive programme which amalgamates exercise training with psychological and behavioural tools to rebuild the functional capacity of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PR whilst documenting improvements in exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnoea, fatigue, and health-related quality of life post-lung resection surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite a wealth of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of PR post-lung resection surgery, implementation in clinical practice remains suboptimal. Furthermore, programme implementation in small, local cancer centres has been under researched to date. Research highlights that the successful implementation of evidence into practice requires tailoring of rehabilitation programmes to a specific setting with local stakeholders so that barriers to implementation in the local context can be understood and addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">While previous research has highlighted some barriers to implementation of lung cancer rehabilitation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] the main challenge in this area today is to get stakeholder input and design and tailor strategies that address these barriers. Taking a participatory health research approach to implementation problems has the potential to improve the uptake, adherence, and sustainability of healthcare interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Participatory health research strives to maximise the participation of end-users in all stages of the research process. Research is not done &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; people as passive subjects providing &#x0201c;data&#x0201d; but &#x0201c;with&#x0201d; them to provide relevant information for improving their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Applying these methodologies to pulmonary rehabilitation in cancer could provide deeper understanding of what makes these programmes work.</p><p id="Par12">Despite a favourable prognosis and extensive evidence suggesting the potential positive effects of PR, patients with NSCLC still suffer from unmet rehabilitation needs. Designing and implementing a successful PR programme on a local level is logistically challenging and involves an extensive multidisciplinary team. This study aims to explore the potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of such programmes and to identify strategies to successful operationalisation of PR programmes for those who have undergone curative resection of NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par13">A qualitative study using semi-structured focus groups with patients who had undergone resection for NSCLC was performed. A total of 12 patients were interviewed for this study, all of whom were offered PR with no obligation to partake. Eight of the study participants opted to partake in the PR programme offered in a physiotherapy gym located on the grounds of an acute hospital.</p><p id="Par14">Throughout this research endeavour, the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (COREQ) were used to perform and report this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, we have employed normalisation process theory (NPT) as a framework to assess the descriptions of exercise behaviours and healthcare practices from the people recovering from lung cancer and health professionals in order to identify facilitators and barriers to rehabilitation exercise, the environment (hospital), and if possible, any strategies that may help with implementation. Developed by May and Finch, NPT is a framework that can be applied across healthcare contexts and topics to explain, and potentially shape, implementation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. NPT has four components that provide a framework for this process. By incorporating theory, we hope this can help us overcome barriers and enhance facilitators and evaluate the implementation in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par15">Having gained ethical approval, patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC who had undergone lung resection were identified. Patients attending routine follow-up appointments during the period of the study (September&#x02013;December 2022) were invited to participate by a administrative gatekeeper not directly involved in their care. The study inclusion criteria was those aged 18 years or over with a diagnosis of lung cancer who were treated with surgery between the period of 1st January 2019 and 31st December 2020. Twelve participants volunteered to take part in 3 focus groups. Recruitment was stopped after the third focus group as there were no new themes being identified in the interviews. No repeat interviews were performed. Of the 12 focus group participants, 8 opted to partake in the PR programme. Participation was voluntary and no disadvantages arose from non-participation. Participants were supplied with information on the objectives of the focus group interviews, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Background information on the interviewees was collected regarding age, gender, comorbid conditions, and smoking status was also collected (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Three of the focus groups were conducted in person and one via zoom. The interviews lasted approximately one hour. A critical review of available literature on PR after lung cancer surgery was conducted to gain an adequate understanding of the subject, and from this, an appropriate list of questions was compiled to ask participants during each interview. All of the focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim by a member of the research team. The transcripts were pseudonymized and given a consecutive ID number from 1 to 12. Transcripts were not returned to participants for comment and/or correction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par19">Four anonymised transcripts (1 for each focus group) were reviewed and independently coded by the first and last author using an open coding procedure.

The data also highlighted that important barriers to the effective implementation of a PR programme were patient comorbidities, location, perceived lack of benefit of PR, and a fear of causing harm. The findings of this study will be discussed in relation to the existing literature.</p><p id="Par52">A significant concern noted across the literature and in this study is a lack of awareness about PR programmes and their potential benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In 2014, Rochester and colleagues developed a survey to better understand patients perspectives on PR. Of 1685 respondents, 40% reported that their healthcare provider never told them about PR programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It has already been suggested in the literature that patient advocacy groups develop education materials for people living with chronic respiratory disease regarding the process and benefits of PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the existing literature alongside this analysis confirms the need for greater healthcare professionals&#x02019; knowledge and awareness of PR to foster patient referrals.</p><p id="Par53">Location of PR programmes and access difficulties are highlighted as barriers to attendance at PR programmes in this study and across the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Four of twelve individuals in this analysis chose not to attend the PR programme due to conflicting responsibilities, comorbid conditions that would hamper their ability to partake, access difficulties, and feeling that the course was &#x02018;not needed.&#x02019; Of the 8 individuals interviewed who chose to partake, there was a 100% completion rate. Travel to a PR centre along with parking charges may act as a barrier to attendance or completion of a programme. In future, a larger number of PR centres would certainly act as a facilitator to future uptake.</p><p id="Par54">There is a lack of consensus across the literature about the best time to enrol in a rehabilitation programme post-treatment and no specific guidelines have been set. Rather, it has been suggested that whilst the timing of rehabilitation is crucial, it must be tailored to the individual patient and their disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Many of the participants in this study echoed the fact they felt they would have been unable for as intense a programme until many months after the surgical resection, with several of these patients partaking in the PR programme 6&#x02013;12 months post-surgery. Some patients may find it distasteful to discuss rehabilitation prior to surgery when facing a life-threatening illness. On the other hand, emphasising a proactive approach at an early time is fundamental to recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer negatively affect patients in terms of the physical and emotional well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, when these patients are presented with a unique opportunity to improve their health status, they must have trust in the programmes ability to &#x02018;do no harm.&#x02019; Not only has the safety and efficacy of PR been widely researched and supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] the strong social aspect of the course can improve mental health and establish social support networks. Those who have participated in PR report enjoying the social aspect of training together, ultimately serving to encourage and motivate one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Besides the individuals with lung cancer or chronic respiratory diseases, the caregivers might also find the desired social support in the PR setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par56">Our study has strengths and limitations. The use of implementation science allowed for evaluation of evidence which reflected community and stakeholder priorities. Nonetheless, this is a single-centre study in a large teaching hospital. The aim of this paper was to explore patient perspectives. However, to get a full understanding of perceived barriers/facilitators to PR implementation, the thought and opinions of the wider multidisciplinary team should be sought, some of whom contributed to this paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Further research suggestions</title><p id="Par57">Prospective studies assessing the psychological and physical outcomes of PR involving large sample size comprising patients with different cancer stages and comparing PR programmes would also be hugely informative. Furthermore, as the role of prehabilitation is a growing area in cancer care, it would be beneficial if the impact of prehabilitation on engagement with, and benefit from, post-resection PR programmes and on patient quality of life and survival was defined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par58">In this analysis, we identified that the most striking barriers to participation in PR programmes are the presence of comorbidities, location, perceived lack of benefit, and a fear of causing harm. As a result, strategies aimed at facilitating better patient education about the importance of PR alongside education of physicians on the importance of referrals to PR programmes would improve uptake rates and positive outcomes for patients and their families.</p><p id="Par59">Regardless, recovery after resection of NSCLC remains a major challenge. This challenge is only exacerbated by the growing burden of obesity, diabetes, COPD, and other chronic diseases. Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes implemented by multidisciplinary teams can offer these patients a unique opportunity to improve their health status and quality of life. As we are now entering the era of personalised medicine, future large-scale studies will almost certainly be required to identify specific rehabilitation programmes most suited for specific individuals and their state of health.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>NSCLC</term><def><p id="Par6">Non-small-cell lung cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p id="Par7">Pulmonary rehabilitation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Denise Doyle (F), Matthew O&#x02019;Brien (M), Rosemary Murphy (F), and Dervla Kelly (F) conducted focus groups.&#x000a0; </p></fn><fn><p>This material has not been presented on any occasion.&#x000a0;</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding provided by the IReL Consortium.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, [DD], upon reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par60">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation-alternatives><element-citation id="ec-CR1" publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vansteenkiste</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>2nd ESMO Consensus Conference on Lung Cancer: early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer consensus on diagnosis, treatment and follow-up</article-title><source>Ann Oncol</source><year>2014</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>1462</fpage><lpage>74</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/annonc/mdu089</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24562446</pub-id>
