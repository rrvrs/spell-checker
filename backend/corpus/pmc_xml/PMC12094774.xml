This systematic review is aimed to highlight any potential benefits or harms with this practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A comprehensive librarian-designed literature search was performed using PRISMA guidelines. Using search terms, &#x0201c;mouth taping, adhesive mouthpiece, porous oral patch, surgical tape, breathing mouthpiece, sleep, microsleep, breath, breathing, or mouth breathing&#x0201d;, MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched from February 1999 to February 2024.

After 34 duplicates were removed, 86 articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Sixty-two were excluded. Twenty-four went on to full text review and 10 met inclusion criteria with a total of 213 patients. Two studies showed statistically significant improvement in established markers of sleep apnea such as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or oxygen desaturations. Other studies showed that mouth taping offered no differences and even discussed potential risks including asphyxiation in the presence of nasal obstruction. Many studies excluded anyone with nasal obstruction or pathology.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The social media trend of mouth taping for individuals with mouth breathing, sleep disordered breathing, or sleep apnea has been reviewed. Based on the data presented by these 10 different studies, it seems that there is a potentially serious risk of harm for individuals indiscriminately practicing this trend. Further studies are required to elucidate any clinical benefit this practice may have.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec012" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by interruptions of breathing during sleep and is considered the extreme end of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. OSA causes oxygen desaturation events and, depending on the severity, can cause long-term sequelae including hypertension and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and quality of life detriments [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mouth breathing has been identified as a risk factor for OSA [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mouth breathing also worsens OSA by narrowing the airway and increasing obstruction [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) or OSA in children is typically managed through adenotonsillectomy [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In adults, OSA is usually treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, for many individuals, CPAP adherence is poor due to discomfort [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Mouth breathing occurs when either nasal or pharyngeal obstruction compels individuals to switch from nasal breathing to breathing through the mouth. Allergic rhinitis, adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy and deviation of the nasal septum are among the most common causes for mouth breathing [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nasal obstruction and the resultant mouth breathing has also been implicated in SDB and OSA [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], with SDB considered to be both a cause and a consequence of nasal obstruction.</p><p>Many interventions have been considered to address mouth breathing. One such intervention that has increased in popularity likely due to social media trends is the phenomenon of mouth taping. This involves participants maintaining mouth closure by occlusion with tape while sleeping to prevent mouth breathing. Participants allege benefits ranging from better sleep quality to anti-aging properties to improvements in dry mouth, bad breath, and concentration [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but lack of concrete evidence gives rise to concern about this practice both from a safety and effectiveness perspective.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the literature to determine the effects of mouth taping on SDB and OSA to assess if this practice carries meaningful benefit and/or risk of harm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>A comprehensive search strategy was devised with an assistance of a clinical librarian (AI) with experience in conducting searches in electronic databases. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the systematic search strategy was tailored to our predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria and conducted using MEDLINE&#x000ae; and Embase&#x000ae; (both via the OVID platform) electronic databases. The web-based search engine Google Scholar was searched to identify additional potentially relevant non-indexed articles in bibliographic databases. References of all studies identified as applicable for inclusion were reviewed for additional articles relevant to our systematic review.</p><p>Systematic literature searches were carried out from February 1999 until February 2024. To identify relevant studies, we utilized a sensitive search strategy comprised of the following search terms (using combinations of subject headings (i.e., MeSH in MEDLINE) and keywords): mouth taping, adhesive mouthpiece, porous oral patch, surgical tape, breathing mouthpiece, sleep, microsleep, breath, breathing, or mouth breathing with further filtering to adverse effects. English language restriction was applied. The search strategies were modified using appropriate thesaurus terms and fields suitable for each database.</p><p>A detailed description of our search strategy can be found in supplementary appendix (S1 Fig). Identified records from the electronic searches were downloaded and imported into Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.covidence.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.covidence.org/</ext-link>). Abstract and full text review as well as data extraction were performed in duplicate by two reviewers (S.M., J.R.).</p><p>We employed the following inclusion criteria: all pediatric and adult patients with OSA, nasal obstruction, or mouth breathing during sleep; and oral/mouth taping, or any similar devices such as oral porous patch and chinstraps. We considered randomized control trials and prospective studies only, with objective and subjective outcomes. The exclusion criteria included non-English articles, only utilizing an oral devices such as mandibular advancement devices without mouth taping, tongue retaining devices, or soft palate lifts. Studies also had to be published within the last 25 years. Initially, 120 studies were identified. After automatic removal of 34 duplicates, 86 abstracts were screened, with 24 studies undergoing full-text screening.

Eight out of the 10 utilized either adhesive tape or a sealing device to occlude the mouth. Two of studies utilized a chin strap to hold the mouth closed. Labarca et al. utilized a mouth seal as well as a mandibular advancement device (MAD) [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Osman et al. utilized a mouth seal as well as a chin strap and a novel nasal spray [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two studies were completed by the same first author in the same year (Jau et al. 2023).</p><p>The mean or median age of each study differed, ranging between 38&#x02013;64 years of age. Sample sizes for studies ranged from 9 to 71 participants, with 233 total patients across all studies included in this systematic review. The mean or median body mass index (BMI) ranged from 24 to 35. Mean or median baseline apnea-hypopnea indexes (AHI) were 13&#x02013;47.

Six studies assessed AHI before and after implementation of their form of oral occlusion. Only two of these studies (Lee et al. and Huang et al.) reported a significant decrease in AHI post-occlusion [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Lee et al. reported a significant reduction in median AHI from 8.3 to 4.7 per hour after tape, and Huang et al. reported a statistically significant reduction in median AHI from 12 to 7.8 per hour after oral patch [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Labarca et al. also compared the AHI in patients with MAD plus mouth taping to those utilizing just MAD alone and did report a statistically significant decrease in the median AHI with MAD alone compared to combined treatment from 10.5 to 5.6 per hour [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Osman et al. showed no significant difference between patient on a placebo spray compared to mouth taping. There was also no significant difference between the novel nasal spray plus mouth taping to spray alone [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The last study looking at AHI was one of the two studies by Jau et al. This group assessed and validated a &#x0201c;mouth puffing&#x0201d; device while patients&#x02019; mouths were taped. Jau et al. define mouth puffing as a derivation of mouth breathing while patients&#x02019; mouths are occluded with tape [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

They found that AHI was significantly reduced in individuals who had no mouth puffing compared to both side or complete mouth puffing [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

PSGs are considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA, and although criticized for its limitations, AHI is a well-established and studied metric of OSA severity [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Only six of the ten included studies assessed AHI as a primary outcome, and only five of those compared AHI directly between interventions. Only three of these studies showed a statistically significant reduction in AHI with intervention, while two reported no significant differences. One of the included studies that reported improved AHI (Labarca et al.) only found this AHI reduction when comparing MAD plus mouth taping to MAD alone [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. When looking into the patient subgroup with mild OSA (defined by AHI&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;15), utilization of MAD or MAD plus mouth taping did show significant reduction of AHI. When this study examined baseline AHI compared to mouth tape alone, there was no significant difference in AHI [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other primary outcomes utilized by authors, such as snoring index, ODI, CPAP pressures, and mouth leak, showed significant differences favoring oral occluding strategies, however, many of these primary outcomes were shown in two or fewer studies. The clinical significance of these differences is also unclear, as none represents a gold standard metric of OSA severity.</p><p>Lee et al., Huang et al., and Labarca et al. were three of the six studies showing a level of reduction in AHI with oral occluding devices [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, when looking closer into these studies, Lee et al. and Huang et al. only included individuals with AHIs of less than 15 [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The classification varies between studies, however, classically, an AHI of 5&#x02013;15 is considered mild OSA [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The AHI improvement in the study by Lee et al. was 8.3 to 4.7 (mild to borderline mild), and 12 to 7.8 in the study by Huang et al (mild to persistently mild). With the criticism of AHI as a marker for disease severity in OSA, it is unclear whether these reported significant reductions in AHI are meaningful clinically [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Lee et al. and Huang et al., were able to report a significant reduction of SI alongside this AHI reduction but no other clinical factors or symptoms can be commented on. Labarca et al. included a larger range of individuals with AHIs from 10&#x02013;50 [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, their study only reported significant reductions in AHI for those individuals that were utilizing a MAD plus mouth tape compared to those with MAD alone, while comparing oral tape to baseline AHI showed no significant difference [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although, when looking at subgroup analysis in the study by Labarca et al., those with mild OSA (AHI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;15), did have significant improvement in AHI with MAD or MAD plus mouth taping [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These three studies also excluded any individuals with any form of nasal obstruction including allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, septal deviation, sinonasal disease as well as tonsils of grade three or above [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, it would be fair to assume that of the patients selected for these studies, any form of oral occlusion, would allow them to continue to breathe comfortably through their nose when asleep. However, the danger arises with the trend of mouth taping in those individuals who sleep with their mouths open when baseline nasal obstruction or nasal pathology is an underlying reason. Lee at al., also mention in their discussion that mouth taping is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe OSA as it may impose dangers rather than benefits in these groups of patients [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Huang et al. 2015, also discuss that the safety or efficacy of oral occlusion/taping cannot be elucidated from their study given the single small institution case series without a control group [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>With respect to risks of mouth taping, there was explicit discussion in four out of ten of the studies indicating that oral occlusion either through taping, sealing, or chin strapping could pose a serious risk of asphyxiation in the presence of nasal obstruction or regurgitation (<xref rid="pone.0323643.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, the social media phenomena of mouth taping as a means to stop mouth breathing would seem to be guided by poor evidence and can even lead to risk of detrimental effects in individuals with serious nasal obstruction as a cause of oral breathing.</p><p>Other primary outcomes measured by three different studies were anatomic measurements by Madeiro et al., Bachour et al., and Huang et al. All three studies demonstrated that with ceasing oral breathing, oropharynx spacing increased significantly [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These findings align with the study by Hsu et al. 2021, who assessed patients undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) and saw that oral breathing was associated with a higher degree and prevalence of lateral pharyngeal and tongue base collapse [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hsu et al. 2021, theorize that the mechanism behind this is three part &#x02013; the first arm is the association of mouth breathing and higher upper airway resistance compared to nasal breathing, leading to increased obstructive apneas and hypoapneas [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The second arm is that mouth breathing decreases airway mucosa moisture and increases oropharyngeal wall surface tension causing difficulty reopening the upper airway [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The third arm is that nasal breathing activates nasal receptors that maintain spontaneous ventilation and oropharyngeal muscle tone which is also important for genioglossal activity [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, both Bachour et al., and Huang et al. used cephalometric radiography in awake patients lying supine for their anatomical measurements [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Madiero et al. was the only study that assessed the oropharynx anatomy while patients were asleep using a pediatric bronchoscope [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Yang et al., similarly, studied patients with OSA undergoing DISE to assess total inspiratory flow in open and closed mouth settings [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Their group looked at 54 patients with a median AHI of 26.9 and median BMI of 28.9. Their study found that for their 32 patients with moderate levels of mouth breathing (oral airflow equating to 0.05&#x02013;2.20&#x02009;L/min), mouth closure increased inspiratory airflow by 2.0L/min. For their 10 patients with near-zero mouth breathing (&#x0003c;0.05&#x02009;L/min), mouth closure had no significant change to inspiratory airflow (0.9&#x02009;L/min). For their 12 patients with high levels of mouth breathing (&#x0003e;2.2&#x02009;L/min), mouth closure was actually detrimental and decreased airflow by -1.86&#x02009;L/min [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. When assessing the anatomy of patients, upstream collapse was associated with greater mouth breathing and a negative response to mouth closure, especially with anteroposterior velum/soft palate collapse and concentric soft palate collapse [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These findings again seem to corroborate with the findings with Madeiro et al., Bachour et al., that oropharynx spacing and airflow volume increases when the mouth is closed during sleep [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, Azarbarzin et al., were able to demonstrate in individuals with OSA, palatal prolapse into the velo/nasopharynx and causing expiratory flow limitation and a compensatory shunting of airflow through the mouth [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Taken all together, this could provide additional explanation as to why the mouth puffing phenomenon was found in the two studies by Jau et al., and that those with palatal collapse/prolapse would not benefit from mouth taping [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, for specific patient populations there is upstream or soft palate obstruction, mouth taping would appear to be an ineffective treatment. Additionally, Yang et al., have shown that for certain patients, namely those with high baseline mouth breathing during sleep and palatal obstruction, there are detrimental effects with forced mouth closure and that forced mouth closure during sleep is not universally beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0323643.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The major limitations of our study include the heterogeneity of our studies, the poor quality of data based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the limited number of studies. While we tried to make meaningful interpretations and conclusions with the small number of studies, it remains a fact that the results were very heterogenous and unfortunately statistical analysis could not be performed. Therefore, there needs to be more studies and higher quality studies to provide conclusive evidence of the safety and efficacy of this practice.</p><p>Overall, the summative data from the identified studies of this systematic review do not lend strong support to the idea of utilizing mouth taping or other occlusive devices for the improvement of OSA. All studies were of poor quality for different reasons as per the Newcastle-Ottawa assessment scale. Therefore, taking all the data together, there does seem to be a very specific use-case scenario in patient population where OSA is mild that mouth taping or occlusion may improve AHI. However, in other patient populations with nasal obstruction as a cause of mouth breathing or more severe forms of OSA, there is little evidence to support any clinical benefit for this practice. Moreover, the data identifies potential risk associated with the practice of oral occlusion for mouth breathing, SBD, or OSA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This systematic review reviewed 10 studies looking into different forms of oral occlusion in the setting of OSA or mouth breathing. Some studies report very minor improvement in certain outcomes such as AHI, ODI, and snoring index. However, the evidence for mouth taping as a treatment modality for mouth breathing, OSA, or SDB is minimal in most patient population groups outside of mild OSA, and not clinically signficiant. Moreover, there are potential serious detrimental health outcomes to those with nasal obstruction who seek oral taping as means to ameliorate their mouth breathing, OSA, or SDB during sleep. The existing data does not support mouth taping or oral occlusion as a sound clinical intervention for the general population with sleep disordered breathing.</p></sec><sec id="sec012" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323643.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Search strategy utilized for the systematic review.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323643.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323643.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jau</surname><given-names>J-Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kuo</surname><given-names>TBJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>LPH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>T-Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>C-T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>P-H</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Mouth puffing phenomena of patients with obstructive sleep apnea when mouth-taped: device&#x02019;s efficacy confirmed with physical video observation</article-title>. <source>Sleep Breath</source>. <year>2023</year>;<volume>27</volume>:<fpage>153</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>64</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s11325-022-02588-0</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">35277783</pub-id>

The study adopts a robust methodological framework adhering to PRISMA guidelines and includes a systematic review of ten studies encompassing 213 patients. Despite the rigorous approach, the findings are notably heterogeneous, with limited clinical significance and potential risks outweighing benefits. While two studies showed statistically significant improvements in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or oxygen desaturation metrics, others either failed to demonstrate meaningful changes or highlighted risks such as asphyxiation in the presence of nasal obstructions. Notably, the article underscores the poor quality of existing research, as evaluated through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, which flags significant limitations in study designs and potential biases. Moreover, the exclusion of participants with nasal obstructions or severe OSA in most studies raises questions about the generalizability of the results, particularly when the practice is being marketed to a broader audience on social media. This comprehensive review highlights the lack of substantial evidence supporting the clinical utility of mouth taping for obstructive sleep apnea or mouth breathing and calls for cautious interpretation of results, advocating further high-quality research to evaluate its safety and efficacy thoroughly. The authors effectively dismantle the unfounded claims of social media trends, emphasizing the potential dangers of unregulated practices in sleep therapy, but the study's conclusions are hindered by the limited scope and quality of the available data, necessitating a cautious approach toward its recommendations.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This study is well-written but unfortunately I was not able to review all the tables that was mentioned in the manuscript and I think the tables are important since this is a systematic review hence will need to have a summary of all the studies that were included.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Review Comments</p><p>Summary</p><p>This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of mouth taping for addressing mouth breathing, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It explores a growing trend popularized on social media and synthesizes the available evidence on its potential risks and benefits. While the review highlights critical concerns and provides valuable insights into current research, there are limitations in comparative insights, heterogeneity of included studies, and consideration of recent key publications.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The manuscript has several notable strengths. First, it addresses a timely and highly relevant public health concern by analyzing the safety and efficacy of mouth taping, a practice that has gained widespread popularity despite the lack of substantial scientific validation. Second, the authors have employed a systematic methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines and utilizing a structured, librarian-assisted search strategy. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of both indexed and non-indexed studies, enhancing the methodological rigor of the review. Third, the manuscript effectively highlights potential risks, such as asphyxiation and complications in individuals with nasal obstruction, which is a critical clinical consideration for practitioners who may encounter patient inquiries about this intervention. Lastly, the use of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the included studies provides readers with a clear understanding of the quality and limitations of the evidence, further strengthening the manuscript's overall credibility..</p><p>Major concerns</p><p>C1. Lack of Comparative Insights:</p><p>The review misses the opportunity to compare its findings with recent studies, such as the JAMA Otolaryngology paper (Mouth Closure and Airflow in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Nonrandomized Clinical Trial). This study provides critical insights into how mouth closure influences airflow and sleep outcomes in controlled settings. Integrating these findings would enhance the depth and relevance of the discussion.</p><p>C2. Heterogeneity in Included Studies:</p><p>The studies included in the review vary widely in methodology, patient populations, and outcome measures. While this is noted, the conclusion that mouth taping is ineffective is not fully justified given this heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses or meta-analytical techniques could offer more nuanced conclusions. For example, Studies showing significant AHI reductions primarily included patients with mild OSA (baseline AHI &#x0003c; 15), such as:</p><p>o Lee et al.: Baseline AHI = 8.3, reduced to 4.7.</p><p>o Huang et al.: Baseline AHI = 12, reduced to 7.8.</p><p>These results suggest that mouth taping may be effective for mild OSA but less so for moderate-to-severe cases. The review should emphasize this distinction and explore other studies' baseline characteristics to better contextualize the findings.</p><p>C3. Recent Research Not Included:</p><p>Recent studies, such as the Harvard group's work on rostral airway obstruction and its influence on mouth taping efficacy, could significantly enhance the review (JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2024;150(11):1012-1019. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2024.3319). Including these findings would position the manuscript as a landmark paper in this field, reframing mouth taping as a targeted intervention rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>Comments on the Results Presentation</p><p>The manuscript mentions: Jau et al. This group assessed and validated a &#x0201c;mouth puffing&#x0201d; device while patients&#x02019; mouths were taped. Jau et al. define mouth puffing as a derivation of mouth breathing while patients&#x02019; mouths are occluded with tape. As such, they utilized accelerometers on the sides of both cheeks to detect the mouth puffing phenomenon while patients&#x02019; mouths were occluded with tape1. They found that AHI was significantly reduced in individuals who had no mouth puffing compared to both side or complete mouth puffing</p><p>C4. In relation to the manuscript, could it be that "mouth puffing," as described by Jau et al., actually represents patients with palatal prolapse and expiratory flow limitation?</p><p>The manuscript mentions: Arousal index was assessed by Osman et al. Patients in the novel spray plus tape group compared to placebo had a significantly reduced arousal index with reduced events per hour.</p><p>C5. This outcome could potentially reflect the effect of mouth taping; however, given that this is a drug study, it seems more likely that the drug itself had a greater impact on the results. Wouldn&#x02019;t this interpretation be more consistent with the study design?</p><p>The manuscript mentions: Bhat et al. also demonstrated that REM sleep percentage was significantly lower with patients using chinstraps compared to those on optimal CPAP12. Total sleep time was also significantly lower with chinstrap compared to patients during their diagnostic PSG study12 The cited reduction in REM sleep percentage and total sleep time (TST) with chin straps should be interpreted cautiously, as the original study only used chin straps for the first two hours of a split-night PSG protocol:</p><p>C3. The original Bhat study explicitly states: "Polysomnogram [PSG] underwent a modified split-night PSG, using only a chinstrap for the first 2 hours of sleep, followed by CPAP titration for the remainder of the night." This indicates that the diagnostic PSG was conducted as a full-night study, while the chinstrap was only used during the first 2 hours of the CPAP titration night. Given this setup, wouldn't it be inevitable for the total sleep time (TST) to be shorter during the chinstrap period and, consequently, the REM sleep percentage to differ?</p><p>Comments on the Discussion section</p><p>The manuscript mentions: Lee et al., Huang et al., and Labarca et al. were three of the six studies showing a level of reduction in AHI with oral occluding devices2,4,10. However, when looking closer into these studies, Lee et al. and Huang et al. only included individuals with AHIs of less than 152,4. The classification varies between studies, however, classically, an AHI of 5-15 is considered mild OSA18. The AHI improvement in the study by Lee et al. was 8.3 to 4.7 (mild to borderline mild), and 12 to 7.8 in the study by Huang et al (mild to persistently mild). With the criticism of AHI as a marker for disease severity in OSA, it is unclear whether these reported significant reductions in AHI are meaningful clinically20,21.</p><p>C4. As the authors demonstrated in the primary outcome section of the results, it cannot be denied that taping statistically lowers AHI in the entire cohort or specific patient subgroups. For instance, the Labarca study states: "A total of 21 participants were included (baseline AHI = 24.3 &#x000b1; 9.9 events/h). The median AHI (interquartile range) in the MAD and MAD + AMT arms were 10.5 (5.4-19.6) events/h and 5.6 (2.2-11.7) events/h (P = 0.02), respectively. A total of 76% of individuals achieved an AHI of &#x0003c;10 events/h in the MAD + AMT arm versus 43% in the MAD arm (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Finally, the observed effect was similar in moderate to severe OSA (AHI &#x02a7e; 15 events/h) in terms of absolute reduction and treatment responders, and AMT alone did not significantly reduce the AHI compared with baseline." This aligns with the authors' point that, in a randomized study, the combination of MAD + mouth tape (AMT) is more effective than MAD alone. This finding clearly demonstrates the effect of AMT in at least certain subgroups.</p><p>Additionally, &#x0201c;Jau et al. assessed and validated a &#x02018;mouth puffing&#x02019; device while patients&#x02019; mouths were taped. Jau et al. define mouth puffing as a derivation of mouth breathing while patients&#x02019; mouths are occluded with tape. As such, they utilized accelerometers on the sides of both cheeks to detect the mouth puffing phenomenon while patients&#x02019; mouths were occluded with tape. They found that AHI was significantly reduced in individuals who had no mouth puffing compared to both side or complete mouth puffing.&#x0201d; This finding also suggests that mouth taping may worsen apnea in specific subgroups, particularly in patients with mouth puffing. Given that individuals with mouth puffing are likely to have palatal prolapse or expiratory flow limitation, wouldn&#x02019;t it be reasonable to interpret this as evidence that mouth taping may be effective in subgroups without these anatomical or physiological features?</p><p>Additionally, considering that MAD and similar interventions are generally effective in patients with mild OSA, wouldn&#x02019;t it be more appropriate to interpret this as evidence of effectiveness in mild patient populations, rather than stating, &#x0201c;it is unclear whether these reported significant reductions in AHI are meaningful clinically&#x0201d;? This perspective aligns better with the observed outcomes.</p><p>The manuscript mentions: The third arm is that nasal breathing activates nasal receptors that maintain spontaneous ventilation and oropharyngeal muscle tone which is also important for genioglossal activity22.</p><p>C5. his section's reference should be clarified, as reference 22 appears to be related to DISE and not to nasal receptors as stated. Could you confirm the correct reference for this claim? It is important to ensure the accuracy of cited studies to maintain the validity of the discussion.</p><p>The manuscript mentions: Other primary outcomes measured by three different studies were anatomic measurements by Madeiro et al., Bachour et al., and Huang et al.. All three studies demonstrated that with ceasing oral breathing, oropharynx spacing increased significantly2,14,15. These findings align with the study by Hsu et al. 2021, who assessed patients undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy and saw that oral breathing was associated with a higher degree and prevalence of lateral pharyngeal and tongue base collapse22. Hsu et al. 2021, theorize that the mechanism behind this is three part &#x02013; the first arm is the association of mouth breathing and higher upper airway resistance compared to nasal breathing, leading to increased obstructive apneas and hypoapneas24. The second arm is that mouth breathing decreases airway mucosa moisture and increases oropharyngeal wall surface tension causing difficulty reopening the upper airway25. The third arm is that nasal breathing activates nasal receptors that maintain spontaneous ventilation and oropharyngeal muscle tone which is also important for genioglossal activity22. However, both Bachour et al., and Huang et al. used cephalometric radiography in awake patients lying supine for their anatomical measurements2,14. Madiero et al. was the only study that assessed the oropharynx anatomy while patients were asleep using a pediatric bronchoscope15.</p><p>C6. The conclusion in this section requires further consideration. For example, &#x0201c;Hsu et al. 2021, who assessed patients undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy and saw that oral breathing was associated with a higher degree and prevalence of lateral pharyngeal and tongue base collapse&#x0201d; suggests that mouth closure may have anatomical benefits. While this conclusion itself could be subject to error, it does not indicate negative effects of mouth taping. Moreover, the positive effects of mouth taping, as identified in references 2, 4, and 15, cannot be dismissed based on this evidence.</p><p>This section would benefit from a different approach. For instance, focusing on identifying subgroups of patients who benefit from mouth taping versus those who do not could lead to a more robust and clinically meaningful conclusion. Such an approach could significantly enhance the quality and relevance of the manuscript.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The authors have conducted a thorough and systematic analysis of the relevant data, and I agree with their observation that there is no definitive evidence supporting the efficacy of mouth taping. However, based on the authors' analysis, it seems more accurate to conclude that the effects of mouth taping are inconsistent rather than absent.</p><p>To make this manuscript more impactful, shifting the focus from merely evaluating the overall efficacy of mouth taping to other aspects might be beneficial. For example, the authors could consider summarizing the varying effects of mouth taping, proposing potential indication groups, or systematically discussing the Potential Complications outlined in Table 2. Such an approach could provide more clinical relevance and guidance, enhancing the manuscript&#x02019;s contribution to the field.</p><p>Final Recommendation</p><p>Major Revisions.</p><p>This manuscript has potential but requires significant revisions to incorporate recent research, refine its conclusions, and provide actionable guidance for clinicians. By addressing these issues, the manuscript could become a key resource in discussing mouth taping and related interventions for OSA.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

The revisions have strengthened the manuscript, but there are several points that require further clarification and modifications. Below are my comments on the revised version:</p><p>C2. Heterogeneity in Included Studies</p><p>The heterogeneity of the included studies remains a crucial factor in interpreting the findings. I strongly recommend that this be explicitly addressed in the limitations section of the manuscript to ensure transparency regarding the variability across studies.</p><p>C4. Expiratory Flow Limitation and Palatal Prolapse</p><p>It would be beneficial to mention the potential role of expiratory flow limitation and palatal prolapse in interpreting the results. This could provide further insight into why mouth puffing occurs and why certain patient populations may not benefit from mouth taping.</p><p>Page 13: Correction of Mild OSA Definition</p><p>The statement on Page 13 currently reads:</p><p>"When looking into the patient subgroup with mild OSA (defined by AHI &#x0003e;15), utilization of MAD or MAD plus mouth taping did show significant reduction of AHI."</p><p>However, mild OSA is classically defined as AHI &#x0003c;15, not AHI &#x0003e;15. This should be corrected to:</p><p>"Mild OSA (defined by AHI &#x0003c;15)"</p><p>C4 (Page 16): Misinterpretation of Palatal Obstruction and Mouth Taping Effectiveness</p><p>The authors state:</p><p>"Therefore, for specific patient populations where AHI is mild and there is limited upstream or soft palate obstruction, there does seem to be a potential for benefit. However, interestingly, Yang et al., have shown that for certain patients, namely those with high baseline mouth breathing during sleep, there are detrimental effects with forced mouth closure and that forced mouth closure during sleep is not universally beneficial."</p><p>However, this interpretation needs correction based on the anatomical and physiological context:</p><p>&#x02022; Mouth puffing is strongly associated with palatal prolapse, which leads to expiratory flow limitation. This means that mouth puffing occurs when there is palatal airway obstruction during exhalation.</p><p>&#x02022; Patients with palatal prolapse typically have a longer palate, leading to palatal anteroposterior (AP) obstruction.</p><p>&#x02022; Yang et al.'s study also demonstrated that patients with palatal obstruction do not benefit from mouth taping.</p><p>Thus, the findings from both studies are actually consistent, showing that patients with upper airway (palatal) obstruction do not respond well to mouth taping.</p><p>Critical Error on Page 16:</p><p>&#x02022; The phrase "limited upstream or soft palate obstruction" suggests that mouth taping is beneficial for such patients, which is incorrect.</p><p>&#x02022; The correct interpretation is that mouth taping is ineffective in patients with significant upstream or soft palate obstruction.</p><p>&#x02022; This is a critical error that must be corrected.</p><p>C5. Validity of Referencing Non-Empirical Discussion Points</p><p>&#x02022; If the statement in C5 is not based on direct research findings but rather reflects the authors' interpretation in the discussion, then citing it as a reference must be reconsidered.</p><p>&#x02022; Discussion-based opinions from the original study authors should not be treated as empirical evidence.</p><p>&#x02022; Please ensure that references used are derived from actual study findings rather than speculative discussion points.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The revised manuscript has improved, but several point should be addressed to ensure the accuracy and scientific integrity of the findings.</p><p>Key revisions needed:</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f06c; --> Address study heterogeneity in the limitations section</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f06c; --> Correct the definition of mild OSA (AHI &#x0003c;15) on Page 13</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f06c; --> Revise the interpretation of mouth puffing and palatal prolapse on Page 16</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f06c; --> Correct the misleading statement that "limited upstream or soft palate obstruction" improves with mouth taping</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f06c; --> Re-evaluate the appropriateness of citing discussion-based opinions as references in C5</p><p>Once these changes are made, the manuscript will be in a much stronger position.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
