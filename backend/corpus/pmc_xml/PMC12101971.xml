It is hoped that we can also highlight the key considerations when treatment planning for both root-filled teeth and dental implants.

Making the choice between trying to retain a structurally compromised tooth by way of endodontic (and/or periodontal) and restorative treatment versus extracting the tooth and replacing it requires thorough examination, thoughtful treatment planning and discussion.</p><p>There are many factors, both clinical and patient-centred, to consider when evaluating a compromised tooth. The remaining tooth structure, periodontal support and endodontic status must be assessed. In addition, factors such as the strategic importance of the tooth, its location, occlusal factors, aesthetics and cost must also be considered. Furthermore, the patient's perspective on the treatment processes, as well as the case specifics of alternative options for tooth replacement, will differ for each patient. Taking into account the multitude of considerations, and moreover, communicating this information in a clear way, also brings its own challenges.</p><p>To assist clinicians in evaluating the compromised tooth, several systematic assessment indices have been developed. Tools such as the Restorability Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11754">1</xref></sup> facilitate evaluation of the residual tooth structure, whilst The British Endodontic Society Case Assessment Tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11756">2</xref></sup> can be used to determine the case complexity before endodontic treatment. More holistic evaluation of a tooth can be carried out using indices such as The Dental Practicability Index, which remains the only tool which has been validated by a clinical study, albeit limited to the evaluation of teeth undergoing root canal retreatment (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11759">3</xref></sup> Both indices and tools have been shown to provide helpful guidance to assess tooth prognosis in an objective and tangible way. While the use of tools and indices facilitate a systematic and logical analysis of each case, restorative indices in particular are susceptible to the limitations of accurately quantifying tooth structure loss. Therefore, these indices should never be used in isolation, or to override clinical judgement and experience.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p> The Dental Practicality Index can be used to assess the prognosis of a tooth in four domains: endodontic, periodontal, prosthodontic, and importantly, in context of the patient's medical and dental conditions. Each domain is weighted according to complexity. The total gives an indication of when to treat, refer, or extract a compromised tooth. The index has been validated in clinical research, both with regards to decision making and treatment outcomes. Reproduced with permission from S.

In the maxilla, consideration of the nasopalatine canal and maxillary sinus is imperative.</p><p>With the advent and increasing accessibility of CBCT, digital implant planning and guided surgery, implants can be planned and placed more precisely, thus reducing the risk of anatomical complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11881">56</xref></sup></p><p>In the posterior maxilla, one of the most frequent considerations is the requirement of sinus floor elevation, which increases treatment complexity and cost. The additional procedures may potentially be high-risk in some patients, such as those taking ARDs. When treatment planning in these patients, retention of the compromised root-filled tooth may be deemed preferable.</p><p>Similarly, implant placement in the mandibular second molar site may often risk perforation of the sublingual fossa and/or the inferior alveolar canal, meaning that tooth retention may again be favoured.</p><p>In the above clinical situations, an alternative may be to use short dental implants. These are defined as those less than or equal to 6 mm in length. Short dental implants have been shown to perform only slightly inferiorly than those over 6 mm (96% versus 98%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11883">57</xref></sup> Accurately placing and achieving adequate primary stability can be challenging with shorter implants, but they may provide a viable alternative in cases where a tooth cannot be retained, and the anatomical risks are also high.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Aesthetic considerations</title><p>One of the most challenging aspects of implant treatment is achieving a good aesthetic outcome, and particularly, a natural soft tissue architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11886">58</xref></sup> The goal is to achieve a harmonious and scalloped profile of the peri-implant mucosa, sufficient thickness of buccal mucosa and intact papillae.</p><p>When a tooth is lost, it is well-established that alveolar ridge resorption occurs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11888">59</xref></sup> and this is more pronounced in sites where the buccal plate is thinnest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11890">60</xref></sup> as a greater proportion of the bone is comprised of bundle bone (the alveolar bone that receives the periodontal ligament fibres, referred to as Sharpey's fibres). This resorption leads to a loss of contour of the soft tissues and although sufficient bone volume may remain to receive an implant, the aesthetic outcome can be compromised.</p><p>Thin and scalloped gingival phenotypes also pose further difficulties, as they are more susceptible to recession and/or translucency, thus risking discolouration from the underlying implant hardware.</p><p>In addition to accurate, prosthetically driven implant placement, various well-documented strategies have been proposed to overcome these aesthetic issues, including guided bone regeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11894">61</xref></sup> soft tissue augmentation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11896">62</xref></sup> immediate implant placement and socket shield, sometimes performed in combination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11898">63</xref></sup> All of these protocols add additional complexity, cost and risk of complications to the course of treatment.</p><p>When replacing adjacent teeth, the soft tissue challenges are even greater, as more pronounced bone loss occurs and obtaining an optimal aesthetic result can be technically difficult.</p><p>The huge benefit of retaining a tooth is that it permits preservation of the osseous and associated soft tissue morphology. In highly challenging aesthetic cases, such as patients with a high smile line, a clinician may prefer to retain teeth to avoid adjacent implants or retain a root which can be submerged to create an aesthetically pleasing ridge contour for a pontic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11900">64</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Occlusal considerations</title><p>As implant occlusal failures are often mechanical in nature, exacerbated by the lack of a periodontal ligament, this makes the application of conventional occlusal principles challenging. Most of the data in relation to implant occlusion relies upon principles of engineering, clinical judgement and recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11902">65</xref></sup></p><p>As with natural teeth, parafunction is a significant factor leading to complications of implant prosthesis (<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11905">66</xref></sup> Furthermore, it can lead to failure of integration in cases that are immediately loaded if the occlusion is not carefully managed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11907">67</xref></sup> The presence of a parafunctional habit is an important predisposing factor for the failure of implant treatment as there is an increased risk of prosthesis fracture, with statistically significantly higher rates of mechanical and technical complications found in those exhibiting a parafunctional habit (60%) compared with those who do not (17%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11909">68</xref></sup><fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p> a) This patient presented with a loose implant crown in the right mandibular first molar site.

The primary diagnostic features are bleeding on probing, which may be accompanied by increased probing depths, resulting from swelling, rather than bone loss.

However, as discussed previously, it is imperative that the criteria used to evaluate both treatment modalities are similar, in order to make the conclusions meaningful. Furthermore, it is also essential to consider: a) that implant outcome studies, or for that matter, comparative studies, rarely, if ever, consider the need for preparatory surgery, such as grafting in the evaluation; and b) that there is a hugely different perspective when retaining a natural tooth as opposed to removing it and essentially &#x02018;starting from scratch'. Patients may have an overriding desire to retain their own tooth rather than having an &#x02018;artificial' replacement and will often consider heroic measures to maintain their natural dentition. For some patients, dental implant treatment may not be feasible for either medical, clinical or financial reasons. Therefore, when quoting success and/or survival rates to patients, these must be contextualised with respect to the specific case being treated, as they may be largely irrelevant for some patients.</p><p>Systematic reviews have compared both the success and survival of root-filled teeth and dental implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11913">70</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11917">71</xref></sup> The findings of these are variable and appear to be related to the chosen success/survival criteria and the observation period. Equivocal outcomes for natural teeth and implants have been reported by several authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11913">70</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11919">72</xref></sup> At 72 months there was no significant difference in survival rates, with both treatment modalities also having high success rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11919">72</xref></sup> However, a retrospective study of clinical records by Chatzopoulos <italic>et al</italic>. suggested superior outcomes for dental implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11917">71</xref></sup> Based purely on survival, and without analysis of non-terminal complications, root-filled teeth were shown to have a 72.7% survival rate after 77 months which was significantly lower (p &#x0003c;0.001) than that for implant treatment. Interestingly, in this analysis of over 13,000 patients, only increasing age and anxiety towards dental treatment were highlighted as risk factors, and this applied to both root-filled teeth and dental implants. It is important to acknowledge that the majority of implant failures occurred in the first year following placement (58.8%). However, the comparison of implant and root-filled tooth survival in this study is highly questionable. Firstly, the Multivariable Cox Regression Model does not record any clinically relevant factors, such as oral hygiene, periodontal disease, caries activity, bruxism, or carious/non-carious tooth structure failure (<xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>). Secondly, implants were placed by residents or faculty members, presumably in carefully selected cases, whereas endodontic treatment was undertaken by dental undergraduate students, presumably in much less carefully selected cases, as indicated by the significantly higher number of root-filled teeth included in the study (8,915 versus 4,519 implants). A matched comparison of root-filled teeth and dental implants which included relevant clinical factors would likely have yielded different results. Case selection bias is a major problem in most studies comparing the survival and success of root filled teeth and dental implants. For example, single-unit dental implants are rarely placed to replace second molars, whereas all survival studies on root-filled teeth include large numbers of second molars, which, as discussed previously, are well-known to be associated with the lowest survival rate compared to other tooth types.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption><p> Recurrent caries and a deep crack have contributed to the failure of this compromised root-filled maxillary left first premolar tooth.

Albeit far less prevalent than for single-tooth implants, biological complications were the primary cause of early failures in root-filled teeth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11923">74</xref></sup></p><p>With specific regards to root canal retreatment when compared to dental implant treatment, there is a lack of research. However, one small randomised controlled trial with a three-year follow-up found no difference in the survival of teeth having undergone root canal retreatment and single-tooth implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11925">75</xref></sup> It was also found that it took significantly more days (191 days), to complete the implant rehabilitation compared with the treatment of a root-filled tooth (61 days). However, the chair time was much greater for endodontic-restorative procedures than for implant treatment (629 versus 326 minutes). At the three-year follow-up, the soft tissue aesthetics were superior for root-filled teeth than they were for dental implants.</p><p>Systematic reviews have also attempted to compare the outcomes for root canal treatment, retreatment, root-end surgery and dental implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11928">76</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11930">77</xref></sup> Both reviews identified favourable outcomes for root canal treatment, retreatment and dental implants. However, root-end surgery was found to have inferior outcomes in both analyses. Elemam and Pretty published survival rates of 86.02% for root canal treatment, 78.2% for root canal retreatment, 63.4% for root-end surgery and 90.9% for dental implant treatment with an observation period of 6.7-8.7 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11928">76</xref></sup> However, it should be acknowledged that one of the included studies in relation to root-end surgery had a success rate of only 27.84% as the treatment was not carried out using contemporary microsurgical techniques; this significantly lowered the survival rate of this treatment modality and the results are not consistent with the high success rates observed in numerous studies where microsurgical techniques have been used. In a further review, there were no considerable differences in survival rates for all four treatment modalities when observing outcomes up to ten years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11932">78</xref></sup> However, it was noted that single tooth dental implants had slightly superior outcomes which became more evident after ten years of follow-up.</p><p>In a recent systematic review comparing the survival of root-filled teeth (after both initial and secondary treatment) with that of dental implants, three studies reported comparable survival rates for both modalities over the first three years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11934">79</xref></sup> However, after three years, the survival rate of root-filled teeth decreased, with a higher failure rate compared to implant-supported restorations. The findings of the review were associated with the inclusion criteria from two studies which included teeth which had undergone all types of endodontic procedures (primary treatment, retreatment and root-end surgery). In addition, teeth with and without definitive cuspal coverage restorations were also included. Root-filled teeth that did not receive cuspal coverage had earlier failures compared with those that did. Interestingly, three included studies reported lower survival rates for implant-supported prostheses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, there is a lack of long-term prospective data comparing the success and survival of root-filled teeth and dental implants. With careful planning and well executed treatment, both options offer favourable long-term outcomes. Decision-making for the compromised tooth should be based on consideration of both non-clinical and clinical factors. Often, there is no &#x02018;ideal' treatment option and both root-filled teeth and dental implants can fail both biologically and biomechanically. Occlusal and non-occlusal forces are an important factor contributing to the failure of both treatment modalities and should be carefully assessed during both planning and management.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed equally to this review article with respect to conceptualisation, research, writing, revising and approving the final version of the manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>This study used third party data which has either been made available under licence that the author does not have permission to share, or is available from the relevant corresponding authors (as per the citations) upon reasonable request.
