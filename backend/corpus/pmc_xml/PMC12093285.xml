Due to the rapid spread globally of COVID&#x02010;19, significant policy changes were put in place, including the restriction on visitors to patients in hospital. Evidence has emerged demonstrating the negative impact of these restrictions on patients with COVID&#x02010;19, their families and the staff caring for them. However, there is limited data about the impact of these restrictions in the non&#x02010;COVID ICU environment.</p></sec><sec id="nicc13186-sec-1002"><title>Aim</title><p>This study aimed to explore the experiences of staff caring for non&#x02010;COVID&#x02010;19 patients in a cardiothoracic critical care unit during the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="nicc13186-sec-1003"><title>Study Design</title><p>This qualitative research study adopted a grounded theory methodological approach. This methodology was used due to the unique situation, with no prior research available. We recruited healthcare staff that worked in a cardiothoracic critical care unit during the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic. Semi structured interviews were carried out, transcribed, and analysed. Using the data collected, a theory was constructed.</p></sec><sec id="nicc13186-sec-1004"><title>Results</title><p>Interviews were carried out with 20 healthcare staff from a range of professions including nurses, doctors, and allied health professionals. Following data analysis four main categories emerged from the data: impact and implementation of visiting restrictions; the dehumanisation of patients; end&#x02010;of&#x02010;life care and witnessing distress. From these four categories, a theory has emerged suggesting that healthcare staff in a non&#x02010;covid ICU were regularly exposed to potentially moral injurious events, despite being shielded from caring for patients with COVID&#x02010;19.</p></sec><sec id="nicc13186-sec-1005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides a theory that healthcare staff caring for non&#x02010;COVID&#x02010;19 critical care patients during the period of visiting restrictions were exposed to potentially morally injurious events.</p></sec><sec id="nicc13186-sec-1006"><title>Relevance to clinical practice</title><p>Repeated exposure to potentially morally injurious events can lead to the development of moral injury and its adverse consequences.

<sup>6</sup>
</xref> It is understood that visitors are a valuable resource, not only providing psychological support to patients but there is also evidence to suggest that the presence of visitors is associated with other benefits, such as the reduction in the occurrence of delirium in the ICU.<xref rid="nicc13186-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> As such, the near complete absence of family members and visitors was a stark change to the ICU environment.</p><p>Since the implementation of COVID&#x02010;19 visitation policies, research has emerged demonstrating the negative impact these policies have for patients, their families and staff caring for them.<xref rid="nicc13186-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> To date, however, the focus of the evidence base has been on patients admitted with COVID&#x02010;19 and those staff caring for them.

During the research data collection period, this centre predominantly treated patients undergoing elective and non&#x02010;elective cardiothoracic surgical procedures, cardiac transplantion, acute heart failure treatment and out&#x02010;of&#x02010;hospital cardiac arrest care. In addition, some non&#x02010;cardiothoracic surgical patients were also admitted to the unit in this period. This centre was maintained as a &#x02018;COVID light&#x02019; centre throughout the study period; as such, most patients admitted did not have COVID&#x02010;19 as a primary diagnosis.</p><p>All health care staff, including all allied health professionals and clinical support workers, over the age of 18, working in the critical care department during the period of visiting restrictions were invited to take part. Initially, invites were sent out via email by the researchers. Written information was sent out to those who expressed an interest in taking part, and they were given time to read the information and decline participation if they wished. Following this, an initial purposive sampling strategy<xref rid="nicc13186-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> was adopted in order to address the aims of this research. This allowed the researchers to recruit participants from various roles and grades within the multidisciplinary team and invite participants from staff groups which were under&#x02010;represented, ensuring that the study population had diversity of gender, age and profession within it. Although grounded theory adopts theoretical sampling as an approach to recruitment,<xref rid="nicc13186-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> it is widely recognized that purposive sampling is suitable and is a realistic approach at the initial stages of data collection.<xref rid="nicc13186-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>16</sup>
</xref> Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim while field notes were created by the researcher following each interview. Open&#x02010;ended questions were used to enable participants to describe and elaborate on their experiences of caring for patients during the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic. The initial interview guide, found in Appendix&#x000a0;<xref rid="nicc13186-app-0001" ref-type="app">1</xref>, was adapted as data collection progressed. In order to provide data verification, two participants reviewed the transcript of their interviews, confirming they were accurate. Ethical approval was granted to interview 20 participants. This sample was chosen to allow diversity among the participants and ensure a theoretical approach to recruitment could be achieved. As such, not all volunteers&#x000a0;were recruited to the final study population, and this allowed for the data collected to direct which participants should be recruited, allowing a more theoretical approach to sampling to occur; it also had the benefit of ensuring that all professions working clinically during the research period were represented in the study population. Initially, participants from a wide a range of roles and experience were recruited. As data underwent initial coding, the data itself guided further recruitment of participants. This process continued alongside the concurrent analysis of data.<xref rid="nicc13186-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> The researchers (JM and LH) agreed when data saturation had been achieved. Data saturation occurred when no new significant categories emerged from the data.

</xref> coding was carried out in stages. First, initial coding was carried out line by line, and then in larger sections or sentences. This identified subcategories in the data. The second stage of data analysis used focused coding. Memo development and constant comparison of the data occurred simultaneously alongside the coding process. Categories were developed, leading to the construction of the primary grounded theory. Once no new codes were identified from the data, it was felt that data saturation had occurred. In order to maintain an audit trail, field notes were taken, memos were constructed and maintained within a database alongside anonymised supporting quotes.</p><p>The first author (LH) carried out data analysis, with frequent discussions with JMcP, an experienced qualitative researcher aware of the processes involved in grounded theory research, who was familiar with the data.

As guidelines were developed nationally, those implementing the guidance had no influence or insight into policy development. Some participants displayed frustration at the application of this policy, expressing that frontline clinicians should have been allowed a degree of autonomy regarding decision&#x02010;making around visitation.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="nicc13186-blkfxd-0002"><p>I think the clinicians working in the Unit should have more autonomy to make decisions related to the patients and their families, and by that I mean I think the clinicians working in the Unit should be the ones to manage who comes up and when, because I think we're the ones that are looking after these patients. We're the ones that are looking after these families. We're the ones that have to tell them, &#x02018;sorry you can't come up and see your dad who's dying&#x02019;, and I think the burden is on us. <named-content content-type="attribution">[S11]</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>This depiction of the burden placed on health care staff highlights the negative effects visitation policies had on the clinical staff implementing them. The application of policy caused distress. Frontline staff were required to manage and implement policies which often resulted in family anger and distress. This led to challenging situations, and participants displayed guilt about their involvement in implementing the guidelines.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="nicc13186-blkfxd-0003"><p>It has been quite difficult but we're on the front line here and we're the ones that are saying, it's not you know the politicians who are saying no, it's us who are saying no to these people and we're the ones taking the brunt of somebody's anger. <named-content content-type="attribution">[S17]</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>This lack of control with regard to decision&#x02010;making, and the repeated exposure to the anger and distress of relatives when implementing the rules, had the potential to expose health care staff to recurrent distress. Some participants described that senior staff used judgement in the implementation of the guidelines, taking on the burden of the decision&#x02010;making. This often led to an inconsistent approach in their implementation, resulting in other health care staff having to deal with the repercussions of the previous decisions made by others. This caused further stress.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="nicc13186-blkfxd-0004"><p>I say, &#x0201c;Well yes okay I'll let somebody in and this is what's to happen,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Well there was two allowed in last week, and you only let one in, why you only let one in?&#x0201d; Because that's the latest rules and two probably shouldn't have been in but then I wasn't there so I can't see why that decision was made at that time.

</p><p>Participants interviewed also described that there was a perceived increased workload because of the absence of visitors. Participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) discussed the increased time spent speaking with families on the telephone; it was recognized that this impacted nursing staff most.

</p><p>Participants described the impact of visitation restrictions on isolation. Isolation was not just experienced by health care staff; participants discussed their experiences witnessing the effects of isolation on both patients and their relatives. Physical barriers increased both health care staff and patients' exposure to isolation: these included the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) as a barrier.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="nicc13186-blkfxd-0006"><p>A lot of people feel even if you have that on that you can't you know hold somebody's hand&#x02026; it is very difficult and some people are feeling it is a big barrier to them to actually physically sit down and hold somebody's hand and you know touch their arm and things like that. <named-content content-type="attribution">[S17]</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>This highlights the difficulty in providing comfort to patients not solely based on the requirement for PPE, but also a mental barrier to providing comfort to patients.

Families play a pivotal role in providing background to the patient as a person before their critical illness. Participants highlighted that they understood the patient's clinical needs intimately, but non&#x02010;clinical information about the patients was lost, with an ultimate loss of human connection.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="nicc13186-blkfxd-0007"><p>So it's just kind of, it's not being able to put more, you're almost treating the body rather than the mind as well because sometimes if they're intubated or they're just starting to become alert or they're delirious, you don't really know what their, their sort of thought processes are, what their values are &#x02026; <named-content content-type="attribution">[S09]</named-content>

</p><p>This loss of human connection had further implications for the participants.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>This highlights the importance of speaking face to face with relatives and also plays a part in the staff's perceived value in the care of patients.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Across the interviews, there were clear signs of distress when participants discussed EoL care. It was acknowledged that although restrictions were in place, a concerted effort was made to allow families to be present if death was felt to be imminent. Participants recognized that EoL is not a clearly defined period for patients, and this led to staff allowing visiting, but with uncertainty as to whether these visits complied with the approved visiting exemptions. This uncertainty in decision&#x02010;making caused anxiety for staff.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="nicc13186-blkfxd-0013"><p>I think because there was sometimes uncertainty what, we didn't know what was quite going to happen and we thought it was important that they got a chance to see their partner&#x02026;to see their loved one, because we didn't know if they were going to recover or not and I don't know if that was strictly within the rules. <named-content content-type="attribution">[S08]</named-content>

</p><p>This exposure to the substantial distress by families and lack of ability to alleviate the distress to the family was a burden placed on the staff involved.</p><p>Conversations between health care staff and family were difficult during the EoL period.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Conflict between the wishes of relatives, representing potentially those of the patient, and the wishes of the health care team arose on occasion.

So I found that quite difficult&#x02026; not knowing this was going to end, knowing her family consistently saying, she would not want this. And we were still going on.

There's a couple of patients who I definitely feel should have had family visits. And I feel ethically actually I think it's wrong. And that does have an impact on yourself because you feel kind of empathy for the patient. You feel sad for the patient that they've not got that support.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>This need to provide extra support to patients increased the toll on staff. Some participants attempted to alleviate the distress of patient isolation, often taking on the role of a family member; however, other participants acknowledged that was a role that was not only challenging to undertake but potentially not achievable as health care staff should not take on the role of the family member.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="nicc13186-blkfxd-0020"><p>I think that's particularly difficult for staff. And if you've got somebody who is really sick, it would be nice to know if they can hear what's going on, that their wife is just talking to them. And just holding their hand.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The fear of making mistakes when updating families and the implications of this was apparent in the data.</p><p>There was an acknowledgement that there was an increased burden placed on health care staff because of visiting restrictions.

PMIEs were not constrained to only the &#x02018;witnessing distress&#x02019; category but weaved throughout the other categories in the data. An example of this was the distress witnessed by participants when discussing EoL care provisions.

However, there are also several limitations to this study. First, this is a single&#x02010;centre study in a tertiary care centre; therefore, the experiences described here may not be representative of all centres caring for non&#x02010;COVID&#x02010;19 patients as experiences may have differed. The sampling method adopted may have added potential for bias as participants self&#x02010;selected for inclusion in the study.

</xref> rather than a holistic approach across the spectrum of sequelae. Future work should investigate strategies that prevent moral injury as well as manging its manifestation. This is likely to require a tailored approach that recognizes individual coping.

</p><p>The data collected in this study provide a theory that health care staff caring for non&#x02010;COVID&#x02010;19 critical care patients during the period of visiting restrictions were exposed to PMIEs. Repeated exposure to PMIEs has the potential to lead to the development of moral injury and its adverse consequences. Priority should be placed on supporting all staff in the post&#x02010;pandemic era; this should include prioritizing research into the management of moral injury. Together with this, organizations should implement strategies to help reduce exposure to PMIEs in the future.</p></sec><sec id="nicc13186-sec-0030"><title>FUNDING INFORMATION</title><p>LH was funded through a Royal College of Nursing Foundation (UK) bursary and JM was funded through The Healthcare Improvement Studies Institute Fellowship, University of Cambridge (PD&#x02010;2019&#x02010;02&#x02010;16).</p></sec><sec id="nicc13186-sec-0031"><title>ETHICS STATEMENT</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Yorkshire &#x00026; The Humber &#x02013; South Yorkshire Research Ethics Committee (20/YH/0236) prior to recruitment.
