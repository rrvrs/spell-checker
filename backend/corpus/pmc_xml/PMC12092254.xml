The study also examined the influence of medication use, particularly antidepressants and/or anxiolytics, classified through the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System, on the gut microbiota. Both 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S) and shallow shotgun sequencing (WGS) were performed on DNA extracted from 666 fecal samples from the Tulsa-1000 and Neurocomputational Mechanisms of Affiliation and Personality Study Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (NeuroMAP CoBRE) cohorts. The results highlight the significant influence of medication use; antidepressant use is associated with significant differences in gut microbiota beta diversity and has a larger effect size than NPD diagnosis. Next, specific microbes were associated with ANXD and MDD, highlighting their potential for non-pharmacological intervention. Finally, the study demonstrated the capability of Random Forest classifiers to predict diagnoses of NPD and medication use from microbial profiles, suggesting a promising direction for the use of gut microbiota as biomarkers for NPD. Though the effect sizes were larger in females than males, similar trends emerged for both sexes. These findings encourage future research on the gut microbiota&#x02019;s role in NPD and its interactions with pharmacological treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Predictive markers</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Psychiatric disorders</kwd><kwd>Genetics</kwd><kwd>Diagnostic markers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute on Aging (U.S. National Institute on Aging)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19AG063744</award-id><award-id>5U19AG063744</award-id><award-id>5U19AG063744</award-id><award-id>5U19AG063744</award-id><award-id>5U19AG063744</award-id><award-id>5U19AG063744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dilmore</surname><given-names>Amanda Hazel</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuplicki</surname><given-names>Rayus</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Ackermann</surname><given-names>Gail</given-names></name><name><surname>Blach</surname><given-names>Colette</given-names></name><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">It has become increasingly clear that peripheral factors such as chemical exposome, diet, gut microbiome and lifestyle can impact brain metabolic heath and contribute to development of neuropsychiatric diseases. Several human cohorts have exhibited disruptions in the gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD), including anxiety disorder (ANXD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), relative to healthy comparison (HC) subjects (reviewed in refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Some of the observational differences in these cohorts have been supported by mechanistic mouse models, which raises the possibility that findings in large cohort studies can be translated into new treatments for ANXD and MDD. Proposed treatments, such as diet alteration or probiotic use, are often less expensive than current first-line treatments, and come with fewer unpleasant side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This prospect of inexpensive, non-invasive treatments for NPD has catalyzed a significant amount of research into the Gut Microbiota-Brain Axis (GMBA) over the last several years. However, there is still a significant gap between these findings and establishing a direct relationship between microbial composition and ANXD or MDD. Despite its high prevalence in both American populations and worldwide, there has been relatively little effort in studying the relationship between ANXD and the gut microbiota. Moreover, existing studies often fail to account for factors such as medication use or diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although more studies have examined the relationship between MDD and the gut microbiota, these studies have similar drawbacks. Many studies have been performed outside the United States, where a larger percentage of participants are treatment-naive or have adhered to a specific treatment regimen for an extended period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, these cohorts often lack the diversity of individuals living in the United States, and have significantly different pharmacological treatment courses.</p><p id="Par3">Medication use, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) antidepressants, is relevant when discussing gut microbiota alterations in ANXD and MDD, as these medications are known to impact gut microbiota composition. However, the changes caused are debated and differ between studies. One study reported that participants using SSRI antidepressants reliably had higher abundances of <italic>Eubacterium ramulus</italic>, but the magnitude of this effect was small compared to differences in the microbiota seen in participants using proton pump inhibitors or metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This effect also appeared to be clustered in individuals using paroxetine, suggesting it could be specific to that particular SSRI. Another study reported a decrease in <italic>Turicibacteraceae</italic> abundance in SSRI-users, which was also supported by a mouse study in which mice were given fluoxetine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The observation that fluoxetine decreases the relative abundance of <italic>Turicibacter sanguinis</italic> is particularly interesting because <italic>T. sanguinis</italic> imports serotonin (5-HT) through an analog of the 5-HT transporter (SERT), which fluoxetine inhibits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, these gut microbiota changes could also influence metabolic pathways.</p><p id="Par4">SSRI use is known to modulate levels of acylcarnitines, amines, lipids, and bile acids (BA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). Specifically, levels of the primary BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) were lower in severely depressed and anxious participants, while levels of secondary BAs produced from CDCA, such as lithocholic acid were significantly higher in these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The high level of bacterially produced secondary bile acids derived from LCA and metabolism of CDCA correlated with anxiety severity. Given that members of the microbiota are known to modulate the bile acid pool, including making previously unknown conjugated bile acids, it is possible that shifts in the gut microbiota could be behind these shifts in the metabolome in ANXD and MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a similar fashion, treatment with citalopram/escitalopram reduced serotonin levels and increased concentrations of indoles, which are known to be associated with microbial cometabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While another study notes that levels of the gut microbiome-derived metabolite indoxyl sulfate are elevated in participants with depression both at baseline and after successful treatment with medications, this does rule out the possibility that other microbially-modified indoles are altered in MDD or ANXD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

For example, one study reports that because a subgroup of participants had microbiota that resembled those of HC after taking escitalopram, their microbiota was returning to normal, even though their predicted functional profiles were significantly different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

While possible that SSRIs modify some taxa of the gut microbiota specifically, particularly those that express SERTs, the conclusion that the entire microbiota trends towards normal is not supported by the relative abundance data reported.

We hypothesized that ANXD and MDD would each be associated with distinct microbiota compositions.

Through rigorous quality control measures, 666 fecal samples from the Tulsa cohort were analyzed: 164 healthy comparison subjects and 502 individuals diagnosed with ANXD, MDD, or both. No significant difference in alpha diversity was found across NPD groups, sex, or medication use. Antidepressant use emerged as a major influence on gut microbiota beta diversity, surpassing the effect size of MDD or ANXD diagnosis and holding across both sexes. Participants taking antidepressants had a higher abundance of a small subset, but not the majority, of microbes that are typically depleted in MDD, highlighting a potential interaction between pharmacological treatments and gut microbiota. Finally, machine learning classifiers were able to label NPD diagnosis, but not medication use, accurately and precisely from microbial profiles, suggesting that it is feasible to use gut microbiota as biomarkers for NPD. Taken together, the study highlights the significant influence of medication use on gut microbial diversity and identifies specific microbes associated with ANXD and MDD, suggesting avenues for non-pharmacological interventions. The findings advocate for further research to explore the role of gut microbiota in NPD and its interaction with pharmacological treatments.</p><p id="Par29">These results support the findings of several other studies that there is a unique microbiota signature associated with ANXD and MDD. For example, the Texas Resilience Against Depression identified a network of microbes that commonly co-occur in participants with MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These signatures are not exclusive to the stool microbiota: another study identified negative associations between the <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> family and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genus with depression symptoms, along with positive associations between the <italic>Desulfovibrionaceae</italic> family and <italic>Clostridiales</italic> Family XIII with anxiety symptoms in the serum microbiota, while another found links between members of the oral microbiota and MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These studies suggest that the GMBA may extend beyond microbes in the gut, indicating the potential existence of unique microbial signatures of ANXD and MDD throughout the body. Consequently, potential biomarkers for these conditions may be available at more easily accessible sites.</p><p id="Par30">Other studies have also examined the interactions between the GMBA and other physiological conditions. For example, <italic>Clostridium</italic> was found to be higher in individuals with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and functional gastrointestinal disease, suggesting that some microbial perturbations could be influenced by changes from other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Similarly, in a study investigating sleep quality, gut microbiota, and metabolome profiles in patients with ANXD and MDD, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> was found to be positively correlated with sleep quality scores. This suggests that particular microbes are depleted in participants with insomnia relative to people with ANXD and MDD but not insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Studies like these support our examination of particular microbes associated with medication use because, while some microbes may be associated with ANXD or MDD overall, there is also a subset of microbes associated with particular phenotypes. The discovery of these associations between microbes and sub-phenotypes may aid in developing precision treatments.</p><p id="Par31">In terms of medication use, one study found that psychotropic medication use decreases the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota in patients with ANXD and MDD, particularly with higher medication doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. While our work does not support this particular finding, this study does support the hypothesis that psychotropic medications alter the microbiota in NPD. This description of microbiota diversity underscores the complexity of the relationship between psychiatric medications and the microbiota, as it does not consider specific taxa. However, work like this does raise the question of whether medication-induced alterations in the microbiota could influence treatment outcomes for NPD. One study addresses the potential for probiotic therapy to augment ANXD and MDD treatments, by supplementing with <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum JYLP-326</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. While this addresses the ability of microbial treatment to manage symptoms of ANXD and MDD, it does not discuss how probiotics may be used in conjunction with other traditional treatments for the conditions, especially since these medications may further alter the microbiota themselves.</p><p id="Par32">However, the sources of GMBA disruption in NPD are poorly characterized. Although several sources report disturbances to the GMBA in ANXD and MDD it is unclear whether these changes are the result of the condition itself, the medications taken for the conditions, or other factors such as diet. Our study tackles this question by identifying in a large cohort of American individuals, specific microbes that are associated with ANXD, MDD, anxiolytic use, and antidepressant use. We used a Bayesian Differential Ranking algorithm that allows us to account for the compositionality of microbiome data and minimize the occurrence of false positives through the careful application of multiple test corrections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">PERMANOVA statistical tests were used to address whether ANXD and MDD were significantly associated with microbiota beta diversity. When both medicated and unmedicated participants were considered, MDD but not ANXD, was significantly associated with microbiota beta diversity but when only unmedicated participants were considered, there was no significant association between either MDD or ANXD and microbiota beta diversity. This suggests that some of the differences in the microbiota between participants with MDD and HC was due to medication-induced microbiota differences. This finding is consistent with some previous studies; when only unmedicated participants were included, there is no significant difference but when medication use is considered, there is a significant difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">We identified biomarkers of ANXD, MDD, anxiolytic use, and antidepressant use and validated them using log ratios. Interestingly, there was a large overlap between microbes associated with ANXD and those associated with MDD. There were 31 microbes credibly associated with both ANXD and MDD, and 31 different microbes credibly associated with HC relative to both ANXD and MDD (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4A, B</xref>). The log ratio constructed from these common microbes was significantly enriched in participants with ANXD (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.83e&#x02212;4), MDD (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.22e&#x02212;7), and both diagnoses (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.10e&#x02212;16) relative to HC; this was also true when only females were examined (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.62e&#x02212;3, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.47e&#x02212;5, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.04e&#x02212;11, respectively), but males only had a significant difference between MDD only (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.33e&#x02212;3) and both diagnoses (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.0e&#x02212;5) relative to HC (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4E</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5A, B</xref>). In participants with both diagnoses relative to MDD only, the enrichment was held regardless of medication use or sex (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>F, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5C, D</xref>). Interestingly, there was only a small overlap between ASVs associated with anxiolytics and antidepressants use (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4C, D</xref>). Despite this small overlap, the log ratio credibly differentiated subjects using both anxiolytics and antidepressants (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>G, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5C, D</xref>). It further differentiated those using both anxiolytics and antidepressants from those only using antidepressants, but only when either the full group or only females were examined (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>G, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5E, F</xref>; see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">S2</xref> for full statistics).</p><p id="Par35">There were minimal overlaps between microbes associated with antidepressants or anxiolytics use and those associated with ANXD or MDD (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). One notable exception is there were twelve microbes that were both significantly associated with antidepressant use and HC (relative to MDD; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2D</xref>). This observation is somewhat consistent with previous reports that taking medications for ANXD and/or MDD returns the gut microbiota to a &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, given that there are several more microbes that are unique to participants using antidepressants, a more parsimonious explanation may be that antidepressant use restores levels of some microbes that are depleted due to MDD. There is still a large number of microbes that are depleted after antidepressant use, including several that are not depleted due to MDD alone. However, given the difference in MDD and ANXD log ratio observed between unmedicated males and females with both conditions in Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>C, D and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2C, D</xref>, it is possible that sex also plays into this relationship. Overall, this suggests that microbes, or microbiota-altering interventions (such as dietary interventions) could be used in tandem with medication use to restore microbes depleted by both MDD itself and antidepressants.</p><p id="Par36">This study notably also identifies microbes characteristic of ANXD that can distinguish not only between participants with ANXD and HC but also participants with both ANXD and MDD and participants with MDD alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). This is significant as there has been considerably less research on the GMBA in ANXD compared to the GMBA in MDD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. However, the ANXD analysis is constrained by the fact that the American Gut cohort cannot be used as a validation cohort because no information was collected on ANXD diagnoses. Further primary literature on changes in the gut microbiome in response to ANXD is needed.</p><p id="Par37">The interplay between ANXD, MDD, lifestyle factors, and the microbiota highlights a complex network of interactions that underscore the multifaceted nature of NPDs. ANXD and MDD often coexist, suggesting a shared pathophysiological pathway that may be influenced by the gut microbiota. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, stress levels, and sleep patterns further modulate this relationship, potentially altering the gut microbial composition and its metabolic outputs, which in turn can affect brain function and emotional regulation through the gut-brain axis. For instance, diets rich in prebiotics and probiotics can favorably modify the gut microbiota, potentially reducing inflammation and altering neurotransmitter activity, thereby mitigating symptoms of anxiety and depression. Similarly, regular physical activity has been shown to influence microbial diversity, enhancing the abundance of beneficial microbes that produce mood-regulating compounds like short-chain fatty acids. This dynamic interplay suggests that interventions targeting lifestyle modifications, alongside strategies for modulating the gut microbiome, could offer a comprehensive approach to managing ANXD and MDD, emphasizing the need for integrated treatment strategies that consider both the microbiome and lifestyle factors in their therapeutic protocols.</p><p id="Par38">The evidence of a relationship between the gut microbiota and NPD, including the nuanced effects of psychiatric medications on microbial diversity, opens new avenues for clinical practice. Recognizing specific microbial markers associated with ANXD and MDD paves the way for the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies, potentially allowing for more personalized and effective treatment plans. The modulation of the gut microbiome through targeted probiotic interventions or dietary modifications could complement or even reduce reliance on traditional pharmacotherapy, mitigating side effects and improving overall treatment outcomes. Furthermore, understanding the role of microbiome offers a compelling rationale for integrating gut health assessments into routine psychiatric evaluations, encouraging a holistic approach to mental health care. This paradigm shift towards incorporating microbiome analysis in clinical settings could revolutionize the management of NPD, emphasizing the importance of gut health in mental well-being and opening up a new frontier in psychiatric treatment and prevention strategies.</p><p id="Par39">This study&#x02019;s strengths include employing compositionally aware methods on a large, United States-based cohort; however, it is not without its limitations. The study does not account for medication dosage variations, and while it distinguishes between anxiolytics and antidepressants use, it does not differentiate between different drugs or dosages within these medication categories to maintain statistical power. The reliance on self-reported medication usage introduces potential inaccuracies regarding adherence to prescribed regimens or unsupervised medication consumption. Another limitation arises from the methodological choice of utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon data over shotgun metagenomic sequencing. While shotgun metagenomic data was available for this study and microbial signatures in this data were able to consistently differentiate between participants with ANXD and MDD, and HC, other subgroups were harder to distinguish (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). This is likely due to the limited sample size, as we saw smaller differences in the same 16S data subsetted to participants with both a 16S sample and a WGS sample (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). This suggests a need for future research to prioritize shotgun metagenomic data, which is becoming more cost-effective and informative. The HC group also had much fewer males than females, such that some of the effects observed in the study may have been at least partially driven by sex differences. Though a sex-stratified analysis was performed and results were generally consistent between sexes, future studies should look for parity between sexes in their sampling. Finally, the machine learning techniques employed in this study, while they effectively distinguish between HC and participants with ANXD or MDD, they do not represent the cutting edge in data analysis. Advanced deep learning models could potentially offer finer distinctions among participant groups. However, such models often lack transparent feature selection, which could impede their practical applicability in clinical settings due to challenges in interpreting which specific features drive observed differences. Future research might benefit from integrating untargeted approaches, such as metabolomics, to classify participants more accurately by medication use, enhancing the study&#x02019;s depth and the reliability of its conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
