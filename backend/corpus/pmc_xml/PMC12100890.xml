This tissue is responsible for mucociliary clearance and, together with the nasal microbiota, acts as a physical, chemical, and immunological defence to preserve the homeostasis of the nasal cavity and limit the invasion of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is also considered an integral part of the innate immune system as it produces antimicrobial agents, danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and recognize pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Integrity alteration of the nose epithelium has been related to inflammation with severe consequences for animal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Traditionally, models to study basic and clinical aspects of the airway pathophysiology have been cells and explants from nose, trachea, or bronchia. These models were either hard to maintain in vitro (like primary cells and explants) or not physiologically relevant enough (like immortalised cell lines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The recent emergence of both human and animal organoids are promising systems to model the respiratory epithelium and study immunological parameters or host&#x02013;pathogen interactions. To date, airway organoids established in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] as well as in some animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have shown to represent a robust system for airway modelling, since they retain the in vivo architecture of the nasal epithelium forming a complex pseudostratified epithelium with most of the cell types from the original tissue (ciliated, mucus-secreting goblet, basal and club cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To our knowledge, only lung organoids have been set up for the porcine respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite the burden of respiratory diseases for the porcine sector, there is no nasal organoid model currently available for pigs, which would enable experiments under defined -like conditions. Moreover, cross-species transmission from pigs to humans are continuously posing a major challenge to public health and this model could be extended to investigate the potential transmission of many zoonotic pathogens, using pigs as asymptomatic carriers, to humans preventing outbreaks of disease in both host species.</p><p id="Par21">To tackle this issue, we have successfully established and characterized the first Porcine Nasal Organoids (PNOs) cultures and used this model to study the interactions with the host and between members of the nasal microbiota. Understanding the interplay between the host with its microbiota, and the pathogens will facilitate the design of preventative and therapeutic interventions to promote respiratory health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation and characterization of Porcine Nasal Organoids (PNOs)</title><p id="Par22">Several lines of PNOs were established from nasal turbinates by isolation of the cells and embedding in Matrigel (basement membrane matrix), adapting published protocols for human and swine tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. After 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days in culture, PNOs were formed showing the typical cystic shape with visible lumen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and B). Moreover, beating cilia were observed inside the lumen (see Supplementary Video 1) under light microscopy. PNO cultures were treated with 1% penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of primocin to avoid bacterial growth, but they were positive for <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> spp. Since <italic>M. hyorhinis</italic> can be found in the nasal cavity of pigs, we performed a specific PCR for this pathogen and confirmed that the PNOs were positive to this species.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Establishment of porcine nasal organoids (PNOs) from nasal turbinates. <bold>A</bold> Representative images of PNOs morphology at different time points by bright field microscopy at 4x, 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;and 20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;magnification, respectively. <bold>B</bold> Haematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining of 3D paraffin-embedding PNOs. <bold>C</bold> Comparison between differentiated and non-differentiated 3D PNOs (top) and monolayers (bottom)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40168_2025_2088_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">To verify if the generated organoids recapitulated the histology of the nasal mucosa, organoids were expanded, differentiated and characterized. Thus, PNOs from non-differentiated 3D cultures were seeded as monolayers (2D cultures) with the apical side exposed, cultured for 1&#x000a0;week and differentiated for one more week (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). PNOs were also established from nasal samples taken with cytology brushes yielding comparable PNOs. The only difference noted was that they required more time to form 3D PNO structures, specifically 2 to 3&#x000a0;weeks after initial adaptation to the growth medium. Early passages from non-differentiated 3D PNOs were frozen to keep a stock of the different PNO cultures and maintained viability after at least 3 freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles.</p><p id="Par24">To evaluate whether 3D and/or 2D PNO cultures maintained and mimicked the characteristics and the organization of the nasal respiratory epithelium, as well as the response to differentiative stimuli, the expression of several cell markers was analysed at different time points by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent assays (IFA). Similar to nasal turbinates from pigs, 3D PNOs and 2D non-differentiated and 2D differentiated PNOs expressed the markers for club cells (<italic>scgb1a1</italic>), goblet cells (<italic>muc5ac</italic>), basal cells (<italic>tp63</italic>), ciliated cells (<italic>foxj1</italic>) and tight junctions (<italic>zo-1</italic>). An increase in the expression of <italic>muc5ac, zo-1</italic> and <italic>foxj1</italic> genes was observed in organoids that underwent a longer period of differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Cell marker analysis expressed on porcine nasal organoid surface by immunofluorescent assay and conventional PCR.

Few Ki67 positive cells were detected while acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin appeared highly expressed in the differentiated cultures. Goblet cells were also detected. Taken together, these results suggest that the generated PNO cultures recapitulate the nasal pseudostratified airway epithelium, retaining in vivo morphological and functional characteristics (see Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Nasal microbiota members were able to colonize PNO monolayers maintaining monolayer integrity</title><p id="Par26">The colonization of the host mucosal surfaces by the microbiota is fundamental in host homeostasis. To evaluate the nasal colonization with the organoid model, we selected some bacterial isolates commonly found in the nasal cavity of pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We used two prevalent and abundant members of the nasal microbiota: <italic>Moraxella pluranimalium</italic> (<italic>Mp</italic>) and <italic>Glaesserella parasuis</italic> (<italic>Gp</italic>)<italic>.</italic> From the latter, we included two strains with different virulence capacities (non-virulent, nv<italic>Gp</italic>; and virulent, v<italic>Gp</italic>). Finally, <italic>Rothia nasimurium</italic> (<italic>Rn</italic>) was also inoculated to PNOs as a prevalent but not abundant member of the nasal microbiota.

These 3D &#x0201c;mini-noses&#x0201d; exhibited a centralised lumen surrounded by a polarised airway epithelial cell layer, showing cilia oscillations with proliferative activity and tight junction function, which are physiologically similar to the pig airway epithelium in vivo. This model recapitulates key histological and functional aspects of the in vivo tissue, suggesting that it is an excellent proxy of the porcine nasal epithelium and can be used to model respiratory diseases. As a proof of concept, we used the PNOs to study host-bacterial interactions using nasal colonizers of pigs.</p><p id="Par36">The culture conditions used to generate and maintain the PNOs preserved the self-renewal of nasal-resident stem cells and the stability of the organoids during the proliferation phase. This allowed us to indefinitely expand the organoid culture while recapitulating the cell diversity of the native tissue. For the differentiation stage, the composition of the medium promoted the specialisation of cells as we confirmed by PCR and IFA. Expression of FOXJ1 and MUC5AC indicated the cilia formation and mucus production, both involved in bacterial clearance. These markers, together with ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1, a tight junction protein implicated in the maintenance of cell barrier integrity) were relevant for the analysis of the host response to both colonization by nasal commensal bacteria and the infection by the respiratory pathogen. In relation to this, the presence of mucus (Muc5A gene, secreted by goblet cells) and the tight junctions (ZO-1 gene) were more evident after 2&#x000a0;h of infection than after overnight incubation with the strains. This suggested that PNOs&#x02019; cells were more reactive to the bacteria during the first hours and reached an equilibrium after an overnight incubation. For non-differentiated PNOs this effect was not observed, suggesting that the lack of differentiation is related to less specialization. Overall, we conclude that colonizers did not affect the integrity of PNO monolayers, whereas virulent <italic>G. parasuis</italic> did disrupt the tight junctions and affected the production of mucus, damaging goblet cells and probably other cellular types, which is in agreement with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Interactions between pathogens and members of the nasal microbiota could be essential to limit pathogen entry and their capacity to disseminate systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For instance, in humans, several studies revealed that interactions between members of the nasal microbiota, such as <italic>Corynebacterium spp.</italic> or <italic>Dolosigranulum pigrum</italic>, interfered with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in these host-microbiome interactions are difficult to study in a systematic way and could profit from a simplified and convenient model like nasal organoids. Our approach with PNOs to study bacterial colonization aligns with other works that describe the in vivo situation. For instance, <italic>Rothia</italic> is prevalent but not abundant in pig nasal swab samples, while other species as <italic>M. pluranimalium</italic> and <italic>G. parasuis</italic> showed high prevalence and abundance in this type of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These findings were in apparent contradiction with the capacity of those bacterial species to grow in laboratory conditions, i.e., <italic>R. nasimurium</italic> grows abundantly in common bacterial media, while <italic>M. pluranimalium</italic> and <italic>G. parasuis</italic> are fastidious microorganisms that grow poorly. In our study, the initial inoculated amount was similar for all the strains, but we found that our PNO model may be mimicking the in vivo conditions of the microbial network and the nasal mucosa, where a high abundance of <italic>Moraxella</italic> and <italic>Glaesserella</italic> is typically detected in the nasal microbiota of pigs, together with a low abundance of <italic>Rothia</italic>.</p><p id="Par38">Differentiated PNOs seemed to be less reactive to bacterial stimuli than the non-differentiated ones as they secreted less interleukins, especially IL-8, IL-12 and IL-6, the latter being only detected in non-differentiated PNOs. We hypothesized that this effect could be produced because differentiated PNOs have more specific cells associated to protection, as ciliated cells, and goblet cells, whose movement and secretion of mucus, respectively, could avoid intimate bacterial contact. Moreover, our results, confirm previous observations showing that Gram-negative bacteria induce pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-12, IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1;, while Gram-positive tend to induce IL-12, TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], supporting the value of the PNO model.

Overall, our results suggest that <italic>R. nasimurium</italic> might be important for the maintenance of the homeostasis with potential properties as a probiotic.</p><p id="Par39">We present a novel model that recreates the typical aspects of the in vivo nasal epithelium based on 3D PNOs (that can be indefinitely passaged and frozen for long-term expansion) and a monolayer culture derived from them, which can be convenient for microbial network and host-microbe interaction studies. It is also important to remark the breakthrough in the generation of the pig nasal organoids using a non-invasive technique (cytological brushes) as an alternative to necropsy-derived organoids, supporting the 3R principle of animal experimentation. Additionally, we improve our understanding of the nasal microbiota colonization and the interactions between the different members, as well as the host cellular response to both bacterial colonization and infection. All the experiments presented in this study have been performed in monolayers using 96-well plates as a &#x0201c;<italic>proof of concept</italic>&#x0201d;. Despite monolayers recapitulated the in vivo structure, future improvements would include air&#x02013;liquid interface (ALI) cultures to simulate apical-basal compartmentalization and thus increase differentiation.
