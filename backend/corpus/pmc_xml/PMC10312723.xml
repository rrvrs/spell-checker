To address this, we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based CRISPR screening platform, CrAAVe-seq, that incorporates a Cre-sensitive sgRNA construct for pooled screening within targeted cell populations in mouse tissues. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by screening two distinct large sgRNA libraries, together targeting over 5,000 genes, in mouse brains to create a robust profile of neuron-essential genes.

By comparing results from individual mice and across different cell populations, we highlight the reproducibility and scalability of the platform and show that it is highly sensitive even for screening smaller neuronal subpopulations.

Most CRISPR screens are carried out in cultured cells. First applications in iPSC-derived brain cell types such as neurons<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, microglia<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and astrocytes<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> have uncovered cell type-specific mechanisms relevant to neuroscience and neurological diseases. However, a major limitation of CRISPR-based screens in cultured cells is that they do not fully recapitulate the physiological context of a multicellular organism, or tissue states such as aging, inflammation, or disease. These limitations are particularly evident in applications to biological questions related to complex organs like the brain, which involves intricate spatial interactions between numerous distinct cell types and subtypes. Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> pooled CRISPR screens directly targeting endogenous cells in the brains of mice have the potential to uncover insights that would be elusive in cell culture.</p><p id="P6">A small number of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> CRISPR screens targeting endogenous brain cells have previously been reported<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, reviewed by Braun et al<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and summarized in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>) Some of these screens involved delivering single-guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries to the brain via lentivirus, but there is increasing recognition that lentivirus-based approaches have several drawbacks (summarized in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Such drawbacks include poor distribution of lentivirus through the brain and the inability to differentiate between cell types in which specific sgRNAs were expressed. To overcome some of these limitations, emerging studies have turned to adeno-associated virus (AAV), which has more widespread brain transduction, and combined with CRISPR perturbations and single-cell RNA sequencing (AAV-Perturb-Seq)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. This powerful approach provides crucial and granular details on transcriptional changes in specific cell types. However, the current cost of scaling this strategy to study larger cellular populations in the mouse brain and across multiple independent mice is prohibitive. Prior work using this approach has so far not exceeded a library size of 65 sgRNAs (targeting 29 genes) and a sampling of 60,000 cells<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Screens at such a scale enable the phenotypic profiling of a small number of preselected genes of interest, but not the unbiased discovery of unexpected genes that have a phenotype of interest. As such, there is a great need for a substantially more scalable <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> CRISPR screening platform that retains the ability to discriminate between cell types.</p><p id="P7">We developed a strategy for screening in the mouse brain called "<underline>CR</underline>ISPR screening by <underline>AAV e</underline>pisome <underline>seq</underline>uencing" (CrAAVe-seq). Incorporating a Cre recombinase-based genetic element into the sgRNA library backbone enables the selective evaluation of phenotypes caused by genetic perturbations only in cell types of interest. Furthermore, CrAAVe-seq exploits the amplification of sgRNA sequences from AAV episomes<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, rather than genomic DNA, to dramatically increase the scalability and reduce the cost of quantifying sgRNA frequencies from whole brain homogenates. Using CrAAVe-seq, we profiled neuron-essential genes in the mouse brain in different neuronal subpopulations, utilizing libraries containing ~12,000 and ~18,000 sgRNAs per brain and sampling at least 2.5 million neurons per brain. This approach yielded highly reproducible top hits across independent mice. Therefore, CrAAVe-seq enables high-throughput, cost-effective screening of the mammalian CNS, with immediate applicability to other cell types and tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CrAAVe-seq strategy for cell type-specific <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> screening of neurons in the mouse brain</title><p id="P8">We aimed to leverage the high CNS tropism and infectivity for neurons of AAV, particularly in comparison to lentivirus, to develop an AAV-based system for pooled CRISPR perturbations of endogenous neuronal genes in the mouse brain. However, because of the ability of AAV to transduce many different cell types<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, we sought a cell-type specific approach for CRISPR screening. To address this, we designed pAP215, an AAV vector for single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression that contains an mU6-driven sgRNA sequence followed by a Lox71/Lox66-flanked 175 bp &#x0201c;handle&#x0201d; cassette that undergoes predominantly unidirectional<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> inversion in cells expressing Cre recombinase (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The construct expresses a nuclear-localized blue fluorescent protein (NLS-mTagBFP2) for visualization. A fully annotated map of the pAP215 is provided (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We devised a strategy using pAP215 to screen for essential neuronal genes in the mouse brain <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, schematized in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. Along with uncovering key pathways involved in neuronal homeostasis, neuronal survival screens can be readily applied to various mouse models of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, to identify genetic drivers or modifiers of neuronal susceptibility. AAVs containing pAP215 and promoter-driven Cre recombinase (e.g. a pan-neuronal hSyn1 promoter-driven Cre) are co-injected into the brains of inducible CRISPR interference (Lox-Stop-Lox-dCas9-KRAB, or LSL-CRISPRi) mice<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. This leads to the activation of CRISPRi machinery and inversion of the handle sequence in neurons. PCR amplification by priming against the inverted handle on AAV episomes, followed by sequencing, enables the identification and quantification of sgRNAs in Cre-expressing neurons.</p><p id="P10">We packaged our AAV plasmids into the PHP.eB capsid, which is known to enable widespread transduction of brain cells<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. We co-injected pAP215 (PHP.eB::pAP215) and an hSyn1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase tagged with a nuclear GFP (PHP.eB::hSyn1-Cre, diagram of construct shown in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>) by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection into neonatal mice. We saw broad distribution of both pAP215 and hSyn1-Cre reporters across the brain, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), consistent with the known distribution profile of the PHP.eB capsid<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Contrasting this, we observe much more limited expression and spread of lentivirus delivered by the same method and expressing the same nuclear mTagBFP reporter (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">CRISPR screens performed in cell culture using lentivirus, which integrate their DNA into the host genome, require extraction of genomic DNA before PCR amplification of the integrated sgRNAs. In contrast, recombinant AAV genomes are mostly maintained as circular or concatenated DNA episomes, with a minor fraction integrating into the host genome<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Consequently, a major potential advantage of AAV is that the viral genomes can be precipitated and concentrated from the aqueous phase of a TRIzol-chloroform extraction as previously demonstrated in the context of AAV capsid screening<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, which could vastly improve scalability for a pooled CRISPR screen. For example, if PCR of sgRNAs from genomic DNA was necessary, a whole mouse brain weighing approximately 500 mg is expected to yield up to 1500 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA. Since PCR reactions have an upper limit for the amount of template DNA (typically 10 &#x003bc;g per 100 &#x003bc;l reaction)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, screening across a single brain would require up to 15,000 &#x003bc;l of PCR reaction volume. This imposes a severe restriction on scalability, as large volumes of PCR reactions become economically and practically infeasible, especially for screening libraries necessitating dozens of mice.</p><p id="P12">In comparison, we performed isopropanol precipitation of nucleic acids from the aqueous phase of a TRIzol-chloroform extraction of an AAV-injected whole mouse brain. We resuspended the nucleic acid pellet in 50 &#x003bc;L of water and treated it with RNase, which removes all RNA without digesting the DNA of the AAV episomes. Using 1 &#x003bc;L of this &#x0201c;episome&#x0201d; fraction as a template, we confirmed by PCR that pAP215 could be detected in the injected brains (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Importantly, we found that the Cre-inverted handle sequence was detectable only in mice co-injected with hSyn1-Cre (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). With the episome fraction containing a nucleic acid concentration of less than 10 ng/&#x003bc;L, a single 50 to 100 &#x003bc;L PCR reaction volume could be used if desired.</p><p id="P13">We further confirmed that PHP.eB::hSyn1-Cre expresses in neurons by immunostaining for a neuronal marker (NeuN) and an astrocyte marker (SOX9) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Image analysis showed that 93% of GFP<sup>+</sup> co-localized with NeuN<sup>+</sup> nuclei, while only 0.3% overlapped with SOX9<sup>+</sup> nuclei. Of note, manual inspection of the SOX9<sup>+</sup> nuclei flagged as GFP<sup>+</sup> showed GFP signal was emanating from adjacent neurons that overlapped with SOX9<sup>+</sup> nuclei. In effect, we did not observe any SOX9<sup>+</sup> nuclei with distinct GFP signal within their nucleus, confirming hSyn1-Cre&#x02019;s known selective expression in neurons<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CRISPRi knockdown <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> using AAV</title><p id="P14">To test that the pAP215 plasmid is effective for CRISPRi knockdown, we used an sgRNA targeting Creb1 (sgCreb1), which encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that is not essential for neuronal survival<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We also generated a non-targeting sgRNA control (sgNTC) in pAP215. We co-injected PHP.eB::pAP215-sgCreb1 or PHP.eB::pAP215-sgNTC alongside PHP.eB::hSyn1-Cre by ICV into neonatal LSL-CRISPRi mice, at approximately 1&#x000d7;10<sup>11</sup> viral particles of each virus per mouse. We also included a group of mice injected with sgCreb1 alone to check for leakiness of the CRISPRi machinery. Three weeks after neonatal ICV injection, immunofluorescence staining confirmed strong knockdown of endogenous CREB1 in all neurons that received both sgCreb1 (BFP<sup>+</sup> nuclei) and hSyn1-Cre (GFP<sup>+</sup> nuclei) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>,<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In contrast, neurons that received sgCreb1 alone did not show knockdown. We also observed that the vast majority (&#x0003e;90%) of the cortex and hippocampus express both the Cre and the sgRNA, with less co-infection in striatum and cerebellum (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). This indicated that co-delivery of the sgRNA and Cre viruses can provide broad coverage and CRISPRi activity for a broad distribution of brain regions.We noted that one of the sgCreb1+hSyn1-Cre mice showed overall less viral transduction throughout the brain, most likely due to a technical issue during the injection of the virus (mouse #1). However, even with sparse infection, there was still strong knockdown of CREB1 in all BFP<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>+</sup> nuclei at the level of individual cells, suggesting that transduction by an AAV at low MOI (potentially a single sgRNA) is sufficient for knockdown. Further supporting this conclusion, we found no correlation between BFP levels and the degree of CREB1 knockdown in a brain transduced with greater amounts of sgCreb1+hSyn1-Cre (mouse #3) (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Distribution and extent of multiple infections by AAV</title><p id="P15">Given the high degree of co-infection between the sgRNA and Cre above in most mice, we next aimed to obtain a semi-quantitative estimate of multiplicity of infection (MOI) by injecting AAVs at multiple concentrations. We co-packaged equimolar concentrations of AAV plasmids encoding three different nuclear-localized fluorescent proteins and performed neonatal ICV injections using three different total viral particle amounts per mouse: 1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup>, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>, and 1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>. Three weeks post-injection, we imaged representative sagittal brain sections to evaluate the prevalence of single-, double-, and triple-infected nuclei across different brain regions.</p><p id="P16">Even at the highest concentration of AAV injected, and in the most infection-prone regions, the majority of nuclei expressed only one or two fluorescent proteins, with approximately 15% of nuclei in the densely transduced forebrain showing infection with all three fluorescent proteins (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Regions with higher co-infection rates correlated directly with areas of enhanced viral tropism, such as the middle to deeper layers of the cortex and the CA3 and CA2 sectors of the hippocampus. At lower concentrations, there was a sharp decline in the total number of transduced nuclei, accompanied by a higher fraction of nuclei expressing only one type of fluorescent protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). In short, the results indicated that higher viral concentrations maximized the number of transduced neurons, and that even at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> viral particles per brain, a substantial number of cells in most brain regions express a single type of fluorescent protein, indicating that most of these cells are transduced by a single virus (with presumably a small fraction of these representing co-infection by two viruses expressing the same fluorescent protein). Obtaining a precise MOI from these experiments is challenging given the degree of variability of infection between different brain regions and neuronal types as dictated by viral tropism. Despite this limitation, these findings help us broadly estimate that the MOI across the whole brain injected with 1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> viral particles most likely ranges from 1 to 3, and could be higher than 3 in focal areas of strong viral tropism.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CrAAVe-seq identifies neuron-essential genes</title><p id="P17">We generated two different sgRNA pooled libraries in the pAP215 AAV backbone by transferring sgRNAs from our previously established mouse sgRNA libraries<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.

We co-delivered PHP.eB::hSyn1-Cre alongside either PHP.eB::pAP215-M1 library or PHP.eB::pAP215-M3 library by ICV injection into LSL-CRISPRi mice. We injected n=13 mice with the M1 library and n=19 mice with the M3 library. We collected the brains after 6 weeks, recovered episomes and amplified sgRNAs using primers specific to the Cre-inverted handle in pAP215, followed by next-generation sequencing (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We compared the sgRNA frequencies from the recovered episomes to the sgRNA frequencies of the packaged and injected AAV sgRNA libraries to identify changes in sgRNA frequency.

The output knockdown phenotype of all screens is provided in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Gene-set enrichment analysis (with background correction for the genes in the library) further highlighted that many hit genes belonged to distinct biological categories (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Top categories included members of the vacuolar ATPase complex, ESCRT pathways, COP-I and COP-II vesicle trafficking, and members of the chaperonin/TRiC complex. Although not identified from gene enrichment, we also noted some of the top hits to be members of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase families. Supporting the notion that the genes with a negative knockdown phenotype are neuron-essential genes, we found that 91 of the 147 hit genes (62%) foverlapped with known common essential genes established by DepMap from cancer cell lines<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>).

We also note the presence a few genes for which the sgRNAs were weakly, but significantly enriched relative to input AAV, suggesting that knockdown of these genes enhances neuronal survival.</p><p id="P19">To examine the robustness of our screening approach, we compared knockdown phenotypes for top hits from each library in each mouse and found that phenotypes were highly reproducible across individual mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), corroborating that hits obtained from analyzing the full cohort of mice are not entirely driven by a subset of mice. We also compared two individual mice each from the M1 and M3 sgRNA library cohorts, selecting the mice that called the highest number of hits. We again observed a strong correlation in knockdown phenotypes, particularly for the strongest hit genes (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). The knockdown phenotypes also strongly correlated when comparing male versus female mice from each cohort; no sex-specific neuron-essential genes were observed (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). We further confirmed that the knockdown phenotypes of the top hit genes in the M1 library require the expression of hSyn1-Cre (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>).

To investigate the impact of MOI on screen quality, we injected a cohort of LSL-CRISPRi littermates with two lower concentrations of the M1 AAV sgRNA library alongside a constant amount of hSyn1-Cre (1&#x000d7;10<sup>11</sup> viral particles per mouse). Evaluating n=2 mice injected with an intermediate amount (7&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> viral particles) of the library showed a clear, strong correlation of the sgRNAs frequencies recovered from mouse brains with those in the input AAV library (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>). In contrast, n=4 mice injected with a 10-fold lower concentration (7&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> viral particles) showed much poorer correlation and extensive sgRNA dropout. The intermediate concentration identified 20 hits that overlap with hits of the M1 sgRNA library cohort from <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, while the lower concentration identified just 2 hits meeting these criteria (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>). In summary, although the concentrations used for the original screens have an MOI greater than 1 in several brain regions, injecting smaller amounts of virus dramatically reduces the power of the screen. We suggest that the poor performance of lower viral concentrations is due to reducing coverage, indicated by vastly increased sgRNA dropout in the lower concentration. Conversely, the infection of a proportion of cells with more than one sgRNA expected at higher concentrations seems to have a much less detrimental impact on the screen quality, likely because the majority of sgRNAs does not cause a phenotype, and because each individual sgRNA is screened in many independent neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Screening for essential genes in CaMKII<sup>+</sup> neurons <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic></title><p id="P21">To determine if a different neuronal Cre driver targeting a large neuronal subpopulation produces similar findings, we tested a CaMKII promoter that has traditionally been used to target predominantly forebrain excitatory neurons<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.

Nonetheless, these screens established that CrAAVe-seq sensitively detects neuron-essential genes on a smaller neuronal population.

We found that for screens conducted in large neuronal populations accessed with hSyn1-Cre expression, analyzing all sgRNAs provides similar knockdown phenotypes of the top hit genes, but also demonstrates a noticeable increase in the knockdown phenotypes for most genes when analyzing only sgRNAs with the Cre-inverted handle (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). This nevertheless indicated that hSyn1-Cre drives sgRNA activity in a sufficiently large number of neurons to permit identification of hit genes when evaluating all recovered sgRNAs, but that the presence of non-transduced or transduction in nonneuronal cells could partially mask the effects of active hits. More importantly and in contrast, screens in a small neuronal subpopulation accessed by hI56i-Cre showed that knockdown phenotypes of the top known hits required amplification with the Cre-inverted handle (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Indeed, hit genes were significantly different compared to non-targeting controls when examining sgRNAs with the Cre-inverted handle (p &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;46</sup>), but not when examining all sgRNAs (p = 0.72) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, <xref rid="F17" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). This supports that sgRNAs expressed in Cre-negative neurons can fully obscure the signal of active sgRNAs, making the Cre-inverting handle in pAP215 essential for screening smaller subpopulations of a broadly transduced population.</p><p id="P25">To further quantity the proportion of the total sgRNAs and Cre-inverted sgRNAs, as well as to determine their relative proportions after inversion with different Cres, we conduced PCR with different primer pairs. Episomes were recovered from mice injected PHP.eB::pAP215-M1 library alone, or with either PHP.eB::hSyn1-Cre or PHP.eB::hI56i-Cre. Standard PCR with examination of the products by gel electrophoresis showed that with primers targeting total sgRNAs, there is qualitatively an approximately equal intensity of the PCR products. When using primers targeting the Cre-inverted handle, there was a strong band in mice injected with hSyn1-Cre, no detectable product in mice without Cre, and a weak band with hI56i-Cre (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To determine the absolute number of template molecules between conditions, we performed digital PCR using the same primer pairs and the same samples.

Moreover, the number of molecules detected also demonstrate the substantially large numbers of neurons being sampled per mouse. Assuming at minimum, when performing CrAAVe-seq using hSyn1-Cre, we estimate from the above digital PCR experiments that 5 million Cre-inverted sgRNA molecules are captured and sequenced from a whole brain. Based on the frequency of the multiple infections observed in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we estimate that most of the transduced neurons express between 1 to 3 transgenes. Therefore, we estimate at least 1.67 million neurons are screened per brain. Importantly, this number can be dramatically boosted by increasing the number of mice for a screen at minimal additional cost. For example, the M3 library-injected cohort of 19 mice represents screening of at least 30 million neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Estimating number of mice required for screening in differing cell populations</title><p id="P28">To investigate the impact of cohort size on hit recovery under different Cre conditions, we performed a bootstrap analysis on the CaMKII-Cre screen cohort (from <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>) and hi56i-Cre screen cohort (from <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), which were all injected with the same preparation and concentration of PHP.eB::pAP215-M1 library.

Our pan-neuronal CRISPRi screen targeting over one quarter of the protein-coding genes in the mouse genome uncovered neuron-essential genes in the brain with high reproducibility of top hits between individual mice. Many of these genes have been previously recognized as common essential genes by DepMap<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> or in our prior screens in iPSC neurons<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.

It is unclear whether these gene knockdowns increase resiliency from death or from inducing proliferation of a transduced cell population; they warrant further investigation.</p><p id="P37">Our Cre-dependent sgRNA recovery strategy enables highly sensitive screens in smaller neuronal subpopulations, providing an avenue for CRISPR screening on molecularly defined cell types that can be accessed through specific Cre-drivers, or brain regions that can be physically dissected. One area for ongoing optimization is increasing sgRNA recovery and coverage across cell populations. Our current proof-of-concept studies rely on co-injecting AAVs for the sgRNA libraries and Cre recombinase, but using transgenic Cre mouse lines could maximize active sgRNA expression without relying on co-infection. Additionally, temporal control over gene perturbation can be achieved by delivering sgRNA libraries later, via intravenous delivery, or by crossing LSL-CRISPRi mice to Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> lines for tamoxifen-inducible activation. Furthermore, the Lox71/Lox66 system used for unidirectional handle inversion may not be the maximum possible efficient, so we are developing a FLEX-based AAV sgRNA backbone for more efficient Cre-dependent handle switching. So far, our screens using different Cre drivers showed strong correlation between independent screens, but no clear evidence of genes essential only in specific neuronal populations. This could be due to the genes included in the M1 library, which may not be optimally suited to detect population-specific vulnerabilities. It may also require longer screening durations to identify genes that impart differential susceptibility.</p><p id="P38">When applying CrAAVe-seq to new applications, factors such as sgRNA library size and viral tropism must be considered. Unlike CRISPR screens in cultured cell-based systems, where low MOI ensures that each cell mostly receives only one sgRNA, the complexity of CNS architecture and viral tropism in different brain regions makes controlling global MOI challenging, as each region will have a local MOI. In our studies, the MOI across the brain was generally 1 to 2, with a few areas exceeding 3. Despite this variability, the large screening library and large number of transduced neurons greatly buffers the potential for complex sgRNA interaction within the same cell, ensuring discernible phenotypes even when randomly paired with other sgRNAs. We found that reducing AAV library concentration significantly diminishes screen performance, indicating that transducing a large number of neurons is more critical than maintaining a low MOI. We also observed, through bootstrapping analyses, that a screen on smaller neuronal populations requires a larger number of mice. Future CNS screens must balance library size, target population(s) with consideration of dissected brain regions, and desired phenotypes, and we recommend using digital PCR and bootstrap analyses in optimizing for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> screens.</p><p id="P39">This platform can be immediately applied to existing neurodegeneration mouse models to systematically screen for modifiers of neuronal vulnerability in large brain regions like the cortex or focused populations, such as Purkinje neurons, where the abundance of internal granule cells might mask biological hits. Moreover, the persistent expression of AAV episomes in non-dividing cells<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> makes CrAAVe-seq well-suited for aging studies. While our screen mainly identified gene perturbations reducing neuronal survival, future studies in neurodegenerative models could identify perturbations that rescue neuronal survival to reveal potential therapeutic targets. Beyond neurodegeneration, we conceive possible applications to study genetic factors that modify cell survival or growth/proliferation after traumatic brain injury and stroke.</p><p id="P40">Further, while our interest is in the brain, we believe this strategy will be useful for screening specific subpopulations of cells throughout the body. The growing toolkit of AAV capsids and Cre drivers allows for immediate application of this approach to study a wide array of different cell types. A minor limitation of using non-integrating AAVs is the gradual loss of AAV episomes during cell division, reducing the fraction of cells from which phenotypic data can be collected, particularly in proliferating tissues. Consequently, this approach would not be best suited to screen for phenotypes related to increased cellular proliferation. This is not a major issue for neurons, as they are postmitotic, and this still permits screening for genes that prevent neuronal death in disease models. For other proliferating cell types, integrating a transposase system into the host genome could help maintain sgRNA expression, as demonstrated previously<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. While this would partly negate the advantage of recovering sgRNAs from episomes, the other advantages afforded by AAV (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>), including superior biodistribution and safety profile remain valuable.</p><p id="P41">CrAAVe-seq complements orthogonal <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> CRISPR screening techniques but is especially well suited for probing specific cell populations with far larger sgRNA libraries for unbiased biological discovery. By taking advantage of widespread AAV transduction in the brain, CrAAVe-seq allows screening across millions of neurons per mouse, which was not feasible with prior options, and this can be further scaled by using multiple mice per screen. While CrAAVe-seq does not provide the same cell-type resolution as scRNA-seq-based Perturb-seq, CrAAVe-seq offers a practical and far less expensive approach for large-scale initial screens using broader libraries (&#x0003e;1,000s of sgRNAs vs. ~10s of sgRNAs) and larger targeted cell populations (~millions vs. 10,000s of cells). We are currently in developing a genome-wide library in the pAP215 backbone for future CrAAVe-seq applications. While our current work demonstrates the use of CrAAVe-seq to uncover modifiers of cell survival, the strategy can be expanded to other relevant phenotypes in the future. For example, delivering an AAV library <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> could be used to comprehensively profile the genes involved in the migration and differentiation of different cell types in development. As for previous screens in cultured cells, the use of reporters and fluorescent read-out in conjunction with flow cytometry will enable the identification of modifiers of a plethora of cellular phenotypes. Thus, CrAAVe-seq has the potential to accelerate the rate of biological and therapeutic discovery in relevant animal models while minimizing cost and animal use.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Animals</title><p id="P42">All mice were maintained according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines and all procedures used in this study were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Raw sequencing results were mapped to the M1 protospacer library using `sgcount`. Briefly, `sgcount` is a tool to match protospacers against a reference protospacer library with exact pattern matching. The resulting count matrices, containing guide and gene information along with count data for each sample, was used as input for subsequent analyses.</p><p id="P70">`crispr_screen` was used to perform differential sgRNA abundance analysis and gene score aggregation analysis. `crispr_screen` is a reproduction of the original MAGeCK analysis but performs differential sgRNA analysis using a negative binomial as originally described in the study and not a truncated normal distribution as used in the current MAGeCK implementation. In brief, sgRNA abundances are median normalized across samples then a weighted linear regression (weighted ordinary least squares) is used to fit the log-variance to the log mean of the control samples (representing sgRNA abundances in the AAV library). The fit variance and mean are then used to parameterize negative binomial distributions for each sgRNA and a survival function or cumulative distribution function is used to calculate a p-value for sgRNA under- and over-abundance. We excluded any sgRNAs that were represented with fewer than 100 reads across the control AAV samples.</p><p id="P71">To calculate a gene-level aggregated metric across sgRNAs of the same gene group we established a novel algorithm, geopagg. We performed the following operations on the under- and over-abundance p-values in parallel. First, the differential abundance p-values for sgRNAs were corrected for multiple hypothesis correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction procedure to calculate a false discovery rate (FDR) for each sgRNA. Next, FDRs for sgRNAs belonging to the same gene grouping were collected and sorted ascendingly. We then calculated a weighted geometric mean FDR <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" display="inline"><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> for each gene <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2" display="inline"><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02208;</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> across the FDRs <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3" display="inline"><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> for sgRNAs within the gene group (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M4" display="inline"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02208;</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><disp-formula id="FD1">
