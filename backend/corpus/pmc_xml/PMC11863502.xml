It was developed and agreed upon by a panel of 12 LISA procedure experts, and subsequently validated through simulation sessions involving 40 learners. Two independent assessors evaluated these 40 simulations. The Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha score for this scale is 0.72, the R-squared value is 0.99, and the intra-class correlation coefficient is 0.92. Three different methods were employed to establish the minimum passing score: the Angoff method, the Borderline group method, and the Contrasting Group method. For the Angoff method, we enlisted 5 experts from the panel who developed the rating scale. In the Borderline Group method, the two assessors evaluated the 40 simulations following the prescribed methodology.

The teaching of LISA through simulation is still in development, with formal validation of this skill pending. In our prior study, the EVALISA study, a rating scale for teaching the LISA procedure in simulation training was developed using the Downing method and approved by a panel of LISA experts following the Delphi method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It exhibits satisfactory validity, with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha score of 0.72, and good reproducibility, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.91 and a linear coefficient of determination of 0.99. Establishing minimum passing scores is essential for the development of assessment scales and examinations leading to certification of competency.

After observing several instances, each judge assigns an overall performance score to each participant: 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;Fail, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;Borderline, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;Pass. Concurrently, each participant obtains a score using the rating scale. The minimum passing score is determined by averaging the scores of individuals in the Borderline group. The minimum passing score was determined by calculating the average score of students who received a rating of 2 (&#x02018;Borderline&#x02019;) in the judges&#x02019; assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Contrasting Group method</title><p id="Par17">This method also facilitates the determination of a minimum passing score. It involves two categories of students: &#x0201c;Experienced&#x0201d; students who are proficient in the assessed technique and &#x0201c;novice&#x0201d; students who lack experience with the technique. The minimum passing score is then established to effectively distinguish between &#x0201c;novice&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;experienced&#x0201d; students. Judges evaluate the performance of both &#x0201c;novice&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;experienced&#x0201d; student using the EVALISA rating scale. The distribution of scores for both groups is then plotted, and the minimal passing score is identified at the intersection of these score distributions. In EVALISA study, &#x0201c;Experienced&#x0201d; students in the LISA procedure had completed more than 5 LISAs in their careers. Their performances were assessed by two independent judges. &#x0201c;Novices&#x0201d; in the LISA procedure had completed fewer than 5 LISAs in their careers and were evaluated by the same judges.

Two independent judges (HR and BG) were recruited to determine the minimum passing scores using the Borderline Group and Contrasting Group methods. HR and BG, both experienced neonatologists, were selected for their expertise in the LISA procedure, their direct involvement in developing and validating the rating scale, and their extensive experience with simulation-based training, demonstrating a strong understanding of the scale&#x02019;s content and application. While it is usual to employ 5 or more judges, only 2 were employed due to logistical constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite the limited number, the reliability of their evaluations was ensured by high inter-rater agreement, as evidenced by an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

We classified learners as experts if they had performed more than 10 intubations in their professional careers. The distribution of scores within each category followed a Gaussian pattern.

Each method offers unique strengths and limitations, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of standard-seting apprpoaches in this context.</p><p id="Par28">The Angoff method, a tried-and-tested classical approach, has been widely utilized for developing minimum passing scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One of its key strengths lies in its detailed description in the literature and its adaptability to performance test development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This method offers reliability as judges independently assess each item on the rating scale, thereby ensuring the overall score&#x02019;s accountability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, Verheggen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed that individual judgement of the item not only reflects its difficulty but also the judge&#x02019;s inherent rigor and disciplinary expertise. Hence careful selection of judges is paramount, ensuring they can accurately portray the &#x0201c;borderline&#x0201d; student and possess adequate proficiency to address all assessments tool queries. In our study, judges not only contributed to the rating scale&#x02019;s development, but also exhibited competence and training in the LISA procedure. Furthermore, the definition of the &#x0201c;borderline&#x0201d; student was established through discussions between the study designer and the judges.</p><p id="Par29">The Borderline Group method offers the advantage of focusing on the candidate rather than individual items on the rating scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Consequently, it closely aligns with learner&#x02019;s actual skill levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, it is straightforward to implement post-simulation sessions, requiring minimal additional time for judges to categorize performances according to the three Borderline method classifications. To employ this method effectively, it is imperative that the judges possess qualifications in the taught method and are accustomed to evaluating simulator performances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this study, both judges conducted numerous assessments of simulation sessions and were well-versed in the LISA procedure. Notably, there were no statistically significant differences between the scores assigned by the two observers. Furthermore, familiarity with the content of the rating scale is crucial for both judges. In this instance, both judges were involved in developing the tool and executing assessments using it, thereby demonstrating a strong command of the content.</p><p id="Par30">The Borderline Group method calculates the minimum passing score by averaging the scores of participants in the &#x0201c;borderline&#x0201d; group. However, this calculation is inevitably influenced by the lowest scores, which tend to lower the average. In our study, this method yielded the lowest minimum score, possibly due to its susceptibility to the lowest scores among learners in the &#x0201c;Borderline&#x0201d; group.</p><p id="Par31">The Contrasting Group method is that it focuses on candidates who are already proficient in the technique, allowing the expected level of the participant to be determined based on the actual level of proficiency of those who perform the technique on a regular basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This method mitigates potential bias from judges evaluating items they have not performed in the simulation. However, the effectiveness of the Contrasting Group method relies on having an adequate number of qualified learners who are experts in the method to achieve a reliable Gaussian curve. In the cohort of learners who participated in the simulation sessions, there were 6 individuals identified as experienced in the LISA procedure, as per the previously established criteria. Additionally, there were a total of 17 learners (42% of the population) who had conducted more than 10 intubations throughout their professional careers. Given the similarities between these two procedures, including exposure to the laryngoscope, locating the vocal cords, and managing analgesia, one might have considered defining expertise based on experience with more than 10 intubations. However, such an approach could have potentially lowered the minimal passing score and compromised the accuracy of the study in terms of evaluating the LISA procedure, which was our primary focus. Consequently, we opted to exclusively assess the minimum passing score using the Contrasting Group method on experts in the LISA procedure, despite the smaller sample size. Nevertheless, the convergence of the two Gaussian curves can be attributed to the significant number of individuals experienced in intubation who were not classified as LISA procedure experts. These individuals demonstrated superior performance compared to novices in both intubation and the LISA procedure, contributing to the observed trend.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par32">One notable strength of this study is its rigorous methodology, involving the use of three complementary methods to determine the minimum passing score. This multi-method approach enhances the reliability and applicability of the findings by providing convergent evidence across different standard-setting techniques. However, a significant limitation lies in the reliance on only two judges for the Borderline Group and Contrasting Group methods. Although these judges possessed significant qualifications, extensive expertise in the LISA procedure, and were directly involved in creating the rating scale, the limited number of evaluators may have introduced bias and reduced the generalizability of the findings. The decision to use only two raters was influenced by logistical constraints. However, the high level of agreement between the two raters in the initial study mitigates this limitation to some extent. As a reminder, we highlighted the excellent interrater reliability of the EVALISA rating scale (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99 and ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Implications for practice</title><p id="Par33">The findings of this study have significant implications for the training and evaluation of healthcare professionals in simulation-based education. The consistent range of minimum passing scores derived from the three methods provides educators with evidence-based benchmarks for assessing competency in the LISA procedure. These thresholds ensure that learners achieve a high level of proficiency, thereby promoting patient safety and the quality of care. The minimum passing scores identified in this study consistently fall within a comparable range, from 63 to 70.6%. In mastery-based education, learners progress only after demonstrating proficiency, and performance is prioritized over fixed training durations. This ensures that all learners, regardless of the time required, achieve a consistent standard of competency, which is critical for patient safety and effective clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, as mastery learning highlights, the focus should not solely be on achieving a minimal standard but on preparing learners to succeed in subsequent stages of training and practice. Integrating specific critical elements, such as those related to patient safety, into the rating scale, as is the case in the EVALISA scale, could further enhance its impact. Although our study did not explicitly assess items related to patient safety, many items in the rating scale emphasize preparation and anticipation, which could contribute to safer procedures and environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par34">In conclusion, we have established three minimum success scores for the LISA scale in surfactant administration simulation training, ranging from 63.4 to 70.6%.
