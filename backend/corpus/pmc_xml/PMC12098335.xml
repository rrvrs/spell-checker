However, the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses to heat stress in <italic>B. napus</italic> plants exposed to a gradual increase in temperature reaching 30&#x000b0;C in the day and 24&#x000b0;C at night for a period of 6 days. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the content of carbohydrates and glucosinolates, respectively. Results showed that heat stress reduced yield and altered oil composition. Heat stress also increased the content of carbohydrate (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) and aliphatic glucosinolates (gluconapin and progoitrin) in the leaves but decreased the content of the indolic glucosinolate (glucobrassicin). RNA-Seq analysis of flower buds showed a total of 1,892, 3,253, and 4,553 differentially expressed genes at 0, 1, and 2 days after treatment (DAT) and 4,165 and 1,713 at 1 and 7 days of recovery (DOR), respectively. Heat treatment resulted in downregulation of genes involved in respiratory metabolism, namely, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation especially after 48 h of heat stress. Other downregulated genes mapped to sugar transporters, nitrogen transport and storage, cell wall modification, and methylation. In contrast, upregulated genes mapped to small heat shock proteins (sHSP20) and other heat shock factors that play important roles in thermotolerance. Furthermore, two genes were chosen from the pathways involved in the heat stress response to further examine their expression using real-time RT-qPCR. The global transcriptome profiling, integrated with the metabolic analysis in the study, shed the light on key genes and metabolic pathways impacted and responded to abiotic stresses exhibited as a result of exposure to heat waves during flowering. DEGs and metabolites identified through this study could serve as important biomarkers for breeding programs to select cultivars with stronger resistance to heat. In particular, these biomarkers can form targets for various crop breeding and improvement techniques such as marker-assisted selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Brassica napus</italic></kwd><kwd>oilseed rape</kwd><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>HPLC</kwd><kwd>LC-MS</kwd><kwd>simple sugars</kwd><kwd>glucosinolates</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council

These extreme events include periods of high temperature stress in the form of heatwaves (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Goel et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>), broadly defined as periods of excessively high temperature as compared to the local climate (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dik&#x00161;aityt&#x00117; et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have shown that heat stress can be detrimental during reproduction development due to the damage caused to plant organs and cellular structures (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hedhly, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hinojosa et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Goel et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). During reproduction, high temperature can induce irreversible structural and physiological changes in both male and female floral organs, leading to premature senescence (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Lohani et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jagadish et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). High temperature stress can also decrease chlorophyll synthesis and disrupt photosynthesis and respiration, further reducing the yield potential of crop plants (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hasanuzzaman et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Zandalinas et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Thus, understanding the impact of heatwaves on crops and particularly during reproductive stages is essential to the development of varieties that can withstand these periods of elevated temperatures.</p><p>Traditionally, most heat stress experiments involve a heat shock, where plants are subjected to a high temperature within a very short time (10&#x02013;15&#x000b0;C above their optimal temperature, from several minutes to a few hours) (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Wahid et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). As a result, plant responses to heat shock have been well studied (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), but relatively little information exists on the responses to heatwaves, especially at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Jin et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Glaubitz et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In plants, heat shock reduces photosynthesis and respiratory metabolism and increases antioxidant activity (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Heat shock also negatively affects plant growth and productivity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ismaili et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). While these experiments revealed the regulatory mechanisms in response to sudden heat stress (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Seth et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ikram et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>), they do not fully represent the impact of temperature changes in the field during heatwave conditions. As a result, several studies employed prolonged warming experiments to study heat stress (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Jin et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Way and Yamori, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Glaubitz et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, studies showed that plants exhibit different response patterns to prolonged warming (7 days) as compared to heat shocks (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Jin et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). While prolonged warming led to a reduction in stomatal conductance, heat shock increased transpiration. Under both heat shock and prolonged heat stress, there was an induction of antioxidant enzymes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; however, these were significantly higher under the heat shock treatment compared to the prolonged heat treatment (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic> L.) is the second largest source of oilseed after soybean and the third largest source of vegetable oil worldwide (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2025</xref>). Cultivation and breeding practices have resulted in numerous genetically diverse lines with strong agronomic and adaptation traits (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Sun et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). As a result, <italic>B. napus</italic> is widely cultivated around the world for food, biofuel, and animal feed (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Namazkar et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Like other major temperate field crops, <italic>B. napus</italic> can be extremely sensitive to high temperature stress, especially if it occurs during flowering or seed development, threatening yields and quality (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Angadi et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Koscielny et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Kourani et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). Studies in different <italic>Brassica</italic> species have found negative relationships between heat stress and seed yield and quality (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Yu et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). For example, under elevated temperature scenarios, four <italic>B. napus</italic> cultivars experienced a significant reduction in seed biomass, resulting in a 58% decrease in the oil yield and 77% decrease in the essential fatty acid C18:3-&#x003c9;3 (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Namazkar et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Heat stress also reduced oil seed content and impaired carbohydrate incorporation into triacylglycerols in <italic>B. napus</italic> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, impairment of chlorophyll biosynthesis and disruption of the biochemical reactions of photosystems were exhibited in 10-day-old <italic>B. napus</italic> seedlings subjected to 38&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hasanuzzaman et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). This was manifested through a significant reduction in chlorophyll and leaf relative water content and through an inefficient antioxidant defence system (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hasanuzzaman et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Despite the significant advances that these studies have made in understanding the effect of heat stress on different <italic>Brassica</italic> species, most of the research have focused on the seedling stage or grain filling. However, the impact of heatwaves on the transcriptomics and metabolomics of <italic>B. napus</italic>, particularly during its yield determining reproductive stages, is still poorly understood (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Kourani et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses to heat stress in <italic>B. napus</italic> during flowering stage under simulated field conditions. To achieve this, a heat treatment experiment simulating heatwave episode of <italic>B. napus</italic> cv. Westar was conducted in a controlled environment. Global transcriptome profiling using RNA-Seq was employed to identify differentially expressed genes in flower buds of heat stressed plants (30&#x000b0;C/24&#x000b0;C day/night for a period of 6 days). This was complemented with HPLC and LC-MS analyses to detect changes in sugars and glucosinolates (GLS) concentration in leaves in response to the heat treatment. Therefore, this study aims to provide insights into the impact of a future warmer climate on the important oil crop species <italic>B. napus</italic> during its reproductive stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Plant materials and physiological parameters</title><p>Seeds of spring oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic> L., cv. Westar) were surface-sterilised and sown into seed trays filled with a seed potting mix (Clover Peat, Dungannon, Northern Ireland). Trays were then placed in polyethylene tunnels for 4 weeks at the Crops and Environment Laboratory, University of Reading, to germinate. Twenty-eight days after sowing (DAS), the plants were transplanted into 3-L pots containing a peat based potting mix (Clover Peat).</p><p>At green bud stage (38 DAS), the plants were moved to two controlled environment chambers [Fitotron, Weiss Technik (UK) Ltd], for a period of 1 week to adjust to the new environment before the start of the heat experiment. Each cabinet contained 16 plants and was maintained under control conditions of 20&#x000b0;C/14&#x000b0;C day/night and a photoperiod of 16/8-h light/dark.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><label>2.2</label><title>Heatwave experimental design</title><p>Since the flowering stage of winter-sown <italic>B. napus</italic> occurs during May in the UK, an analysis of daily weather temperatures during this developmentally crucial period was carried out using the UK Meteorological (Met) Office weather data obtained from the <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Met office (n.d.)</xref> and from <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">WeatherOnline (n.d.)</xref> platforms. The data showed an increase in the frequency of high temperature fluctuations during May, ranging between 26&#x000b0;C and 28&#x000b0;C over several days (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

Given the continuous rise in global temperature, it is expected that future heatwaves would increase in severity and duration (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Seneviratne et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Based on these data, the current study temperature simulates a heat stress event through a temperature increase to 30&#x000b0;C/24&#x000b0;C day/night for a period of 6 days and 20&#x000b0;C/14&#x000b0;C day/night for control. Forty-five DAS, the temperature in one cabinet was kept under control conditions (20&#x000b0;C/14&#x000b0;C) and denoted as control cabinet, while the second cabinet was set to a gradual increase in temperature and denoted as heat treatment (HT) cabinet. To mimic a heatwave, the temperature in the HT cabinet was increased gradually from 20&#x000b0;C to 30&#x000b0;C between 9:00 and 12:00 in three steps: 20&#x000b0;C at 9:00 h, 24&#x000b0;C at 10:00 h, 28&#x000b0;C at 11:00 h, and 30&#x000b0;C at 12:00 h.

All samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before they were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

They catalyse the first and third steps of the pathway, respectively (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Long et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), and have been reported to be associated with the response to various abiotic stresses in plants (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gong et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Esposito (2016)</xref> reported the involvement of the OPPP in the early response to abiotic stress factors, forming a true metabolic sensor to oxidative stress.

In addition, the removal of heat stress after 5 DAT could also be another factor for the decline in GLS content. In addition to its primary role in response to plant pathogen interaction (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Touw et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), GLS accumulation in response to heat stress has also been previously reported (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Valente Pereira et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Ballesta et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Jasper et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). When plants are stressed, growth is reduced, and carbon utilisation is predominantly diverted towards the production of secondary metabolites. As part of the plant defence mechanism, GLS play important role as osmoprotective compounds (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Ballesta et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), where their concentration increases in response to stress, providing protection against oxidative damage. At 30&#x000b0;C/15&#x000b0;C (day/night) temperature regime, <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> seedlings had significantly higher GLS concentration than plants cultivated at lower temperatures (22&#x000b0;C/15&#x000b0;C and 18&#x000b0;C/12&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Valente Pereira et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GLS mutant experienced a remarkable decline in growth and development and was found to be less heat tolerant than wild-type plants upon exposure to high temperature (Ludwig-<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ller et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, indolic glucosinolate GBS showed a downward trend where concentration decreased gradually in response to heat (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">

In addition, during short-term high-temperature stress, the transcript level of the indolic glucosinolates synthetic genes was predominantly downregulated (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Rao et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Several studies reported that indole GLS are much more sensitive to heat treatment (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bones and Rossiter, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bohinc and Trdan, 2012</xref>) and can demonstrate more thermal degradation than aliphatic GLS at lower temperatures (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Orlemans et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The results of our study indicate that the concentration of GLS in the leaves of <italic>B. napus</italic> is influenced by high-temperature stress, which was previously reported in other <italic>Brassica</italic> species (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Rask et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bohinc and Trdan, 2012</xref>). It also shows that different groups of GLS (aliphatic versus indolic) differ in their response to heat stress. As reported by <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Ljubej et&#x000a0;al.

These mechanisms may prioritise energy towards aliphatic GLS production, which are known to play crucial roles in ROS mitigation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Ballesta et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the reduced availability of GLS precursors, such as nitrogen and sulphur, under stressful conditions may influence the allocation of GLS across plant tissues. In response, plants might break down their GLS and utilise the released sulphur to support primary metabolic processes, such as protein synthesis, within specific organs (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Ballesta et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). This plasticity highlights GLS players in balancing stress resilience and adaptation. By selectively modifying GLS content, plants can fine-tune their responses to stress, meeting immediate defence demands while ensuring long-term survival and reproductive success.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><label>4.4</label><title>Heat stress altered the expression of sulphur assimilation and transport genes</title><p>In the current study, the transcript levels of sulphur assimilation and transport genes were significantly downregulated especially at 2 DAT (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">

Given that GLS compounds are rich in sulphur, assimilation of sulphur is closely associated with GLS biosynthesis.

This renders cysteine an important intersection point between sulphur assimilation and GLS biosynthesis (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Rao et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Such proximity between sulphur and these amino acids makes cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway directly related to GLS biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4_5"><label>4.5</label><title>Heat stress altered sugar metabolism during treatment and recovery periods</title><p>In the present study, heat treatment altered carbohydrate concentration as the amounts of glucose, fructose, and sucrose increased with heat treatment (<xref rid="f11" ref-type="fig">

Several studies have shown that various environmental stresses significantly impact sugar metabolism and transport in plants (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Xalxo et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Mathan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). For instance, drought and salinity stress have been reported to increase sucrose content in both leaf and root tissues of rice (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Mathan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, heat-stressed moth bean seedlings exhibited a notable accumulation of total sugars and proline across different genotypes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Harsh et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Heat stress not only impairs carbohydrate assimilation but also reduces sugar export from leaves (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Julius et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Marias et&#x000a0;al. (2017)</xref> observed increased glucose and fructose levels in the leaves of <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> under heat stress. In maize, high temperatures decreased the 13C export rate from ear leaves, leading to enhanced growth of vegetative parts but reduced grain yield (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Suwa et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). It is proposed that SWEET transporters efflux sucrose into the phloem apoplast, while SUT transporters import sucrose into the sieve element-companion cell complex (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Osorio et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). During heat stress, leaves are the first tissues to sense and suffer from heat damage, and they utilise sugars to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviate oxidative stress. Additionally, sugars serve as an energy source in high-respiration environments, helping maintain cell&#x02013;water balance and membrane integrity through osmotic adjustments (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Burke, 2007</xref>). Given the critical role of sugars in stress responses, the findings of this study, combined with previous observations, suggest that heat stress inhibits sugars export by SWEETs and/or its import by SUTs in heat-stressed leaves, resulting in sugars accumulation. Thereby, maintaining leaf sugar content through reducing source to sink export is considered a tolerance strategy (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Kaushal et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). It is also worth noting that the decrease in sink demand due to growth limitation could also contribute to the accumulation of sugars in the source leaves under stressful conditions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Hummel et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Lemoine et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Through a comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, this study brings evidence for the effect of high temperature stress and, in particular, heatwaves on different functional and metabolic pathways, highlighting its role in the plant stress defence system. More specifically, our results indicated that heat treatment:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>inhibited important metabolic pathways such as respiratory metabolism, namely, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation especially after 48 h of heat treatment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>reduced yield and plant biomass and altered seed composition;</p></list-item><list-item><p>altered sugar and glucosinolate levels in leaves;</p></list-item><list-item><p>induced the expression of 9,933 genes, which were differentially regulated during heat treatment and recovery. Most of the top up- and downregulated genes involved in key biological processes such as heat shock proteins, cellular processes regulation, transcription factors, cell wall remodelling, sugar and secondary metabolites transport, and metabolism.</p></list-item></list><p>Altogether, this study is an attempt to tackle the question of how plants face and adapt to heat stress and to provide insights into the impact of a future warmer climate on plants especially during reproductive stages. At the transcriptomic level, the key DEGs identified in this study could serve as important biomarkers that can be utilised by breeding programs to select cultivars with stronger resistance to heat. In particular, the identified genes could be further characterised and used as genetic markers for marker assisted selection, where plant breeders could select plant performance based on the composition of these genetic biomarkers rather than through waiting for the plants&#x02019; phenotypic performance, thus accelerating traditional crop breeding for stress tolerance traits. In addition, the identified genes could form a target for genome editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), an approach that has already been explored in crop improvement programs especially for rapid development of abiotic stress-tolerant crops (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Zafar et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). This can be applied by modifying sensitive or negatively regulating genes and activating positively regulated genes involved in stress response pathways to enhance the plant&#x02019;s ability to withstand stress (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Finally, this study represents an important step towards developing an understanding of the heat stress response and tolerance mechanisms, a knowledge that could be transferred to other plants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Luke Bell from the University of Reading (School of Agriculture, Policy &#x00026; Development) for providing the reference standards for glucosinolates and Monika Jodkowska from Cranfield University (Plant Science Laboratory) for developing the method for the LC-MS experiment.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
