This condition is characterized by impaired cardiovascular blood flow, excessive metabolic consumption, or inadequate oxygen supply to tissues, resulting in cell and tissue hypoxia. As a result, shock can lead to multisystem organ dysfunction, which in turn can culminate in irreversible damage to vital organs and ultimately fatal outcomes.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Shock is a common condition in critical care medicine, affecting approximately one-third of patients in intensive care units (ICUs).<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Identifying patients with shock and administering appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the early stages are crucial, as these interventions can substantially improve patient prognosis. Delayed diagnosis or failure to initiate treatment promptly can have irreversible consequences. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to determine whether a patient is in a state of shock and to identify the type of shock when the initial signs of abnormality are manifested. During the early stages of shock, patients commonly experience clinical symptoms such as decreased blood pressure, increased lactate concentration, rapid heart rate, and various other manifestations, including pallid skin, cold and clammy extremities, reduced urine output, and possible loss of consciousness.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Shock leads to decreased blood volume, decreased cardiac output, vasodilation, and an abnormal heart rate in patients. These factors can occur independently or coexist, and depending on the specific combination of factors, they can lead to different types of shock.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Despite the diverse natures of shock, a common characteristic of all types of shock is the early onset of hypotension. Detecting and analyzing the clinical indicators of shock can be a useful way to diagnose this condition early and provide timely treatment. By doing so, healthcare professionals can effectively manage the condition, improving patient outcomes.</p><p id="p0035">Shock occurs due to a sudden decrease in blood volume, which leads to tissue hypoxia due to a significant loss of red blood cells.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Peripheral blood circulation has substantial clinical value in the diagnosis and treatment of shock.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Shock is a form of circulatory dysfunction that is caused by the body&#x02019;s inability to maintain sufficient perfusion pressure, resulting in ischemia and hypoxia in various tissues and organs. Peripheral blood circulation refers to blood flow between tissues and cells in the most distant regions of the body, including the fingers, toes, and skin. When shock occurs, peripheral blood circulation is typically the first to be affected, as the body prioritizes adjustments to protect vital organs, such as the heart and brain, resulting in decreased peripheral blood perfusion.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In shock patients, abnormalities in the peripheral blood circulation often manifest as decreased blood pressure, cold and cyanotic skin, and a weak or difficult-to-detect pulse.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Therefore, monitoring the state of peripheral blood circulation is crucial for the early identification of shock.</p><p id="p0040">Various methods and instruments are used in clinical practice to determine whether a patient is experiencing shock. Common indicators include the capillary refill time (CRT), the shock index (SI), arterial lactate levels, and blood pressure. In emergency medical situations, the CRT is often used to assess shock status. This involves pressing a patient&#x02019;s fingertip to turn it white, maintaining this pressure for 15 s, and then releasing this pressure and measuring the time required for the fingertip to return to its full pink color. In healthy subjects, this recovery time is typically less than 2.5 s. This method is a quick and simple way to assess shock and is frequently used in ambulances. However, the use of the CRT in clinical practice has limitations because of subjective differences in observations and the inability to fully quantify the results.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In the emergency room, the SI, lactate levels, and blood pressure are commonly used indicators to assess shock. The lactate level is a biochemical marker that is often used in the diagnosis of shock, and it reflects anaerobic metabolism due to inadequate circulatory oxygen delivery. The SI is calculated by dividing the heart rate (HR) by the systolic blood pressure (SBP). An SI greater than 0.9 often indicates a high probability of shock.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Furthermore, in clinical settings, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and SBP are common indications for observing shock. The equipment that is commonly used to assist in determining whether a patient is in shock includes noninvasive sphygmomanometers, arterial catheters, or ultrasound cardiac output monitors (USCOMs), which are commonly used to measure blood pressure, but all three of these devices carry the risk of endangering a patient who is in shock. Noninvasive sphygmomanometers are useful; however, using these instruments takes time, and their use cannot be continuously tracked. Although arterial catheters offer precise and ongoing data, this approach is invasive and requires longer durations, which can result in additional difficulties.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The USCOM device offers absolute accuracy in blood pressure measurement, and it can be used relatively rapidly; however, its high cost makes it inaccessible to all front-line healthcare professionals who treat shock patients. In the context of developing technologies, blood biomarker measurement methods and imaging scans (CT, MRI, and ultrasound) all have benefits and limitations in terms of the speed of diagnosis as well as the precision and working mechanism of the tests. For example, CT and MRI provide detailed imaging information but are expensive, require specialized skills, and have slower diagnostic speeds.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Ultrasound technology, while fast and noninvasive, demands high technical proficiency of the operator, and the results can be influenced by operator variability. Nevertheless, traditional approaches that are used in the early identification and real-time monitoring of shock have numerous limitations, including the absence of noninvasive examinations, the necessity of professional intervention, and slow detection rates. Additionally, there are challenges in the practical clinical application of emerging technologies, including high equipment costs, operational complexity, and patient discomfort. The crucial limitation of all three devices is that their use requires direct contact with the patient. In cases where patients have open wounds or extensive trauma, as seen in events such as the 2012 Taiwan Formosa Fun Coast dust explosion, which left numerous patients with extensive burns, healthcare personnel may face challenges in diagnosis.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> In future potential warfare scenarios, the number of casualties may suddenly increase to hundreds or thousands. Patients experiencing shock due to explosive impacts must receive immediate treatment due to the severity of their injuries. However, for individuals who cannot be examined by healthcare providers via contact-based diagnostics, the critical treatment window could ultimately be missed. Thus, for a number of conditions, the use of a quick and contactless shock detector is needed, and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), which is used in this study, provides both benefits.</p><p id="p0045">The system architecture of LSCI involves the use of a laser that emits single or multiple wavelengths of light. The laser light is diffused through a diffuser to illuminate the test subject uniformly, resulting in random scattering. After passing through a lens that filters specific wavelengths, the scattered light enters the camera and generates a speckle pattern image. Subsequently, computer processing is used to calculate the speckle contrast, thereby generating an image for blood flow visualization.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Recent advances in LSCI technology have significantly increased its diagnostic capabilities and clinical applications. Innovations in image processing algorithms and the integration of LSCI with other imaging modalities have improved spatial and temporal resolution, data quality, and measurement precision, expanding its clinical utility. LSCI is a dynamic light scattering (DLS)-based spin-off technique that is widely used for noninvasive imaging of blood flow in the brain, skin, muscles, and other biological tissues. These techniques, including laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS), and Doppler optical coherence tomography (DOCT), leverage the principles of DLS to analyze fluctuations in intensity caused by the motion of scattering particles. Due to recent advances in DLS-based imaging, these technologies show great promise in applications such as brain blood flow monitoring, skin perfusion measurements, and noninvasive blood microcirculation characterization.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A recent study by Sdobnov et&#x000a0;al.2024<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> highlighted the application of LSCI in visualizing cerebral hemodynamics in mice, particularly during and after cardiac arrest, emphasizing the potential of LSCI in microcirculation research because of its high temporal resolution and noninvasiveness. Similarly, Zherebtsov et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> demonstrated the clinical utility of DLS sensors in detecting microvascular changes associated with aging and diabetes, validating the potential of LSCI technology for noncontact diagnostics. Zharkikh et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> reviewed biophotonics technologies, including LSCI, for detecting diabetic complications, placing LSCI within a broader context of noninvasive diagnostic applications. Studies by Kalchenko et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> further advanced the field by addressing the limitations of LSCI and exploring its brain imaging applications, providing essential insights into the differentiation of vessel functionality. Additionally, the special issue on &#x0201c;Dynamic Light Scattering in Biomedical Applications&#x0201d;<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> compiled the latest breakthroughs and future directions for DLS-based technologies, further solidifying the potential of LSCI for widespread clinical integration. Previous studies have indicated that when LSCI is used, neurovascular blood flow can be detected in real time, and this approach has been tested in dynamic intraoperative situations.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Furthermore, continuous blood flow visualization during neurosurgery has been achieved via LSCI, providing valuable real-time feedback to surgeons.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Preclinical studies have also validated the use of LSCI for real-time visualization of cerebral blood flow during cerebrovascular surgery, highlighting its practical applications in critical surgical procedures. Currently, in clinical medicine, LSCI is used in ophthalmology to record variations in retinal blood flow, in dermatology to assess the depth of burns in patients and to observe facial microvasculature, and in neurosurgery and gastrointestinal surgery as an additional tool for surgery and diagnostics.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> These studies and clinical applications underscore the versatility of LSCI, demonstrating its emerging role in real-time surgical feedback as well as its potential for broader integration across various medical fields.</p><p id="p0050">LSCI is a noncontact, medical imaging method that allows rapid visualization of blood perfusion. LSCI has widespread use in clinical settings. However, LSCI has not been used to observe peripheral blood circulation to identify patients in shock. Unlike contact-based devices, LSCI captures speckle patterns via a high-resolution camera after a biological tissue is illuminated with laser light. Therefore, LSCI does not require any physical contact with the patient. LSCI simply needs to be aimed at the region of interest (ROI) for imaging, substantially reducing the risk of infection. With the use of LSCI technology, healthcare professionals can immediately observe blood flow within the scanning area. After the initial blood flow image is obtained, two distinct regions of interest (ROIs<sub>1</sub> and ROI<sub>2</sub>) can be selected on the screen for tracking analysis. By calculating and comparing the speckle contrast in these two areas, the difference in blood flow velocity can be determined. Subtracting the speckle contrast of these two regions yields the ROI difference (ROI diff), which clearly reflects the difference in blood flow between these intervals. In shock patients, the body responds to symptoms of low blood pressure caused by shock by activating the cardiovascular system directly through the medulla oblongata and reticular activating substances in the brainstem. This cardiovascular activation occurs through the sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate, myocardial contractility, and peripheral blood vessel constriction.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> When peripheral blood vessels constrict in the human body, the flow of blood entering the constricted vessels is substantially reduced to increase blood pressure to a normal state. To assess the effectiveness of LSCI in detecting peripheral blood circulation and identifying patients who are in shock, this study was conducted in partnership with Changhua Christian Hospital. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and practicality of LSCI in identifying shock patients in a clinical setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="p0055">This section presents findings from our two-phase study on the use of LSCI to diagnose shock. The main results focus on our primary investigation (Phase 1), which aimed to evaluate the performance of LSCI in identifying shock patients and establishing diagnostic criteria. To comprehensively assess the clinical value of LSCI, we analyzed common shock detection standards and their clinical application, and then, we conducted in-depth comparisons between LSCI and traditional methods. We then present findings from our supplementary study (Phase 2), which explored the performance of LCSI across different shock types and its relationship with heart rate variability (HRV) in shock patients. By presenting both phases and evaluating common shock detection standards, we provide a thorough assessment of LSCI as a novel shock diagnosis tool, address its standalone performance and compare it to established clinical standards. This approach offers insights into the potential value and applications of LCSI in clinical practice.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Laboratory safety for participants and medical personnel</title><p id="p0060">No safety-related incidents occurred during either phase of this study, in which medical personnel used LSCI to diagnose shock. In both phases, patients in the experimental groups were experiencing shock or were about to enter that state. The experimental groups consisted of 20 shock patients each, for a total of 40 shock patients across the two phases. Healthcare providers closely monitored vital signs using various instruments to ensure patient safety while using LSCI to assess shock symptoms. To prevent laser-induced injuries, the intensity of the laser used in the clinical trials was set to a safe level (600 mA), thus posing no threat to users. In both experimental groups, shock participants, including some elderly individuals, were brought to the hospital under emergency conditions. As shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, most patients had at least one condition in their past medical history (PMH), including various chronic conditions such as hypertension (H.T.N.), diabetes mellitus (D.M.), or cardiovascular disease (C.V.D.). Due to these varied medical histories, medical personnel closely monitored the volunteers' physiological states, especially those of older individuals, to prevent accidental injury during testing. The examination of shock patients was facilitated by the adjustable position and noncontact nature of LSCI. Healthcare professionals could easily adjust the LSCI position, allowing measurements to be taken even when patients were immobile. This high maneuverability and noncontact design allowed for shock assessments without causing additional harm to elderly or severely injured patients, thus ensuring a safe and effective testing environment in both phases of the study. In the second phase, additional safety measures were implemented for the simultaneous ECG measurements, ensuring that the combined use of LSCI and ECG posed no additional risks to the patients.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Basic information of the study group and the control group</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="3"/><th colspan="2">Study Group<hr/></th><th colspan="2">Control Group<hr/></th><th rowspan="3"><italic>p</italic>-value</th><th rowspan="3">Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic></th></tr><tr><th colspan="2"><italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;= 20<hr/></th><th colspan="2"><italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;= 20<hr/></th></tr><tr><th>n(%);

The characteristics of the study and control groups, such as gender, age, height, weight, body temperature, and blood oxygen levels, were not significantly different from each other. However, compared with the control group, the study group presented with significantly lower blood pressure. Additionally, the study group had a significantly higher HR, RR, and CRT as well as a higher prevalence of conditions such as heart disease and cancer.

Blood pressure and flow velocity gradually decrease from the aorta to the microvasculature.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>, the blood pressure of a shock patient is markedly lower than that of a healthy subject at the beginning of blood circulation (in the aorta), decreases toward the end of blood circulation and becomes more uniform in the microvasculature. Therefore, the difference in blood pressure between the initial blood pressure and the overlapping point in shock patients (Y)&#x000a0;is smaller than the difference in healthy individuals (X). From this inference, it can be concluded that shock patients exhibit smaller changes in blood flow velocity. On the basis of this conclusion, using LSCI to observe lower differences in measurement values between the proximal (heart) and distal (limb peripheries) regions may indicate a lower blood pressure proximally or the potential risk of shock in the patient. In the case of shock, different tissues and organs may suffer from ischemia and hypoxia due to the body&#x02019;s inability to maintain sufficient perfusion pressure, which leads to circulatory dysfunction. As the body tries to protect vital organs, peripheral blood perfusion is often reduced. Therefore, evaluating the condition of the peripheral blood circulation is important for the early diagnosis of shock. To validate this theoretical understanding and assess the effectiveness of LSCI in detecting peripheral blood circulation and identifying patients who are in shock, we conducted a comprehensive study in partnership with Changhua Christian Hospital. We collected physiological data, blood test results, and ROI diff values derived from LSCI measurements from 40 volunteers who worked at Changhua Christian Hospital between January 1 and December 30, 2022. Following the participants&#x02019; classification into shock-positive and shock-negative control groups, the data were subjected to numerous statistical analyses, such as ROC curve, boxplot, Spearman correlation, Mann&#x02012;Whitney U test, and chi-square tests. Using the Mann&#x02012;Whitney U test and the chi&#x02012;square test, <italic>p</italic> values were computed, indicating notable differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of physiological data as well as ROI diff values derived from the LSCI measurements. This finding suggests that the experimental and control groups differ in terms of ROI diff values and is consistent with the anticipated clinical presentations of shock patients.<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Graph of blood pressure changes in healthy subjects and shock patients</p><p>This figure shows that while the blood pressures in the microvascular segments of the two groups of patients tended to be similar, the blood pressure in the proximal aorta of a patient experiencing shock was substantially lower than that of a healthy patient; as a result, it can be concluded that the change in flow velocity (X)&#x000a0;of shock patients was lower than that of healthy subjects on the basis of the difference between the proximal blood pressure of shock patients and the coincident blood pressure (Y). According to this conclusion, a subject is highly likely to be in a state of shock when the proximal blood pressure is lower, and the difference between the proximal (in the knuckle) and distal (in the fingernail) measurements observed by LSCI is lower in a shock patient than the average value of healthy subjects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p><p id="p0125">The results from the boxplot analysis indicate that there is an overlap in the range of ROI diff data, which may lead to an increased risk of misdiagnosing shock. Additionally, Spearman&#x02019;s correlation analysis revealed correlations between ROI diff values and physiological indicators such as HR, SBP, and MAP. These findings are consistent with the clinical features that are commonly observed in patients with shock. Using an ROC curve for the final examination, ROI diff was examined and found to have moderate accuracy in diagnosing shock. A specific threshold of ROI diff &#x0003c;6966.43 was selected to diagnose shock. After accounting for all the statistical findings, we can say that LSCI, in fact, offers a basis for diagnosing shock via the ROI diff values that are obtained. However, when LSCI is used to identify shock, the degree of data overlap could result in a higher misdiagnosis rate.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>More accurate criteria for shock diagnosis</title><p id="p0130">Given the potential overlap in ROI diff data between shock and non-shock patients, more accurate diagnostic criteria for shock were needed. We statistically compared the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values to determine whether ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> was better at identifying shock patients to address the problem of overlapping ROI diff data between the experimental and control groups, which resulted in increased rates of misdiagnosis. First, the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values in the experimental and control groups were compared via the Mann&#x02012;Whitney U test; both produced <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05, indicating significant differences. However, the boxplots revealed that the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> data distribution did not overlap as much as the ROI diff data distribution did. This suggested that the rate of misdiagnosis due to overlapping data could be reduced if the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value was used as the basis for shock identification. The correlations between the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values and the physiological data were compared. Compared with the ROI diff value, the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value was not only correlated with SBP, MAP, and HR but also correlated with RR. Furthermore, the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value was more strongly correlated with SBP, HR, and RR. Finally, a comprehensive comparison of the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value with the ROI diff value was performed via the ROC curve and the confusion matrix to assess their accuracy. The ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value had a greater AUC and a <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.001, indicating a highly significant difference according to the validation results of the ROC curve. This outcome demonstrated that the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value provided better shock detection performance and justification. The associated criterion, which was determined from the ROC curve and used as a reference point for the use of the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values in diagnosing shock, was then used to create a confusion matrix. It is evident from the results of the confusion matrix analysis that using the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value rather than the ROI diff value for shock diagnosis yields better results in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score. This means that the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value can identify shock more accurately and demonstrates better performance in shock diagnosis. On the basis of these statistical results, when the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value is used as a reference, LSCI can be used to determine whether a patient is in shock by measuring the blood volume in the fingertip.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Comparison of the developed LSCI technology and conventional methods for shock diagnosis</title><p id="p0135">To comprehensively assess the performance of LSCI for detecting shock, we first evaluated commonly used shock detection parameters, including MAP, SBP, HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). The comprehensive evaluation of these common shock detection standards supported their integration into clinical protocols for early and accurate shock diagnosis. While the AUC value for ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> was slightly lower than that for some traditional methods, LSCI technology offers significant advantages in rapid and noninvasive blood flow change measurements.</p><p id="p0140">By comparing the ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values obtained by observing patients with LSCI and the results of conventional SI, we found that LSCI could comprehensively and rapidly detect microcirculatory changes with high sensitivity, as shown by the correlation and accuracy of the physiological data; these results highlight the advantages of LSCI technology. First, the feasibility and benefits of LSCI in different groups were verified via systematic data analysis. Compared with conventional SI, the LSCI technique provides more evaluative information, including a quantitative assessment of microcirculatory abnormalities, blood flow velocity, and vascular density, which are important indicators of pre-shock onset. Furthermore, regarding the correlation with physiological data, we observed that the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values obtained with LSCI were correlated to a certain degree with the participants' physiological parameters, such as SBP, MAP, and HR. This finding indicates that LSCI technology has the ability to reflect the physiological status of patients.</p><p id="p0145">Furthermore, in the ROC curve analysis, our study revealed that the shock indicators that were obtained by LSCI (ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub>) exhibited high accuracy, with values of 72.5% and 82.5%, respectively; these results demonstrated the substantial effectiveness of LSCI in distinguishing between shock and non-shock patients. In terms of measurement speed, convenience, and hygiene, LSCI technology has important advantages. Previously, obtaining SI values required simultaneous data about blood pressure and heart rate. Traditional blood pressure monitors and heart rate monitors typically require more than a minute to collect measurements, and both methods require contact with the patient. Traditional blood pressure monitors also have the disadvantage of being unable to provide real-time measurements. However, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>, LSCI, whether the ROI diff or ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> value is used as an indicator, can be used to diagnose whether a patient is experiencing shock with a certain level of accuracy in a short time, i.e., as little as 30 s. LSCI can also continuously monitor a patient&#x02019;s current blood circulation status in real time, demonstrating the stability and rapid imaging capabilities of LSCI technology. In addition, measurements can be conducted without direct contact with the patient, further reducing hygiene concerns.</p><p id="p0150">The findings of this study confirm that LSCI technology offers rapid, noninvasive, contactless, and continuous monitoring capabilities. The speed at which LSCI provides critical information can allow healthcare professionals to obtain vital microcirculation indicators, significantly improving the real-time monitoring of a patient&#x02019;s condition. Its noninvasive and contactless nature offers a comfortable testing experience for patients while reducing the risk of cross-infections. Compared with traditional methods, LSCI delivers more comprehensive assessment criteria and demonstrates strong correlations with certain physiological parameters and accuracy. Additionally, the ability of LSCI to complete blood flow measurements within 30&#x000a0;s is crucial for managing acute shock cases, providing real-time insights into microcirculatory changes, especially in&#x000a0;situations where patient contact is not&#x000a0;possible or traditional methods cannot be applied, such as open trauma or extensive burns. Traditional shock assessment methods, such as the measurement of MAP, SBP, HR, and SpO<sub>2,</sub> remain widely used in clinical settings because of their reliability in providing physiological information. However, these methods often require direct patient contact and, in some cases, are invasive (e.g., arterial catheter pressure measurement), which can increase the risk of infection, particularly in patients with severe trauma or burns. Furthermore, traditional methods tend to be slower, potentially delaying diagnosis and treatment. In contrast, the rapid and noncontact nature of LSCI makes it an effective supplementary tool, allowing for quick decision-making in clinical scenarios requiring immediate action. Nevertheless, LSCI also has limitations. While it can provide accurate blood flow information rapidly, its ability to assess the hemodynamics of deeper vessels is less advanced than that of imaging technologies such as CT and MRI, which offer more detailed views of tissues and organs. Additionally, LSCI data may be influenced by environmental lighting conditions, although we mitigated this influence in this study by normalizing the ROI values. Compared with traditional shock indicators such as the SI and CRT, the indicators obtained with LSCI have significant advantages. Although the SI&#x000a0;is&#x000a0;widely used in clinical practice, LSCI provides more comprehensive assessment criteria, particularly for microcirculation research. Similarly, both the CRT and LSCI can be used to detect shock rapidly, but numerous studies have indicated that the CRT can be affected by subjective influence, is difficult to quantify, and currently cannot be continuously monitored in real time,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> highlighting the clear advantages of LSCI.</p><p id="p0155">This capability is crucial in clinical situations requiring quick decision-making, such as during surgical procedures or in emergency rooms.

In the clinical diagnosis of shock, medical personnel first evaluate a patient&#x02019;s SBP, MAP, and lactate concentration and then evaluate whether any of these three indicators exceeds the clinical criteria for shock diagnosis to determine whether the patient is experiencing shock. However, three of the twenty patients in this clinical trial who were experiencing shock did not meet the requirements for shock diagnosis, including lactate concentration, MAP, or SBP, as shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>.

The laser light source emitted near-infrared light with a wavelength of 805&#x000a0;nm, and a diffusion device was used to reduce the intensity of the light source and increase the area covered by the light source. A scattered light source with a wavelength of 805&#x000a0;nm was collected by a filtering device, and the data were transmitted to a computer device through a transmission line to record the ROI values, with a focus on the fingernail and the skin of the index finger.

Our study found that the MAP model missed 12 patients, while LSCI successfully identified 7 of these as potential shock cases. Similarly, SBP missed 9 patients, with LSCI successfully identifying 7 of these as potential shock cases. These results highlight LSCI&#x02019;s advantage as an auxiliary tool that is capable of identifying potential shock patients missed by conventional methods. This finding suggests that LSCI may provide additional diagnostic information in&#x000a0;situations where traditional methods may lack sensitivity. However, it should be noted that the criteria for shock diagnosis may vary due to the use of different LSCI instruments and environmental conditions. Additionally, the advantage of LSCI lies in its ability to be used effectively in a variety of clinical conditions. This clinical trial demonstrated the effectiveness of LSCI in identifying shock. Compared with traditional shock indicators and methods, LSCI has the advantages of rapid and real-time monitoring, and more importantly, it can be used to diagnose patients without touching them, extending its applicability beyond general shock patients. Our comprehensive study encompassed various aspects of LSCI&#x02019;s performance in shock detection. We evaluated LSCI across different types of shock and conducted comparative analyses with traditional shock detection methods. The results consistently showed that both ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values were lower in the shock group than in the control group across all shock types. This finding underscores the robustness of LSCI in detecting shock across various clinical presentations. Furthermore, we performed extensive comparisons between LSCI and traditional methods such as MAP, SBP, HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> using ROC curve analyses and confusion matrices. These comparisons provided valuable insights into the relative strengths of LSCI and conventional shock detection techniques. Notably, our investigation also extended to analyzing HRV parameters, revealing significant differences between shock patients and the control group. This observation opens up new avenues for understanding the physiological responses in shock and potentially enhances our diagnostic capabilities. Even for patients with extensive trauma where contact-based detection is not possible or for patients with multiple types of trauma, LSCI enables frontline medical personnel to examine these patients more easily, as it reduces testing time by more than 50% compared with traditional methods and eliminates the need for complex professional operations. The second phase of our study further confirmed the advantages of LSCI for detecting various types of shock (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>). Importantly, this phase demonstrated the ability of LSCI to quickly identify potential shock patients regardless of the shock type. This finding has significant clinical implications, suggesting that LSCI could be a versatile tool for detecting various types of shock. The multi-functionality of LSCI enables healthcare providers to make timely and beneficial medical decisions, potentially improving patient outcomes. This is particularly crucial in emergency and intensive care settings where rapid and accurate diagnosis is vital.</p><p id="p0170">A growing body of research has shown that LSCI holds significant potential in noninvasive medical diagnostics, particularly in peripheral hemodynamic monitoring.

The research was conducted in two phases, with experimental data collected at Changhua Christian Hospital in Taiwan. It should be noted that the main content of this paper focuses on the first phase of the trial, while the second phase yielded supplementary data.</p><p id="p0250">The first phase (IRB number: 211116) is the core of this research and aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of LSCI in identifying shock patients. The primary purpose of this phase was to establish standards for shock identification using LSCI and to conduct an in-depth comparison of physiological data between the experimental and control groups. The research focused on exploring the application of ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values in shock detection, while also analyzing the performance of LSCI in identifying shock across different time windows. Furthermore, this phase assessed the potential clinical application of LSCI as a diagnostic tool for shock. This phase recruited 40 Chinese participants residing in Taiwan. Among them, 20 participants exhibiting shock symptoms formed the experimental group, while the other 20 healthy individuals served as the control group. The shock group included 14 males and 6 females, while the control group comprised 8 males and 12 females. All shock participants, some of whom were elderly, were admitted to the hospital under emergency conditions. The majority of these patients had at least one chronic underlying condition, including hypertension (H.T.N.), diabetes mellitus (DM), or cardiovascular disease (CVD). More detailed information can be found in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>.</p><p id="p0255">The second phase (IRB number: 230705) served as a supplementary study and to obtain further knowledge about the application of LSCI in shock diagnosis. This phase primarily focused on studying the performance of LSCI across different types of shock while introducing electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements as an auxiliary standard for shock assessment. The study analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) performance in shock patients and explored the correlation between LSCI and HRV parameters. Through these additional measurements and analyses, the second phase trial further validated the reliability of LSCI in diagnosing shock. This phase also included 40 participants, with 20 shock patients in the study group and 20 healthy individuals in the control group. In this phase, the shock and control groups consisted of 9 males and 11 females. Similar to the first phase, shock patients in the second phase also had various chronic underlying diseases, the specific composition of which can be found in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>.</p><p id="p0260">In both phases, healthcare professionals screened shock patients who had not received inotropic or vasoconstrictor agents based on early shock symptoms (systolic blood pressure&#x000a0;&#x0003c;95&#x000a0;mmHg, mean arterial pressure&#x000a0;&#x0003c;65&#x000a0;mmHg, and lactate concentration &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;mmol/L) and clinical manifestations of shock. For safety considerations, both studies excluded patients with trauma, peripheral vascular diseases, chronic wounds, and other severe cases of shock.</p><p id="p0265">The research procedure was generally similar in both phases. When clinical physicians diagnosed patients with shock and their conditions had stabilized, the research team obtained consent from the patients' families. Subsequently, researchers immediately used LSCI to record patients' ROI data. In the second phase, LSCI measurements were conducted simultaneously with ECG measurements to collect ROI data and electrocardiogram data concurrently. This synchronized measurement method allowed us to calculate HRV-related parameters and examine their correlation with LSCI data, thereby comprehensively assessing shock patients' hemodynamics and autonomic nervous system function.</p><p id="p0270">All participants and their families were informed about the experimental plan and signed informed consent forms. Although sex was recorded for all participants, neither study specifically analyzed the influence of sex on the results, which remains a limitation of the research. The combined objective of these two phases was to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of LSCI in identifying and diagnosing different types of shock patients, and to explore the correlation between LSCI and other physiological parameters, thus providing a scientific basis for clinical applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8.3"><title>Method details</title><sec id="sec8.3.1"><title>Experimental methods</title><p id="p0275">This study recruited a total of 80 participants across two phases, with 40 participants in each phase. The grouping and experimental procedures were performed according to the flow chart in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A. In both phases, LSCI was employed to monitor each participant continuously for 60 seconds, with an average sampling rate of 2.7&#x000a0;Hz. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B illustrates the collaborative use of LSCI by healthcare professionals to detect shock in participants. All participants underwent LSCI examination without direct contact with the device. To determine the regions of interest (ROIs) during LSCI testing, we conducted preliminary experiments to identify the optimal observation areas. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>C, blood flow patterns on both the back of the hand and the palm exhibited prominent blood flow at the fingertips. Blood circulation is most pronounced in the fingers; capillary beds in the finger tips are characterized by shallow and dense microvessels, making them highly responsive to changes in blood circulation.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> This observation aligns with findings by Ruan et&#x000a0;al.<italic>,</italic><xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> who reported significant changes in the perfusion index (PI) in the fingertips of patients with septic shock, highlighting the sensitivity of fingertips compared with that of the less responsive finger joints. Based on these observations, during the enrollment process, ROIs in the fingernail area (ROI<sub>1</sub>) and the skin on the fingertip (ROI<sub>2</sub>) of the index finger or middle finger were selected, as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;7</xref>A and 7B. When healthcare professionals placed a participant's hand in the sensing area and activated the LSCI system, they selected these key observation points. It was essential to verify that the chosen detection area did not extend beyond the fingertip to avoid inaccuracies in the test results. After a continuous 60-second recording, the values obtained were stored in a folder. The subsequent calculation involved subtracting ROI<sub>2</sub> from ROI<sub>1</sub> to derive the ROI difference (ROI diff), which was used to assess blood flow. Additionally, we normalized the ROI diff by dividing it by ROI<sub>2</sub> (ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub>), using ROI<sub>2</sub> as a reference point, to mitigate potential variations in light interference during clinical measurements due to different environmental conditions.</p><p id="p0280">In the first phase, various physiological parameters (blood pressure, BT, HR, RR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, CBC) were measured after LSCI. In the second phase, in addition to LSCI measurements, we simultaneously conducted ECG measurements. The ECG device was attached to a different finger not observed by LSCI, allowing us to gather complementary data. This ECG measurement was conducted for approximately 90 seconds, providing data for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis.</p><p id="p0285">After completing the data collection for all participants in both phases, analyses were performed to validate whether the ROI diff values in the experimental and control groups were correlated with changes in blood flow during shock. Additionally, correlation analyses were performed to examine the associations between the ROI diff values, physiological parameters, and HRV parameters (in the second phase). This comprehensive approach allowed us to not only assess the effectiveness of LSCI in identifying shock but also to explore its relationship with other physiological indicators, particularly HRV, thus providing a more holistic view of shock diagnosis and monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.3.2"><title>LSCI principles</title><p id="p0290">Laser speckle is a random intensity distribution formed due to the scattering of light in a medium.

The instrument comprises a semiconductor laser light source that emits near-infrared (NIR) light at a wavelength of 805&#x000a0;nm and a power of 500 mW (ML620G40, Thorlabs, USA). To enable the penetration of light into human skin, an integrated laser diode driver (SF8075-NM, Maiman Electronics, Russia) is used in conjunction with control software to adjust the output energy. A circular diffuser (ED1-C50, Thorlabs, USA) attached to the laser output scatters light at a 50&#x000b0; angle to increase the illuminated area on the target and ensure equal distribution. The area scan camera (acA1300-200&#x003bc;m, Basler, Germany) used in the image acquisition system has a complementary metal&#x02012;oxide&#x02012;semiconductor (CMOS) sensor and can take pictures with a resolution of 1280&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1024 pixels. To achieve optical magnification ranging from 0.084&#x000d7; to 0.84&#x000d7;, we utilized a macrozoom lens (MLH-10&#x000d7;, Computar, Japan) that offers a focal length of 0.15 to 0.45&#x000a0;m and an aperture ranging from F5.6 to F32C. This lens provides flexible adjustment options for magnification, zoom, and focus, allowing it to seamlessly adapt to varying focal lengths across different operational distances and imaging scenarios. During measurement, the distance between the lens and the target was maintained at 30&#x000a0;cm, and the energy was uniformly dispersed through a diffuser within the imaging area of 20&#x000d7;15&#x000a0;cm. A total of 96.7% of the field of view (FoV) falls within the full width at half maximum (FWHM), with a power range of 238.3 to 525.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;W reaching the target. A bandpass filter is placed in front of the lens to reduce interference and mistakes caused by outside light. This ensures that the images that are captured are solely the result of the NIR laser (805&#x000a0;nm) light reaching the CMOS sensor. The area scan camera, with an exposure time of 5&#x000a0;ms and a frame rate of 15 fps for each flow speed, transmits the received data to a computer for computation to visualize the blood circulation in the illuminated area. The LSCI program system<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> is designed to track the target patient, can perform real-time perfusion calculations over a wide region, and allows users to adjust the laser light source and image sensor. Through this system, users can observe real-time images, control the laser output, and select ROIs to record and observe the blood flow data. The recorded data, including NIR images, LSCI images, and perfusion data, are stored as .csv files.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8.4"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p id="p0340">The physiological data and various participant test results are presented as the mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1; standard deviation, median, and quantity (%). Differences in the means and standard deviations were used to assess the normality of the data distribution. For the analysis of the ROI diff, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), body temperature (BT), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), height, and weight, the Mann&#x02012;Whitney U test and Z test were used to determine whether there were differences in physiological values between the experimental and control groups, with a predefined significance level of &#x003b1; equal to 0.05. Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> was calculated to assess the effect size of these differences, providing an indication of the practical significance of the results (as shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).

With this analysis, we sought to determine whether there was a correlation between ROI diff and blood tests. Correlations that were significant at the 0.01 level are marked with two asterisks (&#x02217;&#x02217;), and those significant at the 0.05 level are marked with a single asterisk (&#x02217;) (as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p id="p0350">ROC curves were plotted for both the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values (as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>), the analysis of ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> over different periods (as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>), and the analysis of MAP and SBP (as shown in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). The analysis included parameters such as the area under the curve (AUC), 95% confidence interval (CI), <italic>p</italic> value, and associated criterion. These metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy, reliability and threshold values of LSCI in the identification of shock patients. The associated criteria obtained from the ROC curves were the basis for determining shock. The confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, and F1 score for the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values were calculated, providing a comprehensive assessment of the performance of LSCI in the identification of shock. A comparison of the accuracy of the ROI diff and ROI diff/ROI<sub>2</sub> values in identifying shock patients was conducted.</p><p id="p0355">Statistical analysis was performed via MedCalc Statistical Software (MedCalc 2023, Ostend, Belgium), and MS Excel (Excel LTSC Professional Plus 2021; Microsoft, Seattle, Washington, USA) was used for the statistical calculations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haseer Koya</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><part-title>Shock</part-title><source>StatPearls, (StatPearls Publishing Copyright &#x000a9; 2024</source><year>2024</year><publisher-name>StatPearls Publishing LLC</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sakr</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinhart</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>J.-L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sprung</surname><given-names>C.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ranieri</surname><given-names>V.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>De Backer</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Payen</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Does dopamine administration in shock influence outcome?
