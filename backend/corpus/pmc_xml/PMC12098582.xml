The &#x02018;pressure field&#x02019; visualizes mean perfusion pressure as the product of stroke volume and a beat-to-beat measure of vascular tone, termed systemic elastance. The pressure field guided the titration of inotropes and vasopressors at high doses, including norepinephrine equivalents &#x0003e;2.5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, to restore the patient&#x02019;s estimated pre-morbid pressure field values. Urine output was maintained throughout with no ileus. We hypothesize that pressure field management assists in individualizing care for patients with septic shock and improves outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pressure field</kwd><kwd>septic shock</kwd><kwd>elastance</kwd><kwd>perfusion</kwd><kwd>personalized hemodynamics</kwd><kwd>norepinephrine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="2"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="4747"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-at-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Intensive Care Medicine and Anesthesiology</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Septic shock has an in-hospital mortality rate of 30%&#x02013;40% (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), a 5-year mortality rate of 80% (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and morbidity among survivors.

Three years after the diagnosis of viral cardiomyopathy, he (at 57&#x0202f;years of age and 90&#x0202f;kg) presented to his family physician with a rapid pulse following 3&#x0202f;days of increasing fatigue. His family physician recommended ambulance transfer to our hospital; he initially refused but presented to our hospital several hours later that same day. On arrival, he was hypotensive (BP 70/50) with rapid atrial fibrillation (150&#x02013;180&#x0202f;bpm), cool peripheries, and confusion. A flecainide infusion (150&#x0202f;mg) and intravenous metoprolol (5&#x0202f;mg) were administered, restoring sinus rhythm. The patient progressed to pulmonary edema, became diaphoretic and confused, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>2.2</label><title>Initial ICU crisis response</title><p>A central line was inserted, and epinephrine was initiated and titrated up to 1.1&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min to support blood pressure (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring was then urgently commenced using the Edwards Lifesciences (CA, United States) EV1000 monitoring platform with a radial arterial line connected via a FloTrac transducer (v3.0) and transduced central venous pressure (CVP). The patient&#x02019;s MAP was 80&#x0202f;mmHg, CVP 21&#x0202f;mmHg, and SV 45&#x0202f;mL/beat. The patient was intubated, and transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated profoundly depressed biventricular function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) showed pH 7.28, actual base excess (ABE) -9.0&#x0202f;mmol/L, and P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ratio 103 (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

In response, blood pressure improved with a small increase in SV. An amiodarone infusion was commenced to prevent the recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Cefazolin (1&#x0202f;g) was administered intravenously because sepsis could not be excluded, and sodium bicarbonate (150 mmol in four doses) was given intravenously to improve acidemia.</p><p>On day 2, MPP fell below 60&#x0202f;mmHg and SV to 29&#x0202f;mL/beat (see the orange dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and in response, drug doses were further titrated up, with the epinephrine dose reaching 1.3&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, milrinone 0.6&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, and norepinephrine 1.2&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The doses of epinephrine and norepinephrine were titrated down to 0.9&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min when SV reached 40&#x0202f;mL/beat. SV continued to improve, eventually doubling to 78&#x0202f;mL/beat, although blood pressure increased only marginally and stabilized at an MPP of 55&#x02013;65&#x0202f;mmHg with a MAP of 75&#x02013;85&#x0202f;mmHg (see the green dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Blood cultures grew Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. Antibiotic cover was broadened to include erythromycin (1&#x0202f;g daily) and metronidazole (500&#x0202f;mg three times per day). The Gram-negative rod was later identified as <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic>. Severe cardiomyopathy with overt heart failure, possibly precipitated by infection from an unknown source, still appeared the most likely cause of shock.</p><p>Over days 3 to 6, blood pressure was maintained, but SV gradually declined from its peak of 78&#x0202f;mL/beat (see the yellow dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), despite an average epinephrine dose of 1&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, an average norepinephrine dose of 0.9&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, and the addition of metaraminol on day 3 at an average dose of 1.6&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, with dosage adjustments (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) assessed by reviewing the impact on the pressure field. A levosimendan infusion was administered on days 3 and 4 at 0.1&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min. Urine output was maintained throughout, and the initial acidemia was resolved by day 5 (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>On day 5, the positive fluid balance reached 15 L, primarily due to the diluents used with infused drugs. Urine output remained unresponsive to diuretics; therefore, although the acidemia had already resolved, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated to manage fluid overload (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> for fluid balances). Late that evening, right upper lobe consolidation became apparent (possibly due to the gradual resolution of pulmonary edema), and sepsis appeared increasingly likely as the cause of shock. A single dose of ceftriaxone (2&#x0202f;g) was administered, and erythromycin and metronidazole were continued.</p><p>On day 6, MPP fell to 55&#x0202f;mmHg (see the yellow dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) due to a slow deterioration in SV (a fall to 44&#x0202f;mL/beat), offset partially by an increase in vascular tone (increased E<sub>sys</sub>). Despite severe ventricular dysfunction, vasopressin was commenced at 0.04&#x0202f;units/min. Hemodynamic improvements occurred soon after. Blood pressure and SV increased, while E<sub>sys</sub> fell overnight and continued to improve the following day (see the green dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Metaraminol was discontinued by midday, and norepinephrine was discontinued by the evening of day 7. Vasopressin was ceased early on day 8, at which point MPP had increased to 68&#x0202f;mmHg, MAP to 84&#x0202f;mmHg, and SV to 57&#x0202f;mL/beat.</p><p>Epinephrine and milrinone were weaned and ceased over days 8 to 13 as hemodynamics continued to improve. On day 12, with antibiotic sensitivities available, erythromycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and meropenem (1&#x0202f;g three times per day) was commenced, although the patient had largely recovered.</p><p>By the morning of day 14, with no vasopressor support, MPP was 77&#x0202f;mmHg, MAP 87&#x0202f;mmHg, and SV 65&#x0202f;mL/beat, with these values approaching the patient&#x02019;s estimated pre-morbid pressure field values (see the green dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The SV recovery suggested that sepsis was the sole cause of biventricular dysfunction.</p><p>Hemodynamic monitoring and CRRT were ceased, and the patient was transferred to a lower acuity ward.

The method is an alternative to population-based disease-specific protocols such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), to which strict adherence in this case would have resulted in early fluid loading of a failing heart and acceptance of an MPP of 45&#x0202f;mmHg (that is, a MAP of 65&#x0202f;mmHg with a CVP of 20&#x0202f;mmHg).

Elastance has been argued to be a better measure of ventricular afterload than SVR, as demonstrated by Sunagawa (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) using Otto Frank&#x02019;s pressure-volume loops (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and its measurement in the intact circulation is validated (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the traditional Starling and Guyton pressure equation, CO represents the load transferred by the heart to create blood pressure, and SVR is the resistive force. Clinicians recognize that CO is a composite measure, that can be broken down into SV and heart rate. Equally critically, SVR can be broken down such that</p><disp-formula id="EQ2">

In shock states, both elastance and heart rate commonly increase, so SVR may appear stable (implying no change) or even decrease (implying vasodilation) when there is significant constriction (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) of the arterioles (the main site of resistance in the circulation (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)); see <xref rid="EQ2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>. This pattern was observed in the primary patient reported in this study on day 1 during rapid atrial fibrillation. We hypothesize that expressing perfusion pressure in terms of its ventricular and vascular components, SV and E<sub>sys</sub> (rather than CO and SVR), provides clinicians with more granular information, particularly in relation to vascular tone, and enables earlier, more targeted diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The second element of pressure field management involves identifying and managing personalized hemodynamic zones defined in terms of MPP, SV, and E<sub>sys</sub>. Explicitly estimating a patient&#x02019;s pre-morbid pressure field values usefully informs management. We intend to publish further guidance; however, a useful rule of thumb for the normal adult population is an SV of 1.1&#x0202f;mL/kg/beat and an MPP of 80&#x02013;100&#x0202f;mmHg (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). For the primary patient reported, given the history of viral cardiomyopathy, the target SV was revised downward.</p><p>The third element of pressure field management involves visualizing a patient&#x02019;s pressure field in a graph with SV on the y-axis and E<sub>sys</sub> on the x-axis (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This graph provides an instantaneous view of how SV and E<sub>sys</sub> relate to a particular MPP, and sequential plotting of this interaction enables the detection of small directional changes in the beat-to-beat ventricular and vascular contributions to blood pressure. This image provides an <italic>integrated</italic> picture of patient physiology <italic>over time</italic> and thus provides a simple and intuitive means of understanding disease progression and changes in response to treatment.</p><p>The pressure field substantially addresses the need to differentiate between preload, afterload, and contractility: changes in the x-axis (changes in E<sub>sys</sub>) represent changes in vascular tone and are managed with vasopressors and vasodilators, with the dose being titrated against a physiological response. Changes in the y-axis (SV) are the result of changes in preload and contractility and are managed with fluids and inotropes.</p><p>In managing patients with septic shock, there are typically many steps forward and backward, requiring many therapy adjustments. The pressure field provides a visual indication of what works and what does not, as well as visual evidence of the progression or recovery of vasoplegia and myocardial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><label>4.3</label><title>High-dose inotropic and vasopressor therapy</title><p>In the primary case reported, application of pressure field management resulted in the administration of sustained high doses of inotropes and vasopressors. High-dose inotropes and vasopressors have been associated with high mortality (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Brown retrospectively studied mortality in critical care patients receiving &#x0201c;high dose vasopressor therapy&#x0201d; (defined as &#x0003e;1&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min for more than 10&#x0202f;min of norepinephrine equivalents; n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;443) and found an overall mortality of 83% at 90&#x0202f;days. The survivor and non-survivor groups had median maximum doses of 1.4&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min and 1.8&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, respectively, administered for median durations of 2 and 3&#x0202f;h (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This study was not able to control for disease impacts versus drug toxicity. However, in the primary patient reported here, the maximum norepinephrine-equivalent dose was 2.7&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, and doses &#x0003e;1.4&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg/min were administered for more than 5&#x0202f;days (excluding metaraminol, aligned with Brown&#x02019;s study). In three of the four additional case summaries, increasing perfusion pressure with norepinephrine was followed by improved renal function, and renal replacement therapy was not required.</p><p>We hypothesize that the pressure field visualization combined with personalized hemodynamic zones enables safe and effective use of inotropes and vasopressors, including at high doses. Response to drugs varies by individual patient, and the pressure field visualization enables individual responses to be understood and doses to be precisely titrated.</p></sec><sec id="sec12"><label>4.4</label><title>Future directions</title><p>For the primary patient reported, we visualized the pressure field by manually plotting hemodynamic data.

This novel method explicitly aims to estimate and restore a patient&#x02019;s normal hemodynamics&#x02014;defined by MPP, SV, and E<sub>sys</sub>&#x02014;to tailor fluid, vasopressor, and inotropic therapy accordingly. This approach is generalizable to the management of other shock types. Patients experiencing shock are individuals, with different pre-morbid hemodynamics, different acute insults, and different responses to therapies. Rather than a protocol for standardizing care, the pressure field is a method&#x02014;a system&#x02014;for individualizing care. We hypothesize that significant improvements in patient outcomes are feasible through the adoption of the pressure field method, which addresses the clinical need to match treatment to the disease. Therefore, a prospective observational study of patients with septic shock is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec15"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The data analyzed in this study is subject to the following licenses/restrictions: data sets are available on request.
