This manuscript builds upon prior overviews of LLMs in education, which outlined the transformative potential and inherent challenges of integrating LLMs into educational environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. With the introduction of ChatGPT-3.5, it appeared as though we had reached the pinnacle of LLMs. This was a momentous advancement in the application of AI. However, the landscape of AI has proven to be ever-evolving with increasingly short innovation cycles. The recent emergence of large multimodal foundation models (LMFMs), such as ChatGPT-4-Turbo by OpenAI or Gemini by Google, has reshaped our previous perceptions, bringing to the table a fresh set of opportunities and challenges for education. This overview aims to delve deeper into the opportunities and challenges presented by these advanced LMFMs, such as ChatGPT-4-Turbo and Gemini, shedding light on the future of AI in education.</p><p id="Par3">Historically, the integration of AI in education has been a gradual but impactful process. From the early adoption of systems that adapt the sequence of tasks and learning content to learners&#x02019; understanding with early intelligent tutoring systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> to more learner-centered systems that include natural language processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, the educational landscape has been reshaped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The development of the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) marked a significant leap forward in the processing of natural language texts and &#x02013; by implication &#x02013; the processing of learners&#x02019; and teachers&#x02019; inputs and consequent responses. These models, trained on extensive text data, showcased an unprecedented ability to generate human-like text, answer complex questions, classify teachers&#x02019; written reflections and facilitate very high learner-centered interactive learning experiences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The release of ChatGPT-3.5 especially sparked numerous empirical studies demonstrating the wide variety of opportunities for education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, it can be used to support teachers in generating course material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, to detect students&#x02019; errors during experimentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, to enhance peer feedback processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, to augment empirical data in education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and to provide various types of formative feedback to enhance self-regulated learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. At the same time, there are also numerous challenges and concerns, such as the risk of overreliance by students on the output of an LLM without critically reflecting on it, the difficulty for teachers to identify texts that were created by an LLM rather than by students. There are concerns about the reliability and accuracy of the output of the LLM, potential inherent biases, and the protection of students&#x02019; and teachers&#x02019; personal data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A few months after the release of ChatGPT, it became available via an application programming interface (API). This allowed for its integration into custom-built applications with specific preprompting that allow the assignment of tasks and roles to the LLM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As an important step, Shen and colleagues demonstrated that large language models can be effectively used as a middleware to communicate between different AI models by using language as the universal interface of every AI model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this way, the vast amount of developed AI tools can be effectively integrated into advanced LLMs, provided the LLM is fine-tuned to the specifications of the AI tools to generate correct inputs. This effective communication between a LLM and different AI tools led to the development of LMFMs, which not only allow an input and output via written text, but also via spoken text, images or videos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Among these advanced LMFMs are ChatGPT-4-Turbo and Gemini. In comparison to the first version of ChatGPT-3.5, these models represent a significant advancement in this field due to its multimodality, boosted accuracy, faster response times, and more nuanced understanding of context and subtleties in language.</p><p id="Par5">The potential opportunities of LMFMs in education are manifold. Their advanced capabilities can revolutionize personalized learning, enabling tailor-made educational experiences that adapt to individual student needs and learning preferences. The enhanced understanding and response mechanisms can aid in creating more engaging and interactive multimodal content, thus potentially increasing student motivation and participation in learning activities. Moreover, their ability to process and generate vast amounts of information in real time can serve as a powerful tool for research on learning and teaching processes.</p><p id="Par6">However, with these opportunities come additional significant challenges. The reliance on AI-supported education raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by these systems. The potential for inherent biases in the AI algorithms also remains a critical issue with LMFMs, and this issue may be intensified due to the complexities arising from processing multiple input modalities. Furthermore, the integration of such advanced technologies in educational settings necessitates a reevaluation of teaching methods and curricula. It also requires the development of new competencies among educators and students alike because these tools now allow for much more interactive learning and formative feedback, thus allowing a shift from a focus on declarative knowledge to facilitating complex skills. This is a crucial step towards the democratization of education, ensuring that learning opportunities are accessible and equitable, making it more likely now for illiterate people to use AI without even being able to read and write. Yet, the issue of the digital divide and accessibility remains a concern, as not all educational institutions may have the resources to implement and maintain such advanced technology effectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The following sections of this manuscript will explore how LMFMs can enhance various aspects of education, such as personalized learning, student engagement, and educational content and application creation, and they will critically examine the potential drawbacks and limitations of LMFMs in education, including issues related to accuracy, bias, and the need for human oversight. Finally, the &#x02018;Mitigation Strategies&#x02019; section will propose strategies to overcome these challenges, ensuring that the integration of LMFMs in educational settings is done responsibly, ethically, and effectively. This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the landscape of LMFMs in education, with a specific focus on the latest advancements represented by LMFMs, thereby contributing to the ongoing discussion about the role of AI in shaping the future of education.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Opportunities</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Opportunities for learners</title><p id="Par8">Personalized learning assistants can have multiple benefits for learners. They have the potential to enhance students&#x02019; productivity and foster motivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. ChatGPT, for instance, has been favorably received by students<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the advanced context understanding of LMFMs could potentially alleviate concerns regarding the accuracy of LLM outputs, due to their enhanced precision. Additionally, the integration of LLMs in an API allows efficient preprompting including the provision of an example solution. In this way, LLMs are aware of the correct solution and can guide the learner towards it without generating hallucinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the context of LLMs, &#x0201c;hallucination" refers to the generation of information that appears plausible but is factually incorrect. LMFMs offer a range of options for learners, as recent research shows. Fauzi and colleagues discuss the role of GPT in stimulating contextual learning strategies, thereby enhancing metacognitive abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This aspect is important for the development of self-regulated learning skills. In addition, the opportunity to build personal learning assistants using LMFMs promotes generative learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, where learners actively participate in the design of their learning tools, which may lead to higher engagement, better understanding, and retention. Furthermore, educators can now create customized LMFM applications with pre-defined prompts, design content based on their needs, the subject and teaching style by providing relevant domain-specific content to the fine-tuned LMFMs which can expedite learning through such personalized learning assistants. In this way, the specially created multimodal learning assistants can be individualized and offered on a large scale in the classroom or school setting. Learners can therefore benefit from using teacher-recommended Chatbots to boost their learning process.</p><p id="Par9">Particularly, LMFMs have the capacity to facilitate a range of learning mechanisms and provide support to students across a diverse array of activities, as outlined in the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par10"><bold>Multimedia-effect</bold>: The capabilities of LMFMs, especially their abilities to process and generate images suggest a more comprehensive learning experience. It is already known from multimedia research that text in combination with images leads to better understanding than text alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This is particularly beneficial for complex or abstract concepts, where visual representations can provide additional clarity. In this line, LMFMs may enhance formative feedback by providing visual representation along with written feedback to better illustrate learners&#x02019; difficulties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11"><bold>Barrier-free interaction</bold>: Furthermore, LMFMs can play a crucial role in supporting students with disabilities by allowing a barrier-free interaction via speech-to-text, image-to-text, text-to-image, and text-to-speech functionalities. These features make educational content more accessible, especially for students with visual or auditory impairments or with difficulties in writing or reading. Similarly, students can also write or speak in their mother tongue if they are unfamiliar with the local language, and the text is translated into the local language. These features can also be beneficial in language learning, where the model can act as a conversational partner, offering real-time interaction and feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It could help learners develop their language skills in a more natural and immersive environment, simulating real-life conversations. Similarly, LMFMs may enrich history lessons by enabling role-playing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and acting as conversational partners such as historically important characters like Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, or others. These features enable a more inclusive learning environment where all students have equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from the educational materials. Additionally, the adaptability of GPTs in customizing learning experiences can help address individual learning needs in a diverse student population with varying abilities and learning preferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12"><bold>Learning support during the generation of images</bold>: Another significant aspect is the integration of visual transformer models such as DALL-E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which enables the creation of visual outputs based on text inputs. LMFMs have also demonstrated the ability to understand the content of images, thereby offering the opportunity for students to receive learning support during generation through real-time scaffolding and feedback on their drawings. This may prove useful in providing multi-faceted feedback and in subjects where visual representation is key. For instance, in arts and creative subjects, it can be used to teach design and reflection, allowing students to explore different visual representations and interpretations of their ideas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In several other fields of education, the generation of visual representations, such as graphs or schemas, is a common exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Here, LMFMs may provide real-time feedback to students while generating graphs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13"><bold>Learning support during the generation of handwritten text, mathematical solutions, and physics equations</bold>: LMFMs have demonstrated the ability to even process images or plots that contain handwritten text, experimental results, function graphs or mathematical equations to provide feedback to students in real-time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this way, they may not only support students in solving maths problems but also provide feedback during the solution of physics problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14"><bold>Representational competence training</bold>: Several authors point out that the integration of visual representations in the learning material can enhance learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To effectively learn from visual representations, Edelsbrunner and colleagues could show that students need to possess representational competence that allows them to extract information from visual representations and interpret them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, Rau points out that students often face a representational dilemma, which means that they do not possess the necessary representational competence during learning, so they need to acquire it during the learning of domain-specific content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.
