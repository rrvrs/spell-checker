The present study aimed to generate T/F viruses and to characterize their biological properties. For this purpose, we constructed 18 full-length infectious molecular clones (IMCs) of HIV from recently infected infants. All the clones were characterized genotypically through whole genome sequencing and phenotypically for infectivity, replication kinetics, co-receptor usage, as well as their susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors using standard virological assays. Genotypic analysis revealed that all the T/F clones were of non-recombinant subtype C, but some of them harboured the Y181C drug resistance mutation associated with resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of antiretroviral drugs. In vitro studies showed that while all the IMCs were capable of replicating in PBMCs and utilized the CCR5 co-receptor for cellular entry, the drug-resistant variants had significantly lower replicative capacity and per particle infectivity than the drug-sensitive viruses. Both exhibited similar sensitivities to a standard panel of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and viral entry inhibitors. These findings suggest that despite their diminished replicative fitness, the drug-resistant T/F variants retain transmission fitness and remain susceptible to neutralizing antibody-based interventions and viral entry inhibitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>transmitted/founder virus</kwd><kwd>infectious molecular clones</kwd><kwd>NNRTI resistance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>institutional funds of ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This study did not receive any external funding but was supported through institutional funds of ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01854"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Globally, approximately 1.3 million women and girls living with HIV become pregnant each year (WHO, 2022) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Without intervention, the risk of HIV transmission from a HIV-positive mother to her child during various stages of pregnancy is estimated to be 15&#x02013;30% during gestation or labor and 15&#x02013;20% through breastfeeding [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Various interventions are now being employed to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the virus [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of PMTCT strategies may be compromised by the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains that can potentially be transmitted from the mother to the child despite the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) administered for PMTCT [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>HIV exhibits significant genetic diversity due to the error-prone nature of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT), leading to the emergence of a complex quasispecies in chronically infected individuals. However, it is evident that a genetic bottleneck occurs during HIV transmission, allowing only a select few genetic variants to establish infection in the newly infected host. Understanding the unique characteristics of the transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, i.e. the viral strain that initiates HIV-1 infection, is crucial for the design of effective immune-based or other prophylactic interventions against HIV. Detailed biological characterization of T/F viruses has been challenging due to the limited availability of full-length infectious molecular clones (IMCs) of these variants. In this study, we aimed to develop IMCs of T/F viruses from infants recently infected with HIV through vertical transmission from their mothers. Incidentally, we found that some of the T/F clones that we generated carried a mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that conferred resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of antiretroviral drugs used for the treatment of HIV as well as for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnant women and their children [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>NNRTI drugs bind to a hydrophobic pocket located near the polymerase active site and effectively prevent the synthesis of viral DNA [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The administration of a single dose of nevirapine (NVP) to both the delivering woman and the neonate within 72 h of birth has been shown to be a safe and effective measure for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, it is now well known that nevirapine exposure selects viral mutations associated with resistance to NNRTIs in more than half of exposed infants [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. K103N and Y181C substitutions are the two most common NNRTI-resistance associated mutations. Several studies have shown that whereas K103N is the predominant NNRTI-resistant mutation in adults, Y181C is the predominant NNRTI-resistant mutation among infants [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Y181C mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme of HIV involves the substitution of a tyrosine residue with a cysteine (Y181C) in the NNRTI binding pocket [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This mutation confers high level resistance to drugs like nevirapine (NVP) and delavirdine (DLV), and moderate resistance to etravirine (ETR) and rilpivirine (RPV) [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Mutations that confer drug resistance are known to reduce the ability of HIV-1 to replicate effectively [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Yet, the transmission of drug-resistant variants is known to occur as evidenced by the presence of T/F viruses carrying resistance-associated mutations in recently infected infants [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to generating full-length patient-specific infectious clones of T/F viruses from recently infected infants, the present study also attempted to characterize the impact of a high-level drug resistance-associated mutation in the T/F clones on replicative fitness, viral infectivity, co-receptor usage, and sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01854"><title>2.

Study Subjects</title><p>The current study used stored plasma samples of two HIV-1-infected infants who had recently contracted the infection through mother-to-child transmission. The HIV status of the infants was confirmed in the laboratory using HIV-1 DNA PCR. <xref rid="viruses-16-01854-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the comprehensive demographic profile of the two infants.

Viral RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis</title><p>Viral RNA was extracted from plasma using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit from Qiagen (Hilden, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. In brief, 140 &#x003bc;L of plasma was used for RNA extraction.

[<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, the cDNA synthesized from viral RNA was serially diluted and distributed into ten replicate wells of a PCR plate, so as to reach a dilution point at which 30% of the wells exhibited positive amplification [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This dilution threshold was determined to ensure that each well contained a single viral template. This was followed by nested PCR using HIV-specific primers. First-round PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;L with a reaction mixture comprising of 1X KAPA HiFi premix (Roche, Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa) and 0.5 &#x003bc;M each of the primers HCFLC1F and HCFLC1R (Oligo primers synthesize from IDT Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). The first round of PCR comprised of initial denaturation at 98 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 35 cycles of denaturation at 98 &#x000b0;C, annealing at 66 &#x000b0;C, and extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 10 s, 30 s, and 8 min, respectively, and final extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 10 min. The second round of PCR was performed with the same cycling conditions using the same PCR master mix as round 1, with 2 &#x000b5;L of the first-round PCR product as template and HCFLC2F and HCFLC2R as primers. The amplicons were analysed by gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of the expected 9 kb product.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-16-01854"><title>2.4. LTR Amplification and Construction of Patient-Specific LTR Clone</title><p>The virion-packaged RNA genome of retroviruses does not contain the complete long terminal repeat (LTR) region [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In order to construct full-length infectious molecular clones from the amplified near full-length HIV-1 genomes, we separately amplified 650 bp of the LTR sequence from the genomic DNA of the corresponding infant using nested PCR, with the LTR CF and LTR CR primers for the first round and LTR overlap vec F and LTR overlap vec R primers for the second round. The PCR reaction was performed in a total reaction volume of 50 &#x003bc;L containing 1X KAPA HiFi (Roche, Cape Town, South Africa) reaction premix and 1 &#x003bc;L of DNA template. The cycling conditions included an initial denaturation step at 98 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98 &#x000b0;C for 20 s, annealing at 62 &#x000b0;C for 20 s, and extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 2 min. Two microlitres of the first-round PCR product was used as template for the second-round PCR. The total volume of round II PCR was 50 &#x003bc;L with similar components as the first round, except for the primers, which had an overlap with the vector. The amplicons were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. Positive bands were excised using a gel cutter, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany)and eluted in 60 &#x003bc;L of nuclease-free water.</p><p>To generate patient-specific LTR clones, we generated a linear vector amplicon from pIndie, a HIV-1 subtype C molecular clone which contains a bacterial origin of replication and ampicillin resistance cassette. The primers used for the amplification of the vector were Pvec F and Pvec R. The PCR conditions used were initial denaturation at 98 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 98 &#x000b0;C for 20 s and 72 &#x000b0;C for 4 min, with a final extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 7 min. The 3.8 kb vector piece was gel-extracted and purified. The patient-specific LTR amplicons and vector backbone were mixed in a ratio of 1:1. Two microliters of In-Fusion HD 5X enzyme premix was added, and the reaction volume was made up to 10 &#x003bc;L with nuclease-free water. The reaction mixture was incubated at 50 &#x000b0;C for 45 min and then held at 4 &#x000b0;C until it was ready for transformation.</p><p>The LTR-pIndie vector infusion reaction mix was transformed into competent Stellar cells following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Clontech, CA, USA). In brief, the competent cells were thawed on ice. Twenty-five microlitres of competent cells was transferred to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and placed on ice, and 2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;L of the In-Fusion HD cloning reaction (Takara, San Jose, CA, USA) mix was added to it. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were heat shocked for 45&#x02013;60 s in a water bath and quickly placed on ice for at least for 2 min. Next, 500 &#x003bc;L of warm SOC medium was added and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 30 min with gentle shaking at 180 rpm in a shaker. Then, 100 &#x003bc;L of cells was plated on LB agar plates supplemented with 100 &#x003bc;g/mL ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C overnight. Multiple colonies were picked and cultured overnight in LB broth. DNA was extracted using the PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The LTR vector clones were confirmed by double restriction digestion and sequencing of the LTR-pIndie vector junction using Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-viruses-16-01854"><title>2.5. Generation of Patient-Specific Full-Length Infectious Molecular Clones (IMCs)</title><p>To assemble full-length HIV clones, the patient-specific LTR vector clone was used to generate two individual PCR products as per an established protocol described previously for the production of full-length molecular clones [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This process was meant to fill the absent LTR regions from the NFL amplicons in the construct.

For infusion cloning of the full-length HIV genome, the 9 kb NFL amplicon was derived by re-amplification of the selected second-round amplicon using the cloning primers NFL C clone F and NFL C clone R. The PCR conditions were the same as described previously for the NFL PCR, except for the cycling conditions. The cycling conditions included an initial denaturation step at 98 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 &#x000b0;C, annealing at 65 &#x000b0;C, and extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 10 s, 30 s, and 8 min, respectively, followed by a final extension for 10 min at 72 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>Each of the three PCR products were individually gel-extracted as described earlier. To generate the full-length clone, a final In-Fusion HD reaction was performed. In a 10 &#x003bc;L reaction volume, the 9 kb NFL amplicon was combined with the two LTR vector pieces that complemented the missing LTR regions. The reaction included 150 ng of each linear gel-purified amplicon, 2 &#x003bc;L of 5X In-Fusion HD enzyme (Takara, CA, USA) mix, and nuclease-free water.

Since the plasma virus genome typically lacks a complete LTR, we performed a separate PCR to amplify a 650 bp LTR fragment from genomic DNA isolated from the corresponding infant&#x02019;s PBMC. This approach ensured accurate representation of the virus sequence by specifically targeting and matching the LTR. Patient-specific LTR primers were used for nested PCR based on the identified sequence at the 5&#x02032; end of U3 and 3&#x02032; end of U5 in the NFL amplicon. Cloning of the LTR fragments was achieved using the pIndie vector backbone via a two-piece fusion reaction.

The chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) plays a crucial role in HIV infection, especially during the early stages of the infection process [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We found that both the drug-resistant and drug-sensitive T/F clones analysed in our study exclusively used the CCR5 co-receptor. This suggests that targeting CCR5 remains a valid therapeutic strategy even in the context of drug-resistant T/F viruses. Due to the pivotal role played by the CCR5 receptor in HIV-1 transmission, infection, and AIDS progression, extensive research has focused on developing drugs targeting CCR5 [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Maraviroc (MVC), a globally approved HIV entry inhibitor that blocks the CCR5 co-receptor, is now used to treat patients infected with R5-tropic HIV [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. MVC has demonstrated substantial antiretroviral activity in a short-term clinical trial involving HIV-infected patients [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>With the understanding that fitness costs and genetic bottlenecks constrain the transmission of viruses harbouring drug resistance mutations, we undertook precise measurement of the replicative fitness of T/F variants harbouring the Y181C mutation by infecting primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells and measuring reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in the culture supernatants at periodic time intervals. It was observed that viruses harbouring the drug resistance mutation exhibited lower RT activity, as revealed by the reduced replicative capacity (RC) score as compared to the drug-sensitive non-mutant viruses. Earlier studies that analysed the replicative fitness of drug-resistant viruses also reported diminished replicative fitness of viruses containing drug resistance mutations like Y181C/K103N and G190A as compared to wild-type viruses [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In contrast, some other studies reported very minimal or no impact of the single RT mutation Y181C on in vitro viral fitness [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01854" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>We checked the per particle infectivity of the mutant and non-mutant T/F viruses and found that the per particle infectivity of the T/F variants containing the Y181C mutation was significantly lower than that of the non-mutant T/F variants, in spite of using equal numbers of infectious virus particles (MOI) for the experiment, again pointing to slower processivity of the mutant RT. Since viral infectivity is largely a feature of the viral envelope, we examined the intactness and functionality of the viral envelopes by examining co-receptor usage as well as neutralization sensitivity to some well-characterized monoclonal bNAbs. It was observed that both the mutant and non-mutant T/F clones exhibited identical co-receptor usage patterns and similar sensitivity to a panel of bNAbs, including VRC01, PG16, and 10E8, indicating the functional integrity of the viral envelopes. A mutation reversal study could have confirmed whether the observed difference in infectivity was in some way linked to the Y181 mutation, but this experiment could not be performed and therefore can be considered a limitation of this study. However, this observation has clinical implications in that it is now possible to hypothesize that drug-resistant T/F viruses remain sensitive to bNAbs and may therefore be effectively targeted by antibody-based therapies. This finding is therefore crucial for informing therapeutic strategies, particularly in populations where NNRTI resistance is prevalent due to the use of drugs like nevirapine for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, since this mutation not only leads to decreased susceptibility to nevirapine but also offers cross-resistance to other NNRTIs, potentially impacting the efficacy of treatment. We found that the mutant viruses exhibited moderate-level resistance to etravirine (ETR) and very minimal to no effect on susceptibility to efavirenz (EFV) and rilpivirine (RPV). On the other hand, both the mutant and non-mutant viruses exhibited similar levels of sensitivity to the entry inhibitor maroviroc.</p><p>While several studies have described the deleterious effects of the acquisition of drug resistance-associated mutations on viral fitness, this is the very first attempt to characterize the impact of drug resistance mutations in T/F viruses on viral infectivity and viral phenotype. Overall, our study unveiled several interesting characteristics of early transmitted T/F viruses, those harbouring the Y181C drug resistance mutation, as well as those which did not contain any mutation. Notably, the mutant viruses exhibited diminished replicative capacity and decreased infectivity in comparison to their non-mutant counterparts. Since replicative capacity, infectivity, and viral fitness are intrinsic viral characteristics that are linked to virological and clinical outcomes, further studies in this line could help define strategies that can be effectively exploited for the early control of disease progression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>AS acknowledges the University Grants Commission, India, for providing him a Senior Research Fellowship from 2019 to 2022 and the HIV Research Trust for supporting his travel to Emory University for training and research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
