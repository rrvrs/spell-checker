Liver progenitor cells (LPCs) contribute to tissue regeneration after severe hepatic injury, yet signals instructing progenitor cell dynamics and fate are largely unknown. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and TIMP3 control the sheddases ADAM10 and ADAM17, key for NOTCH activation. Here we uncover the role of the TIMP/ADAM/NOTCH/DLK1 axis in LPC maintenance and cholangiocyte specification. Combined TIMP1/TIMP3 loss in vivo caused abnormal portal triad stoichiometry accompanied by collagen deposits, dysregulated Notch signaling, and increased soluble DLK1. The MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup>CD26<sup>&#x02013;</sup> biliary progenitor population was reduced following acute CCl<sub>4</sub> or chronic DDC liver injury and in aged TIMP-deficient livers. Single-cell RNA sequencing data interrogation and RNAscope identified portal mesenchymal cells coexpressing ADAM17/DLK1 as enzymatically equipped to process DLK1 and direct LPC differentiation. Specifically, TIMP-deficient biliary fragment&#x02013;derived organoids displayed increased propensity for cholangiocyte differentiation. ADAM17 inhibition reduced <italic toggle="yes">Sox9</italic>-mediated cholangiocyte differentiation, prolonging organoid growth and survival, whereas WT organoids treated with soluble DLK1 triggered <italic toggle="yes">Sox9</italic> expression and cholangiocyte specification in mouse and patient-derived liver organoids. Thus, metalloproteinase inhibitors regulate instructive signals for biliary cell differentiation and LPC preservation within the portal niche, providing a new basis for cell therapy strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

Progress in stem cell biology is opening new possibilities for alternative therapies. Although hepatocytes have extensive replicative capacity, evidence indicates that the biliary compartment plays a crucial role in regeneration following extensive hepatocyte loss (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Biliary cell subpopulations comprise bipotent progenitor cells capable of generating both hepatocytes and cholangiocyte lineages (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Numerous studies have aimed to define liver progenitor cells (LPCs) and their contribution to hepatic homeostasis and repair, yet factors that influence LPC dynamics remain largely obscure.</p><p>The Notch pathway is a master regulator of cell fate, and its functions are well established in liver development. Notch is critical for the specification and differentiation of hepatoblasts into cholangiocytes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and for morphogenesis of the intrahepatic biliary system (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The Notch ligand JAG1 along with NOTCH2 is instrumental for bile duct formation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and mutation of <italic toggle="yes">JAG1</italic> leads to bile duct paucity in Alagille syndrome in humans (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Beyond its developmental role, Notch signaling participates in liver regeneration, fibrosis, metabolism, and cancer (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Following ligand binding (Delta-like 1, 3, 4, Jagged 1, 2), Notch receptor activation (NOTCH1&#x02013;4) requires metalloproteinase (ADAM)-mediated S2 cleavage of the receptor at the cell surface with subsequent NICD release via &#x003b3;-secretase (S3 cleavage) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). ADAM10 is firmly established as the central metalloproteinase responsible for Notch activation, and ADAM17 has also been proposed to perform this function (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Among Notch ligands, isoforms of Delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1; also called Pref1/FA1) are either membrane-tethered or processed by ADAM17, which releases its soluble form (sDLK1) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Wide embryonic DLK1 expression becomes restricted to a few tissues or stem/progenitor cells postnatally (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the human and mouse embryonic liver, DLK1 serves as a marker for bipotent hepatoblasts (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and is expressed by rat oval cells in severely injured tissue (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Among the 4 natural tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMP1 controls ADAM10 while TIMP3 inhibits both ADAM10 and ADAM17 activities (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Compound <italic toggle="yes">Timp1</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Timp3</italic>-deficient mice exhibit striking mammary stem cell expansion, which we have shown prevents age-associated tissue regression in part via altered Notch activity (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The TIMP-metalloproteinase axis is thus a fundamental regulator of Notch signaling (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Here we uncover that TIMP1 and TIMP3 together control the mouse liver progenitor reservoir and highlight portal mesenchymal cells as regulators of LPC fate. Using biliary organoid models, we demonstrate the increased propensity of LPCs toward cholangiocyte differentiation in a microenvironment lacking these TIMPs. Mechanistically, in addition to Notch activation we identify sDLK1 as an important inducer of <italic toggle="yes">Sox9</italic> and a trigger for cholangiocyte specification, revealing its critical function in the LPC niche. Exploiting small-molecule inhibitors, we show that control of ADAM activity is key to preserving LPC expansion and restricting cholangiocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Abnormal portal triad stoichiometry and biliary differentiation in compound TIMP1/TIMP3-null mice.</title><p>Mouse livers from individual or combined whole-body deletions of <italic toggle="yes">Timp1 and Timp3</italic> were analyzed (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI164997DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI164997DS1</ext-link>). At the gross anatomical level, <italic toggle="yes">Timp1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>Timp3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> (designated hereafter as <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic>) livers were enlarged, of harder consistency and abnormal shape with visible large intrahepatic and portal blood vessels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas single-knockout livers were similar to wild type (WT). Features of portal hypertension including hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and numerous enlarged &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin&#x02013;positive (&#x003b1;SMA<sup>+</sup>) mesenteric blood vessels were noted in compound-knockout mice, but not individual <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> or <italic toggle="yes">T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> groups (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, B&#x02013;D).

Furthermore, the cholangiocyte marker cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and &#x003b1;SMA for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) confirmed altered portal triad stoichiometry, with elongated bile ducts surrounding the portal veins accompanied by a higher number of hepatic arteries (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). At the cellular level, increased proliferation was evident in ductular and interstitial portal cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), by Ki67 as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positivity (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1F</xref>). Overall, the severity of abnormalities increased with age, in spite of mouse-to-mouse variability, with highly proliferative bile ducts, extensive portal and sinusoid dilatation, and localized periportal fibrosis in 8-month-old <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>, A&#x02013;E).</p><p>Developmentally, hepatic arteries form in response to signals from the bile ducts (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and developmental anomalies in human polycystic liver disease have correlated increased hepatic artery branching with the presence of biliary cysts (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Interrogation of published fetal liver single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) in human and mouse (human weeks 5&#x02013;19; mouse E11.0&#x02013;E17.5) revealed 8 major cell populations: hepatoblast/hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, erythroid lineage, hematopoietic lineage, Kupffer cells, mesenchymal cells (septum transversum stellate cells and mesothelial cells), and endothelial cells in both species. <italic toggle="yes">Timp1</italic> was expressed by mesenchymal and endothelial cells and <italic toggle="yes">Timp3</italic> by endothelial cells in embryonic livers (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). At embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), livers of WT and <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> genotypes were comparable. (Sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), an early marker of biliary cell differentiation downstream of Notch signaling, was present in periportal hepatoblasts, and the biliary cell marker Epcam was scarcely observed (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1G</xref>). However, <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> liver at E16.5 had many portal veins surrounded by a greater number of Epcam+ cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Specifically, ductal structures were already formed in <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> livers, while WT livers showed single-cell layers without ducts. Nascent tubules in <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> hepatic tissue expressed markers of mature (CK19) and functional cholangiocytes (acetylated tubulin [AcT]) along with a significantly higher SOX9 fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). At postnatal day 10 (P10), Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells belonging to elongated biliary ducts were twice as numerous as in WT, and multiple single layers of Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells were additionally found scattered in the <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> periportal area (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). This increase in bile duct number was less pronounced in adult tissue (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting attrition or lack of maintenance of bile ducts with aging. Altogether, the combined loss of TIMP1 and TIMP3 resulted in potent cholangiocyte differentiation during embryogenesis with subsequent aberrations in the adult hepatic portal triad architecture, suggesting that TIMP1 and TIMP3 are regulatory effectors of biliary lineage commitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased Notch activation in the absence of TIMP1 and TIMP3.</title><p>We next interrogated the published scRNA-Seq (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>) of murine hepatic models of chronic injury after CCl<sub>4</sub> exposure or bile duct ligation, both of which instigate LPC activation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). TIMPs were broadly detectable in hepatic cells, except <italic toggle="yes">Timp4</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Cholangiocytes expressed <italic toggle="yes">Timp2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Timp3</italic>, while mesenchymal cells (hepatic stellate cells, fibroblasts, and VSMCs) expressed <italic toggle="yes">Timp1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Timp2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Timp3</italic>. TIMP1, a known marker of liver fibrosis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), was highly induced in mesenchymal cells after hepatic injury. Among ADAMs targeted by these TIMPs, <italic toggle="yes">Adam10</italic> was ubiquitous, while <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> was found in macrophages, VSMCs, and fibroblasts. Components of the Notch pathway, Notch receptors 1&#x02013;4 and ligands <italic toggle="yes">Jag1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Jag2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Dll1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Dll4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Dlk1</italic>, were broadly detectable and the canonical target gene <italic toggle="yes">Hes1</italic> was present in cholangiocytes and endothelial and mesenchymal cells. <italic toggle="yes">Sox9</italic> was restricted to biliary cells. Next, direct examination of Notch signaling in our mouse cohorts by Western blotting found it was consistently increased in <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> hepatic tissue. The activated form of Notch2 (NICD2) was elevated at P10 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), and a higher NICD1 level was obvious in adult liver (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 12w). Interestingly, the level of cleaved Notch1 correlated with the severity of portal triad distortion and collagen deposition (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed the upregulation of several Notch target genes (<italic toggle="yes">Sox9</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Hey1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Hey2</italic>) in <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> adult liver. Expression of Notch receptors (1 and 2) and most ligands (<italic toggle="yes">Dll1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Dll4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Jag1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Jag2</italic>) was comparable to WT, but <italic toggle="yes">Dlk1</italic> was significantly increased in mice lacking these TIMPs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>We also examined several morphogens and signaling pathways known to contribute to liver pathophysiology, specifically YAP, TGF-&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, HGF, PDGF-B, and Hedgehog. Phosphorylation of YAP and ERK is important for cholangiocyte proliferation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Although p-ERK was elevated in <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> livers, neither YAP nor its targets <italic toggle="yes">Ccn1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ccn2</italic> were significantly altered (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>, A and B). A concentration gradient of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) initiates hepatoblast commitment toward biliary lineage (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and inactive TGF-&#x003b2; precursor sequestered by the extracellular matrix is proteolytically activated by metalloproteinases (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2; activity was comparable at P10 (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5C</xref>) and at 12 weeks but increased at 8 months (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5D</xref>), likely owing to the advanced tissue alterations present in aged <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and correlating with TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02019;s profibrotic role. Two other key regulators of liver cell proliferation and inflammation, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), which can be affected by TIMP activity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), were also measured (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>, E and F).

Specifically, the vast majority of DMSO-treated organoids began collapsing by day 7, whereas both ADAM inhibitors allowed organoids to sustain growth and reach larger diameters from day 8 to day 14 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). A higher percentage of live organoids was observed at day 14, with TAPI-1 exhibiting the strongest pro-survival effect (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, restraining of ADAM10 or ADAM17 activity is crucial for adequate LPC expansion and survival. In the WT organoid setting, we also tested the effect of DAPT, known to abrogate Notch activity by blocking &#x003b3;-secretase (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Notch inhibition also promoted LPC survival. The pro-survival effect of TAPI-1 was superior to that of GI254023X or DAPT. Since inhibiting ADAM10 or ADAM17 did not affect organoid initiation but affected solely the later stage of organoid growth, we next added TAPI-1 from day 4 to day 7 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Around 50% of WT organoids collapsed in control conditions by day 7, yet nearly all organoids remained healthy in the presence of TAPI-1.

In the liver, progenitor cells participate in regeneration after severe injury, and systems underlying their regulation are of wide interest (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Through a multitiered approach with in vivo analyses of murine livers and gold standard in vitro systems designed to study both murine and human liver progenitor biology, we have now uncovered the combined function of TIMP1 and TIMP3 in biliary development and LPC maintenance. LPCs are skewed toward exhaustive cholangiocyte differentiation in the absence of these TIMPs and are unable to expand after liver injury. We delineate mechanisms underlying this biology, specifically underscoring the role of the periportal niche, the molecular interplay of TIMPs and ADAMs in Notch activation, and soluble DLK1 bioavailability as a critical effector of cholangiocyte specification in the liver. The metalloproteinase-inhibitor system regulates multiple aspects of tissue homeostasis and liver biology, including hepatocyte cell cycle kinetics, death, and senescence (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).

In patients with chronic hepatitis and rodent models of liver injury, LPCs colocalize with laminin, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and macrophages (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Interactions among LPCs, stromal cells, extracellular matrix, growth factors, and cytokines are injury dependent and determine progenitor cell behavior (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our interrogation of mouse and human scRNA-Seq data mapped this cellular network, pinpointing critical paracrine and juxtacrine signals within the LPC niche. Specifically, within the ADAM and Notch ligand/receptor landscape we verified that portal mesenchymal cells coexpress ADAM17 and DLK1 in situ and are equipped to release sDLK and direct LPC differentiation in a paracrine manner. The combined loss of TIMP1 and TIMP3, the natural inhibitors of ADAM10 and ADAM17, culminated in abundant cleaved NICD and DLK1 in liver homogenates, reflective of unchecked ADAM shedding activity. Additionally, our bioinformatic interrogation indicated a juxtacrine interaction with mesenchymal cells expressing JAG1 that can activate Notch signaling in LPCs, which possess both Notch receptor 2 and ADAM10. Finally, given that periportal mesenchymal cells have recently been reported to regulate mature cholangiocyte proliferation through secreted factors and Notch signaling (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), these cells have the potential to influence both mature cells and LPCs. Thus, we have exposed key components of the TIMP/ADAM/NOTCH/DLK1 axis that operate in both a paracrine and a juxtacrine manner, to regulate LPC fate within the hepatic periportal niche.</p><p>In our organoid cultures, which recapitulate many aspects of the complex structure and function of in vivo tissue, lower progenitor activity in <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> livers was due to alterations of the LPC niche rather than a cell-autonomous feature. Specifically, owing to the presence of stromal cells, <italic toggle="yes">T1<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup>T3<sup>&#x02212;&#x02044;&#x02212;</sup></italic> biliary fragments produced differentiated organoids capable of only limited growth, while the FACS-purified MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup>CD26<sup>&#x02212;</sup> LPC fraction generated organoids with morphology and growth kinetics comparable to WT. This supports the role of stroma in LPC fate determination. TIMP1 induced in mesenchymal cells and TIMP3 constitutively expressed by biliary, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells are secreted endogenous inhibitors ideally positioned to modulate the availability of local signals in the LPC niche. TIMP3 is the only TIMP to bind the extracellular matrix, and it can stabilize the cell microenvironment, serving to sustain progenitors within the hepatic niche. TIMP3 is implicated in the regulation of other tissue stem cells as it suppresses myogenic differentiation in the muscle (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) and maintains the undifferentiated state of murine embryonic neural stem cells in the brain (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).

The Seurat R package (v4.0.2) was used to normalize, scale, find variable features, and run dimensionality reduction/unsupervised clustering for each dataset. Quality control metrics were implemented based on parameters provided by respective Methods sections. Via the Seurat package, the DimPlot function was used to display uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of categorical variables (such as cell populations and conditions). Cell population identities were attributed using ScType (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/IanevskiAleksandr/sc-type" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/IanevskiAleksandr/sc-type</ext-link>) and curated gene lists. VlnPlot was used to depict the expression of genes of interest across different cell types, and FeatureScatter was used to create correlation scatterplots for gene expression (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/satijalab/seurat</ext-link>). The Nebulosa R package (v1.13.1) was used to determine and visualize gene-weighted density estimations on UMAPs. Scatterplots depicting the proportion of cells expressing genes of interest were generated using the ggplot2 R package (v3.3.5), and cells were colored by identity class. See <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 5</xref> for cell population signatures used to generate UMAPs.
