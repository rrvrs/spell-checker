This study identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ROS1 mutated (<italic>ROS1</italic><sup>MUT</sup>) and wild-type (<italic>ROS1</italic><sup>WT</sup>) LUSC samples from the TCGA database. Using WGCNA, immune-related DEGs (IRGs) were screened. Prognostic signatures derived from IRGs were used to compare immune infiltration, chemotherapy sensitivity, and immune-phenotyping score (IPS) between high- and low-risk subgroups. Hub gene abundance in different cell clusters was analyzed via Sc-seq. TAGAP overexpression or silencing was employed to assess its impact on cytokines production and differentiation of CD4+&#x02009;T cells, downstream c-Rel expression, and tumor progression. High-risk subgroups exhibited decreased infiltration of natural killer, follicular helper T, and CD8+&#x02009;T cells, but increased plasma, CD4+&#x02009;memory resting T, and macrophage M2 cells. These subgroups were more sensitive to Sunitinib and CTLA4 blockade. TAGAP expression was significantly reduced in LUSC. Overexpressing TAGAP enhanced CD4+&#x02009;T cells to produce cytokines, promoted differentiation into Th1/Th17 cells, inhibited Treg conversion, and suppressed LUSC cell phenotype in vitro. TAGAP overexpression in CD4+&#x02009;T cells also inhibited LUSC tumor growth and boosted immune infiltration in vivo. TAGAP&#x02019;s effects on CD4+&#x02009;T cells were partly reversed by c-Rel overexpression, highlighting TAGAP's role in rejuvenating CD4+&#x02009;T cells and exerting anticancer effects by inhibiting c-Rel. This study elucidates the novel therapeutic potential of targeting TAGAP to modulate CD4+&#x02009;T cell activity in immunotherapy for LUSC.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00262-025-03960-1.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>T cell activating Rho GTPase-activating protein (TAGAP)</kwd><kwd>CD4+&#x02009;T cell</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Prognosis signature</kwd><kwd>Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017700</institution-id><institution>Henan Provincial Science and Technology Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>222102310170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Haibo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Key Project of Medical Science and Technology Research and Development in Henan Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>SBGJ202302018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Haibo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Henan Province Young and Middle aged Health Science and Technology Innovation Talent Training Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>YXKC2020022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Haibo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010834</institution-id><institution>Education Department of Hainan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hnky2023ZD-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Tongmeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Henan Provincial Health Commission Joint Construction Project Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>LHGJ20230190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Huawei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">As the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, lung cancer is composed of approximately 85% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which is mainly composed of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As the emerging discoveries of molecular targets, the overall survival (OS) of NSCLC increased gradually during the recent year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the overall response rate of NSCLC could be up to 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, as reported, the targeted therapy mainly benefited the non-LUSC and did not bring a satisfactory prognosis to LUSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hence, as the LUSC occupies 30% of NSCLC, limited treatment strategies for LUSC led to approximately 400,000 deaths every year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of LUSC might provide effective targets for the treatment of LUSC. ROS1 is located on the long arm of human chromosome 6, and its full name is c-ros sarcoma oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase). <italic>ROS1</italic>, along with epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase receptor tyrosine kinase (<italic>ALK</italic>) mutation, are clear driver genes for NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, ROS1 was found to have a higher mutation rate in LUSC compared with EGFR, ALK and other common mutation genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Therefore, unveiling the mechanisms downstream of ROS1 in LUSC would better construct therapeutics for certain patients.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Immune-related prognosis signature construction and efficacy evaluation. <bold>a</bold> Overview of somatic mutations of common therapeutic targets in LUSC of TCGA database. <bold>b</bold> Heatmap of the association between identified modules and TME-related scores of all LUSC samples, including stromal score, immune score and ESTIMATE score. <bold>c</bold> Scatter plot of gene significance for immune score and module membership in the turquoise module. <bold>d</bold> The time-dependent ROC analysis of the prognostic signature to identify the best cut-off value.

TIME is mainly composed of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (like monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and tumor-associated macrophages), cancer-associated stromal cells (including endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, lipocytes) and neoplastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Besides, specific immune-infiltrating cells have been identified as a practical indicator for distinguishing the clinical stage and outcome of some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Immunosenescence, a hallmark of aging, plays a crucial role in TIME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This age-related decline in immune competence is characterized by several key features: a diminished capacity to mount effective responses to novel antigens, a persistent state of low-grade chronic inflammation, the accumulation of memory T cells, and a concomitant reduction in the na&#x000ef;ve T cell pool. These factors collectively contribute to widespread T cell dysfunction within the TIME, particularly abnormal of cytokines production and differentiation of CD4+&#x02009;T cells and impaired cytotoxicity of CD8+&#x02009;T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many researches have been focused on CD8+&#x02009;T cell function, especially on programmed death receiver-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1). However, the presence of PD-1 and PD-L1 could make CD8+&#x02009;T cells inactivate and unable to recognize tumor cells, leading to tumor cell escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Since 2015, Anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy has become the standard treatment for stage III-IV NSCLC patients with satisfactory expressions of PD1/PD-L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, due to its relatively low response rates and susceptibility to resistance, anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy is only beneficial to a small subset of patients and does not produce a lasting response for the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Cytotoxic CD4+&#x02009;T cells could produce massive cytokines to enhance immunotherapy responses in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, exploring the function of CD4+&#x02009;T cells in the immunosenescence of LUSC may contribute to the development of comprehensive strategies or the fire of new drugs.</p><p id="Par4">TAGAP is a T cell activating Rho GTPase-activating protein widely expressed in natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells and B/T lymphocytes and is mainly responsible for T cell activation and cytoskeleton arrangement. As reported, TAGAP is widely involved in some autoimmune diseases and cancer. In rheumatoid arthritis, overexpressed TAGAP could disrupt the balance between Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells transformation, promoting Th17 cell differentiation, releasing more inflammatory factors, and exacerbating the progression of rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, TAGAP in myeloid cells is necessary for proinflammatory cytokine production and anti-fungal signaling activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. More importantly, TAGAP expression was decreased in LUAD and overexpressed TAGAP could limit the tumor progress, thus increasing the toxicity and immune infiltration ability of CD4+&#x02009;T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Conventional CD4+&#x02009;T cells exhibit enhanced differentiation and polarization toward Th1 and Th1/17 states, leading to the overproduction of cytokines associated with autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This phenomenon may be impaired in cancer and immunosenescence situations, which is related to the dysfunction of NF-&#x003ba;B pathway molecules such as c-Rel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, in LUSC, there is currently little exploration about whether TAGAP can effectively inhibit tumor growth or its molecular mechanisms.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between <italic>ROS1</italic> mutated (<italic>ROS1</italic><sup>MUT</sup>) and wild-type (<italic>ROS1</italic><sup>WT</sup>) LUSC profiles, screened the immune-related DEGs (IRGs) via weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), then constructed a reliable immune-related prognostic signature. In the immune-related prognostic signature, TAGAP, as a hub gene, was significantly down-regulated in LUSC samples verified by immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. And TAGAP had a more abundant expression on CD4+&#x02009;T cells examined by single-cell sequencing (sc-Seq). Rasing TAGAP could rejuvenate the toxicity of CD4+&#x02009;T cells and inhibit the tumor progress in vitro and in vivo, and vice versa. In terms of mechanism, TAGAP rejuvenized the differentiation of CD4+&#x02009;T cells toward Th1/17 cells and inhibited their transformation into Treg cells by decreasing the c-Rel expression. The above results suggested that TAGAP would be a potential target for LUSC's future individual clinic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data source, preparation and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis</title><p id="Par6">In the present study, 495 LUSC transcriptome, clinical information, as well as VarScan 2-based somatic mutation profiles were harvested from the TCGA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>).

The above result suggests TAGAP could regulate the differentiation of CD4+&#x02009;T cells by modulating c-Rel, thereby participating in the regulation of the anti-tumor activity of CD4+&#x02009;T cells.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>TAGAP participated in the differentiation of CD4+&#x02009;T cells by regulating the expression of c-Rel. <bold>a</bold> GESA analysis of TAGAP based on the TAGAP profile. c-Rel protein expression level in TAGAP <bold>b</bold> silencing and <bold>c</bold> overexpressing CD4+&#x02009;T cells. <bold>d</bold> The c-Rel protein expression in TAGAP overexpressing CD4+&#x02009;T cell after c-Rel (ov) treatment. <bold>e</bold> The percentages of Th1 (CD4<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;and IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>), Th17 (CD4<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;and IL17A<sup>+</sup>), and Treg (CD4<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;and FOXP3<sup>+</sup>) changes after rescuing c-Rel expression in CD4+&#x02009;T cell overexpressing TAGAP. **<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, ***<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 versus Control. <sup>#</sup><italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, <sup>###</sup><italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 versus TAGAP (ov). <bold>f</bold> The cytokine levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL17A and IL10 change after rescuing c-Rel expression in CD4+&#x02009;T cell overexpressing TAGAP. *<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, **<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 versus Control. <sup>#</sup><italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, <sup>##</sup><italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 versus TAGAP (ov)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="262_2025_3960_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">Exploring reliable drug targets for treating LUSC is a reliable way to improve the prognosis of LUSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Unveiling the immunosenescence mechanisms of T cells in cancer is pivotal for screening potential targeted therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In our study, we compared the mutation characteristics of several common therapeutic agents of NSCLC treatment in LUSC, like <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>ALK</italic>, <italic>ROS1</italic>, <italic>BRAF, KARS</italic>, <italic>RET</italic> and <italic>MET</italic>. And the mutation frequency of <italic>ROS1</italic> was the highest among the above genes in LUSC. Next, by comparing the expression profiles of <italic>ROS1</italic><sup>(wt)</sup> and <italic>ROS1</italic><sup>(mut)</sup>, the harvested DEGs were utilized for IRGs screening via WGCNA and prognosis signature building via IRGsP. Based on the signature, the immune milieu in different risk subgroups had been revealed, as well as the related chemotherapy sensibility, immune checkpoint expression, and IPS. Finally, TAGAP was identified as the hub gene among the IRGs and showed abundant expression in CD4+&#x02009;T cells of LUSC samples. Furthermore, overexpression of TAGAP in CD4+&#x02009;T cells enhanced its production of cytokines, promoted LUSC cell apoptosis, and inhibited its migration level in vitro. CD4+&#x02009;T cells with TAGAP overexpressing could also inhibit the progression of tumors due to the rejuvenation of CD4+&#x02009;T cells&#x02019; function in vivo. Our result revealed that TAGAP might be a viable immunosenescence target for the treatment of LUSC.</p><p id="Par40">ROS1 encodes a cellular receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) containing a transmembrane region, an N-terminal extracellular domain and a C-terminal intracellular tyrosine kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. It was first reported in NSCLC in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and after that, ROS1 became an established therapeutic target of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In our present study, <italic>ROS1</italic> mutation was more frequent than other genes in LUSC suggesting ROS1 may involve more potential mechanisms related to LUSC. To explore the potential mechanism related to LUSC, the LUSC samples of TCGA were separated into <italic>ROS1</italic>
<sup>(wt)</sup> and <italic>ROS1</italic>
<sup>(mut)</sup> subgroups to conduct the difference analysis. According to the enrichment results, the terms of chemokine signaling pathway or cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction activities were enriched by most DEGs. Moreover, the DEGs have mainly participated in biological processes of signaling transduction and immune response, as well as the molecular function related to protein binding. These results suggested the DEGs related to <italic>ROS1</italic> mutation were not only mainly involved in the immune response related to protein binding such as chemokine or cytokine receptors.</p><p id="Par41">The heterogeneity of TIME is an obstacle to many tumors&#x02019; treatment, which is largely caused by the different levels of immune cell infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. And different immune infiltration is highly associated with cancer prognosis. A prognosis risk module constructed by DEGs quested by comparing the samples of high- and low-immune infiltration could more accurately evaluate the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Other immune-related prognosis models were also reported in hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] whose ability to predict the outcome of the corresponding tumor was all better than the clinical TNM staging method. With the same aim to build a more reliable and accurate risk signature of LUSC, the IRGs from DEGs of <italic>ROS1</italic>
<sup>(wt)</sup> and <italic>ROS1</italic>
<sup>(mut)</sup> LUSC subgroups were utilized for the risk signature construction which could more accurately evaluate the prognosis of LUSC. More importantly, the time-dependent ROC curve of risk signature was better than the traditional TNM classification and the AUC values for OS evaluation at 1-, 3- and 5-years were all&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.7. In addition, the nomogram combined with risk signature and traditional clinical information would help to achieve a personalized prediction of LUSC outcomes. These results suggesting the risk signature constructed by IRGs could be realized in the personalized evaluation of LUSC.</p><p id="Par42">Through comparing the levels of immune cell infiltration within the low- and high-risk subgroups, the levels of NK, CD8+&#x02009;T and follicular helper T cells were decreased and plasma, CD4+&#x02009;memory resting T cells and macrophage M2 cells were increased in the high-risk subgroup. Among them, NK cells have been reported to demonstrate anti-tumor properties by producing a large number of cytokines like interferon-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In addition, CD8+&#x02009;T cells also known as the CD8+&#x02009;cytotoxic T lymphocytes. And CD8+&#x02009;T cells mainly exert the roles of cytotoxicity and anti-tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. And cells of follicular helper T had been identified as the vital type to activate the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The plasma cells located in tumors or in tumor-draining lymph nodes have a crucial effect on anti-tumor immune responses as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The memory CD4+&#x02009;T cell has been reported as an independent index for NSCLC metastasis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. M2 macrophage cells could contribute to tumor carcinogenesis and less M2 macrophage infiltration always was associated with poorer OS of specific cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In the present study, the above anti-tumor immune cells decreased in the high-risk subgroup may be one reason for the poor outcome of LUSC.</p><p id="Par43">With the increasing understanding of tumor immune mechanisms, the treatment of NSCLC has shifted from adjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy to immunotherapy. Especially, the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (like anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4) has brought promising progress in advanced NSCLC patients with better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Herein, the genes of PDCD1, CTLA4 and PDCD1LG2 expressions were compared between the low- and the high-risk subgroups and found PDCD1, CTLA4 and PDCD1LG2 expressions were all significantly higher in the high-risk subgroup. In addition, the response and efficacy of ICIs&#x02019; application could be evaluated via IPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. In our results, we found the IPS of the low-risk subgroup was lower than that within the high-risk subgroup in the application of anti-CTLA4. These results suggested the ICI therapy of CTLA4 might be beneficial for the high-risk subgroup of LUSC. Although the application of ICIs is of crucial significance for NSCLC therapy, only a part of cancer patients can respond to immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Next, the sensitivities of common chemotherapy agents were compared between high- and low-risk subgroups of LUSC. It is worth noting that the sensitivities of Gefitinib, Paclitaxel, and Mitomycin.C were increased in the high-risk subgroup and Sunitinib sensitivity was lower in the high-risk subgroup, suggesting Sunitinib might be a potentially effective chemotherapy drug for the high-risk subgroup of LUSC. Finally, considering that application of chemotherapy drugs is easy leading to the emergence of drug resistance and limiting its application, we screened some potential chemotherapy agents according to the hub genes of IRGs. In the results, Nelarabine, Chelerythrine, Imexon, Hydroxyurea, Chlorambucil, Uracil mustard, Isotretinoin, and Fluphenazine may be the effective drug for high-risk LUSC patients.</p><p id="Par44">Exploring new pathogenic targets or molecular mechanisms of LUSC is expected to provide more strategies for LUSC management. Here, via difference and sc-seq analysis of LUSC, TAGAP was found in all cell types containing epithelial cells, fibroblasts, B cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells. However, its expression was more abundant in immune cells, especially T cells and neutrophils. According to previous studies, TAGAP encodes members of the Rho GTPases superfamily, which is involved in the Rho GTPase cycle and responsible for T cell response to stimuli and influencing T cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In addition, as the activator of Rho GTPases, TAGAP could exhibit certain effects on autoimmune diseases by overactivation of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Therefore, the lower TAGAP expression, the worse the prognosis of LUSC, and the loss of T cell function may be the key factor. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments based on CD4 T cells in vitro and in vivo. As expected, overexpression of TAGAP on CD4+&#x02009;T cells could enhance its activity, manifested by increased cytotoxicity, weakened migration ability of co-cultured LUSC cells, increased apoptosis in vitro and significant inhibition of the volume and size of transplanted tumors in vivo. Moreover, more pronounced CD4 expression and increased apoptosis of cells could be observed in xenograft tumors. Moreover, TAGAP could promote the differentiation of CD4+&#x02009;T cells into Th1/Th17 cells with pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects, while inhibiting their differentiation into Tregs with inhibitory immune responses. The above results indicated that TAGAP exerted its anti-tumor effect on CD4+&#x02009;T cells by affecting their differentiation into Th1/Th17 cells. Immunosenescence drives T cells from quiescence to a terminally differentiated state, characterized by reduced lineage plasticity and a diminished capacity to respond to novel antigenic challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the observed TAGAP enhanced function of CD4+&#x02009;T cells may represent a mechanism counteracting immunosenescence.</p><p id="Par45">NF-&#x003ba;B pathway has been demonstrated as a hallmark of immunosenescence in the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Abnormal activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is often associated with the development of tumors, including NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In this study, we found that TAGAP could negatively regulate the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B via GSEA analysis. There are two pathways for NF-&#x003ba;B activation: canonical and non-canonical pathways. For the canonical pathway, the NF-&#x003ba;B heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 or p50 and c-Rel is mainly involved in immune response and cell survival. And c-Rel activity in CD4+&#x02009;T cells could restrict their anti-tumor responses and promote its differentiation into Tregs and chemical c-Rel inhibition could reduce melanoma growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], suggesting c-Rel might harm CD4+&#x02009;T immune response. In our study, overexpression of TAGAP in CD4+&#x02009;T cells could inhibit c-Rel expression while TAGAP silencing up-regulated expression of c-Rel. Moreover, upregulating c-Rel in CD4+&#x02009;T cells with TAGAP overexpression partially weakened the activation effect of TAGAT on CD4+&#x02009;T cells toward Th1/Th17 differentiation, facilitating their differentiation into Tregs. Based on the above results, it can be inferred that TAGAP activated CD4+&#x02009;T cells by regulating c-Rel.</p><p id="Par46">This study presents several limitations that warrant acknowledgment. First, further investigation into the mechanisms driving TAGAP downregulation in CD4+&#x02009;T cells within the LUSC TIME is crucial. Understanding these upstream processes could inform preventative strategies targeting TAGAP related LUSC development. Second, while this study focused on c-Rel, a crucial regulator of CD4+&#x02009;T activation and differentiation, a more comprehensive analysis of TAGAP's downstream effects is needed. Employing transcriptional sequencing could elucidate the broader impact of TAGAP on CD4+&#x02009;T cell function. In addition, the senescence biomarkers of CD4+&#x02009;T cells after TAGAP targeting should be further investigated in the future. Finally, exploring the role of TAGAP in other immune cell populations within the LUSC context could provide valuable insights for translating TAGAP related findings into clinical applications.</p><p id="Par47">In conclusion, a LUSC prognostic signature constructed with TAGAP as the key gene could reliably distinguish the high-/low-risk LUSC populations. In addition, TAGAP, as a c-Rel suppressor in CD4+&#x02009;T cells could promote their differentiation into Th1/Th17 cells and inhibit their differentiation into Tregs, thereby rejuvenating the anti-tumor ability of CD4+&#x02009;T cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="262_2025_3960_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 1270 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Peian Cai and Haibo Sun contributed as the co-first authors.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>PC, HS, TJ and GL conceived and designed the study.
