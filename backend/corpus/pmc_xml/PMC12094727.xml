</self-uri><abstract><p>This study was conducted to determine and compare the effects of reformer pilates (RP) and mat pilates (MP) exercises on soccer players&#x02019; physical parameters and technical skills. Thirty voluntary participants were randomly assigned to either RP group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; age&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.65), MP group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; age&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.40&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.35) and control group (CG) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; age&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.15). Technical and physical performance tests were performed. In the RP group counter movement jump (CMJ), standing broad jump (SBJ), single leg triple hop right-left, balance right-left leg, flexibility, 10-20m sprint, german agility (GA), speed dribbling (SPD), loughborough soccer passing (LSPT), lobbed passing right food, lobbed passing total measurement results showed a statistically significant difference between pre-test and post-test mean values (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In the MP group, balance right-left leg, single leg triple hop right-left, 5 - 10m sprint, GA, SPD, LBP, lobbed passing right measurement results showed a statistically significant difference between pre-test and post-test mean values (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The control group had no significant difference in the pre-test and post-test mean values of technical and physical performance measurements (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). Between-group comparisons revealed superior improvements in GA, LSPT, and single-leg triple hop right-left in the RP group compared to the MP group. Based on these findings, coaches and sports performance specialists may enhance athletes&#x02019; physical performance and technical skills by incorporating Pilates exercises (particularly RP) into training programs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Health, Czech Republic</institution>

Athletic performance requirements differ significantly based on the specific sports disciplines [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In soccer, optimal performance demands multifaceted physical and technical abilities, including repeated high-intensity sprints, endurance, agility, coordination, dynamic balance, and precise execution of technical skills such as dribbling, passing, shooting, and heading [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Soccer players must possess a high degree of balance, coordination, flexibility, agility, speed, endurance, and technical proficiency to perform effectively [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, training interventions targeting these specific components are critical to improving overall soccer performance.</p><p>Pilates exercises represent a promising training methodology due to their unique emphasis on core strength, muscular integration, flexibility, and neuromuscular coordination, aspects directly relevant to soccer players&#x02019; performance [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Pilates is designed to create a strong, harmonious, flexible, and balanced body by integrating major and minor muscle groups through precise and controlled movements [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Pilates training is typically executed through two primary methods: mat Pilates, which uses body weight and supplementary materials (e.g., small balls, Pilates rings), and apparatus-based Pilates, notably using a reformer machine. The reformer utilizes springs for controlled force and resistance, enabling diverse exercises in lying, sitting, or standing positions, thereby enhancing external resistance during muscular contractions [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Recent literature has demonstrated Pilates&#x02019; effectiveness in improving performance-related parameters across various sports, including static and dynamic balance in archers [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], muscular endurance and technical skills in volleyball players [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], posture and flexibility in dancers [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], coordination and agility in badminton athletes [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and core strength in cricket and karate athletes [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite these findings, evidence specifically examining Pilates&#x02019; efficacy in soccer is limited. Previous studies on soccer have primarily assessed singular Pilates modalities without directly comparing different Pilates methods or comprehensively evaluating both physical and technical performance outcomes within one design [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>To address these gaps, the present study uniquely compares two distinct Pilates modalities (mat Pilates vs. reformer Pilates) in a controlled experimental design involving amateur male soccer players. The choice of Pilates training over other modalities, such as aerobic gymnastics or traditional stretching, is justified by Pilates&#x02019; superior focus on controlled dynamic movements, precise body control, integrated muscular engagement, and enhancement of core stability, factors crucial for soccer-specific actions.</p><p>We hypothesized that both mat and reformer Pilates training would significantly improve soccer players&#x02019; physical performance and technical skills compared to a control group. Moreover, we expected reformer Pilates, due to its increased mechanical resistance and functional variability, to provide superior improvements in performance metrics. Thus, the current research aimed to investigate and compare the effects of reformer Pilates and mat Pilates exercises on the physical performance and technical skills of amateur soccer players.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty amateur male soccer players voluntarily participated in this study as reformer pilates group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; age&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.65; weight (kg) = 71.53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.80; height (cm) = 179.80&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.58; BMI (kg/m2) = 22.12&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1,17), mat pilates group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; age&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.40&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.35; weight (kg) = 71.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.28; height (cm) = 179.70&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.83; BMI (kg/m2) = 22.05&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.47), and control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; age&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.15; weight (kg) = 73.15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.85; height (cm) = 179.85&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.56; BMI (kg/m2) = 22.61&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.55). Participants are amateur soccer players competing in local amateur league. Players were accustomed to a training regimen of at least six training units per week and had participated in soccer training and competitive matches for a minimum of 4 years. The experimental groups included players on the same team. The control group consisted players from a diffrent team. The research was executed out at the beginning of the season, during the preparation period. The participants were verbally informed of the study&#x02019;s content, methodologies, procedures, benefits, potential risks and permission forms were collected voluntarily. The players included in the study did not have any injuries or general health problems before the study. The players did not experience any injuries during the study. The groups consistently participated in the training sessions designed for them.</p><p>Participants were allocated to three research groups using a random assignment method: Reformer pilates (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), mat pilates (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), and control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.randomization.com</ext-link>). The flow diagram is shown in <xref rid="pone.0324129.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. The randomization process was conducted by an individual who was both unrelated to the objectives of the investigation and not involved in any aspect of data collecting or any phase of the trial. The study was carried out between 20.11.2021 and 10.03.2022. The study was prepared in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. To determine the appropriate sample size for this study comparing the effects of RP and MP on physical performance and technical skills in amateur male soccer players, a power analysis was conducted. The study aimed to detect a significant difference in physical performance and technical parameters, which are continuous variables. Based on previous literature and pilot data, an effect size of 0.8 was estimated for physical performance and technical skills improvements between the intervention groups, indicating a large effect. To achieve a power of 0.80 and a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, it was calculated that a minimum of 10 participants per group would be required, totaling 30 participants across the three groups (RP, MP, and control). This sample size allows for sufficient power to detect significant differences in physical performance and technical skills outcomes while accounting for potential dropouts. Given the experimental design and the exploratory nature of comparing two different Pilates methods, this sample size is considered adequate for providing reliable and generalizable results within the context of this study.

The research was conducted in three phases. The study was completed over a total of 10 weeks, consisting of 1 weeks of pre-testing, 8 weeks of pilates training interventions (Reformer pilates and Mat pilates), and 1 weeks of post-testing. The players completed a 5&#x02013;10-20m sprint test, german agility test, counter movement jump (CMJ) test, standing broad jump (SBJ) test, single-leg triple hop test, sit and reach test, Y balance under extremity (YBT) test, speed dribbling test, loughborough soccer passing test and lobbed passing test before and after the 8-week intervention period. All tests and training periods were performed on an artificial grass pitch at a consistent time of day (17:00), following the same sequence of tests and players. The reformer and mat pilates group were subjected to six weekly training days for eight weeks, including three Pilates and three team training days. The control group continued their regular team training regimen six days per week. Three groups were allocated one day of rest per week. The mat and reformer Pilates group exercise sessions lasted 50&#x02013;60 minutes. A 5-minute warm-up session was conducted just before starting the Pilates exercises. MP groups had two-minute rest breaks after the toe-top, spine twist, and circle side-kick movements. RP groups had two-minute rest intervals after the supine arm series, short box, arm series, and knee stretch movements.

The participants proceeded to run a distance of 20 meters, while their running durations were measured using a set of paired photocells (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) placed at intervals of 5, 10, and 20 meters. Participants assume an upright position with their anterior limbs positioned 0.2 meters from the initiation photocell beam. The evaluation process is completed within a matter of seconds [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Counter Movement Jump (CMJ).</title><p>The participant was directed to do the counter movement jump (CMJ) with an arm swing. This involved squatting to a knee flexion angle of around 90&#x000ba; and executing a leap with maximal concentric contraction to achieve maximum height. The participants performed two initial leaps, succeeded by five maximum jumps, with 6-second intervals in between [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Standing Broad Jump (SBJ).</title><p>The standing broad jump test was conducted on a rigid surface. Participants position themselves by aligning their heels with the starting line and ensuring that their feet are parallel to each other. Following the researcher&#x02019;s instructions, students execute the maneuver by leaping with maximum horizontal displacement. The tests are conducted twice, with a five-minute interval between each session. The distance was quantified using a tape measure in centimeters, from the beginning line to the heel of the foot that was closest to the starting line. The superior result of the two tries was documented [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Single-leg triple hop test.</title><p>Participants start the activity by assuming a standing position on the specified foot, with hands placed on the hips and toes positioned behind the starting line. Participants are directed to execute a maximum of 3 forward leaps, initially landing on the same leg, with the aim of reducing the amount of time their feet spend on the ground following the first and second jumps. When completing the last jump, participants are instructed to execute a controlled fall and maintain this position for a duration of 2 seconds. Failure to land invalidates the attempt and the leap is retaken after a 60-second rest [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Sit and reach test&#x000a0;(SRT).</title><p>The measurement of flexibility using the traditional SRT methodology. In this experiment, a conventional SRT box of 30.5&#x02009;cm in height was employed. The box was equipped with a sliding reach indication on a measuring scale ranging from 0 to 50&#x02009;cm. The 35 centimeter mark is in perfect alignment with the foot panel of the box. The subject performs testing in a seated position on the floor, with their legs together, knees extended, and bare soles pressed on the foot panel of the testing box. The participant is instructed to maintain an open position of their knees during the test and to ensure the stability of their knees during the test. The maximal position should be progressively achieved and sustained for a duration of 2 seconds.

To score each of the three aspects, they are normalized by the participant&#x02019;s leg length. The composite score is determined by calculating the mean of the right and left reach distances for each of the three directions, and then adding together the averages for all three reach directions. The score is calculated by dividing it by three times the average length of the legs and arms, and then multiplying it by 100 [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>German agility.</title><p>This agility test is one of the tests used to determine motor diagnostics in the German football talent identification and development program. The participant begins the race from a stationary position, without any cues, and navigates through a slalom course to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. It is utilized on a track measuring 13 meters in length and 4 meters in wide. Slalom bars are positioned at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th meters along the 4th wide meter and a long with at the 0th, 8th, 9th, and 10th meters.

An independent samples t-test was used to evaluate within-group differences. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (3x2) (two-way ANOVA) was used to analyze the data. The factors included three Pilates groups (reformer, mat, and control) and repeated measurements (pre- and post-exercise). The effect sizes for all tests in the two-way ANOVA were calculated using a partial eta squared. This is a measurement of the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent variables.

No significant improvements were observed in the 5m sprint and lobbed passing (left foot). Although previous literature on RP exercises in soccer is scarce, studies in other athletic populations report similar enhancements in CMJ, agility, and balance [<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324129.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

The sample consisted exclusively of young male amateur soccer players, limiting generalizability. Future research should include diverse participant groups regarding age, gender, competitive levels, and playing positions. Additionally, the eight-week training duration and frequency (three days per week) may not reflect the full potential of Pilates interventions. Further research should explore longer intervention durations and varying training frequencies. The lack of nutrition control also represents a limitation. Future studies incorporating nutritional monitoring could further elucidate Pilates&#x02019; effects on soccer performance. Addressing these factors in future studies would strengthen the evidence base for Pilates training in soccer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides evidence supporting the implementation of Pilates exercises, especially reformer Pilates, as effective training modalities to enhance physical and technical performance among amateur soccer players.

I hope you will understand that all of them are made with the sole purpose of helping you to improve your work.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>- There is a lack of contextualisation of football in the work. It is not possible to present a work on improving the performance of a sport without going into the aspects of performance in depth.</p><p>- The bibliographic selection is scarce and outdated and does not provide relevant information to contextualise the study. There are a multitude of academic studies of great impact on performance in football that are not present in the article.</p><p>- The authors point out that there is no evidence of performance improvement in football players through Pilates and focus on the differences between two Pilates methods before testing whether Pilates itself improves performance regardless of the modality.</p><p>Material and methods</p><p>- The description of the sample indicates that the players are amateurs but does not indicate in which league they play, if they all belong to the same team, how much training load they have, and all the variables required in this type of study. To improve this point, I suggest that they be guided by published works in this respect in which all the characteristics of the participants and their conditions are indicated in detail.</p><p>- The sample is small and by convenience, which presents a very important limitation in the results.</p><p>- The authors state that the participants have no injuries or health problems, but do not specify how this data was obtained.</p><p>- It is also specified that the players train regularly, but the workload is not specified.</p><p>- This section is disorderly and chaotic, which makes it difficult to read.</p><p>- The exercise protocol specifies that the control group does not do any exercise while the other two groups do a protocol. This biases the results as the control group members receive less training than the groups receiving Pilates. In other words, there are two groups that do 6 sessions per week while the control group does only 3. This already generates differences, regardless of the techniques used.</p><p>- The authors state that the distribution of the data is normal, but do not specify the test used or add the test coefficients.</p><p>- It is not clearly specified how the analyses have been carried out, as there is a pre-post and a comparison between groups. If all this has been done at the same time, it is more advisable to use an ANCOVA.</p><p>- With the sample size, I consider it much more accurate to perform non-parametric tests such as the Kruskal Wallis analysis, as ANOVA tests require a larger number of subjects. In order to use a two-way ANOVA, the groups must consist of at least 15 subjects, otherwise the results may be compromised.</p><p>Results</p><p>- The results are confusing and disorganised</p><p>I hope that these indications will help you to improve your work.</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Overview:</p><p>The article presents a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of reformer pilates (RP) and mat pilates (MP) exercises on the physical performance and technical skills of soccer players. The study reveals that both pilates methods improve the performance of soccer players, but reformer pilates is more effective than mat pilates. The article provides valuable information, especially for those working in the field of sports science and training methodology.</p><p>Thank you for the interesting insights your article provides. The manuscript is well-written and deals with an important topic. I have thoroughly reviewed the manuscript and would like to make some suggestions for your review.</p><p>Abstract section:</p><p>- RP group (n=10; 20.60 &#x000b1; 1.65), MP group (n=10; 19.40 &#x000b1; 1.35), and control group (CG) (n=10; 20.10 &#x000b1; 1.15).</p><p>- Add unit, example: (age 20.60 &#x000b1; 1.65 years)</p><p>Introduction section:</p><p>- &#x0201c;Soccer players must have a high degree of athletic performance characteristics such as including balance, coordination, flexibility, agility, speed, endurance, and technical</p><p>skills in order to properly accomplish these activities.
