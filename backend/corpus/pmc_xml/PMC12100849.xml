Exosomal small RNAs play a key role in cell&#x02013;cell communication in CKD and may serve as nanocarriers for delivering small RNAs into podocytes. However, the uptake of exosomal cargo by podocytes remains poorly understood. This study explores the use of isolated exosomes, directly transfected with fluorescently-labeled small RNAs, for tracking and delivering small RNAs to cultured podocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Exosomes were isolated from immortalized murine podocytes and transfected with Cy3-labeled siRNA and miRNA controls using the ExoFect siRNA/miRNA Transfection Kit. We characterized the transfected exosomes via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western blot for exosomal markers CD9 and TSG101. Subsequently, we co-cultured these exosomes with podocytes and used confocal laser-scanning microscopy (cLSM), and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to visualize cargo uptake, confirmed through flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining for Rab5, Rab7, and CD9. The isolated exosomes were also transfected with pre-miR-21 and filamin A (FlnA)-siRNAs before being co-cultured with podocytes. We confirmed the efficiency of transfection and knockdown using RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">TEM revealed that the exosomes maintained a consistent shape and size of approximately 20&#x000a0;nm posttransfection and exhibited a stable expression of CD9 and TSG101. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging showed that podocytes take up Cy3-labeled exosomal miRNAs and siRNAs time-dependently, utilizing various mechanisms, including encapsulation within vesicular structures, endocytosis and free distribution within the cells. Transfection of exosomes with FlnA-siRNAs resulted in a significant 2.8-fold reduction of filamin A expression in co-cultured podocytes, while pre-miR-21-transfected exosomes led to a remarkable 338-fold increase in mature miR-21 levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These findings demonstrate that direct exosome transfection with fluorescently-labeled small RNAs is an effective method for tracking exosomal cargo in podocytes. This study is the first to show that directly transfected exosomes can deliver small RNAs to podocytes in vitro, suggesting their potential as RNA carriers for therapeutic strategies in more complex settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par5">&#x000a0;<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="12951_2025_3426_Figa_HTML" id="MO10"/></p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12951-025-03426-7.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Podocyte</kwd><kwd>Exosomes</kwd><kwd>Transfection</kwd><kwd>Vesicles</kwd><kwd>CKD</kwd><kwd>Small RNA</kwd><kwd>MiRNA</kwd><kwd>SiRNA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#01GM1518B</award-id><award-id>#01GM1518B</award-id><award-id>#01GM1518B</award-id><award-id>#01GM1518B</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100021130</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#16KN077229</award-id><award-id>#16KN077229</award-id><award-id>#16KN077229</award-id><award-id>#16KN077229</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>S&#x000fc;dmeyer Stiftung f&#x000fc;r Nieren- und Gef&#x000e4;&#x000df;forschung</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Dr. Gerhard B&#x000fc;chtemann Stiftung</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Greifswald (8976)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Podocytes, a highly specialized renal epithelial cell type, cover the outer aspect of the glomerular capillaries and are crucial for the size-selectivity of the filtration barrier. Changes in the complex 3D morphology of their interdigitating foot processes or their loss are the leading causes of 80% of chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">CKD is a major public health burden affecting more than 10% of the world&#x02019;s population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Until now, there has been no causal therapy for the treatment of CKD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If CKD progresses, renal replacement therapies such as dialysis and transplantation are necessary. However, they are often associated with significant limitations in quality of life and with increased mortality. Therefore, advanced strategies to generate new treatment options are urgently needed.</p><p id="Par8">The study of extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes, is an innovative and promising approach for the treatment of CKD. These vesicles play important roles in cell&#x02012;cell communication between podocytes and can also act as natural carriers for a variety of molecular cargos, such as proteins, metabolites, DNA, RNA and small RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Podocytes release increased amounts of exosomes containing disease-specific small RNA cargo during kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], especially miRNAs, which have recently come into the focus of kidney research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that exosomes could also function as delivery vehicles for small RNAs to podocytes. This would open up completely new avenues for therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Current studies primarily use indirect loading strategies, such as the use of exosomes isolated from naturally overexpressing cell types like stem cells, to treat podocyte-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another common approach involves the transfection of donor cells with specific small RNAs and the subsequent isolation of the enriched exosomes that they secrete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Both methods have major disadvantages: they lack specificity due to the presence of other endogenous small RNAs, they often have insufficient intracellular packaging of the target small RNAs, they have reduced reproducibility, and the transfection reagents used are difficult to remove and often toxic to recipient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">A more promising approach than the currently preferred indirect methods could be the direct transfection of exosomes with small RNAs. Direct transfection of exosomes enables precise cargo loading with higher efficiency, consistency, and scalability, bypassing donor cell dependence and allowing incorporation of non-endogenous materials for therapeutic applications. However, researchers have not yet determined whether cultured podocytes can effectively internalize these cargo-loaded exosomes and whether the small RNAs contained in these exosomes remain functional. To address these questions, we directly transfected exosomes with fluorescentlylabeled miRNAs and siRNAs, demonstrating their potential as a viable tool for delivering small RNAs into podocytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par11">Conditionally immortalized podocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (SVI; NIPOKA GmbH, Greifswald, Germany) were used for all the cell culture experiments and were handled as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Another common indirect approach is the transfection of donor cells with specific small RNAs and the subsequent isolation of enriched exosomes secreted by these cells. Zhang et al. transfected HEK293 cells with miR-145-5p, isolated miR-145-5p-enriched exosomes and then co-cultured these exosomes with podocytes.

However, both strategies have considerable disadvantages. First, they lack specificity, as many other endogenous exosomal small RNAs are present in addition to the target RNAs. Second, the efficiency of packaging transfected small RNAs into exosomes within donor cells is often insufficient, resulting in lower transfection rates and poor reproducibility. Third, transfection reagents are difficult to remove completely from isolated exosomes and can therefore be cytotoxic to recipient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">A promising alternative approach is the direct transfection of exosomes, which are already being used in cancer research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

Currently, most studies use staining protocols to visualize exosome uptake via fluorescent labeling of exosomal membrane components via either immunofluorescence or organic dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These methods have various disadvantages since organic dyes are predisposed to stain cellular components other than exosomes and thereby generate false positive results.

In the present study, we circumvented these drawbacks by using prelabeled exosomal cargo instead of staining exosomal structural components. This technique not only increases the potential for tracking small RNA transport but also offers significant advantages for tracking exosomes and exosomal cargo. By using this method, we were able to show that cultured podocytes internalize the fluorescentlylabeled small RNAs delivered by directly transfected exosomes.</p><p id="Par41">To reveal the mechanism of uptake, we performed additional experiments. In general, exosomes can be internalized in different ways, such as clathrin-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and caveolae-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and macro- and pinocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or receptor-mediated endocytosis. We observed that the internalized small RNAs are localized either within the cytosol or encapsulated in CD9-positive vesicles. To determine the dominant vesicle type, we stained for Rab5, a marker for early endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and Rab7, a marker for late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. After staining podocytes with specific antibodies, we found that most Cy3-fluorescence colocalized with Rab5 and, to a lesser extent, with Rab7. These findings suggest that the uptake of exosomal cargo by podocytes in vitro occurs via endocytosis. However, the exact mechanisms of exosomal cargo uptake by podocytes remain rather unclear and require further studies.</p><p id="Par42">To determine whether the transfected small RNAs remained functional, exosomes were loaded with specific siRNAs against FlnA and Pxn as representative targets since they are essential for podocyte cytoskeleton integrity and highly expressed in cultured podocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We found that FlnA and Pxn were almost completely downregulated in podocytes that were treated with FlnA/Pxn-siRNA exosomes confirming that the siRNAs remained functionally active.</p><p id="Par43">A similar result was also observed for pre-miR-21-loaded exosomes. MiR-21 has been shown to be upregulated in kidney injury and in the urinary exosomes of CKD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We found that mature miR-21 was strongly upregulated in podocytes after pre-miR-21-exosome treatment.</p><p id="Par44">During the biogenesis of miRNAs, they undergo several processing steps. After transcription, miRNAs are present as pri-miRs with a length of &#x0003e;1 kb and are further processed intranuclearly into 60&#x02013;70 nt long pre-miRs with a stem&#x02012;loop structure. These pre-miRs are exported into the cytosol and then cleaved by Dicers into mature miRNA and an opposing strand, which is further degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Using Taqman probes that are specific for mature miR-21 and can distinguish between pre-miRs and their mature forms with 2000-fold higher efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we observed that the transfected pre-miR-21 was processed into mature miR-21 by the recipient podocytes, confirming their integrity. These results are consistent with previous findings that RNAs packed in exosomes are protected from degradation by RNases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Our findings may open up great possibilities for various experimental approaches in podocyte research. The uptake of exosomes by podocytes has been reported several times before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe small RNA uptake in podocytes by directly transfected exosomes.</p><p id="Par46">Podocytes, a postmitotic cell type, undergo cell cycle arrest even under most in vitro conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Like other postmitotic cells, podocytes are difficult to transfect and highly sensitive to transfection reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Here, we show that directly transfected exosomes could represent a promising alternative to overcome these challenges. Direct exosome transfection could also play a promising role in the targeted, therapeutic administration of small RNAs to podocytes in higher organisms. Evidence from oncology research suggests that cells are more prone to phagocytizing exosomes than liposomes, for example, which are currently the gold standard in RNA delivery trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Moreover, exosomes are less immunogenic than liposomes and express damage-specific surface markers that facilitate specific uptake by injured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Taken together, directly transfected exosomes represent a promising clinical strategy for treating podocyte-related diseases since they allow the targeted delivery of miRNA or siRNA. This approach can regulate key molecular pathways, reduce inflammation, prevent apoptosis, restore cytoskeletal integrity, and possibly mitigate proteinuria, thereby preserving renal function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">In summary, we have shown that direct exosome loading with fluorescently-labeled small RNAs is suitable for exosome tracking approaches in podocytes in vitro. This study is the first to demonstrate the potential of directly transfected exosomes for delivering small RNAs to podocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> providing an initial indication that exosomes could serve as small RNA carriers for therapeutic strategies in more complex experimental settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
