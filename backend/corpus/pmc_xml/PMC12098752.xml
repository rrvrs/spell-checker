She presented with pain and restricted forearm rotation during heavy lifting. Surgical excision of the synostosis with anconeus muscle flap interposition was performed. Four months postoperatively, the patient demonstrated improved pronation and supination with no further complaints. Surgical intervention should be considered in adult cases where forearm rotation is compromised.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>anconeus</kwd><kwd>flap</kwd><kwd>integra</kwd><kwd>radioulnar</kwd><kwd>synostosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synostosis refers to the abnormal fusion of two bones, with radioulnar synostosis being an uncommon complication following forearm trauma, reported in 0-9.4% of cases [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vince and Miller's classification divides radioulnar synostosis into three types based on location: distal third, middle third, and proximal third [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hastings and Graham later expanded this classification, identifying six forearm regions prone to synostosis [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, Jupiter and Ring subdivided proximal synostosis into types 3A (distal to the bicipital tuberosity), 3B (at the radial head and proximal radioulnar joint), and 3C (extending to the distal humerus) [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;Risk factors include postoperative complications and trauma. The incidence of proximal radioulnar synostosis ranges from 1.2% to 6.2% in patients with combined radius and ulna fractures [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CT scanning with 3D reconstruction aids in determining the precise location and extent of the synostosis, guiding the surgical approach [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Surgical approaches, such as posterolateral or posterior global, are selected based on the extent of bony ankylosis.&#x000a0;Pronation and supination range of motion is exclusively seen in the forearm alone. This occurrence is partly due to two condylar articulations (proximal radioulnar joint and distal radioulnar joint) and also an osseoligamentous intercondylar segment. Both axes of the radioulnar joint must be aligned coaxially for an even forearm rotation to take place. Here, we present a case of proximal radioulnar synostosis treated with excision and anconeus muscle flap interposition with Integra application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 42-year-old woman presented with a four-month history of pain and limited forearm rotation. Eighteen months earlier, she sustained a radial head fracture from a fall, treated conservatively with casting for one month at another facility. The patient was diagnosed with proximal radioulnar synostosis during follow-up but defaulted on the proposed surgery. Upon presentation to our center post-trauma of 18 months, clinical examination revealed an arc of motion restriction with 20&#x000b0; of pronation and supination was only achievable (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Preoperative clinical image showing limitation in pronation and supination of patient right forearm as compared to the normal contralateral side</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082783-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Radiographs confirmed synostosis at the proximal radioulnar joint with a healed radial head fracture (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Synostosis of the radius and ulna can be either congenital or post-traumatic. Classification systems typically focus on either anatomical location or functional limitation. Vince and Miller categorized forearm synostosis into three types based on location: distal third, middle third, and proximal third [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Jupiter and Ring further subdivided the proximal synostosis (type 3) into three subgroups: type 3A (at or distal to the bicipital tuberosity), type 3B (at the radial head and proximal radioulnar joint, as seen in our case), and type 3C (contiguous with heterotopic ossification extending to the distal humerus) [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hastings and Graham introduced a separate classification system addressing functional limitations [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Surgical intervention is typically justified in patients with significant range of motion deficits, as prolonged delay can result in severe, irreversible stiffness [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recommended timing for surgical excision varies, with studies suggesting intervals from six to 12 months and up to one to two years post-injury, depending on the extent of synostosis [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some researchers recommend waiting six to 12 months but not exceeding three years [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Preoperative imaging, particularly CT scan with 3D reconstruction, is crucial for evaluating the location and extent of the synostosis and planning the surgical approach [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The posterolateral and posterior global approaches are commonly used for proximal radioulnar synostosis, based on Jupiter and Ring's classification [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The latter may provide better outcomes, particularly in cases of bony ankylosis at the elbow joint.</p><p>Several techniques, including grafts and flaps, have been described to prevent the recurrence of synostosis, though none have emerged as the definitive gold standard. In this case, anconeus muscle interposition was used because it is within the same operative field, eliminating the need for positional changes, thus reducing operative time and technical difficulty. Bell and Benger reported favorable outcomes with vascularized anconeus muscle interposition, with no postoperative complications [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Early initiation of postoperative rehabilitation, as employed in this case, likely contributed to the patient's rapid recovery. The use of native muscle within the same operative field not only minimized morbidity but also supported faster functional recovery. Early rehabilitation is crucial in maintaining an optimal arc of motion and preventing recurrent stiffness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite various techniques available for treating proximal radioulnar synostosis, there is no universally accepted gold standard treatment. The decision to proceed with surgical intervention should be based on multiple factors, including the duration and extent of synostosis and the patient's functional limitations. Early postoperative rehabilitation is vital for preserving the desired range of motion and optimizing recovery.&#x000a0;Regular follow-up is also recommended, as this helps identify the risk of recurrence and allows for quick intervention if needed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Deepak Singh, Chia Hua Lim, Jamari Sapuan</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Deepak Singh, Shalimar Abdullah, Elaine Zi Fan Soh</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Deepak Singh</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Deepak Singh, Chia Hua Lim, Shalimar Abdullah, Jamari Sapuan, Elaine Zi Fan Soh</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Chia Hua Lim, Shalimar Abdullah, Jamari Sapuan</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Cross-union complicating fracture of the forearm.
