</self-uri><abstract><p>Spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury are major causes of long-term disability and are often complicated by spasticity, a motor disorder characterized by increased muscle tone and exaggerated reflexes that significantly impair quality of life. Current diagnostic methods lack the sensitivity needed to accurately predict the severity of injury or the onset and progression of spasticity. Trauma-induced calcium dysregulation activates calpains, a family of proteases that cleave sodium channels, disrupting their inactivation and increasing persistent sodium currents. This cascade drives the overexcitability of motoneurons, contributing to the development of spasticity. Consequently, sodium channel fragments have emerged as promising biomarkers that link injury mechanisms to clinical outcomes. The present SpasT-SCI-T clinical trial protocol aims to evaluate sodium channel fragments as blood biomarkers for assessing the severity of spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries, as well as their potential to predict clinical outcomes, including the development of spasticity. This prospective, multicenter, case-control and cohort study involves 40 participants: 20 individuals with spinal cord injury, 10 individuals with traumatic brain injury, and 10 healthy controls. Blood samples are collected within six hours of injury and at follow-up points over six months. Clinical outcomes, including spasticity (assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale), neurological recovery (measured by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and Glasgow Coma Scale), and quality of life (evaluated using the Short Form-36 Health Survey), are analyzed in correlation with biomarker levels. We anticipate that calpain-mediated sodium channel fragments will transform the management of central nervous system injuries by enabling early diagnosis, improving prognostic accuracy, and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies. The clinical trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06532760, January 10, 2024), with Assistance Publique&#x02013;H&#x000f4;pitaux de Marseille as the sponsor.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Accurate and timely assessment of its severity is paramount for predicting outcomes and guiding therapeutic interventions. However, current diagnostic methods, which rely primarily on clinical examinations and imaging, lack the sensitivity required for precise evaluation, especially during the critical acute phase [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This diagnostic gap underscores the urgent need for novel, reliable biomarkers to improve clinical decision-making.</p><p>One of the most prevalent and disabling complications of SCI is spasticity, which affects up to 75% of patients within the first year post-injury [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Spasticity, classically defined as hypertonia with a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflexes [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], encompasses a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including clonus, exaggerated reflexes, muscle spasms, and involuntary leg crossing [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These symptoms severely disrupt daily activities, quality of life, and rehabilitation efforts. Without early and effective management, spasticity progresses to complications such as muscle shortening, joint contractures, and painful pressure sores [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The unpredictable onset and variable severity of spasticity, ranging from mild stiffness to severe, uncontrollable spasms, pose significant challenges for clinicians, emphasizing the urgent need for reliable predictive biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Advances in our understanding of spasticity pathophysiology have highlighted promising targets for biomarker discovery [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Secondary injury processes in SCI trigger molecular cascades, including excessive glutamate release, intracellular calcium overload, and calpain activation [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

This proteolysis disrupts the normal inactivation of Nav1.6 channels, leading to an upregulation of persistent sodium currents (I<sub>NaP</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The pathological I<sub>NaP</sub> drives motoneuron hyperexcitability and sustained depolarizations (plateau potentials), directly contributing to spasticity in both animals [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The identification of sodium channel fragments as products of calpain-mediated cleavage offers a novel biomarker opportunity, linking the molecular pathology of SCI to clinical outcomes. These fragments hold potential not only for assessing SCI severity but also for predicting the onset and magnitude of spasticity [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Notably, similar sodium channel cleavage mechanisms have been observed in traumatic brain injury (TBI), suggesting broader applicability of these biomarkers across central nervous system (CNS) injuries [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The focus on SCI and TBI in this study is thus driven by their shared traumatic etiology and the established role of calpain-mediated sodium channel cleavage in their pathophysiology. SCI, with its high prevalence of spasticity (up to 75% of patients), and TBI, a leading cause of CNS trauma, both exhibit this molecular signature in preclinical models [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], distinguishing them from non-traumatic CNS conditions such as stroke or neurodegenerative diseases, where this mechanism is not documented. By targeting these traumatic injuries, we aim to leverage this specific biomarker to address the unmet diagnostic and prognostic needs in acute CNS trauma management.</p><p>The present <italic toggle="yes">SpasT-SCI-T</italic> clinical trial protocol aims to evaluate calpain-mediated sodium channel fragments as diagnostic biomarkers for SCI and TBI and as prognostic markers for spasticity. By bridging molecular mechanisms and clinical outcomes, this study seeks to advance the management of CNS injuries and spasticity, paving the way for more accurate diagnoses, enhanced prognostic precision, and personalized therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study aims</title><p>The primary objective of the SpasT-SCI-T study is to detect and quantify sodium channel fragments in blood samples from patients with SCI or TBI.

These fragments are quantified using a semi-automated Western blot technique employing the commercial Pan-Nav antibody, which is validated for its high sensitivity in detecting &#x003b1;-subunit cleavage products generated by calpain-mediated proteolysis. Sodium channel fragment levels are compared across SCI, TBI and healthy participants to identify injury-specific biomarker signatures. These data aim to provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SCI and TBI.</p><p>The <bold>secondary outcomes</bold> include:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1</label><p><bold>Temporal Dynamics of Sodium Channel Fragments:</bold> The temporal kinetics of sodium channel fragments are analyzed to characterize their dynamic expression and persistence during the acute and chronic phases of injury. Longitudinal changes in fragment levels are assessed from the baseline (acute phase) through follow-up visits at 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6). These data are related with key clinical and functional outcomes to evaluate the role of sodium channel fragments as potential prognostic biomarkers. For SCI patients, changes in neurological function are monitored using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, which provides detailed assessments of sensory and motor function recovery. For TBI patients, functional recovery is evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and the more granular Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), which capture subtle variations in recovery trajectories. For both groups, quality of life is assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), a comprehensive tool that evaluates health-related quality of life across physical, mental, and social dimensions. These correlations aim to establish the predictive value of sodium channel fragment levels for neurological recovery, functional outcomes, and overall quality of life, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying injury progression and recovery.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2</label><p><bold>Spasticity and Biomarker Levels in SCI Patients:</bold> The relationship between sodium channel fragment levels and spasticity is specifically investigated in SCI patients. Spasticity is assessed during follow-up visits at M3 and M6 using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), a widely used tool for grading muscle tone. The relationship between MAS scores and fragment levels is evaluated using correlation analyses. This correlation is expected to provide evidence of the prognostic utility of sodium channel fragments in predicting the onset and severity of spasticity. These analyses aim to establish the prognostic utility of sodium channel fragments in predicting the onset, progression, and severity of spasticity, providing a molecular link between injury mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Such insights may inform personalized therapeutic strategies for managing spasticity in SCI patients.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3</label><p><bold>Injury Severity and Biomarker Associations:</bold> The study investigates the association between sodium channel fragment levels and injury severity in both SCI and TBI patients. For SCI patients, neurological severity is assessed using the ASIA Impairment Scale, which evaluates the level and completeness of spinal cord injury through sensory and motor function tests. For TBI patients, the severity of brain injury is determined using the GCS, which provides a standardized assessment of consciousness based on eye, verbal, and motor responses. By correlating sodium channel fragment levels with these established severity metrics, the study aims to elucidate the relationship between molecular biomarkers and clinical injury severity, enhancing the understanding of the pathophysiology of CNS trauma and informing future diagnostic approaches.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Biomarker levels</title><p>Sodium channel fragment levels are quantified using the Jess system (ProteinSimple, Bio-techne), a capillary-based automated Western blot platform. Plasma samples are resuspended in 0.1X Sample buffer (SimpleWestern, Bio-techne). Protein concentrations are determined using the DC Protein Assay (Biorad) to ensure consistent loading across all samples. Samples are prepared without reducing agents or heat denaturation to preserve protein integrity. Prepared plasma samples (3 &#x000b5;L) are loaded into the Jess assay plate along with controls, standards, and molecular weight ladders. Proteins are loaded into the capillary automatically (12&#x02013;230&#x02009;kDa range), electrophoresed and separated by size. A monoclonal anti-pan Nav antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#S8809, 1:500) targeting the &#x003b1;-subunit of human sodium channels is used for detection. This antibody, raised against the conserved intracellular III-IV loop peptide &#x02018;CTEEQKKYYNAMKKLGSKK,&#x02019; was validated for specificity by immunoblotting in HEK293 cells transfected with Nav channels, showing selective detection of the native channel (~250&#x02009;kDa) and its cleavage fragments, with no signal in untransfected controls [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The conserved sequence minimizes cross-reactivity. Chemiluminescence is used for signal detection. Quantitative data are captured by automated software, and protein band intensities are normalized to either a housekeeping protein or total protein for variability control. The native sodium channel (~250&#x02009;kDa) and its lower molecular weight fragments are identified and quantified based on band intensity, facilitating the comparison of fragment expression across groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Spasticity evaluations</title><p>Spasticity is assessed at M3 and M6 follow-up visits using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), which grades muscle tone on a scale from 0 (no increase in muscle tone) to 4 (rigid muscle tone) [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This score measures the resistance perceived by the rater when passively moving a joint through its full range of movement. All evaluations are performed by a single, trained physiotherapist to minimize inter-observer variability. Associated phenomena, such as clonus and spasms, are also recorded to provide a comprehensive spasticity profile. Factors influencing variability (e.g., patient positioning, medication, and pain) are meticulously documented.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Neurological Evaluations (GCS, ASIA)</title><p><bold>The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)</bold> is a widely used, standardized tool for assessing consciousness in patients with TBI.

The Eye-Opening Response is scored from 4 to 1: 4 for spontaneous eye opening, 3 for a response to verbal stimuli, 2 for a response to painful stimuli, and 1 if there is no response. The Verbal Response evaluates the orientation and ability to communicate, scoring 5 for coherent and oriented speech, 4 for confusion, 3 for inappropriate words, 2 for incomprehensible sounds, and 1 for no vocalization. The Motor Response measures movement in response to commands or stimuli, scoring 6 for obeying commands, 5 for localizing pain, 4 for withdrawing from pain, 3 for abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing), 2 for abnormal extension (decerebrate posturing), and 1 for no response. The total GCS score ranges from 3 (deep coma) to 15 (full consciousness), allowing clinicians to classify the severity of brain injury and monitor changes in neurological status over time.</p><p><bold>The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale</bold> is a standardized framework for evaluating and classifying the severity of SCI [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It assesses sensory and motor functions across key dermatomes and myotomes, as well as sacral sparing, to determine the neurological level and completeness of the injury. Sensory evaluation tests light touch and pinprick sensations across 28 dermatomes bilaterally, from C2 to S4/S5. A cotton swab is used for light touch, and a safety pin for pinprick testing, with scores assigned as 2 for normal sensation, 1 for impaired sensation, and 0 for absent sensation. Special attention is given to the S4/S5 dermatome, as sacral sparing is critical for determining whether the injury is complete or incomplete. Motor function is evaluated by testing strength in 10 muscle groups corresponding to specific myotomes, ranging from elbow flexion (C5) to ankle plantar flexion (S1), scored from 5 (normal strength) to 0 (no contraction). Sacral motor function is further assessed by voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter. The ASIA Impairment Scale assigns grades based on the completeness of the injury: Grade A indicates complete injury with no sensory or motor function preserved in sacral segments, Grades B-D reflect varying degrees of incomplete injuries with some preserved sensory or motor function below the injury level, and Grade E signifies normal sensory and motor function. The neurological level of injury is defined as the lowest spinal segment with intact sensory and motor function bilaterally.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Functional Scales (GOS, GOSE, SF-36)</title><p>The <bold>Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)</bold> is a widely recognized tool for evaluating functional recovery following TBI [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It categorizes outcomes into five levels: death, vegetative state, severe disability, moderate disability, and good recovery. The GOS provides a high-level summary of a patient&#x02019;s ability to reintegrate into daily life post-injury. To enhance its sensitivity, the <bold>Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)</bold> subdivides each GOS category into upper and lower levels, offering a more nuanced evaluation of recovery trajectories. This refined scale is particularly beneficial for detecting subtle differences in functional outcomes, making it a valuable tool in clinical trials. Both the GOS and GOSE are exclusively applied to TBI patients in this study to monitor recovery.</p><p>The <bold>Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</bold> is a generic quality-of-life questionnaire used for both SCI and TBI patients. It evaluates health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across eight domains, including physical functioning, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The SF-36 captures the broader impact of injuries and treatments on physical, emotional, and social well-being. Administered during follow-up visits, it complements the GOS and GOSE for TBI patients by offering additional insights into their quality of life. For SCI patients, it serves as a critical tool for assessing long-term functional impairments and evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Pain assessments (VAS, DN4)</title><p>Pain assessments are critical for evaluating quality of life and rehabilitation in SCI and TBI patients. The <bold>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</bold> is a simple yet effective tool for quantifying pain intensity. Patients rate their pain on a 10-centimeter line, with anchors at &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; (0&#x02009;cm) and &#x0201c;worst imaginable pain&#x0201d; (10&#x02009;cm). This approach enables longitudinal tracking of pain severity, offering valuable insights into the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions over time. The <bold>DN4 questionnaire (Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions)</bold> is specifically designed to identify neuropathic pain, which is prevalent among SCI patients [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It comprises 10 items: 7 symptom-related questions (e.g., burning, tingling, electric shocks) and 3 clinical examination items (e.g., hypoesthesia, allodynia). A score of &#x02265;4 indicates the presence of neuropathic pain. Together, the VAS and DN4 provide a comprehensive evaluation of pain intensity and type, enabling targeted therapeutic strategies and effective monitoring of patient progress.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Sphincter functions</title><p>Sphincter function is a crucial outcome in SCI patients, as SCI often compromise bladder and bowel control, significantly affecting quality of life.

distributed as follows: 20 patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), 10 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and 10 healthy controls. The selection of 20 SCI patients is based on the annual admission rates for SCI at the study institution, ensuring a representative sample of the population served. The inclusion of 10 TBI patients is justified to account for potential confounding factors arising from the overlapping but distinct injury mechanisms of SCI and TBI. Furthermore, 10 healthy controls are included to provide a robust baseline for sodium channel fragment levels, facilitating a balanced comparison across the three groups.</p><p>This sample size is sufficient to detect meaningful trends and associations between sodium channel fragments and clinical outcomes, including spasticity, while maintaining feasibility within the scope of a pilot study. The findings will generate preliminary evidence regarding the diagnostic and prognostic utility of sodium channel fragments in neurological injuries and will guide the design of larger-scale clinical trials.</p><p>Given the exploratory nature of this study, no formal interim analyses are planned. As the trial involves minimal-risk procedures, such as blood sampling, no pre-specified stopping rules have been established. In the event of significant deviations from the protocol or unforeseen safety concerns, the trial steering committee will consult the Ethics Committee to determine whether adjustments or study termination are necessary. All such decisions will be transparently documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders, including regulatory authorities, to ensure compliance with ethical standards.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Randomisation, blinding</title><p>The SpasT-SCI-T trial is an observational study employing a case-control and cohort design; therefore, randomization is not applicable. Participants are allocated to groups based on predefined eligibility criteria rather than random assignment. Consequently, sequence generation, allocation concealment, and implementation of randomization do not apply to this trial. To mitigate bias and maintain data integrity, laboratory personnel conducting biochemical analyses remain blinded to group allocation. This blinding ensures that sodium channel fragment quantification is performed without preconceived assumptions about the samples, enhancing the reliability and validity of the results.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to quantify sodium channel fragments in blood samples and compare their levels across the three participant groups: healthy controls (Group 1), SCI patients (Group 2) and TBI patients (Group 3).

In SCI patients, severity will be categorized based on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale grades (A&#x02013;D). Similarly, spasticity onset will be analyzed as a binary outcome (presence vs. absence). For TBI patients, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) will be used to classify injury severity, enabling comparisons of sodium channel fragment levels across defined severity subgroups.</p></list-item></list><p>Additional statistical methods will include multivariable linear regression models to adjust for potential confounders, including age, sex, injury severity (ASIA grades A&#x02013;D for SCI, GCS scores for TBI), and concurrent medications (antispasmodics, analgesics, antiepileptics) as primary factors, as well as additional variables from <xref rid="pone.0319635.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> such as comorbidities (diabetes, organ failure), trauma context (type of accident), and biological parameters (hemoglobin, renal clearance) where statistically significant or clinically relevant, informed by prior literature [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This ensures that observed associations between sodium channel fragment levels and outcomes such as spasticity are robust and not influenced by baseline characteristics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be generated to identify threshold levels of sodium channel fragments that differentiate SCI from TBI or predict spasticity onset. To address missing data, multiple imputation methods will be applied, minimizing bias and preserving the validity of the analyses.</p><p>Continuous variables will be expressed as means with standard deviations for normally distributed data or medians with interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed data. Categorical variables will be summarized as frequencies and percentages. For all primary and secondary analyses, a two-tailed p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

CNS injuries initiate a cascade of molecular events, including calcium overload and calpain activation, leading to the proteolysis of Nav1.6 sodium channels (<xref rid="pone.0319635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). These cleavage products emerge as detectable blood biomarkers, offering a window into injury severity and secondary complications like spasticity. The SpasT-SCI-T trial builds on evidence linking calpain activity to spasticity severity [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], hypothesizing that sodium channel fragments can serve as reliable prognostic markers for functional outcomes in SCI and TBI. This aligns with the growing need for biomarkers to enhance CNS injury management, from understanding disease progression to guiding clinical decisions [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0319635.g003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319635.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Calpain activation following spinal cord injury.</title><p>Traumatic injury to the spinal cord triggers glutamate release into the extracellular space, causing a sustained increase in intracellular calcium concentrations in motoneurons.

The cleavage results in an upregulation of persistent sodium currents (I<sub>NaP</sub>), contributing to motoneuron hyperexcitability and the development of spasticity. Additionally, fragments of cleaved sodium channels accumulate in the sublesional spinal cord and can be detected in the bloodstream. These fragments represent a promising biomarker for assessing SCI severity and predicting spasticity outcomes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0319635.g003" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Comparison with previous biomarkers</title><p>Previous studies have explored calpain-mediated &#x003b1;-II spectrin fragments as indicators of SCI severity [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, their utility is limited by several factors: spectrin is also cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, reducing its specificity to calpain activity [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; its expression is transient, restricting its use to the acute phase [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; and its abundance in red blood cells complicates interpretation in polytrauma cases [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In contrast, sodium channel fragments offer distinct advantages. Exclusively expressed in the nervous system and resistant to caspase-3 cleavage [<xref rid="pone.0319635.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], they provide greater specificity. Moreover, preliminary data suggest they persist beyond the acute phase, enabling long-term monitoring of spasticity and recovery, attributes that address critical gaps in current biomarker options.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>The potential of sodium channel fragments as biomarkers could transform SCI and TBI management.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">8 Apr 2025</named-content>
</p><p>Dear Editor and Reviewers,</p><p>We sincerely thank you for your valuable feedback and the opportunity to revise our manuscript, "The SpasT-SCI-T trial protocol: Investigating calpain-mediated sodium channel fragments as biomarkers for central nervous system traumatic injuries and spasticity prediction." We appreciate the insightful comments, which have helped us improve the clarity and quality of our submission. Below, we address each comment point-by-point and detail the changes made to ensure compliance with PLOS ONE&#x02019;s requirements and enhance the manuscript. All changes in the revised manuscript are highlighted in red for your convenience.</p><p>Journal Requirements:</p><p>RJ.1 Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p><p>We have ensured compliance with PLOS ONE&#x02019;s style requirements. For file naming, all figures are cited sequentially in the text (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3) and will be submitted as separate files named accordingly (Fig1.tif&#x02026;) in an accepted format. Supporting information items are cited as S1 to S7 with specific categories (&#x02018;S1 Checklist,&#x02019; &#x02018;S3 Consent Form&#x02019;) and will be uploaded with matching file names (&#x02018;S1_Checklist.pdf,&#x02019; &#x02018;S3_Consent_Form.pdf,&#x02019; &#x02018;S4_Trial_Protocol.pdf&#x02019;), using underscores as required. We have also corrected an inconsistent citation in the &#x02018;Participants&#x02019; section, changing &#x02018;S3 Supplemental Material&#x02019; to &#x02018;S3 Consent Form&#x02019; to align with the file name and caption in the &#x02018;Supporting Information&#x02019; section. These adjustments ensure full compliance with PLOS ONE&#x02019;s style and file naming requirements.</p><p>RJ.2 Please include your full ethics statement in the &#x02018;Methods&#x02019; section of your manuscript file. In your statement, please include the full name of the IRB or ethics committee who approved or waived your study, as well as whether or not you obtained informed written or verbal consent. If consent was waived for your study, please include this information in your statement as well.</p><p>We have added a full ethics statement to the &#x0201c;Methods and Analysis&#x0201d; section under a new subsection titled &#x0201c;Ethics Approval and Consent.&#x0201d; This statement includes the full name of the ethics committee that approved the study, the Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Est III, along with the approval details (CPP number 2024-A00265-42, dated October 7, 2024). It also clarifies that written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legally authorized representatives, with specific procedures for emergency consent in cases of unconscious patients, as detailed in the &#x0201c;Participants&#x0201d; subsection and supported by the ethics approval letter (S6 Ethics Approval). Consent was not waived for this study. These revisions (pages 8-9; lines 190-202) ensure compliance with PLOS ONE&#x02019;s requirements for a comprehensive ethics statement.</p><p>RJ.3 Please provide a complete Data Availability Statement in the submission form, ensuring you include all necessary access information or a reason for why you are unable to make your data freely accessible. If your research concerns only data provided within your submission, please write "All data are in the manuscript and/or supporting information files" as your Data Availability Statement.</p><p>We have updated the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript. Due to legal and ethical restrictions, the data, which include potentially identifying and sensitive participant information, cannot be made publicly available. They are accessible upon request from the sponsor, Assistance Publique des H&#x000f4;pitaux de Marseille (Direction de la Recherche en Sant&#x000e9;, 80 rue Brochier, Marseille, France, aap.drs@ap-hm.fr).</p><p>RJ.4 Please include a caption for figure 2.</p><p>We would like to clarify that a caption for Figure 2 is already included in the manuscript. It is inserted immediately following the paragraph where Figure 2 is first cited in the "Study Design" section of the "Methods and Analysis" part. If the referee has specific suggestions for additional details or modifications to the caption, we would be happy to incorporate them. Please let us know if further adjustments are required.</p><p>RJ.5 Please remove all personal information, ensure that the data shared are in accordance with participant consent, and re-upload a fully anonymized data set.</p><p>The manuscript under review is a clinical trial protocol for the SpasT-SCI-T study, which outlines the study design, methodology, and planned data collection without including any raw participant data or results. As such, it does not contain explicit personal information such as participant names, birth dates, or medical record numbers. All references to participants are generic and aggregated ("20 patients with spinal cord injury" or "10 healthy volunteers"), ensuring no identifiable data is presented. Regarding participant privacy and data anonymization, the protocol includes robust safeguards, as detailed in the "Data Management and Statistical Analysis" and "Legal and Ethical Aspects" sections.</p><p>We note that no data set is included with this protocol submission, as it describes a prospective study not yet conducted. To ensure full compliance with PLOS ONE policies, we reviewed all supplementary files listed in the CPP Est III opinion submitted to the journal. These files are templates or administrative documents and contain no participant-specific data.</p><p>RJ.6 Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article&#x02019;s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p><p>We carefully reviewed the entire reference list to ensure that all citations are accurate, complete, and up to date. We confirm that none of the cited articles have been retracted.</p><p>Additional Editor Comments:</p><p>RE.1 The manuscript mentions that sodium channel fragments will be measured using a semi-automated Western blot, but does not describe antibody specificity or validation procedures. Provide details on antibody specificity, potential cross-reactivity, and assay validation steps to ensure reliability.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need for clarity on antibody specificity and assay validation. In response, we have updated the &#x02018;Biomarker Levels&#x02019; subsection in the &#x02018;Methods and Analysis&#x02019; section to include detailed information. We use a monoclonal anti-pan Nav antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#S8809, 1:500) targeting the &#x003b1;-subunit of human sodium channels, specifically the conserved intracellular III-IV loop peptide &#x0201c;CTEEQKKYYNAMKKLGSKK.&#x0201d; Its specificity was validated by immunoblotting in HEK293 cells transfected with Nav channels, showing selective detection of the native channel (~250 kDa) and its cleavage fragments, with no signal in untransfected controls [21]. The conserved sequence across species reduces potential cross-reactivity. For assay validation, the semi-automated Western blot (Jess system, ProteinSimple) was optimized for sensitivity and reproducibility, with consistent detection of fragments across triplicate runs (coefficient of variation &#x0003c;10%) and normalization to total protein using the Jess Total Protein Detection Module to account for loading variability. These details enhance the reliability of our biomarker quantification and have been incorporated into the revised manuscript. These details are added on page 20, lines 470-476, within the &#x02018;Biomarker Levels&#x02019; subsection.</p><p>RE.2 While emergency consent is addressed, the procedure for withdrawal of patients who regain capacity is not clearly outlined. Clarify how patients who regain capacity are re-consented and whether they can retrospectively withdraw data.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this important observation. To address this, we have revised the &#x0201c;Participants&#x0201d; subsection in the &#x0201c;Methods and Analysis&#x0201d; section to clarify the re-consent process and withdrawal options for patients who regain capacity after emergency inclusion. When patients regain decision-making capacity, they are promptly approached by the investigator or a trained clinical team member with a detailed information sheet and verbal explanation of the study, including its objectives, procedures, risks, benefits, and their prior inclusion under emergency consent. They are then offered the opportunity to provide written continuation consent to remain in the study. If they decline, they may withdraw entirely, and we have now specified that they can request retrospective withdrawal of their data collected prior to regaining capacity, in compliance with French Public Health Code (Article L1122-1-1) and GDPR. Such data will be destroyed unless already anonymized and aggregated, ensuring ethical standards are upheld. These clarifications enhance transparency and participant autonomy in the protocol. These clarifications are added on page 13-14, lines 301-311and 323-325, within the &#x02018;Participants&#x02019; subsection.</p><p>RE.3 The study does not adequately account for confounding variables (e.g., age, sex, injury severity, concurrent medications).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this critical point about confounding variables. To address this, we have revised the &#x0201c;Statistical Methods&#x0201d; subsection in the &#x0201c;Methods and Analysis&#x0201d; section to clarify how we account for a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including but not limited to those highlighted (age, sex, injury severity, and concurrent medications). Our study collects extensive baseline and follow-up data (Table 3), encompassing age, sex, injury severity (ASIA grades A&#x02013;D for SCI, GCS scores for TBI), and concurrent medications (e.g., antispasmodics, analgesics, antiepileptics), as well as additional variables such as comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, organ failure), trauma context (e.g., type of accident), and biological parameters (e.g., hemoglobin, renal function). In the updated statistical plan, we specify that multivariable linear regression models will adjust for these key confounders&#x02014;specifically age, sex, injury severity, and concurrent medications as primary factors, with additional adjustments for comorbidities and other relevant variables from Table 3 as determined by their statistical significance and clinical relevance (e.g., prior studies [14, 21]). Subgroup analyses by injury severity are also refined to further explore its impact. This approach ensures that confounding effects on sodium channel fragment levels and outcomes like spasticity are rigorously controlled, enhancing the reliability of our findings.

Consider an extended follow-up period (e.g., 12 months) or justify why 6 months is sufficient.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We have revised the &#x02018;Study Design&#x02019; subsection in &#x02018;Methods and Analysis&#x02019; to justify the 6-month follow-up period. Clinical signs of spasticity typically stabilize between 2 and 6 months post-injury, with electrophysiological measures showing minimal change thereafter (Hiersemenzel et al., 2000). Holtz et al. (2017) reported in a cohort of 465 SCI patients that the prevalence of problematic spasticity remained relatively stable, 35% at 1 year, 41% at 2 years, and 31% at 5 years, suggesting that 6 months captures the onset and severity of spasticity effectively. While neurological recovery (ASIA scale improvements) may continue beyond 6 months, our focus on early biomarker kinetics and spasticity prediction aligns with this timeline, as significant recovery plateaus within this period for many patients. Thus, a 6-month follow-up is sufficient for our primary objectives, though we acknowledge that extended follow-up (12 months) could be considered in future studies to assess longer-term outcomes. These clarifications, with references, are added to the manuscript. These clarifications are added on page 8, lines 165-168, within the &#x02018;Study Design&#x02019; subsection.</p><p>1.

However, despite being well done and using excellent methodology, the justification for the study needs to be better targeted. I only understood better that the focus was on traumatic injuries to the nervous system at the conclusion of the study. I suggest that the authors consider improving this in the introduction of the article, improving the justification for why only individuals with TBI and SCI were included.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this important remark. We recognize your point that the rationale for specifically targeting individuals with TBI and SCI could be more explicitly targeted in the introduction. While we cited preclinical studies (Brocard et al., 2016; Von Reyn et al., 2009) showing sodium channel cleavage in these traumatic conditions, we may not have sufficiently clarified why these two injury types were selected over other CNS conditions. To address this, we propose revising the introduction to emphasize that SCI and TBI were chosen due to their traumatic etiology, the high prevalence of motor disorders like spasticity in SCI (affecting ~75% of patients), and the shared molecular mechanism of calpain-mediated sodium channel cleavage observed in preclinical models of both conditions. This revision will also briefly note that non-traumatic CNS conditions (stroke or neurodegenerative diseases) were excluded because they lack comparable evidence of this specific mechanism in the context of our biomarker hypothesis. These revisions are made on page 5, lines 99&#x02013;107, within the &#x02018;Introduction&#x02019; section.</p><p>RR1.2 They should also consider including this issue focused on central nervous system trauma in the title of the study.</p><p>The current title, "The SpasT-SCI-T trial protocol: Investigating calpain-mediated sodium channel fragments as biomarkers for CNS injuries and spasticity prediction", uses "CNS injuries" to encompass traumatic SCI and TBI, as clarified in the introduction. To make this focus explicit, we propose revising it to: "The SpasT-SCI-T trial protocol: Investigating calpain-mediated sodium channel fragments as biomarkers for traumatic CNS injuries and spasticity prediction". Adding "traumatic" aligns with your recommendation and sharpens the scope.</p><p>RR1.3 In addition, they should improve the discussion and organization of ideas, including in the discussion of</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0319635.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0319635.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0319635.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319635.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mofatteh</surname><given-names>Mohammad</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Mohammad Mofatteh</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Mohammad Mofatteh</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0319635" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
