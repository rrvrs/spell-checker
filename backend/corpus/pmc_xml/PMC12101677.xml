</self-uri><abstract><p>Several T cell immune checkpoint blockade therapies have shown initial successes in multiple cancers. However, significant issues remain, including tumor relapse, severe toxicities, and a lack of efficacy in most patients. SIRP&#x003b1;, commonly known as the &#x0201c;do not eat me signal&#x0201d;, is a monocyte checkpoint cell surface protein. Agents that block the interaction of CD47 with SIRP&#x003b1; have recently shown clinical success in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy to potentiate macrophage phagocytosis of tumors. However, significant toxicities and logistical issues are associated with CD47-targeted agents due to the expression of CD47 on all human cells. In contrast, SIRP&#x003b1; has expression limited to myelomonocytic cells, meaning highly specific SIRP&#x003b1; blocking agents might reduce these toxicities and avoid the target antigen sink. Herein, we generated a high affinity and highly specific SIRP&#x003b1;-targeting monoclonal antibody, F05, that has enhanced SIRP&#x003b1; binding and reduced SIRP&#x003b2; and SIRP&#x003b3; binding capacity when compared to other available SIRP&#x003b1; antibodies. Furthermore, we show F05 reprograms immunosuppressive macrophages toward a phagocytic profile <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. F05 demonstrated efficacy in solid tumor animal models, providing a rationale for further development of the antibody.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

These approved agents all target proteins associated with improving T-cell function, such as CTLA-4, PD1 and PD-L1, Tim 3, and Lag3 [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Only a subset of patients respond well to these therapies [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This lack of uniform success has also prompted exploration of other immune checkpoints affecting tumor-associated immune cells that are not T cells.</p><p>The CD47-SIRP&#x003b1; axis has recently emerged as a key pathway for development of a new class of immune checkpoint cancer-targeting agents. CD47 is ubiquitously expressed, but many tumor cells overexpress this protein as a protection mechanism. In contrast, SIRP&#x003b1; has expression limited to myelomoncytic cells, most prominently on macrophages. This axis is known as the &#x0201c;do not eat me&#x0201d; pathway because engagement of CD47 with SIRP&#x003b1; results in an inhibitory signal for macrophage phagocytosis through activation of the ITIM domains of SIRP&#x003b1;, resulting in downstream inhibition of actin-myosin engagement and therefore reduced macrophage phagocytosis [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In pre-clinical studies, blockade of the CD47-SIRP&#x003b1; alone results in minimal anti-tumor effects [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, this strategy in combination with a tumor-opsonizing monoclonal antibody provides the macrophages a signal to phagocytose, and has proven to be highly effective. Numerous studies have demonstrated the anti-tumor benefit with this combination strategy <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, including a triple combination therapy approach with CAR T-cells [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the vast majority of these agents bind CD47, which has resulted in severe toxicities in the clinic due to reduction of red blood cells and platelets, which also express high levels of CD47 [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the widespread expression of CD47 requires large and frequent doses of the inhibitors to saturate the CD47 antigen sink.</p><p>The clinical limitations of CD47-targeting agents has prompted a recent shift towards development of SIRP&#x003b1; targeting agents with a goal of reducing systemic toxicities and the antigenic sink. In the pre-clinical setting, several SIRP&#x003b1; targeting monoclonal antibodies have been efficacious in vivo in several cancer types. Additionally, a high-affinity peptide mimetic of the CD47 extracellular domain has been developed, but no in vivo efficacy has been described [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Five SIRP&#x003b1;-targeting antibodies have been described in the preclinical setting: 1H9, KWAR23, BR105, AL008 and BYON4228 [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the clinic, only 1H9 has advanced as GS-0189. While well-tolerated in a phase I trial in combination with Rituximab for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma, GS-0189 was discontinued for further clinical development.</p><p>While targeting SIRP&#x003b1; has shown success in eliminating the thrombocytopenia associated with CD47-targeting agents, the strategy still presents a risk through potential binding of these antibodies to SIRP&#x003b2; and SIRP&#x003b3;, which have high sequence homology to SIRP&#x003b1; in the extracellular domain [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The function of both SIRP&#x003b2; and SIRP&#x003b3; are not well described; however, initial characterization of SIRP&#x003b3; has revealed a role in promoting the chronic activation and migration of T-cells and promoting stem-like characteristics of tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, potential blockade of SIRP&#x003b3; may result in the inhibition of tumor-associated T cells, which would reduce the therapeutic effect of SIRP&#x003b1; targeting antibodies. In view of these deficiencies, there is still a demonstrated need for effective, high affinity <italic toggle="yes">SIRP&#x003b1; specific</italic> agents.</p><p>We sought to develop a SIRP&#x003b1; specific antibody that enhances the antitumor effect of mAb therapy in both hematopoietic cancers and solid tumors. F05 was identified as a high affinity SIRP&#x003b1; antibody clone with binding capacity for both SIRP&#x003b1; V1/V1 and V2/V2. Importantly, F05 does not bind SIRP&#x003b3; on human T cells, which mitigates the risk of potential inhibition of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or other activated T cells systemically. We demonstrated that F05 reprograms human macrophages <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> towards a phagocytic phenotype, which resulted in enhanced anti-tumor effects in two models. Importantly, in three models involving both hematopoietic cancers and solid tumors, we show that F05 in combination with mAb has additive efficacy <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> when compared to mAb treatment alone. We propose that F05 is a promising SIRP&#x003b1; specific agent with the potential for treatment in a variety of cancer types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Ba/F3, a murine interleukin-3 dependent pro-B cell line (DSMZ cat #ACC 300) and its derivative overexpression huSIRP&#x003b1; was maintained in 95% RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% h.i.

Mice dosed with F05 plus Rituximab demonstrated significantly reduced tumor volume, as measured by caliper, compared to mice treated with Rituximab alone at Day 27 post-tumor engraftment (two-tailed t-test; F05, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.032; 1H9, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.052, <xref rid="pone.0321169.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Importantly, the F05 combination treatment also demonstrated significantly increased survival compared to Rituximab monotherapy (Mantel Cox log-rank: F05 vs RITUX, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03; 1H9, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.063, <xref rid="pone.0321169.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). We further evaluated the efficacy of F05 combination treatment in a less aggressive tumor model in which antibodies were dosed starting on Day 11 post tumor engraftment (S6 FigA in <xref rid="pone.0321169.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). A modest, although not significant decline, in tumor burden was observed in both the F05 and 1H9 combination treatment when compared to Rituximab monotherapy (S6 Fig B in <xref rid="pone.0321169.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Minimum survival benefit was observed in this model with combination treatment (S6 Fig C in <xref rid="pone.0321169.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), indicating these antibodies may have enhanced efficacy for treatment of larger, more aggressive tumors.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0321169.g004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0321169.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>F05 demonstrates additive anti-tumor effects in combination with mAb therapy <italic toggle="yes">in vivo.</italic></title><p>A.)

Because of the important role of intra-tumoral T cells in eliminating tumor cells, and the potential for reduction of T-cell function by engagement of SIRP&#x003b3;, the lack of binding of F05 to human T cells provides a distinct advantage over other available agents.</p><p>We selected F05 for further characterization in a macrophage phagocytosis assay using human-derived M2 macrophages co-cultured with either Raji lymphoma cells or SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. In combination with either Rituximab or Trastuzumab, we show that F05 has additive anti-tumor effects with mAb therapy when compared to mAb therapy or F05 alone. Indeed, F05 shows little anti-tumor effect alone, as widely demonstrated across all CD47-SIRP&#x003b1; targeting agents. Because both Rituximab and Trastuzumab are clinically approved agents, we suggest that these findings may provide a superior rationale for translation of F05 into the clinic with these agents compared to other combination therapies due to its minimal binding to other SIRP proteins.</p><p>To further demonstrate the potential clinical application of F05 in combination therapy, in three models, F05 has enhanced efficacy when compared to mAb treatment alone. Because F05 does not bind mouse-derived SIRP&#x003b1;, we generated tumors in vivo with a combination of human M2 macrophages mixed with either Raji or SKOV3 human tumor cells. In a large tumor burden model using Raji subcutaneous engraftment, F05 significantly reduced tumor burden and enhanced mouse survival, albeit very briefly compared to the Rituximab monotherapy. In a mouse model bearing smaller tumors, F05 reduced tumor burden and enhanced mouse survival, but non-significantly. While these models do not represent a more disseminated lymphoma, the solid tumor models are arguably harder to treat and strongly indicate the utility of F05 as an agent for treatment of lymphoma. Furthermore, we tested the efficacy of F05 for treatment of SKOV3 ovarian tumors co-engrafted with human M2 macrophages. While non-significant, due to presence of one outlier mouse failure, F05 again showed additive effects with mAb therapy compared with mAb therapy alone. Importantly, this is the first time a SIRP&#x003b1; specific antibody has shown enhanced efficacy with mAb therapy in the context of true solid tumor model.</p><p>While several SIRP&#x003b1;-targeting mAb&#x02019;s have been described in the pre-clinical setting, F05 has distinct advantages compared to each of them. Two of these agents, KWAR23 and 1H9, do not demonstrate specificity for SIRP&#x003b1;, whereas BR105, AL008 and BYON4228 were shown to specifically bind SIRP&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, BR105 was only shown to have in vivo efficacy in lymphoma models [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, AL008 did not demonstrate significant in vivo efficacy alone in humanized mouse models [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. BYON4228 demonstrated anti-tumor effects <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, but only in the context of a Raji lymphoma model in combination with Rituximab [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. F05 specificity towards SIRP&#x003b1; provides a distinct advantage over 1H9 and KWAR23, the former of which has already been discontinued in the clinic. While Andrejeva <italic toggle="yes">et</italic> al show their antibodies, do not inhibit T cell proliferation, they did not present comparison in vivo efficacy data [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, BR105 and BYON4228 antibodies were tested in hematopoietic cancer Raji lymphoma, while F05 has therapeutic effects as well in in the context of a solid tumor. BI 765063 and BI770371 have advanced to phase I trials, but BI 765063 importantly only binds SIRP&#x003b1; variant V1, limiting the patent responding pool [<xref rid="pone.0321169.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lastly, AL008 was proven effective in a syngeneic setting and not in a human xenograft model. Therefore, F05 warrants further development for clinical application.</p></sec><sec id="sec022" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0321169.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Additional Figures to support paper.</title><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321169.s001.pptx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321169.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Raw data for paper figures, as needed.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321169.s002.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p>phosphate buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>room temperature</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBMC</term><def><p>peripheral blood mononuclear cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OE</term><def><p>overexpressing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p>wild type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0321169.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Zahavi</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>. <article-title>Monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy</article-title>. <source>Antibodies (Basel)</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>9</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>34</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/antib9030034</pub-id>
