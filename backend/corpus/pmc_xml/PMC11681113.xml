In addition to the anonymization process, other techniques, such as spatial discretization and location concealing or removal, are applied to achieve these dual objectives. The primary research question is whether concealing the observation area is an adequate form of protection or whether human mobility patterns in urban areas are inherently revealing of location. The characteristics of the mobility data, such as the number of activity records in a given spatial unit, can reveal the silhouette of the urban landscape, which can be used to infer the identity of the city in question. The presented locating method was tested on multiple cities using different open datasets and coarser spatial discretization units. While publishing mobility data is essential for research, concealing the observation area is insufficient to prevent the identification of the urban area. Instead of obscuring the observation area, noise should be added to the trajectories to mitigate privacy risks regarding the individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mobile positioning data</kwd><kwd>Urban mobility</kwd><kwd>YJMob100K</kwd><kwd>HuMob2023 challenge</kwd><kwd>Reverse-engineering</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Computer science</kwd><kwd>Scientific data</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In order to ensure the reproducibility of research findings, it is advisable for scholars to publish both data and code alongside their papers. Nevertheless, the publication of mobility data raises issues regarding privacy, as the process of anonymization is complex and challenging. It has been demonstrated on numerous occasions that the implemented anonymization process was inadequate. The users in the Netflix Prize dataset were re-identified using IMDb as a source of background knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The taxi IDs of the NYC taxi data were also re-identified, revealing the drivers&#x02019; identity due to poor anonymization technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In combination with paparazzi photographs from social media, which often capture the unique IDs of the cabs, celebrities can be tracked in the NYC dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Similarly, the ticket IDs in the published data of the Riga public transport were easily de-anonymized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, revealing the ticket type, which could lead to privacy attacks.</p><p id="Par3">Mobile positioning data can be affected as well. As demonstrated by Sharad and Danezis in their analysis of the anonymization of the D4D challenge data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, was found to be inadequate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Even if the anonymization process was performed correctly, and the user is not identifiable by any columns, the visited locations still provide some attack vectors based on the individuals&#x02019; behavior. De Montjoye et al. showed that the vast majority of the individuals could be distinguished from each other by only four spatial data points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Another prevalent technique is spatial discretization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which can limit the accuracy of geographic locations to a certain level.</p><p id="Par4">This paper presents evidence that concealing the observation area of mobility data cannot be an effective solution to privacy concerns, because human activity are tightly connected to the urban areas, and it will reveal the observation area. To achieve this, I primarily use the &#x02018;YJMob100K&#x02019; data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, a metropolitan-scale, longitudinal, anonymized mobility trajectory data set that aims to serve as a benchmark dataset of human mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The data provider is Yahoo Japan Corporation, and the data follows 100,000 individuals across a 90-day period in an undisclosed, highly populated metropolitan area in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In this data set the geographic locations of the individuals are discretized (into 500-meter by 500-meter cells), and the location of the observation area is undisclosed. Furthermore, the precise dates are not provided; instead, the days are numbered relatively (e.g., day 1, day 2, etc., up to day 90) and the time is also discretized into 30-minute intervals.</p><p id="Par5">The data has been discretized both spatially and temporally, and user IDs are sequential numbers. However, the main question is whether the undisclosed observation area provides sufficient protection. Alternatively, the characteristics of human mobility can reveal in which urban area the mobility data was captured. Despite the absence of geographic locations for the spatial grid cells, the activity distribution within the grid can be used to infer the city landscape. Once the urban area was deduced using a map, a template matching method was applied to find the exact grid location on the map, which is a technique in digital image processing for finding the location of a template image in a larger image. The spatial grid used to discretize the mobility data can be reconstructed once the location of the observation area is known.</p><p id="Par6">The presented approach was generalized in two directions. Initially, coarser discretization resolutions were simulated, demonstrating that city characteristics cannot be easily suppressed. Second, the location technique, based on template matching, was presented for four other cities from three additional data sets. Furthermore, in one of these cases, H3 hexagons were used instead of a grid, indicating that the discretization scheme is also irrelevant.</p><p id="Par7">The majority of human activity takes place in urban environments. Therefore, if a sufficient amount of location data is available, it will inherently reveal the city in which the data was collected. By itself, the revealed observation area does not pose a threat to the privacy of individuals. However, it does make it easier to link other data sources to the mobility data for more detailed profiling. Estimation of home (and work) location estimation is a common part of the mobility data processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, such as the income proxying by the real estate prices of the home location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A possible attack vector is to look for people in the mobility data whose appearances are well known, such as celebrities or politicians, and use this information to infer which user is the given person. For example, the President of the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The bottom line is that privacy by obscurity is not viable solution for ensuring true privacy. The privacy-preserving transformation applied to the mobility data should not depend on an obscured dimension of the data. Previous studies have shown that adding noise to the location trajectories can mitigate privacy issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, when synthetic mobility data is not a viable option. In addition, the spatial dimension can be omitted completely from mobility data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par8">The urban area in which the activities were recorded was determined by analyzing the visible silhouette of the urban landscape in the activity heatmap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, Figure&#x000a0;6, and assuming that the low-activity areas are partly water surfaces. The urban area was identified as the Nagoya metropolitan area including Mikawa Bay and Ise Bay. Subsequently, the spatial grid, which was used to discretize the geographic locations of the individuals, was reconstructed. This section presents a mobility analysis, which serves as a validation of the grid reconstruction. The reverse-engineering process is detailed in the Methods section.</p><p id="Par9">The first step in the validation process is to plot the reconstructed grid over the map, with each cell colored according to the number of activity records (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) and unique users (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The number of unique users per cell more accurately reflects the road network, particularly the highest order of highways (motorway, trunk) from the OSM, which were displayed as a validation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). As the grid aligns with the map, it can be concluded that the grid geometry is considered good.</p><p id="Par10">The amenity complexity, as defined by Juh&#x000e1;sz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, can be calculated using the provided the information about the number of different POIs (POI) in each cell, which is provided for the YJMob100K data. The POIs are also anonymized otherwise it would help to locate the grid on the map. Only the cardinality of each anonymized category is provided in the YJMob100K dataset, which is sufficient to calculate the amenity complexity. Complex amenities attract socially diverse people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and can indicate city centers. It is used in this paper as a part of the validation process, with the expectation that the highest values are clustered around the city centers. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d shows the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) in terms of amenities, and the highest ECI values indeed correspond to downtown Nagoya and the center of other cities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The reconstructed grid is plotted over a map, with colors indicating the number of activity records (<bold>a</bold>) and unique users (<bold>b</bold>) on a log-scale, as well as the higher-order elements of the road network were also displayed (<bold>c</bold>) , and the amenity complexity (<bold>d</bold>) of the cells for additional details.

It is common practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> to apply home detection algorithms to mobility data. In this case, the cell with the most activity after 21:00 and before 8:00 is considered the home location. It should be noted that the home detection does not require the reconstructed grid it can be computed from the original data. The thresholds (21:00 and 8:00) are set as a rule of thumb and may require adjustment to align with Japanese societal norms. Furthermore, the home detection algorithm does not differentiate between workdays and weekends as the data does not contain dates. However, holidays could be inferred from the daily activity levels.</p><p id="Par12">Without ground truth, the detected home locations cannot be validated, but their spatial distribution can be compared<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>to the census data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a compares the estimated number of inhabitants for the cities within the observation area with the 2020 census data. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.8879. It should be noted that cities with less than 30% of their area within the observation area have been excluded from the comparison. Interestingly, Kawagoe is still an outlier (denoted in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and appears to be underrepresented in the mobility data. Upon removing Kawagoe from the comparison, the city-level Pearson correlation coefficient increases to 0.9717. The results show that the data follows approximately 1% of the population. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b shows the correlation at the ward level in Nagoya (correlation coefficient is 0.8744).</p><p id="Par13">The spatial distribution of the detected population correlates with the census data, thereby confirming the validity of the constructed grid geometry. In contrast, the correlations are notably worse in the case of the unstretched grid (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f), where Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.7536 for the municipality level and 0.4676 for the ward level.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The correlation between the population based on census data and the estimated number of inhabitants.

To what extent is the presented method robust to increases in the resolution of the discretization? The reconstructed grid was merged into grids of 1 km by 1 km, 2 km by 2 km, and 4 km by 4 km grids by summing the activity records in 4, 16, and 64 cells, respectively. An increase in the cell size results in a reduction in the accuracy of user location, thereby increasing privacy. The first row of the Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the upscaled grids as heatmaps using the same color scheme as in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d. Although the rescaled grids notably compress the information and the figures lose details, the urban landscape remains more or less recognizable. The expectation is that the presented approach, utilizing template matching, will be able of accurately identifying the urban area.</p><p id="Par15">The template was generated with the same threshold (75) as for the original grid (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). Second row of the Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the location results. In the first two cases (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), the locating was accurate. However, it failed for the 4 km by 4 km grid (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). The threshold proved too low concerning the compressed image as the shape of Mikawa and Ise bays was lost, so the threshold was increased to 375. Upon increasing the threshold, the template matching algorithm was able to successfully locate the urban area (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). This result proves that the characteristics of human mobility can reveal the urban landscape even when the mobility locations are discretized into 4 km by 4 km cells.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Locating the upscaled grids.

The openly available Weeplaces data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>was used, presented in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which was collected from LBSN including Facebook Places, Foursquare, and Gowalla. Two cities were selected from the Weeplaces database for further analysis: Toronto and London. The activity locations were discretized into a 500 m by 500 m grid over a 100 km by 100 km by area, which also covers other settlements from the area similarly as in the YJMob100K data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Note that an area of this size covers other settlements outside Toronto from the shore of Lake Ontario. The Weeplaces data set contains a significantly lower number of activity records per city than the YJMob100K data set. In the case of Toronto, there are 110,829 activity records from 19,356 unique users in the selected area, whereas the YJMob100K data set contains 111,535,17 activity records from 100,000 users.</p><p id="Par17">The Weeplaces data set is notable sparser, with significantly less activity concentrated outside the urban areas (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), in contrast to the YJMob100K data set, where unpopulated areas still have some activity, even the ferry lines can be recognized. The sparseness of the available data for Toronto makes it more difficult to compare the activity heatmap to the land. Furthermore, cities without distinctive coastal regions, such as London (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), may not work. Alternatively, land usage data was extracted from OSM, namely regions designated as residential, retail, or industrial (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). This approach aligns with the functional classification of the urban areas with respect to land cover data presented in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

However, a recently published data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, did not disclose the geographic location of the mobility traces. This study examines how effective this step is in terms of user privacy. The main finding is that mobile positioning datasets describe the urban landscapes where the mobility took place, so the geographic location can be identified even if it is not disclosed. In addition to the &#x02018;YJMob100K&#x02019; data set, this was demonstrated in four other cities from three other openly available data sets. Furthermore, this effect has some resilience to upscaling, so that the urban area can be identified even with lower resolution grids.</p><p id="Par22">It is important to emphasize that the goal of this work is not to demonstrate template matching on mobility data but to point out that human activity has a peculiar spatial distribution that makes the urban landscape recognizable even after discretization. With the uncovered metropolitan area, it is now possible to cluster the users based on home location (on a city, a ward, or even a neighborhood level), which information can be associated with real estate prices to profile mobility based on estimated income (e.g., as<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> uses data from the Japanese statistical office). The revealed geographic location widen the possible applications of the YJMob100K data but at the same time it might increase privacy risks by making it easier to link additional data sources. Furthermore, may provide possibility to look for people in the mobility data whose appearances are well known, and use this information to infer which user could be the given person.</p><p id="Par23">In cryptography, it is widely accepted that there is no security by obscurity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Based on this principle, privacy through obscurity could not provide privacy. However, in this case, the obscured observation area was meant to provide another layer of protection in addition to the anonymization, and the spatial and temporal discretization. Zhang and Bolot argue that publishing location data is likely to lead to privacy risks, and the data must be coarse in either the time domain or the space domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Even partial location data can be used to infer the location. In<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, the altitude information from fitness tracker applications was used to infer the location of users.</p><p id="Par24">This discourse leads to a trade-off between privacy preservation and researchers&#x02019; interest in using more granular mobile positioning data to build better models. In addition to adding noise to the location data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, a possible solution for protecting user privacy when publishing mobility data is to exclude location information completely. For example, a mobility data set was published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, covering Changchun Municipality, Northeast China, revealing only distances between locations. In Section S1 of the supplementary information, it was shown that the urban landscape remains recognizable even if each location coordinate is transformed by adding random noise. Adding noise to (a part of) the locations, or adding fake appearances can mitigate attacks on user identification based on visitation patterns (e.g<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.,).</p><p id="Par25">This work is not without limitations. First, the reconstructed grid cannot be arbitrarily accurate. The accuracy of the grid anchor point is at most 500 meters in both directions (using the original resolution), because the template matching returns the coordinate of a pixel that represents a 500-meter by 500-meter cell. As with the upscaled grids, the larger the grid size, the greater the chance that the anchor point will be misplaced. The users&#x02019; geographic locations are discretized into 500-meter by 500-meter grid cells, so the accuracy is inherently limited, but the inaccuracy of the reconstructed grid placement increases it further. On the other hand, the presented validation process with the population counts at the ward and municipality level shows that the determined location of the grid is acceptable.</p><p id="Par26">Note that the template matching was applied to the area surrounding the selected city with a limited size instead of the whole globe, which could be possible with sufficient computing capacity. Furthermore, the applied template matching solution cannot deal with scaling or rotation (it was not necessary), although there are rotation and scale invariant template matching algorithms (e.g<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.,).</p><p id="Par27">Originally, the visibility of the road network in the heatmap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> gave the idea that the urban landscape can be identified from mobility data, but using the road network with the presented template matching approach did not give satisfactory results. This may be mainly because the roads are much narrower than the grid cells. Also, the activity around the roads is not necessarily distributed proportionally to the priority or the order of a road. For example, a highway is considered higher order than a street in a shopping district, but the latter may contain more user activity. Thus, it is difficult to plot a map based solely on the cartographic features of the roads in a way that would be matched with the activity-weighted and spatially distorted templates. For these reasons, the road network-based template matching could not match the landscape-based approach with the algorithm used. However, this does not mean that only binary templates could work as it was demonstrated in Section S2 of the supplementary information.</p><p id="Par28">The initial hypothesis of this study was that mobility trajectories can identify the urban area where the mobility took place, even if the location is not disclosed. This hypothesis was tested on the &#x02018;YJMob100K&#x02019; data set, and is considered confirmed with the reconstructed grid. The results show that hiding the observation area does not provide significant privacy benefits. It was also shown that coarser grids can reveal the observation area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par29">Two pieces of information was required to deduce which city is in the focus of the data: (i) it was revealed that the metropolitan area is in Japan, and (ii) the urban area must be large as the observation area is 100 km x 100 km.
