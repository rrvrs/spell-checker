It is associated with high mortality rates and long-term adverse outcomes, including progression to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and even death [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As AKI is difficult to predict in real time [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it leads to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis in 25% of AKI patients in the clinic, which results in worsening of AKI disease, poor prognosis, and increased medical costs [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The AKI electronic alert system built the AKI diagnostic algorithm (KDIGO AKI criteria) into the medical system, along with automated collection of key indications and generation of alerts [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The automated alert system, capable of real-time prediction of AKI occurrences, is considered a potential solution to this issue [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there is currently inconsistency regarding the effect of alert models on the prognosis of AKI [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A BMJ RCT showed that there is no correlation between AKI alert and prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but a secondary analysis of this study showed that the rate of AKI alert detection by an attending physician correlated with prognosis; the higher the rate of AKI alert detection by attending physicians, the better the prognosis of patients with AKI [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The global escalating medical costs are a major concern for both individuals and health systems [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. From a health economics perspective, rising medical costs are associated with various factors, including population aging, the increasing burden of chronic diseases, and advances in medical technology, among others [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With the aging of the population, the elderly population is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades, which will place an additional burden on the healthcare system, as the elderly typically require a more comprehensive range of medical care [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Besides, chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cervical and lumbar pain, and high blood pressure, are another significant factor in rising healthcare costs [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, advances in medical technology and treatments, while leading to better health outcomes, also bring higher costs [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective strategies to manage the medical costs.</p><p>As mentioned earlier in the RCT study of BMJ and its secondary analysis, we can find that associating such alert with the attending physician can improve the prognosis of patients. However, whether the AKI electronic alert system can reduce medical costs while improving patient outcomes is a topic with limited research. Therefore, we conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized clinical trial on the AKI electronic alert system to explore whether the AKI electronic alert system can reduce medical costs while further exploring the role of the rate of AKI alert detection by an attending physician in the medical costs.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Objective</title><p>To investigate the association between the AKI electronic alert system and medical costs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design</title><p>This was an exploratory secondary analysis of data from a multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating an AKI electronic alert system.

The majority of the patients were of other races (84.31%), while 15.69% were Black. Most of the patients were admitted for medical reasons (75.69%), and a significant proportion were recorded in urban teaching hospitals (77.91%). Approximately one-third of the patients (31.89%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The median estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR, one of the best indices for evaluating glomerular function in normal or diseased individuals [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) was 55.45&#x02009;mL/min, and the median creatinine level was 1.01&#x02009;mg/dL. The median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA, a scoring system that assesses the degree of organ failure in critically ill patients [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) score was 2.00, and the median Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI, a composite scoring system that evaluates the prognosis of underlying diseases for hospitalized patients [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) was 6.00.

Furthermore, 44.08% of the patients had congestive heart failure. The composite outcome was observed in 21.14% of the patients. A nephrology consult within 14 days was noted for 23.83% of the patients. The duration of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) was less than 2 days for 72.09%, between 2 to 7 days for 23.58%, and more than 7 days for 4.33%. Approximately half of the patients (50.73%) were alert; the median proportion of those detection by an attending physician was 0.35.

id="sec014"><title>The results of multi-factor regression analysis</title><p>In the multi-factor analysis, adjustment variables were screened by the following method: after adding a variable to the model, if the change in effect value was &#x02265;&#x02009;10%, the variable was included in the adjustment; if the change was &#x0003c;&#x02009;10%, it was not included in the adjustment. The results of previous studies were also referenced to determine whether certain variables were included in the model adjustment. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was used to determine whether collinearity existed between variables; if the VIF &#x0003e;&#x02009; 5, collinearity was considered to exist, and it was excluded before being included in the model adjustment. The screened variables were adjusted in two steps: model 1 for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, etc., and model 2 further adjusted for relevant laboratory tests and disease severity scores, etc., on the basis of model 1 to further validate the reliability of the findings. Based on the multivariate regression analysis presented in <xref rid="pone.0314907.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the relationship between alert and direct cost as well as total cost was examined. The reference group for this analysis was the &#x02018;Usual Care&#x02019; group. In terms of direct cost, the alert group showed a decrease compared to the usual care group across all modes. Specifically, in the crude mode, the effect value was -351.28 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of &#x02212;2282.15 to 1579.59 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.072). In Mode 1, after adjusting for age, sex, race, medical admission, ICU, Elixhauser comorbidity score, and hospital, the effect value was &#x02212;251.28 (95% CI: &#x02212;2143.75 to 1641.20, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79). In Mode 2, with additional adjustment for creatinine, BUN, anion gap, k&#x02009;+&#x02009;, Platelet count, Hemoglobin, SOFA score, duration of AKI, and nephrology consult within 14 days, the effect value was -138.36 (95% CI: &#x02212;1938.67 to 1661.94, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88). Similarly, for total cost, the alert group also showed a decrease compared to the usual care group across all modes. In the crude mode, the effect value was &#x02212;709.60 (95% CI: &#x02212;4376.42 to 2957.21, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.70). In Mode 1, the effect value was &#x02212;473.86 (95% CI: &#x02212;4049.52 to 3101.81, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80). In Mode 2, the effect value was &#x02212;281.89 (95% CI: &#x02212;3667.17 to 3103.40, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.87). These results suggest that the alert group had lower direct and total costs compared to the usual care group, although the differences were not statistically significant.

The x-axis in both graphs represented the percentage of alert detection by an attending physician, ranging from 0% to 100%, while the y-axis showed costs in dollars. A specifically depicted direct cost, and B showed total cost. In figure A, we saw that direct cost initially increased sharply as the alert detection by an attending physician, peaking around 18%, then steadily decreased as the rate of alert detection by an attending physician continued to climb. This curve demonstrated a non-linear relationship between the rate of alert detection by an attending physician and direct cost. The red line indicated the median trend, while the blue lines may have represented upper and lower confidence intervals. Figure B reflected a similar pattern to figure A, but on a different scale. Total cost substantially raised at lower alert percentages, reached a maximum around 18%, then progressively declined as alert rate increased.

In low-resource settings, AKI recognition, diagnosis, and treatment initiation are often delayed or inadequate, leading to avoidable increases in mortality, severe complications, and costs [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The AKI electronic alert system automatically collects key indicators and generates alerts based on KDIGO criteria, supporting treating physicians in making the diagnosis of AKI and treating it appropriately [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the hospital setting, randomized trials have shown the efficacy of alerts to reduce drug interactions [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], increase the rate of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and improve the rates of various other preventive measures to influence outcomes positively [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, research on the relationship between AKI electronic alert system and medical costs is limited.</p><p>The medical costs of AKI patients are affected by various factors, including whether or not they are on dialysis, the progression of their disease, and the length of their hospitalization [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In particular, medical costs are significantly higher for AKI patients who require dialysis [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, AKI patients are often hospitalized for longer periods and require more supervision and treatment, which also leads to higher medical costs [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>We first explored the relationship between the AKI electronic alert system and medical costs and found that the alert group did not significantly reduce medical costs compared to the usual care group, which aligns with the original study&#x02019;s conclusion that the alert system did not improve patient outcomes, including the progression of acute kidney injury, dialysis, or death [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The progression of acute kidney injury and dialysis, both of which can increase medical expenses, may be one of the reasons that the alert group does not reduce medical costs. Additionally, the AKI electronic alert system impacted process measures, including increased intravenous fluid drip orders, urinalysis, and subsequent creatinine measurement [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], all of which can lead to increased medical costs.</p><p>Although the AKI electronic alert system did not significantly reduce medical costs, further analysis of the relationship between the rate of alert detection by an attending physician and medical costs we found that when the rate of alert detection by an attending physician was in the appropriate range (18%&#x02013;59%), the higher the alert detection rate, the lower the medical costs. In the existing healthcare system, only the attending physician provided a systematic approach to AKI treatment [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Early detection of AKI progression might improve the patient&#x02019;s prognosis by changing the dosage of medication properties, avoiding nephrotoxicity, and paying attention to fluid balance, which requires the attending physician to develop a systematic and comprehensive treatment strategy [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Research has found that the higher the rate of AKI alert detection by attending physicians, the better the prognosis (14-day AKI progression, 14-day dialysis, 14-day mortality, and discharge to home) of patients with AKI [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Preventing AKI progression, reducing dialysis, and discharge to home can all reduce medical costs, which may be why the higher the alert detection rate, the lower the medical costs. In addition, why the rate of alert detection by an attending physician was effective in reducing medical costs when it was within a certain range (18%&#x02013;59%), we analyzed the possible reasons: (1) Importance of Moderate Alert Rates: When the alert detection rate by attending physicians is at a moderate level (18%&#x02013;59%), it might indicate that the attending physicians are effectively identifying the AKI cases that truly require attention. In this scenario, physicians can intervene timely and prevent the progression of the condition, thus reducing the need for more expensive treatments and prolonged hospitalization. (2) Alert Fatigue: If the alert detection rate is too high (above 59%), it may lead to &#x0201c;alert fatigue,&#x0201d; where physicians become desensitized to the frequent alerts. This could result in important alerts being overlooked, impairing the ability to take effective interventions, which is not conducive to reducing medical costs. (3) Lack of attention to Alerts: A lower alert detection rate (below 18%) might suggest that attending physicians do not take alerts seriously. This could lead to missed diagnoses and missing the opportunity for timely intervention, and consequently, patients might require more extensive treatment, increasing medical costs.</p><p>In subgroup analyses, we found that when the duration of alert was &#x02265;&#x02009;7 days, the change in total cost was not significant as the rate of alert detection by an attending physician increased. When the elixhauser comorbidity score was &#x02265;&#x02009;10, the change in direct cost was not significant as the rate of alert detection by an attending physician increased. However, the trend of these changes was decreasing, and the reason for the statistical insignificance may be that the sample sizes of these two subgroups were relatively small. The results of our subgroup analyses also revealed an interesting phenomenon: In urban and Suburban teaching hospitals, there was a significant trend toward lower direct and total costs as the rate of alert detection by an attending physician increased. However, in Suburban non-teaching hospitals, this decreasing trend did not occur, and even patients&#x02019; medical costs showed a slight increase with the rise in the rate of alert detection by an attending physician, although this association did not reach a statistically significant level (P&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). Notably, this finding echoes the observation in the original study that mortality rates increased in the alert group in Suburban non-teaching hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To address this discrepancy, we speculate that possible reasons include the limitations of Suburban non-teaching hospitals in terms of healthcare resources, technological capabilities, and AKI management strategies, which may result in the hospital&#x02019;s inability to provide patients with timely and effective treatment options even if the alert rate of attending physicians increases, leading to progression of the condition and affecting the effectiveness of medical cost reductions [<xref rid="pone.0314907.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At the same time, the patient population in Suburban non-teaching hospitals may have its special characteristics, such as the complexity of the condition and limited affordability, all of which may affect medical costs. Therefore, when promoting the AKI electronic Alert System in Suburban non-teaching hospitals in the future, we need to consider its applicability and implementation strategies more carefully.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Application value of the research</title><p>The practical value of this study lies in its insights into early warning models. Firstly, our research found that as the rate of alert detection by an attending physician increases, there is heterogeneity in the changes of medical costs for patients in different hospitals. Therefore, when promoting the AKI electronic Alert System in Suburban non-teaching hospitals in the future, it is necessary to consider its applicability and implementation strategies more carefully. Additionally, the research suggested that mere warnings might not suffice to reduce medical costs. Instead, these alerts should be correlated with the attending physician to have a positive impact. In addition, this study identified a threshold relationship between the rate of alert detection by an attending physician and the medical costs, which may improve the management of the AKI electronic alert system. Medical costs may be reduced by optimizing the AKI electronic alert system to ensure that the attending physician detects alerts at the optimal range.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The alert did not use urine output criteria, which might have meant that the study population was not fully representative of all patients with acute kidney injury. The impact of alerts on the medical behaviors of attending physicians may be a key reason why alert rates reduce medical costs.
