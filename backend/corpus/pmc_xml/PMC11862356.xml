An 89-year-old man with a history of one prior brief psychiatric hospitalization for depression three years ago was admitted after attempting suicide with an overdose of medication. He reports depressive symptoms of several years of evolution. Medical tests came back normal, but he had a urinary catheter due to voiding issues. He was initially on a medication regimen of amitriptyline, clomethiazole, and fluvoxamine. Despite his depressive state, he maintained his cognitive and decision-making abilities. Medication adjustments were made, including discontinuing amitriptyline and switching fluvoxamine to amitriptyline. His depressive symptoms worsened after three days, leading to the addition of trazodone to his treatment. He also developed urinary symptoms and was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and metastatic prostate cancer during urological evaluation. Emotionally, he became more apathetic, anergic, and anhedonic, frequently expressing a desire for euthanasia, even with medication changes. Hyponatremia&#x000a0;led to the discontinuation of duloxetine and&#x000a0;the introduction of venlafaxine. To address anxiety and sleep problems, clomethiazole was replaced with mirtazapine. Upon learning of his cancer diagnosis, his mood deteriorated further, along with increased anxiety and continued mentions of euthanasia. Lorazepam was introduced, and he was informed of his right to request euthanasia after discussing therapeutic options with urology. Following this consultation, the patient became calmer, stopped expressing thoughts of death, and began making short-term plans, including the possibility of receiving palliative care at home upon discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec6316"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
Euthanasia and assisted suicide in severe mental disorders are complex due to ethical and medical challenges. Patients must understand their condition, prognosis, and have decision-making capacity. Assessing their suffering is crucial. Coexisting mental and organic issues complicate the request&#x02019;s origin. In SMD, determining irreversibility is tricky, as these are often chronic, non-terminal conditions. Exhausting treatment options is essential before considering euthanasia, despite patient treatment refusal. Limited research underscores the need for more studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec6317"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
