BDD is a psychiatric disorder characterised by an excessive, persistent, and distressful preoccupation with a perceived defect in appearance. These perceived defects are slight and are unnoticed by others. People with BDD usually have poor insight and are preoccupied with a perceived physical defect which causes them to check on it repeatedly. This leads to an impairment in psychosocial functioning, depression, and an increase in suicide risk.</p></sec><sec id="sec6950"><title>Objectives</title><p>Review how dismorphophobia (BDD) and obsessive compulsive syndrome intersect, the differences they present in symptomatology, prevalence and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec6951"><title>Methods</title><p>Presentation of a patient&#x02019;s case and review of existing literature, in regards to body dysmorphic syndrome and its similarities and differences with respect to obsessive compulsive syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="sec6952"><title>Results</title><p>There are common features between both disorders, which are genetic overlap, physical past traumatic events, sex ratio, trait of perfectionism and body image disturbance.</p><p>Studies have found the prevalence of BDD in patients with OCD in a large patient sample was 8.7% to 15% compared to 3% in non-OCD.</p><p>The risk of comorbidity of OCD-BDD is three times higher in samples with a primary diagnosis of BDD compared to those with a primary diagnosis of OCD with 27.5% and 10.4%, respectively.</p><p>BDD as well as OCD must be managed with pharmacological and psychotherapy treatment. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is the recommended first-line medication for BDD, even if appearance beliefs are delusional in nature.</p><p>
Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) doses and trial durations are similar to those used for OCD; higher doses and a longer treatment trial are recommended than those typically used for depression and most other disorders.&#x000a0;Cognitive-behavioral therapy that is specifically tailored to BDD is the psychosocial treatment of choice. Simply treating BDD as if it were OCD is not recommended.</p></sec><sec id="sec6953"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There are limitations included a restricted number of studies overall, an absence of studies comparing biological parameters, and the frequent inclusion of participants with comorbid body dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The current nosological status of body dysmorphic disorder is somewhat tenuous and requires further investigation, with particular focus on dimensional, biological and aetiological elements.</p></sec><sec id="sec6954"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
