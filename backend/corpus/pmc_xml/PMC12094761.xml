</self-uri><abstract><p>Diabetes Mellitus in older adults reduces the accuracy of foot landing adjustments and increases the risk of falling. This study investigated whether targeted visual feedback enhances the accuracy of the foot landing in older participants with diabetes. Forty-eight volunteers in three groups of young, healthy older and older adults with diabetes participated. During treadmill walking, Nexus Vicon software streamed real-time orientation data of two markers on the first toes into MATLAB scripts through a Visual3D server. The system visualised real-meaningful step length or minimum toe clearance (MTC) in each step on a monitor in front of a treadmill at eye level. Participants responded to four subject-specific step-length (&#x000b1;10% mean baseline step length) or MTC targets (3.5 and 5.5&#x02009;cm higher than the mean baseline MTC). One target was displayed every 10 steps and removed after 10 steps when participants walked without seeing any target, then a new or the same target appeared and stayed on for another 10 steps. Tasks were increasing or decreasing baseline step length or increasing the baseline MTC in response to virtual targets. The accuracy (absolute error) of each step adjustment in each 10-step block with a target was calculated. The mean accuracy of Step 1 and the mean accuracy of Steps 2&#x02013;10 were measured and compared within and between groups using three-way ANOVA tests. Errors significantly differed between conditions (Step 1 and Steps 2&#x02013;10) in all groups. All groups showed reduced errors in Step 1 during Steps 2&#x02013;10. Among groups, the group with diabetes presented the greatest errors in Step 1 and Steps 2&#x02013;10. These findings suggest that meaningful visual feedback about spatial gait parameters (step length, MTC) can improve foot-landing accuracy in older participants with diabetes, highlighting its potential as a training tool to prevent falls in this high-risk population.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data underlying the findings described in our paper are freely available to other researchers in a public repository based in Australia <ext-link xlink:href="https://vuir.vu.edu.au/id/eprint/42294" ext-link-type="uri">https://vuir.vu.edu.au/id/eprint/42294</ext-link>.

It is reported that older adults with type 2 diabetes (diabetes mellitus) demonstrated worse balance, gait, and functionality, contributing to an increased fall risk compared to those without diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy exhibit reduced sensory input, impaired motor control, and slower functional mobility, further elevating their risk of falling [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, even older adults with type 2 diabetes who do not have peripheral neuropathy may still face heightened fall risks due to subtle declines in sensory functions (somatosensory, visual, vestibular), metabolic muscle function, and cognitive performance [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Over 50% of older adults with diabetes report one injurious fall or two non-injurious falls annually [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Each year, an estimated 37.3 million falls worldwide result in injuries requiring medical attention [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalisations in older Australians [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The most frequent injuries that result from falls are fractures followed by open wounds [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Fall-related injuries in people with diabetes are more serious than in those without diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; therefore, fall prevention programs to reduce the incidence of falls in older people with diabetes are of particular importance.</p><p>Visual feedback for training more accurate foot landing adjustments to external hazards is a potential intervention to prevent falls. Targeted biofeedback was used to reduce falls in older adults and patients with chronic stroke and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease by training step length and minimum toe clearance (MTC) adjustments in response to virtual targets during treadmill walking [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, gait adaptability involves adjusting the movement of the landing foot in response to goal-oriented tasks such as stepping on projected targets [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The training program provided feedback by directly comparing foot displacement with the position of targets on the ground [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or by comparing visualised foot displacement and targets on a monitor installed in front of the treadmill (non-immersive visual reality) [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Reduced accuracy of foot landing adjustments in older people has been investigated, and the varying results may reveal several methodological issues [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite the influence of time-constrained conditions, it is unlikely that all participants were free from age-related conditions that might affect their responses to tasks. Hence, it is important to investigate foot-landing adjustments in cohorts whose characteristics are homogenous. Aging without or with diabetes mellitus may impair vision, cognition, and peripheral nerves [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Reduced accuracy of foot landing adjustments may place adults with age-related conditions at increased risk of falling when negotiating unexpected hazards. When tasked to step on a virtual target and increase their step length, older adults increased the number of steps (by one), shortened their step lengths and spent more time in double support, compared with young adults [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This adaptation by older adults results in poorer stepping accuracy and failure to adjust steps to meet stepping targets and avoid obstacles. Similar trends have been reported in research studies with the involvement of older people with stroke and diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although the development of peripheral neuropathy can be responsible for a reduced accuracy in foot landing adjustments when responding to goal-oriented tasks in people with diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], no study has been found to investigate the effectiveness of meaningful visual feedback of spatial gait parameters in this population.</p><p>The use of visual feedback to train more accurate foot landing adjustments in individuals with diabetes mellitus without neuropathy also remained relatively unexplored; however, some investigators reported that diabetes mellitus in older people impairs the accuracy of foot landing adjustments in the sagittal plane [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This study aimed to present the application of a new computer system for training foot landing adjustments with visual feedback. If successful, this application could be used to prevent falls in older people living with diabetes.</p><p>The hypotheses tested in this study were (i) diabetes mellitus would impair spatiotemporal gait parameters, (ii) individuals with diabetes mellitus would be able to use visual feedback (meaningful information) and immediately increase the accuracy of their foot adjustments, and (iii) diabetes mellitus would reduce the accuracy of foot landing adjustments in an older group with diabetes compared with matched healthy older and young groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>A cross-sectional study design was used to investigate the effects of diabetes mellitus on foot displacement adjustments in the sagittal plane in response to visual feedback using a more developed visual feedback system [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Setting</title><p>All procedures were undertaken at the Biomechanics Laboratory at Victoria University, located in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia.

In the baseline condition, participants walked for 10 minutes at their preferred speed without visual feedback (the monitor was off). Baseline walking trials were used to determine spatiotemporal gait parameters. Four targets were defined based on each participant&#x02019;s baseline step length and MTC. Two step-length targets were 10% shorter or longer than baseline mean step length and two MTC targets were 3.5&#x02009;cm or 5.5&#x02009;cm higher than baseline mean MTC (high MTC target and higher MTC target).</p><p>During the practice session, the real-time graphs and points of interest for step length and MTC and virtual targets were illustrated on the monitor (<xref rid="pone.0323569.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

However, the online correction error (Steps 2&#x02013;10) was calculated as the mean errors observed during steps 2&#x02013;10, corresponding to the period when the target stayed visible, and participants used visual feedback to match their step length or MTC height with the presented target on the monitor (<xref rid="pone.0323569.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). These two errors (accuracy) were compared across participants and among groups.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS (Version 25 for Windows, SPSS Science, Chicago, USA) at a significance level of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05. Three-way ANOVA tests compared the gait and foot landing adjustments between groups (Group I, Group II, Group III) and between conditions (Step 1 and Steps 2&#x02013;10).

However, older participants with diabetes were able to use meaningful information about the difference between their actual step length/minimum toe clearance and virtual targets to reduce the differences between groups on their performance (adjusted step length and MTC) and virtual targets during the online correction.</p><p>The findings supported the first two hypotheses, highlighting the role of visual feedback in gait adaptation among participants. In line with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], gait characteristics during walking at preferred speeds, when no challenge was involved (baseline gait analysis), did not reveal significant differences between groups. Bard et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that when a target suddenly appeared on the monitor, the response was reactive and did not require further processing of afferent (sensory) feedback. However, when the target stayed visible for a few steps, it provided some feedback about the foot landing in the previous step. Therefore, a feedforward correction model was used to improve foot landing adjustment in the following steps. Consistent with previous research on foot adjustments in older adults and stroke survivors [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], this study found that receiving detailed and meaningful information about a specific task - e.g., walking with long steps - improved the accuracy of foot landing in older adults with diabetes. Like young and healthy older adults, the older participants with diabetes compared their step lengths and MTC heights with presented targets to reduce errors. Increased errors of foot displacement adjustments in older participants with diabetes might result from the delayed comparison between the expected and the real performance during the online correction (Steps 2&#x02013;10) [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or the instantaneous comparison between the goal and expected sensory feedback during inter-sensory and visuomotor integration [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The corticospinal system plays a key role in gait adaptation when visual feedback is available, as the visual input excites corticospinal neurons in the motor cortex and along the corticospinal pathway [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This influences neural activity measured by electroencephalography while walking with short steps [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Given this involvement, the reduced errors observed during steps 2&#x02013;10 in older participants with diabetes in comparison with their errors in Step 1 may reflect corticospinal contributions to gait adjustments. During steps 2&#x02013;10, the participants made voluntary adjustments to their performance based on feedback. Older participants with diabetes might use a similar forward model [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in other groups of participants to compare their foot landing response with the presented target, which helped them refine the accuracy of the internal forward model in their next step/response. This period involved decision-making and reprogramming of the performed task in the following step [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hence, the forward model enabled the central nervous system to predict the errors of motor commands by modulating feedback loops. In line with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the participants reduced their foot landing errors in response to targets during the online correction (Steps 2&#x02013;10). However, increased standard deviation of foot landing errors during walking with feedback may indicate an increased risk of falling [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The combined effects of two independent variables (diabetes and ageing) may lead to impairment of the central nervous system, which is responsible for processing and integrating information [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This impairment in the integrated brain and spinal neural network activity during walking increases the latencies of evoked potentials and reduces conduction velocity in peripheral nerves [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Consequently, older participants with diabetes may need more time to respond during the online correction phase (Steps 2&#x02013;10) compared with participants without diabetes. Since the presented tasks had similar available times for all participants, errors of foot adjustments for online correction (Steps 2&#x02013;10) increased in older participants with diabetes.</p><p>The finding also supported the third hypothesis - diabetes mellitus would decrease the accuracy of foot landing adjustments in older participants with diabetes. The older participants with diabetes showed reduced accuracy of foot adjustments when targets in Step 1, compared with the healthy older and young participants. The older participants with diabetes showed higher mean errors compared to healthy older and younger groups. Previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] identified that older adults may encounter more challenges in modulating and adapting foot trajectory with a target that shifts forward, backward, or upward. Additionally, the older participants with diabetes in our study displayed increased errors during online correction (Steps 2&#x02013;10) compared with the other groups. Notably, this impairment was not observed in older participants without diabetes, suggesting that these deficits may be attributed to diabetes-related factors rather than age-related changes. Dingwell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] also reported that diabetes-related impairments can increase the physiological noise of the central nervous system. Also, the frontal cortex executes response inhabitation which is important to avoid falling by stopping ongoing commands and modulating them based on sensory information [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Hence, the increased errors in foot-landing adjustments in older participants with diabetes in the current study may be explained by several factors, including frontal and parietal cortex lesions [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], lateralised right hemisphere [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and reduced abilities to control the development of force in response to tasks [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is important to highlight that these underlying mechanisms have been studied in individuals with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and those who have experienced a stroke. Therefore, further investigation is needed to assess the effect of these mechanisms on individuals with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>The higher error during the online correction (Steps 2&#x02013;10) in the older group with diabetes compared with the control groups (younger and healthy older adult participants) may also suggest the presence of learning deficits. In a study on diabetic rats, learning deficits were associated with changes in the hippocampus that were dependent on the severity of diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, it is important to note that the older participants with diabetes were able to decrease their errors during the online correction (Steps 2&#x02013;10) compared to their foot adjustments without feedback (Step 1), indicating that any learning impairment among participants was minimal and negligible. This suggests that more practice and exposure to feedback can improve performance [<xref rid="pone.0323569.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>This study examined the effectiveness of a developed visual feedback system for foot landing adjustments in older adult participants with diabetes in a safe, controlled environment, marking it as the first investigation of its kind. However, the study also encountered some limitations. The system was limited to quantifying the accuracy of foot landing adjustments in the sagittal plane; therefore, foot adjustments were not assessed in the mediolateral direction. In future research, it would be valuable to add MATLAB scripts that enable assessment of the foot landing adjustments in the mediolateral direction. Another limitation of this study was the exclusion of participants with a history of falls and neuropathy. These individuals may be able to increase the accuracy of foot landing adjustments using visual feedback. Future research will also investigate the long-term effects of visual feedback for more accurate foot-landing adjustments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study investigated the application of a novel visual feedback system for training foot-landing adjustments in older participants with diabetes mellitus. The findings demonstrated that the visual feedback system used in this study significantly enhanced the accuracy of sagittal foot landing adjustments of the leading foot in older participants with diabetes. Specifically, older participants with diabetes mellitus adjusted their step length and minimum toe clearance more accurately when provided with real-time visual feedback using the role of feedforward biofeedback during step adaptation in the sagittal plane. The findings also highlighted the potential of visual feedback as a training tool to enhance gait control, which may contribute to fall prevention in this high-risk population.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323569.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Crews</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yalla</surname><given-names>SV</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fleischer</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name>. <article-title>A growing troubling triad: diabetes, aging, and falls</article-title>. <source>J Aging Res</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>2013</volume>:<fpage>342650</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1155/2013/342650</pub-id>

The scope of the study is relevant to the readers of PlosOne. The study is interesting, but the manuscript has flaws which must be addressed before it can be suitable for publication. My main concern is the lack of a specified aim and that the method section is hard to follow. Please find my specific comments below.</p><p>Title</p><p>I suggest adding the design of the study to the title</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Baseline differences between the groups can be deleted, it is obvious that the group with diabetes differed in that aspect from the other groups and from the younger group in the aspects of diabetes and age.</p><p>I acknowledge that there is a word limit in abstract, but I still recommend the authors to include conclusion in the abstract.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Line 55: Ref 5 is used for the statement that around 30-50% of falls cause minor injuries, this is not correct, ref 5 concerns mortality rates after fracture.</p><p>Line 68-70: please add a reference.</p><p>Line 75-77: The sentence &#x0201c;Compared with young adults, older people increase one shorter step and spent more time in double support when responding to an obstacle and a long step length target&#x0201d;.

</p><p>Reviewers' comments:</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>General comments: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this manuscript. The scope of the study is relevant to the readers of PlosOne. The study is interesting, but the manuscript has flaws which must be addressed before it can be suitable for publication. My main concern is the lack of a specified aim and that the method section is hard to follow. Please find my specific comments below.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We have revised the introduction section to clarify the aim of our study. Additionally, the methods section has been updated to enhance the flow and clarity of the methodology.</p><p>Comment: Title: I suggest adding the design of the study to the title</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. The title &#x0201c;Immediate effects of visual feedback on the accuracy of foot landing adjustments in older people with diabetes mellitus&#x0201d; was changed to &#x0201c;Immediate effects of visual feedback on the accuracy of foot landing adjustments in older people with diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study&#x0201d;.</p><p>Comment: Abstract: Baseline differences between the groups can be deleted, it is obvious that the group with diabetes differed in that aspect from the other groups and from the younger group in the aspects of diabetes and age. I acknowledge that there is a word limit in abstract, but I still recommend the authors to include conclusion in the abstract.</p><p>Response: The abstract has been revised following the reviewer&#x02019;s recommendations. We also added a summary of the conclusion at the end of the abstract (lines 49-52 of the revised manuscript). &#x0201c;These findings suggest that meaningful visual feedback about spatial gait parameters (step length, MTC) can improve foot-landing accuracy in older participants with diabetes, highlighting its potential as a training tool to prevent falls in this high-risk population.&#x0201d; Additionally, we revised the abstract to ensure that the word limit is adhered to as closely as possible (298 words).</p><p>Comment: Introduction: Line 55: Ref 5 is used for the statement that around 30-50% of falls cause minor injuries, this is not correct, ref 5 concerns mortality rates after fracture.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your attention. We checked Ref 5 and added, &#x0201c;Each year, an estimated 37.3 million falls worldwide result in injuries requiring medical attention [6]. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalisations in older Australians [7]. The most frequent injuries that result from falls are fractures followed by open wounds [7]&#x0201d; in lines 66-69 of the revised manuscript and added their references at the end of the manuscript:</p><p>&#x0201c;[6] World Health Organization.

This sentence is hard to understand, what do you want to say with the sentence? I had to read the reference to be able to understand.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comments. Please find the revised section in lines 89-91 of the revised manuscript: &#x0201c;When tasked to step on a virtual target and increase their step length, older adults increased the number of steps (by one), shortened their step lengths and spent more time in double support, compared with young adults&#x0201d;</p><p>Also, a few edits are applied in lines 92-95 to improve clarity. Following is the revised text:</p><p>&#x0201c;This adaptation by older adults results in poorer stepping accuracy and failure to adjust steps to meet stepping targets and avoid obstacles&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment: Line 86-87: The sentence &#x0201c;Therefore, this study used a more developed visual feedback system to enhance the accuracy of foot displacement adjustments in the sagittal plane.&#x0201d; This should be moved to method.</p><p>Response: This section was moved to lines 115-117 of the revised manuscript in Materials and Methods.</p><p>Comment: Aim: Aim is lacking, there are only hypotheses. Please add an aim for the study.</p><p>Response: The aim is added in lines 105-107 of the revised manuscript: &#x0201c;This study aimed to present the application of a new computer system for training foot landing adjustments with visual feedback. If successful, this application could be used to prevent falls in older people living with diabetes.&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment: Materials and methods: All information is given in a single paragraph, and all information is mixed. I strongly advice the authors to structure the materials and methods section. Start with stating the design of the study. Gather all information about setting in one paragraph, participants in one paragraph, procedure in one etc.</p><p>Response: We thank you for your great comment. We used the opportunity to reorganise Material and Methods. The revised structure is as follows:</p><p>Study design (line 114-117), Setting (line 125-128), Sample size calculation (line 129-132), Recruitment of participants (133-147), Experimental setup and equipment (line 158-165), Procedure (line 166-181), and Data analysis (line 182-202)</p><p>The content was also edited to improve the clarity of the text. Thank you again for your comment.</p><p>Comment: Results: Line 148-149: information that data collection was performed at the Biomechanis laboratory at Victoria University should be moved to methods (settings).</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. Please find the revision in lines 204-206 of revised manuscript: &#x0201c;Forty-eight volunteers,16 young adults (Group I), 16 healthy older adults (Group II), and 16 older adults with diabetes (Group III) participated.&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment: Line 147-148 and line 157-158: the same information.</p><p>Response: This section has been revised to clarify that the number of participants included in the statistical analysis differs from the number who completed their data collection sessions. In total, five participants were excluded during the further assessment for not meeting the selection criteria or for other valid justifications that can be found in lines 209-213: &#x0201c;Two older adults with diabetes were excluded because they had peripheral neuropathy. The rest of the older participants achieved MNSI scores between zero and 1.5, so neuropathy was not confirmed. During treadmill familiarisation, two healthy older participants and one older participant with diabetes were excluded because they were uncomfortable walking on the treadmill.&#x0201d;</p><p>We also elaborated it in lines 214-218 of the revised manuscript: &#x0201c;Collected data collected from 43 participants, 16 young adults (9 males, 7 females), 14 healthy older adults (8 males, 6 females), and 13 older adults with diabetes (7 males, 6 females) was used for statistical analysis.&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment: Line: 165: Delete &#x0201c;Mean&#x0201d;.</p><p>Response: &#x0201c;Mean&#x0201d; was deleted in the revised manuscript, line 223.</p><p>Comment: Discussion: What seems to be an aim is stated in the first sentence. The first paragraph in the discussion preferably includes main findings.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your invaluable comment. The aim was removed and added to the introduction (lines 102-105 of revised manuscript). The main findings were included in the first paragraph of Discussion, lines 276-281.</p><p>&#x0201c;This study found that older participants with diabetes mellitus had the most inaccurate foot landing in response to displayed virtual targets when compared to older and younger participant groups. However, older participants with diabetes were able to use meaningful information about the difference between their actual step length/minimum toe clearance and virtual targets to reduce the differences between groups on their performance (adjusted step length and MTC) and virtual targets during the online correction.&#x0201d;</p><p>Accordingly, the second paragraph of discussion was edited in lines 286-292 to link two paragraphs &#x0201c;The findings supported the first two hypotheses, highlighting the role of visual feedback in gait adaptation among participants. In line with previous research [24,25], gait characteristics during walking at preferred speeds, when no challenge was involved (baseline gait analysis), might not reveal significant differences between groups.&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment: Line 239-242: It is very difficult to understand what you mean with the sentence starting with &#x0201c;When visual feedback is received&#x0201d;. Please rephrase. Also, this information (presented in a way that is understandable) should be given before the sentence &#x0201c;&#x0201d;Furthermore, reduced errors during steps 2-10 in the group of older adult with diabetes compared with errors in Step 1 can be related to corticospinal involvement&#x0201d;.</p><p>This is revised to clarify the discussion (Lines 306-312 of revised manuscript). The following is the revised version:</p><p>&#x0201c;The corticospinal system plays a key role in gait adaptation when visual feedback is available, as the visual input excites corticospinal neurons in the motor cortex and along the corticospinal pathway [28,29]. This influences neural activity measured by electroencephalography while walking with short steps [30]. Given this involvement, the reduced errors observed during steps 2&#x02013;10 in older participants with diabetes, compared to errors in Step 1, may reflect corticospinal contributions to gait adjustments&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment: Line 291 and line 301: the word &#x0201c;elderly&#x0201d; is considered as ageism and should be avoided. Please check the entire manuscript. Don&#x02019;t call me &#x0201c;old&#x0201d;: Avoiding ageism when writing about aging | National Institute on Aging</p><p>Response: Thank you for your reminder. We changed the word &#x0201c;elderly&#x0201d; twice in our manuscript where it was used mistakenly. However, we decided to leave reference number 14 with the term of &#x0201c;elderly&#x0201d; in its title.</p><p>Comment: Conclusion: Conclusion should relate to the aim. Please check the conclusion after you have added an aim. Also move the sentence about implications for future research to the end of the discussion.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We used your feedback and rewrite the conclusion related to the aim.</p><p>lines 377-386: &#x0201c;This study investigated the application of a novel visual feedback system for training foot-landing adjustments in older participants with diabetes mellitus. The findings demonstrated that the visual feedback system used in this study significantly enhanced the accuracy of sagittal foot landing adjustments of the leading foot in older participants with diabetes. This supports the role of feedforward biofeedback in gait adaptation. Specifically, older participants with diabetes mellitus adjusted their step length and minimum toe clearance more accurately when provided with real-time visual feedback. These results highlight the potential of visual feedback as a training tool to enhance gait control, which may contribute to fall prevention in this high-risk population.&#x0201d;</p><p>Also, we moved the implications to the end of the discussion.</p><p>lines 373-374 of revised manuscript: &#x0201c;Future research will also investigate the long-term effects of visual feedback for more accurate foot-landing adjustments.&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment: Tables and figures: Table 1: add &#x0201c;gait&#x0201d; to velocity.</p><p>Response: &#x0201c;Velocity&#x0201d; was changed to &#x0201c;Gait velocity&#x0201d; in Table 1.</p><p>Comment: References: Ref 5 is not adequate.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We replaced Ref 5. We changed &#x0201c;(Goldacre, et al., 2002)&#x0201d; to a more adequate reference &#x0201c;(Roman de Mettelinge, et al., 2013)&#x0201d; in References (line 405)</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Comment: The manuscript could benefit from providing a legend or description of the labels Z, U, and H in the figures to enhance clarity. The figures may be more informative and self explaining.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We used legend and description of the labels in each figure. For example, in Fig 2, legends Group I, Group II, and Group III were used and described in Fig1&#x02019;s caption. We used a consistent method to illustrate the results in our manuscript.</p><p>Comment: Line 123: The U value of both group 2 and 3 is 31.Is this an error?</p><p>Response: Thank you for your attention. We checked the original data analyses in SPSS to ensure that Line 231 in the Revised Manuscript with Track Changes did not include any errors. Probably because the distribution of data in the two groups differed in spread and shape but the groups&#x02019; medians were very similar, U values became the same. We did not change anything in Line 231.</p><p>Comment: While the research ensured enhanced internal validity, they may limit generalizability to individuals with more severe comorbidities or varying durations of diabetes. I recommend this article may be accepted with minor revision</p><p>Response: Thank you for your insights. We admit that we can&#x02019;t generalise these results and use the results in older people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy who were excluded from participating in our research project. We already mentioned this limitation in lines 370-371. &#x0201c;Another limitation of this study was the exclusion of participants with a history of falls and neuropathy.&#x0201d; Therefore, we did not change anything in these lines.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>Comment: I missed the authors mentioning the prevalence of falls in the study population. Therefore, I would like a paragraph to be created in the discussion or introduction mentioning this outcome. Therefore, I suggest two references below so that the authors can create this paragraph in the study.</p><p>Hewston P, Deshpande N.
