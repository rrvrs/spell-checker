Specifically, juvenile hormone (JH) drives early egg development until a bloodmeal is acquired, and JH titers are positively correlated with active host seeking and blood feeding behaviors. After a bloodmeal, JH levels fall, and female mosquitoes become refractory to host seeking and biting. While JH analogs (JHAs) are commonly used as larvicides for mosquito control, the effects of these compounds on adult mosquitoes are not well understood. If JH levels are directly implicated in blood acquisition, adult exposure to JHAs might cause nonbiting female mosquitoes to take a blood meal. To test this hypothesis, in laboratory experiments we exposed gravid <italic toggle="yes">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes to s&#x02010;hydroprene, a JHA, both through direct topical application and a simulated environmental exposure. We found a significant increase in the likelihood of gravid <italic toggle="yes">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> taking a bloodmeal after exposure to JHAs at levels we hypothesize they may encounter in the field. We also measured the fertility of females that had taken a second bloodmeal while gravid and found a significant negative effect on both the number and hatch rate of eggs. Our results support the expectation that JH levels regulate female blood feeding behaviors. They also suggest that application of JHAs for larval control can unintentionally lead to additional blood feeding events per gonotrophic cycle, with potential increases in the transmission of disease agents.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>We applied s&#x02010;hydroprene, a juvenile hormone analog (JHA), to gravid female mosquitoes that have naturally ceased JH production.

Most female mosquitoes are anautogenous and require blood for the development of viable eggs. Before active host seeking and blood feeding, eggs undergo a period of pre&#x02010;vitellogenic egg development, during which oocytes develop competence to uptake nutrients and yolk proteins derived from a future bloodmeal (Zhu and Noriega&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In anautogenous females, once oocytes have completed pre&#x02010;vitellogenic egg development, eggs cease development until a blood meal is acquired (Raikhel et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). During this state of arrested egg development female mosquitoes actively seek and bite hosts. After acquiring a bloodmeal, females enter a period of unresponsiveness (refractoriness) to hosts while eggs complete development. Host seeking and biting resume once these eggs have been deposited and a new batch of eggs can be produced. This pattern of egg development and associated behaviors are largely conserved across mosquito taxa with the notable exception of autogenous species that do not require blood (O'Meara&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; O'Meara and Evans&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). In addition, under specific environmental stressors such as lack of suitable oviposition sites and dehydration females of some species have been shown to take additional blood meals (Govoetchan et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; O'Meara&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; Hagan et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Johnson and Fonseca&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Cycles of biting and egg production are regulated by juvenile hormone (JH) production; titers of JH correlate with the discreet periods of egg production, host seeking, and unresponsiveness to hosts (Zhu and Noriega&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). JH is produced at relatively constant levels until a blood meal is taken at which point JH production ceases. These two patterns of production align with active host seeking and unresponsiveness to hosts, respectively. Additionally, removal of the <italic toggle="yes">corpora allata</italic>, the neuroendocrine glands responsible for JH production, significantly decreases the likelihood of a mosquito biting, and this can be reversed through the application of JH (Meola and Petralia&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). Further evidence of the importance of JH in blood feeding is the fact that emerging females entrained into diapause, a dormant state that allows them to survive the winter, have low JH levels (compared to non&#x02010;diapausing conspecifics) and forgo blood feeding in favor of increased sugar feeding (Readio et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Meola and Petralia&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). In summation, JH is an important driver of mosquito blood feeding.</p><p>High JH levels also prevent immature adult mosquitoes from pupating and ultimately emerge as, if females, blood&#x02010;seeking adults (Parthasarathy and Palli&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Consequently, juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs), are a standard larvicide. Compounds such as methoprene (Propan&#x02010;2&#x02010;yl (2E,4E)&#x02010;11&#x02010;methoxy&#x02010;3,7,11&#x02010;trimethyldodeca&#x02010;2,4&#x02010;dienoate), and more recently, pyriproxyfen (4&#x02010;Phenoxyphenyl (R/S)&#x02010;2&#x02010;(2&#x02010;pyridyloxy)propyl ether 2&#x02010;[1&#x02010;(4&#x02010;Phenoxyphenoxy)propan&#x02010;2&#x02010;yloxy]pyridine) are added to water to disrupt regular larval development and pupation. While it is common to apply JHAs as slow release brickettes directly in bodies of water, ultra&#x02010;low volume applications of JHAs (sometimes formulated in combination with <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus turingiensis israelensis</italic>) are also used (Maoz et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This potentially creates situations in which adult mosquitoes are exposed to JHAs through either contact with treated bodies of water or broadly treated environments. While most research has focused on the effects of JHAs on larval mosquito development, to the best of our knowledge no studies have examined the effects of JHAs on adult blood feeding behavior.</p><p>Our objective was to examine the effects of exposure to JHAs on female mosquito blood feeding. We chose a stage expected to be unlikely to blood feed: gravid female <italic toggle="yes">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. We tested the effects of direct application of a JHA as well as a simulated environmental exposure on the propensity for a gravid female to take a bloodmeal. In addition, we examined the effects of JHA exposure on egg production and hatchability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="arch70066-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="arch70066-sec-0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Insects</title><p>We purchased 5&#x02013;7 day old adult <italic toggle="yes">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes from Benzon Research Inc.

Upon arrival both male and female mosquitoes were transferred to mesh cages and provided 10% sucrose solution ad libitum. These cages were kept inside incubators maintained at 25&#x000b0;C, a relative humidity of approximately 70%, and a photoperiod of 16&#x02009;L:8D. All experiments were performed during the 8&#x02010;h dark period in which <italic toggle="yes">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> females actively seek hosts (Bhattacharya et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="arch70066-sec-0040"><label>2.2</label><title>Juvenile Hormone Application Experiments</title><p>We obtained 99% HPLC grade S&#x02010;Hydroprene (Sigma&#x02010;Aldrich, St Louis, MO), which we added to a 50/50 mixture of acetone and ethanol to a final concentration of 5&#x02009;ng/&#x000b5;L. This concentration was chosen as it has been shown to cause behavioral shifts in other insects, and was neither the highest nor lowest concentration found in other juvenile hormone related experiments performed in mosquitoes (Spielman&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>). To blood feed, 5&#x02013;7 day old female <italic toggle="yes">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> were given access to an artificial membrane blood feeding system composed of chicken blood in a jacketed reservoir maintained at 35&#x000b0;C by recirculating water. Females were allowed to feed for 1&#x02009;h or until approximately 80% of them were observed to be engorged. Following blood feeding, females were returned to the incubator and given 48&#x02009;h to digest the blood and develop eggs. After eggs were visible, and blood could no longer be seen in the abdomens of the mosquitoes, they were then aspirated into groups of approximately 40 individuals and anesthetized by placing them in a freezer for approximately 5&#x02009;min. After removal from the freezer, we applied 0.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of s&#x02010;hydroprene solution to the abdomen of 30 female mosquitoes kept over ice to maintain anesthesia. Following application, we placed the mosquitoes in separate cages based on their treatment group. As controls we treated an additional group of individuals with 0.5&#x02009;uL of the acetone and ethanol mixture without s&#x02010;hydroprene, and another 40 females were left untreated. We placed all individuals in separate cages corresponding to their treatment group and returned them to the incubators for 24&#x02009;h. Once 24&#x02009;h had passed, we gave females access to chicken blood through the artificial membrane. After 20&#x02009;min the mosquitoes were euthanized in a freezer then examined under a microscope to determine the number of gravid females that had taken a bloodmeal. Females were considered gravid if their abdomens were visibly distended with eggs, and eggs could be observed as reaching the 3rd sternite of the abdomen (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This threshold was used to exclude any individuals that had initially only taken a partial blood meal.

Several studies have examined the role of JH in blood feeding and found this hormone is critical to both egg development and host seeking (Readio et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Meola and Petralia&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Shiao et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Because blood feeding must follow early egg development, it is difficult to separate the effects of pre&#x02010;vitellogenic egg development from the action of JH in initiating blood feeding. It could be hypothesized that once nutrients from a bloodmeal can be used for egg development, another endogenous signal produced by the eggs could initiate the blood feeding behavior of mosquitoes, as studies examining this behavior typically involve younger mosquitoes which have not taken a bloodmeal (Hancock and Foster&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Alto et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). By using gravid females which are typically inhibited from blood feeding, we have further supported that JH signaling is directly involved in the activation of blood avidity.</p><p>We found that treating mosquitoes with increasing concentrations of s&#x02010;hydroprene up to 25&#x02009;ng corresponded with increasing rates of gravid females taking a second bloodmeal. While it is difficult to determine the actual physiological dose of JHA needed to cause abnormal blood feeding behavior (i.e., the amount i.e. absorbed), applications of 25&#x02009;ng led to an average of 51% of mosquitoes taking a second bloodmeal. We also found high mortality in mosquitoes treated with 250&#x02009;ng of JHA, a result that we are currently at a loss to understand but hypothesize may be due to crosstalk between JH and nutritional signaling pathways causing disruption of normal metabolic function (Hansen et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Sharma et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>There was no statistical difference between the percentages of gravid females that blood fed after direct applications of JHA or exposure to JHA treated flowers. This was surprising as the prolonged exposure period associated with the treated flower experiment was expected to result in a greater exposure to JHA. Additionally, JHA from the &#x0201c;flowers&#x0201d; likely leached into the sugar solution in the Erlenmeyer and resulted in the females ingesting JHA while drinking. However, we did not find an effect of route or length of exposure to JHAs to blood feeding behavior.</p><p>After finding that a few gravid females in the untreated group and acetone&#x02010;ethanol control in the first experiment took a second blood meal we suspected contamination with JH across treatments, as hormones are known to act at very small concentrations. Therefore, in a second experiment, we performed all replicates for each treatment separately starting with the controls, and found that zero females in the untreated controls fed a second time when gravid. This corroborates our original hypothesis that environmental contamination of JHAs may have caused some untreated individuals in our control groups to take a second bloodmeal. In contrast, in the second experiment we still found that some individuals in the acetone&#x02010;ethanol treatment group took a second bloodmeal. We hypothesize this may be due to the solvent itself stripping some components of the cuticle away, resulting in increased desiccation. Dehydration has been shown to increase the likelihood of a mosquito taking additional bloodmeals (Hagan et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Holmes et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Even considering the possible cross&#x02010;treatment contamination, in both experiments the treatment with s&#x02010;hydroprene produced a significantly higher proportion of female mosquitoes taking a second bloodmeal while gravid. In addition, in the flower exposure treatments neither group of mosquitoes were exposed to solvents, and there was still a significant increase in the likelihood that gravid females would take a second bloodmeal in the s&#x02010;hydroprene treatment, negating the possibly that dehydration per se, led to gravid females&#x02019; blood feeding.</p><p>It is difficult to argue that the levels of JHA we used are representative of the levels mosquitoes might be exposed in the field without detailed calculations of field application rates, degradation rates, etc. The literature on the subject is unclear and likely varies between mosquito control programs. As mentioned previously, while these compounds are typically applied as briquettes or other solid formulations, increasingly they are being applied as sprays (Suman et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Doud et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, pyriproxyfen is commonly used in auto&#x02010;dissemination approaches (Kancharlapalli et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Kancharlapalli et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Our results reveal potential drawbacks of using these compounds as larvicides and warrants further studies on the degree to which adult mosquitoes may be exposed to JHAs in nature.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that taking a second bloodmeal while gravid significantly decreased the number of eggs laid and their hatch rate. Of note, the numbers of eggs and hatch rates of untreated and JHA exposed mosquitoes that did not take a blood meal are within the averages reported in the literature for <italic toggle="yes">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (Oda et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Mccann et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Other studies have shown the detrimental effects of JHAs on egg development in both adults exposed before blood feeding and eggs exposed to JHA directly (Klowden and Chambers&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Brabant and Dobson&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Suman et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic>, treatment with JHAs around 36&#x02009;h after taking a bloodmeal was found to have the most significant reduction (up to 90%) in reproductive output with the effect diminishing with increasing time post&#x02010;bloodmeal(Patterson&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>). Our results agree with this, as mosquitoes were treated at a minimum of 48&#x02009;h following the initial bloodmeal and we only saw an average reduction of approximately 6% between treated and nontreated gravid mosquitoes. Importantly, we found a much greater decrease in reproductive output from gravid <italic toggle="yes">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> exposed to s&#x02010;hydroprene if they took a second blood meal. The fact that the declines in eggs and hatch rate were limited to those females that took another blood meal, indicates the blood was not used to develop more eggs.</p><p>The acquisition of blood and the following development of eggs are associated with distinct states in behavior and hormonal signaling (Zhu and Noriega&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hansen et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Blood acquired when females would have been inhibited from feeding may interfere with processes involved in egg retention and maintenance. Eggs retained by female <italic toggle="yes">Culex</italic> mosquitoes are a considerable mass of metabolically active tissues in relation to the total body weight of the mosquito. Taking a bloodmeal is also well understood to initiate genome wide transcriptional changes involved in digestion, egg development, and protection from harmful compounds such as heme (Gracasouza et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Bonizzoni et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). To metabolize a new bloodmeal, gravid mosquitoes may need to reallocate resources that would normally be used to maintain already developed eggs resulting in lower hatch rates and egg numbers. Further studies investigating the effects of a second bloodmeal on gene expression might determine which genes are responsible for egg maintenance once developed.</p><p>Juvenile hormone analogs remain a common larvicide for control of mosquito populations. As its name suggests, the majority of what is known about JH and JHAs is related to the immature stages of insects and JH's role in regulating metamorphosis and development and how exposure to these compounds can be used to human benefit (Jindra et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Riddiford&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Parthasarathy and Palli&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However, it is important to be aware that JH is also produced in adult insects and has been shown to regulate a wide variety of processes and behaviors across insect taxa (Hartfelder&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Tibbetts et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Dingle and Winchell&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70066-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). While the role of JH in mosquito development and reproduction is relatively well understood, our results provide additional insight into how JH regulates epidemiologically relevant behavior and offers a useful model system for further study.</p></sec><sec id="arch70066-sec-0150"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
