In Russia, there are no developed or registered vaccines against ASFV genotype II, which is associated with numerous ASFV outbreaks in populations of domestic pigs and wild boars in the country. <bold>Methods:</bold> We introduced deletions of the six MGF360 and MGF505 genes of the ASFV virulent Stavropol_01/08 strain, isolated in Russia in 2008. <bold>Results:</bold> We show here that this deletion did lead to full attenuation of the ASFV virulent Stavropol_01/08 strain. Animals intramuscularly inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> HAD<sub>50</sub> of &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav developed a strong immune response and short period of viremia (at 3&#x02013;7 days post-inoculation). Recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain provides complete protection of pigs against the ASFV parental Stavropol_01/08 strain (10<sup>3</sup> HAD<sub>50</sub>). Therefore, in our experiment, we did not detect the genome of both the virulent and the recombinant strains in the blood and organs post-challenge with the Stavropol_01/08. In contrast, we found only partial protection (40%) of the &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav-immunized pigs against challenge with the ASFV heterologous Rhodesia strain. Additionally, the surviving animals had a prolonged fever, and their condition was depressed for most of the experiment. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Thus, the ASFV recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain is the first live attenuated vaccine (LAV) in Russia that induces complete protection in pigs challenged with the highly virulent, epidemiologically relevant strains genotype II and serotype 8. However, this ASF LAV is not able to provide a high level of protection against other variants of serotype 8.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>African swine fever</kwd><kwd>African swine fever virus</kwd><kwd>MGF360</kwd><kwd>MGF505</kwd><kwd>serogroup</kwd><kwd>serotype</kwd><kwd>genotype</kwd><kwd>live attenuated vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Federal Research Center for Virology and Microbiology</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by the Federal Research Center for Virology and Microbiology for government assignment.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-12-01443"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease impacting domestic pigs, with a mortality rate that can reach up to 100% [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disease&#x02019;s causative agent, the African swine fever virus (ASFV), is a large DNA virus from the <italic toggle="yes">Asfarviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, several classifications of ASFV strains/isolates have been proposed. Thus, virus isolates have been divided into at least 24 genotypes based on the sequence of the B646L gene encoding the p72 protein [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At the same time, analysis of the entire encoded proteome allowed for the identification of seven distinct biotypes [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another classification based on HAI typing and classical vaccination/challenge experiments divided ASFV isolates into at least eight discrete serogroups (serotypes), although there are probably more serogroups [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The results of serotype classification were in good agreement with the results of grouping based on the analysis of the EP402R and EP153R genes (encoding CD2v and C-type lectin proteins) [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It should be noted that the results of p72 genotyping and CD2v/lectin genotyping of ASFV isolates were often inconsistent [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The greatest diversity of ASFV genotypes and serotypes is found in Sub-Saharan Africa, where their transmission is sustained by a sylvatic cycle [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. From 2007 to 2024, most outbreaks outside Africa (in Europe, Asia, America, and Oceania) were associated only with the genotype II ASFV [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 2021, ASFV low-virulent p72 genotype I isolates were detected in the domestic pig population in China [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In 2023, highly virulent recombinant ASFV genotypes I and II were isolated in China and Vietnam [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In the 17 years since ASF was first diagnosed in the Caucasian region of Russia [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], ASFV outbreaks have been reported in various regions of Russia with enormous economic losses and serious effects on wild boar populations [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. No vaccines against ASF are registered in Russia. Currently, two live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) against ASF are licensed and available in Vietnam&#x02014;AVAC ASF live (AVAC VietNam, Vietnam) and NAVET-ASFVac (Navetco, Vietnam). Both of these vaccines are the ASFV recombinant genotype II strains with virulence-associated gene deletions [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, several LAVs against ASF have been developed by researchers in different countries [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, the use of live vaccines is associated with many risks, and various studies on their safety are needed, including in the field.</p><p>Different vaccine strategies for ASF have been evaluated, but the vaccines against ASF with full or partial protection are mainly based on field low-virulent ASFV strains [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], attenuated by consecutively passing in homologous or heterologous cell lines [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B42-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and recombinant ASFV strains with the deletion of the virulence-associated genes [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Currently, editing the ASFV genome by homologous recombination or CRISPR/Cas9 technology for specific deletion of the virulence-associated genes seems to be the most promising method for the generation of ASF LAV vaccines.</p><p>Several LAV candidates obtained in different countries [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as well as the licensed vaccine AVAC ASF live, were based on genetically similar strains of ASFV genotype II with a deletion of the three genes of the multigene family MGF360 and three genes of the multigene family MGF505. It should be noted that some LAV candidates had additional deletions of other genes [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These vaccine strains demonstrated a high level of protection against homologous infection. In addition, previously, we showed that the KK262 (Congo-a) vaccine strain serotype 2 revealed an 8.8 kb deletion in the left variable region of the genome, affecting five genes of the MGF360 and three genes of the MGF505, compared to the virulent homolog K49 [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, it is obvious that the genes of multigene families MGF360/505 are associated with ASFV virulence, and this deletion does not affect the protective properties of deletion mutants.</p><p>In this study, we have successfully deleted three genes of the multigene family MGF360 (MGF360-12L, MGF360-13L, MGF360-14L) and three genes of the multigene family MGF505 (MGF505-2R and a partial deletion of MGF505-1R and MGF505-3R) from the genome of the ASFV virulent Stavropol_01/08 strain (genotype II, serotype 8). The recently developed recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain was created with the potential for use as an LAV against ASF and as a foundation for the production of other recombinant LAVs. Consequently, the assessment of its safety and efficacy against the parental strain became a pivotal objective of this study. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain is fully attenuated, exhibiting no adverse effects during the 30-day observation period and providing complete protection (100%) to immunized animals against the homologous virulent strain. We detected no or minimal viral genome in circulation in the blood and organs both post-immunization and post-challenge, which confirmed the new LAV candidate&#x02019;s safety. In addition, we tested the protective properties of this recombinant strain against another ASFV virulent Rhodesia strain of serotype 8. Interestingly, this strain was assigned to the same serogroup as the Stavropol_01/08 strain based on HAI typing and CD2v/lectin genotyping, although based on the results of p72 genotyping, they were assigned to different genotypes [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We found only partial protection (40%) of the &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav-immunized pigs against challenge with the ASFV Rhodesia strain, and the surviving animals had a prolonged fever.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01443"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>Since the introduction of ASFV into the Russian Federation, the virus has spread widely to the western and eastern regions, causing outbreaks of the disease among both domestic pigs and wild boars [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To date, two LAVs against ASF are licensed in Vietnam and available in some Asian countries, but so far there are no globally approved vaccines. In Russia, there are also no developed or registered vaccines against ASF genotype II, although several vaccine strains against ASF of other genotypes/serotypes have been obtained [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, the development of safe and effective vaccines against circulating and emerging ASFV variants is required.</p><p>The LAVs, predominantly based on recombinant viruses with deletions of virulence-associated genes, are considered the most promising vaccine candidates against ASF. Although many recombinant attenuated strains have been produced recently, not all of them have been characterized in detail. A number of well-characterized strains, including HLJ/18-7GD, ASFV-G-&#x00394;I177L, and ASFV-G-&#x00394;MGF, have demonstrated the capacity to induce complete protection against homologous virulent ASFV challenges under laboratory conditions [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B56-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Furthermore, these strains have been evaluated in field trials. However, the results of using these vaccines in the field are currently not completely clear.</p><p>The genomes of naturally low virulent strains such as NHV68 and OURT88, as well as strains attenuated by adaptation to cultured cell lines (BA71V and KK262), contain large fragmental deletions in the left variable region [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B57-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These large deletions include the genes MGF360-12L, MGF360-13L, MGF360-14L, MGF505-1R, MGF505-2R, and MGF505-3R, although they are not always limited to these genes. As already noted, deletions of these six genes of the MGF360 and MGF505 multigene families have been repeatedly used to create LAVs [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B60-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Importantly, these proteins mediate viral virulence through modulation of the host immune response [<xref rid="B66-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] but do not affect the induction of a protective immune response.</p><p>Due to these facts, we decided to also use the deletion of these genes for the production of LAV against ASFV genotype 2 isolates circulating in Russia. We used the Russian ASFV Stavropol_01/08 strain (genotype II, serotype 8) as a backbone to generate a recombinant virus. Comparative complete genome analysis of the recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav and the parental Stavropol_01/08 strains confirmed the deletion of the multigene family MGF360/505 genes and the simultaneous insertion of the EGFP gene with the E184L gene promoter. In addition, we found few point mutations (insertions and deletions) in the poly-C and poly-G regions. Due to the fact that the mutations in the poly(C) and poly(G) regions are difficult to confirm by both Illumina and Sanger sequencing, we cannot say that these mutations are related to the recombinant strain production and are not sequencing errors.</p><p>To characterize the recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain, we conducted three animal experiments. The first animal experiment has confirmed that the recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain is fully attenuated, without any side effects during the observation period (24&#x02013;28 dpi). Animals developed low levels of viremia in the early stages (3&#x02013;7 dpi). As expected, anti-ASF antibodies were detected in animals starting from 14&#x02013;21 dpi, and the kinetics of antibody formation were comparable with our other immunization/challenge experiments [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B46-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of the new recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain against the parental Stavropol_01/08 strain was assessed in the second experiment. Considering that the strain we obtained was genetically very close (but not identical) to the ASFV-G-&#x00394;MGF [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and HLJ/18-6GD [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] strains, we assumed a high level of protection of &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav-immunized animals from infection with the homologous strain. As expected, 100% of &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav-immunized animals were completely protected from the homologous infection. Interestingly, in our experiment, we did not detect the genome of the ASFV virulent and the ASFV recombinant strains in the blood and organs post-challenge, although the virus was detected by other researchers [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>It was previously shown that viruses within the serotype appear to cross-protect against one another while viruses outside the serotype do not [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; thus, ASF protective immunity may be serotype-specific. However, these results were obtained using only vaccine strains attenuated by adaptation to cultured cell lines for immunization, while recombinant deletion variants were not used. In addition, the FRCVM, where the classification into serotypes (serogroups) was proposed, had not previously conducted work on the study of serotype 8 strain cross-immunity. Therefore, the aim of the third animal experiment was to study the cross-protection of &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav-immunized animals against a challenge with the ASFV heterologous Rhodesia, a serotype 8 strain. Previously, the Rhodesia strain was characterized as virulent (with a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> HAD<sub>50</sub>) and was assigned to serotype 8 based on HAI typing and CD2v/lectin genotyping [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Based on the results of p72 genotyping, the Rhodesia strain was assigned to genotype VIII, while the Stavropol_01/08 strain was identified as genotype II [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01443" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In Experiment 3, we did not observe significant differences in the development of cellular or humoral immune responses in pigs after immunization with the ASFV recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain compared to the Experiment 2 data. However, only 40% of the &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav-immunized pigs were protected against challenge with the ASFV Rhodesia strain. Three immunized animals died at 9&#x02013;15 dpc, and two immunized animals had a prolonged fever and other clinical signs but remained alive until the end of the observation period. Thus, the recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain cannot be used to protect against this heterologous variant of serotype 8.</p><p>The molecular and immunological foundations of cross-immunity remain poorly understood. However, further investigation into these aspects is crucial for the advancement of safe and effective vaccines against ASF.

We plan to conduct a comparative analysis of the complete genomes of the Stavropol_01/08 and the Rhodesia strains and to continue the study of cross-immunity within ASF serotypes for a more detailed understanding of this important issue.</p><p>The small number of animals used in the experiments, as well as the lack of reversion-to-virulence and genetic stability studies, seem to be the main limitations of this research. Further experiments are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this ASFV vaccine strain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-12-01443"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, the obtained homologous recombination strain with a six-gene deletion in the MGF360/505 region located in the left variable region was characterized in vivo and in vitro. The genetic makeup of the recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain closely resembled the previously described ASFV-G-&#x00394;MGF and HLJ/18-6GD strains. Our studies demonstrated that the recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain is fully attenuated, characterized by a short period of viremia, and it protected 100% of immunized animals against the homologous virulent strain. At the same time, only partial protection (40%) of the &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav-immunized pigs against challenge with the ASFV heterologous Rhodesia strain was shown. Therefore, we propose the recombinant &#x00394;MGF360/505_Stav strain as the basis of a promising vaccine against a homologous ASFV genotype II. However, this LAV cannot be used to protect animals against heterologous variants of serotype 8.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank CISA-INIA (Valdeolmos, Spain) for providing the COS-1 cell line to the FRC of Virology and Microbiology (FRCVM, Volginsky, Russia) for scientific research.
