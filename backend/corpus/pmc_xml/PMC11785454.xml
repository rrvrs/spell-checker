This regulation has raised concerns that the quality of medical care may decline. On the other hand, the shifting demographics of Japan, characterized by an aging population and declining birth rates, suggest a potential decrease in demand for obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) services in the future. In Japan, there is no feasible study regarding how many OBGYN doctors are currently lacking and how many of them will be necessary. Herein, we conduct simulations using Japanese insurance claims data to estimate the required number of OBGYN doctors.</p><p>Methods</p><p>This is a simulation study. We project&#x000a0;future demand based on the current demand, working hours, and demographic changes. Using health insurance claims data, we estimate how many OBGYN doctors will be necessary in the future within the overtime work limit.</p><p>Results</p><p>The required number of doctors shows a declining trend that mirrors the declining population. Presently, there is a shortage of 1,500 doctors to comply with the 960-hour limit, and it is anticipated to be until 2040 or later before all doctors adhere to this limit. Several sensitivity analyses consistently support this trend.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Despite the existing shortage of obstetricians and gynecologists, future demands are expected to decrease.

However, concerns have been raised, mainly by senior physicians, that the regulation could negatively impact the quality of care in&#x000a0;Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) due to reduced training opportunities [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To address the current medical demand under these regulations, temporary measures such as&#x000a0;"Night and Holiday Duty Permission" have been introduced to make physicians' working hours appear shorter than they actually are [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Meanwhile, the demographics of Japan are changing due to an aging population&#x000a0;and declining birth rates. As the population ages, the demand for healthcare services for elderly women, including treatments for malignancies, is expected to rise. Conversely, declining birth rates and population numbers are anticipated to reduce the demand for perinatal medicine.</p><p>Amid these significant changes, it is crucial to estimate how many OBGYN doctors are currently lacking and how many&#x000a0;will be needed in the future to develop effective health policies for Japanese OBGYN doctors. In response to this need, the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) proposed the &#x0201c;Grand Design,&#x0201d;&#x000a0;recommending the recruitment of 500 OBGYN residents annually [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, this target lacks epidemiological evidence to support it. While acknowledging the declining birth rates, the society predicts an increase in high-risk pregnancies due to the aging of pregnant women, the growing focus on women&#x02019;s healthcare, and medical innovations such as robotic surgery, genomic medicine, and personalized healthcare. Therefore, the society argues it is premature to reduce the number of OBGYN doctors [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This underscores the urgent need for robust predictions regarding the future demand for OBGYN doctors in Japan.</p><p>Predicting the required number&#x000a0;of doctors is inherently challenging and has been a topic of study since 1978 [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Estimation methods generally focus on supply, demand, or a combination of both [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Supply-based estimation considers&#x000a0;factors such as the inflow&#x000a0;and outflow&#x000a0;of physicians, including medical school graduates, immigration, retirements, attrition, and physicians working abroad [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, demand-based estimation involves factors such as population size (demography), morbidity, healthcare utilization patterns, and growth in health expenditures [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, few studies have specifically focused on predicting the future demand for OBGYN doctors&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These reports suggest that future demand&#x000a0;would increase in response to the population growth of women of reproductive age (18-44 years old), based on a baseline scenario that assumes healthcare demands remain constant as long as demographic trends remain unchanged [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we estimate the future required number of OBGYN doctors using a demand-based approach and a baseline scenario, focusing on the radically changing demographics of Japan and the new regulations of overtime work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study is a simulation using insurance claims data and demographic information. The simulation consists of four steps. The first step is to analyze the current demand by quantifying the workload of OBGYN doctors. Second, we evaluate the current number of OBGYN doctors and their working hours. Third, we estimate the future demand based on projected demographic changes. Finally, we calculate the number of OBGYN doctors&#x000a0;required to meet the demand. All analyses were performed using R (version 4.2.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p><p>Current demand</p><p>The total workload of OBGYN doctors consists of&#x000a0;three main components: medical procedures for inpatients, workload for outpatients, and other tasks (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Unfortunately, no comprehensive data exists to capture the total workload. Estimating the workload for outpatients is particularly challenging due to the diverse range of activities involved, such as ultrasound examinations, prescribing medications, and providing informed consent regarding patients' conditions. These activities are difficult to quantify with health claims data. Other tasks include attending conferences, writing electronic medical records and letters, and conducting research, all of which are&#x000a0;difficult to quantify.</p><p>As a result, only the workload associated with medical procedures for inpatients can be quantified. These procedures include gynecologic procedures, obstetric procedures, and those related to&#x000a0;normal vaginal deliveries. Gynecologic procedures include laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy, while obstetric procedures consist of colpo-perineal sutures, vacuum extractions, and cesarean sections. Procedures for normal vaginal deliveries involve cardiotocogram monitoring, internal examinations, and waiting hours. Among these, gynecologic and obstetric procedures are covered by insurance, whereas normal vaginal deliveries are not. For the purpose&#x000a0;of this study, we assume the workload for each procedure is proportional to its medical fee. For normal vaginal deliveries, which are not covered by insurance, we use an alternative fee as described below.</p><p>Supply</p><p>In this study, we assume that the age structure and geographic distribution of OBGYN doctors will remain constant over time. Additionally, we define <inline-formula><tex-math id="M17383745089356456">\begin{document}h(t)\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>&#x000a0;as the total working hours in year <inline-formula><tex-math id="M1738374508936006">\begin{document}t\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>.

The workload is estimated based on data collected from 2015 to 2021. While the number of gynecologic procedures is assumed to change&#x000a0;proportionally with the population size, the number of obstetric procedures varies according to the number of deliveries, including cesarean&#x000a0;sections. Similarly, the number of procedures for normal vaginal deliveries is determined by the number of vaginal deliveries, excluding cesarean sections. Additionally, we assume that the workload associated with outpatients and other tasks changes in proportion to the volume of medical procedures for inpatients.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Total workload</title><p>The total workload comprises three components: medical procedures for inpatients, workload for outpatients, and other tasks.

With 16 national holidays annually and mandatory paid leave of five days&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the statutory working hours for each physician amount&#x000a0;to 1,917 hours per year.</p><p>The MHLW&#x000a0;has proposed regulations on overtime work, setting an upper limit of 960 hours per year. An extended limit of 1,860 hours applies exclusively to physicians working in underserved healthcare areas, emergency medicine, and those in training. However, this 1,860-hour limit is set to expire in 2035 [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, information regarding part-time work is not available for those affiliated with gynecologic hospitals or clinics without inpatient beds&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since they work fewer hours than the statutory working hours at their affiliated facilities [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we assume they are not engaged in overtime work. However, this assumption is further evaluated&#x000a0;in a sensitivity analysis.&#x000a0;Importantly, the regulation does not apply to OBGYN doctors who manage labor-handling clinics, as they are considered&#x000a0;employers rather than employees. In this regard, we assume that all doctors, except for those affiliated with labor-handling clinics, will work an additional 960 hours of overtime annually in the future.</p><p>Sensitivity analysis</p><p>Firstly, since the working hours of OBGYN doctors vary significantly, the regulation will reduce the average overtime work to 960 hours or fewer annually. Therefore, we assume three additional scenarios for the average overtime work of future OBGYN doctors who currently exceed&#x000a0;the 960-hour limit: (A) no overtime work, (B) 360 hours annually, and (C) 720 hours annually.</p><p>Secondly, as mentioned above, we assume that the hours dedicated to part-time work are zero for those affiliated with&#x000a0;gynecologic hospitals or clinics without inpatient beds. We consider an additional four scenarios for part-time work of this population: (A) 0 hours annually, (B) 360 hours annually, (C) 720 hours annually, (D) 960 hours annually, and (E) 1860 hours annually. In these scenarios, we assume that the hours of overtime work remain unchanged for scenarios (A), (B),&#x000a0;(C), and (D). In scenario (E), however, we assume overtime work of 960 hours annually starting after 2025. Scenario (A) is used for the primary analysis in this study.</p><p>Finally, we apply different <inline-formula><tex-math id="M17383745089684732">\begin{document}\overline{d}\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>&#x000a0;values, representing the workload for a single vaginal delivery.</p><p>Data source</p><p>Current Demand</p><p>We utilize&#x000a0;the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB open data Japan) from the year 2015 to 2021 [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From this dataset, we extract medical procedures from the inpatient data categories&#x000a0;&#x0201c;J medical procedures&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;K surgeries,&#x0201d;&#x000a0;which are associated with OBGYN doctors.

Data on the number of OBGYN doctors in each hospital and their working hours are sourced from the annual survey by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG) [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This survey covers all 5,230 facilities with OBGYN departments, with responses from 5,146 facilities, resulting in a response rate of 98.4%.</p><p>Additionally, part-time work is calculated using data from a JAOG questionnaire survey&#x000a0;in 2021 [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This survey targeted 985 birthing hospitals, excluding clinics, and received responses from 715 facilities, achieving a response rate of 72.6%. The annual total in-hospital hours are determined by combining daytime duty hours (8 hours per duty)&#x000a0;and overnight duty hours (16 hours per duty) from other hospitals. Unfortunately, there is no available data on part-time work for OBGYN doctors employed in gynecologic hospitals and clinics. As a result, this study does not account for part-time work by these doctors. The average values for 2020 and 2021 are used as&#x000a0;the baseline for efficiency, as the total in-hospital hours are calculated using data from mid-2021.</p><p>Future Demand</p><p>To estimate future demand, we use population data from the Statistics Bureau of Japan [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and population projections from the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

This estimation focuses on current demand and demographic changes to project future demands. For simplicity, we based the estimation on the changes in the workload for inpatients. To represent the total workload of OBGYN doctors, we considered medical procedures covered by insurance as well as normal deliveries not covered by insurance. Although OBGYN doctors are currently in short supply, the required number of OBGYN doctors is expected to decline in the future due to decreasing population and birth rates. While this study relies on several assumptions, our sensitivity analyses consistently demonstrate this trend.</p><p>In Japan, many small labor facilities heavily rely on part-time OBGYN doctors who have primary affiliations elsewhere [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. JAOG has expressed concerns that the regulation of overtime work will discourage part-time work in smaller labor facilities, potentially destabilizing perinatal medical services. Consequently, JAOG has recommended that labor facilities obtain &#x0201c;overnight and holiday duty permission&#x0201d; [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. When overnight and holiday duty in certain facilities requires minimal tasks for physicians, hours worked are not counted as working hours unless actively performing medical procedures [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. With this permission, labor facilities can invite OBGYN doctors for part-time work without caring about the 960-hour limit. However, it may lead to prolonged and unfair working hours. Therefore, JAOG considers this permission as only a temporary measure [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, we use in-hospital time as working hours, which includes sleep and waiting time, because in-hospital time will be fully counted as working hours in the coming years.</p><p>The regulation will reduce working hours. However, working hours may vary significantly within the same facility, and the average overtime work after the regulation may not strictly align with the 960-hour&#x000a0;limit. Thus, we anticipated an additional three scenarios, as shown in Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. If the average overtime work becomes 720 hours, all OBGYN doctors achieve the 960-hour limit in 2045 or later. Additionally, OBGYN doctors in labor-handling clinics work for incredibly long hours (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Though the regulation does not intend to limit overtime work for those who manage labor-handling clinics, the younger generations are not likely to inherit these long working hours, judging from their attitude toward work [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, the estimates based on these hardworking OBGYN doctors (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) may undervalue the future required number of OBGYN doctors.</p><p>As detailed information on part-time work is not fully available, we conducted a sensitivity analysis for part-time work. In Figure <xref rid="FIG5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the average hours dedicated to part-time work have minimal impact on the estimates as long as&#x000a0;they remain within 960 hours.</p><p>Moreover, we established a standard fee for normal vaginal deliveries, which requires sensitivity analysis. In Figure <xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, a smaller workload leads to achieving the 960-hour limit earlier. If&#x000a0;<inline-formula><tex-math id="M17383745091531296">\begin{document}\overline{d}\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> is 5,000 points under insurance coverage, the 960-hour limit will be achieved in 2038 or later.</p><p>The main assumption in this estimation is that healthcare supply will remain unchanged if demographics remain the same. However, this baseline scenario may not always hold true due to medical innovations, an increase in female physicians, changes in the allocation of physicians, and advanced data sharing.</p><p>In this study, we did not take gender differences into account. In Japan, female doctors tend to work fewer hours than male doctors because they are engaged in parenting [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Female doctors occupy approximately 40% of OBGYN doctors [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and this proportion is increasing [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. JSOG and JAOG have been calling for action to ease burdens on female doctors [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, we will need more OBGYN doctors than our estimates if the surrounding environment of female doctors does not improve sufficiently and female doctors continue to increase.</p><p>The estimates are all based on the current medical system. Japan has an excessive number of labor facilities, approximately 2,000 nationwide [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The average delivery per hospital is 475 deliveries annually, with&#x000a0;7.4 OBGYN doctors per hospital on average [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Many labor facilities have fewer than two physicians, and most clinics are assumed to be managed by only a small number of doctors [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Japan's medical and human resources are inefficiently dispersed&#x000a0;compared to countries like the United States and Finland, where hospitals are highly concentrated [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].&#x000a0;This decentralized system results in an excessive number of OBGYN doctors being on standby during nights and holidays.</p><p>Maternal transfers from smaller clinics to&#x000a0;larger hospitals are common due to the limited capacity of many clinics. These transfers pose significant risks to patients, as a recent study in Japan found that the average transfer takes approximately one hour to reach a tertiary center [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This highlights the inherent inefficiencies and risks of the current dispersed system. Moreover, physicians are often unable to rest properly at night, as they remain prepared for potential emergencies. Addressing these systemic issues is crucial to improving both efficiency and patient safety.</p><p>In addition to these structural inefficiencies, there are also issues with personal data sharing. While the exchange of patient records between hospitals has progressed in countries such as the United States and Singapore, inter-hospital communication in Japan still predominantly relies on telephone, fax, and paper-based medical records [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This system is not only inefficient but also poses risks, as it increases the likelihood of overlooking critical information. By promoting personal data sharing, physicians could dedicate more time to patients, potentially reducing overall demands.</p><p>Therefore, we should prioritize deliveries in well-equipped hospitals initially and promote personal data sharing. In centralized facilities, more deliveries can be managed per in-hospital hour, reducing waiting times.&#x000a0;Additionally, large hospitals are reported to have better neonatal outcomes [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In terms of neonatal outcomes as well, consolidating birth facilities should be encouraged. Small clinics should focus more on outpatient care&#x000a0;rather than taking risks with deliveries. The redistribution of human resources from small clinics to larger hospitals will also be necessary. By concentrating deliveries and surgeries in&#x000a0;larger hospitals, the issue of low physician salaries&#x000a0;in teaching hospitals could be addressed [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In short, if we were to maintain the current number of birth facilities, more OBGYN doctors would be required than our estimates suggest, as efficiency would decline with decreasing birth rates.</p><p>However, neonatal outcomes are significantly worsened in cases of out-of-hospital births. If travel time to the hospital takes long, out-of-hospital births become a serious concern [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], indicating that hospital concentration should be carefully planned.</p><p>Ultimately, we should focus on meaningful dialogue with stakeholders to create a better medical system for both patients and physicians. This is far more constructive than devising ways to manipulate working hours to circumvent regulations for "overnight and holiday duty permissions."</p><p>Strengths and limitations</p><p>The methods used in this study quantify the workload based on medical fees and use demographic changes to make estimations. These methods can&#x000a0;be applied as an alternative in other fields, particularly when crucial information is unavailable. Several sensitivity analyses also support the robustness of the results in this study. However, the assumptions made in this study may introduce bias into the estimates. The primary limitation of this study is that we could not quantify outpatient workload to predict the future demand for OBGYN doctors. This may introduce bias; if treatment trends shift&#x000a0;toward more conservative management in outpatient settings, the actual demand for physicians may be lower than our estimates. Conversely, with the increasing demand for infertility treatment, more patients may seek medical assistance through outpatient clinics. In this case, our study would likely underestimate the required number of physicians. Additionally, changes in the efficiency of medical services should be taken into account. If the current number of birth facilities is maintained, more OBGYN doctors will be required. Furthermore, increasing demands for innovative medical treatments could distort the projections, though the extent of these changes remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using claims data, we estimated the required number of OBGYN doctors based on medical procedures and vaginal deliveries, highlighting declining trends. Our analysis indicates a shortage of 1,500 doctors for a 960-hour overtime work&#x000a0;limit. However, the current workforce is expected to be sufficient until around 2040. Simply increasing the number of OBGYN doctors will not be enough to address the current excessive workload and the projected decline in demand. Instead, we should prioritize inter-hospital and regional communication and collaboration, rather than merely relying on the long working hours of physicians. Structural reforms must be explored more extensively, including the concentration of hospitals and&#x000a0;clinics, improvement of working conditions for healthcare workers, and the digitalization of medical information.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We utilized ChatGPT for proofreading.
