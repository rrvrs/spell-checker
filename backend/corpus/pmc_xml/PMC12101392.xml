Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can play a crucial role in crops&#x02019; adaptation to manganese (Mn) toxicity by regulating nutrient uptake and altering subcellular compartmentalization. The present study examines the influence of intact extraradical mycelia (ERMs) from native AMF on wheat (<italic toggle="yes">Triticum aestivum</italic>) grown in Mn-toxic soil, with a focus on the tissue-specific and subcellular Ca, Mg, P, and Mn distribution. Wheat cultivated in soil pre-colonized using an intact ERM associated with <italic toggle="yes">Lolium rigidum</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Ornithopus compressus</italic> exhibited enhanced growth and improved P contents. During the first week of growth, the Mn concentrations increased in the wheat&#x02019;s roots and shoots, but Mn was subsequently reduced and sequestered within the cell wall. In contrast, in the absence of an intact ERM, the Mn accumulation in wheat followed an apparent continuous time-course pattern. AMF-mediated cell wall sequestration seems to contribute to Mn detoxification by limiting excessive cytoplasmic accumulation. Furthermore, AMF-driven changes in the element distribution suggest a dynamic response, wherein an early-stage nutrient uptake transitions into a long-term protective mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of AMF in mitigating Mn stress in crops, providing insights for sustainable agriculture and soil remediation strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell wall immobilization</kwd><kwd>extraradical mycelium</kwd><kwd>manganese toxicity</kwd><kwd>mycorrhiza</kwd><kwd>nutrient partitioning</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER), Programa Operacional Regional Alentejo 2020</funding-source><award-id>ALT20-03-0145-FEDER-000039</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>GREEN-IT</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>HERCULES</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>IN2PAST</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This study was partially funded by Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER), Programa Operacional Regional Alentejo 2020, under the research contract ALT20-03-0145-FEDER-000039; programmatic funding for GREEN-IT (DOI: 10.54499/UIDB/04551/2020 and DOI: 10.54499/UIDP/04551/2020); HERCULES (DOIs: 10.54499/UIDB/04449/2020 and 10.54499/UIDP/04449/2020); and IN2PAST (DOI: 10.54499/LA/P/0132/2020).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-jox-15-00070"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Heavy metals (HMs) are elements with a high atomic weight and density, typically exceeding 5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Their levels in the soil at a toxic concentration can substantially impact crop production by reducing the diversity of beneficial microbiota and microfauna, as well as inhibiting plant growth and development [<xref rid="B1-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Elevated HM levels often come from anthropogenic activities, including industrial processes, coal conversion, and waste incineration. However, natural sources of HMs can also have substantial and widespread effects on soil health and plant ecosystems [<xref rid="B3-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Under natural conditions, elements like aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) can reach toxic levels in acidic soils, while important macronutrients become less available [<xref rid="B4-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Soil acidification is a natural process that can become aggravated by agricultural practices through an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in the soil, primarily after the excessive use of fertilizers and inefficient nitrogen management [<xref rid="B5-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ammonium-based fertilizers release nitrogen, which is quickly converted into nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and H<sup>+</sup> in the soil. When plants fail to uptake nitrate, it leaches away, leaving behind H<sup>+</sup>, which contributes to acidification. Manganese toxicity, driven by soil acidity, poses a significant challenge in many agricultural soils worldwide [<xref rid="B6-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Under Mn toxicity, crops exhibit stunted growth and reduced productivity, accompanied by symptoms such as chlorosis in older leaves, necrotic spots, white flecking, purpling, and leaf tip burn, progressing from older to younger leaves [<xref rid="B7-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Elevated Mn levels in the soil solution can disrupt the uptake of other essential nutrients, such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca), through competition for shared transport pathways [<xref rid="B9-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Diagnostics is often challenging, as the symptoms of Mn toxicity are sometimes mistaken for Fe deficiency [<xref rid="B12-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Acidic soils with high levels of bioavailable Mn are also a driver of the adaptability of native microbiota. Under these challenging conditions, soil microorganisms have developed strategies for enduring environmental extremes [<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Notably, some mycotrophic plants can thrive in Mn-toxic soils, aided by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), especially if they are promptly colonized by an intact extraradical mycelium (ERM) as a preferential source of inoculum [<xref rid="B15-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi establish arbuscules within the root cells and form a large ERM extending outside the roots, which can cover over 100 m of hyphae per cubic centimeter of soil [<xref rid="B16-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Besides contributing to the stability of the soil structure [<xref rid="B17-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the ERM plays a crucial role in mobilizing water and nutrients, primarily P, while the arbuscule facilitates their exchange with photosynthetic products from the host&#x02014;accounting for between 10 and 30% of the hosts&#x02019; photosynthetic output [<xref rid="B18-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Under HM toxicity, AMF are known to benefit plants by improving the soil&#x02019;s physicochemical properties and filtering xenobiotics within their mycelium, effectively acting as a protective physical barrier for the mycorrhizal plant (e.g., by chelating HMs in the cell wall or to the glomalin produced by the AMF and released into the soil) [<xref rid="B19-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, AMF can immobilize HMs at the plants&#x02019; roots. More importantly, they enhance plants&#x02019; development and efficiency by influencing the host&#x02019;s biochemistry, optimizing redox balance, and facilitating intracellular compartmentalization of HMs [<xref rid="B21-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as reviewed in detail by [<xref rid="B20-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Wheat grown in Mn-toxic soil attempts to limit its Mn uptake at the roots, albeit inefficiently, and sequesters excess Mn into the vacuoles of its shoot cells [<xref rid="B23-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, when a highly mycotrophic plant, such as <italic toggle="yes">Lolium rigidum</italic> L. (LOL) or <italic toggle="yes">Ornithopus compressus</italic> L. (ORN), is grown beforehand and establishes its characteristic AMF consortium in the soil, subsequent plants appear to tolerate the toxicity caused by excess Mn better [<xref rid="B24-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Under these conditions, an undisturbed ERM formed through previous symbiosis with LOL or ORN will colonize the wheat roots more rapidly than in its absence, conferring earlier protective benefits by stimulating growth, reducing Mn uptake, and altering the subcellular ratios of Mn and other nutrients [<xref rid="B21-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B25-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the protection conferred by intact ERMs from native AMF in wheat&#x02019;s growth in Mn-toxic soils remain unclear. However, earlier studies have identified differential gene expression in wheat roots colonized by ERMs previously developed through symbiotic LOL-AMF or ORN-AMF combinations. Through LOL-AMF symbiosis, wheat genes associated with oxidative stress response, disease resistance, and metal ion binding were predominantly upregulated. Conversely, in wheat roots grown after colonization by the ORN-AMF consortium, the upregulated genes were primarily linked to cellular division and growth, with minimal association with stress responses [<xref rid="B26-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The present study aims to contribute to uncovering these biochemical mechanisms by detailing the compartmentalization of the nutrients Mg, Ca, P, and toxic Mn at the tissue and subcellular levels in the shoots and roots of wheat grown after LOL-AMF or ORN-AMF symbiosis weekly over 3 weeks. This was performed to elucidate the dynamics of elemental displacement following the colonization of intact ERMs with different communities of beneficial native AMF, depending on the plant grown before wheat. The outcomes of this study elucidated the mechanisms through which an intact ERM from native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhances wheat growth in Mn-toxic soil. Primarily, the ERM appears to facilitate Mn uptake during the early stages of colonization, likely triggering an early tolerance response that promotes enhanced growth at later developmental stages. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this mechanism in this system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jox-15-00070"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-jox-15-00070"><title>2.1. The Soil&#x02019;s Characteristics, the Plant Material, and the Experimental Design</title><p>The soil used was a granitic Eutric Cambisol with Mn toxicity related to its granitic origin, collected from the top 20 cm layer at the Mitra Farm, the University of &#x000c9;vora, Alentejo, Portugal (38&#x000b0;32&#x02032; N; 08&#x000b0;00&#x02032; W). This sandy loam soil has previously been chemically analyzed [<xref rid="B27-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The key nutrient concentrations were 67 mg/kg of K, determined using the Egner&#x02013;Riehm method combined with flame atomic emission spectroscopy; 112 mg/kg of Mg, obtained using 1 M ammonium acetate at a pH of 7 and analyzed through atomic absorption spectroscopy; 41 mg/kg of Mn, assessed through the Lakanen method using flame atomic absorption; 26 mg/kg of P, quantified through UV&#x02013;Vis molecular absorption spectrophotometry after Egner&#x02013;Riehm extraction; and 0.4 mg/kg of N-NO<sub>3</sub>.

The abundance of AMF in this soil was previously quantified at 180 viable propagules per g DW of soil, and the AMF diversity was also previously profiled [<xref rid="B27-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>To prime the Mn-toxic soil with ERMs from beneficial AMF, the collected soil was used to grow each of the mycotrophic species. Thus, dark plastic pots with a capacity of 8 L were filled with the homogenized soil, moistened to approximately 70% of its maximum water holding capacity (by weight), and maintained under these conditions in a greenhouse for one week to allow for soil stabilization. Throughout this period, the daily minimum and maximum air temperatures were recorded, with the temperature regulation system set not to exceed 30 &#x000b0;C. Afterwards, five ORN or LOL seedlings, germinated in hydrated filter paper, were selected at a similar development stage and planted at equally distanced positions in each of twelve replicate pots for each treatment [<xref rid="B24-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As a control, five <italic toggle="yes">Silene gallica</italic> L. (SIL) seedlings, a non-mycotrophic plant that does not develop ERMs, were also planted as described above. The AMF developer species were selected based on prior studies demonstrating the beneficial effects of their specific AMF consortia on wheat growth, including their association with reduced internal Mn levels in wheat leaves [<xref rid="B27-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The pots were kept within the conditions described above for 7 weeks to allow the mycotrophic plants to develop naturally and establish symbiotic relationships with their preferred AMF symbionts. Any germinated weeds were excised to avoid interference from different hosts in the formation of the AMF consortium. Following their growth period, the mycotrophic plants were removed through cutting, and six uniformly spaced seedlings of wheat (<italic toggle="yes">Triticum aestivum</italic> L., cultivar Ardila) were sown in each pot. The pots were then arranged in a completely randomized design within the greenhouse. After 1, 2, and 3 weeks, the wheat plants were retrieved from four replicate pots at each time point, and the roots and shoots were weighed separately. Three plants per pot were used to determine the tissue DW after drying at 60 &#x000b0;C for 3 days. For the remainder, the tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until analysis.

Discussion</title><p>The benefits of AMF symbiosis for crop growth and productivity are well documented in the scientific literature, particularly regarding their role in enhancing P uptake and improving plant&#x02013;water relations under both optimal and stress conditions, as reviewed in [<xref rid="B30-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, our understanding of AMF-mediated nutrient dynamics beyond those for P remains relatively limited. This is particularly evident for other essential nutrients, such as Mg or Ca, which are crucial for plant growth, metabolic regulation, and stress resilience, especially under heavy metal toxicity. This limited understanding arises from the complex and often context-dependent effects of different AMF species on the nutrient uptake, translocation, and distribution within plant tissues. In the present study, the impact of native AMF consortia on wheat&#x02019;s growth and nutrient compartmentalization under Mn stress was investigated. Wheat grown in soil containing an intact ERM from AMF&#x02014;previously established through symbiosis with highly mycotrophic plants&#x02014;exhibited more than double the growth of the wheat grown in soil without a previously developed ERM. This striking improvement in growth highlights the critical role of intact ERMs in mitigating Mn toxicity and supporting nutrient acquisition. However, significant growth was only observed three weeks after planting, indicating that time is required to see the full benefits of AMF symbiosis. Notably, changes in the host plant&#x02019;s biochemical responses were evident as early as the first week, suggesting that AMF-induced modifications in nutrient dynamics and stress tolerance begin during the early stages of colonization. An increase in the P concentrations in the shoots during the first week suggests the early establishment of AMF symbiosis. This prompt colonization is driven by the nature of the initial inoculum, as a fully developed ERM more efficiently colonizes wheat roots compared to colonization initiated by AMF spores in the soil (i.e., soil from the previously grown non-mycotrophic <italic toggle="yes">S. gallica</italic>) [<xref rid="B15-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The immediate establishment of symbiosis seems to greatly enhance the Mn uptake by the roots and its subsequent translocation to the shoots, a response that is particularly pronounced in wheat associated with the ORN AMF. By the second week, the wheat influenced by the ORN AMF begins to exhibit a decline in the Mn concentrations in its roots, potentially signaling a reduction in uptake activity. Conversely, in the wheat grown in soil lacking a pre-established ERM, the Mn concentration continues to rise by the third week. In the presence of an intact ERM formed in association with mycotrophic plants (ORN or LOL), the Mn concentrations decline in both the shoots and roots. This initial surge in Mn uptake may reflect an AMF-associated enhancement in nutrient transport as the AMF hyphae actively mobilize P from the soil to the plant. The increased wheat growth in the soil from mycotrophic plants appears to result primarily from elevated internal P levels and reduced Mn levels, both influenced by early root colonization through the intact pre-formed ERM. Additionally, this condition led to increased root Ca and Mg nutrient levels, further contributing to improved plant health.</p><p>The uptake of P and Mn exhibits some interlinkages, with several mechanisms suggesting their coupled dynamics in the soil&#x02013;plant system. For instance, inositol hexaphosphate (commonly known as phytate), a predominant form of organic P in many soils, has the capacity to form stable complexes with bioavailable Mn [<xref rid="B31-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This interaction highlights the role of organic P compounds in indirectly modulating Mn dynamics. Also, an important strategy employed by plants for P acquisition involves the exudation of carboxylates into the rhizosphere. These low-molecular-weight organic acids facilitate the mobilization of P that is bound to Fe and Al hydroxides via ligand exchange reactions, thereby increasing the bioavailability of P for root uptake [<xref rid="B32-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, this strategy also inadvertently mobilizes Mn in the soil, which often results in increased Mn uptake and its subsequent accumulation in plant tissues, particularly in the leaves [<xref rid="B33-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Intriguingly, the transport of Mn across plant membranes appears to exhibit low specificity. A significant proportion of the membrane transport proteins responsible for Mn translocation are not exclusively dedicated to Mn. Instead, they also mediate the transport of other divalent cations, including Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ca, Co, and Ni [<xref rid="B34-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This lack of specificity is likely driven by the chemical similarities between these cations, particularly in terms of their ionic radii and charge. Consequently, competition among these cations for transport pathways can influence Mn uptake and distribution, further complicating its regulation within plant tissues. Typically, it is believed that Mn and P compete for absorption by plant roots, meaning that the increased absorption of one element results in the reduced uptake of the other. This happens because both elements have similar chemical characteristics, and the transport mechanisms in the roots can be affected by this competition. However, the present study suggests in the presence of a pre-established ERM, this competition process between Mn and P does not occur as expected. In Mn-toxic soil (where the Mn concentrations are very high and can be harmful to the plant), wheat&#x02019;s uptake of Mn and P seems to be linked. That is, even under conditions of excess Mn, the plant absorbs both elements more effectively with the help of the native AMF, rather than experiencing direct competition.</p><p>The competitive interactions among the analyzed elements may partially explain the distinct compartmentalization patterns for Ca, Mg, and Mn observed in the present study. Although the Ca and Mg concentrations remained unchanged during the first week, their subcellular distribution was altered. In the presence of an intact ERM, the Ca and Mg ratios were elevated in the root cell walls, indicating preferential accumulation in this compartment. In wheat shoots, Ca was specifically redirected to the cell wall fraction under the influence of the ORN AMF. By the third week, the Mg in the roots exhibited an inverse trend, with reduced accumulation in the cell wall compared these conditions without an intact ERM. At this stage, the allocation of Ca, P, Mg, and Mn into the cell wall fraction in the shoots increased, driven by the presence of an intact ERM. These findings suggest that Mn is rapidly assimilated within the first week, whereas Mg and Ca are retained in the cell walls. By the third week, these elements are actively transported from the cell wall into the symplast in the roots, likely at the expense of Mn uptake. In the shoots, any excess Mn, Ca, or Mg was sequestered into the cell wall, potentially mitigating Mn toxicity.</p><p>When there is excess Mn, it is believed that wheat mitigates its toxicity by sequestering the excess Mn into vacuoles, effectively isolating it from sensitive cellular components and reducing its harmful effects on cellular metabolism [<xref rid="B23-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the presence of an intact ERM appears to circumvent this sequestration mechanism, favoring Mn&#x02019;s compartmentalization within the cell wall instead. Cell wall compartmentalization is a crucial mechanism through which plants mitigate Mn toxicity. The cell wall, primarily composed of polysaccharides such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, along with structural proteins and lignin, can serve as a buffer modulating cation uptake [<xref rid="B35-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Negatively charged functional groups, particularly the carboxyl groups of pectin, facilitate cation binding, forming stable complexes that restrict mobility. Pectin, rich in polygalacturonic acid residues, exhibits a high affinity for divalent cations, also contributing to Mn sequestration [<xref rid="B36-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This apoplastic cation loading maintains elevated concentrations of polyvalent cations near the plasma membrane or along the apoplasmic pathway, which is critical for the uptake of certain macronutrients. A low external pH decreases the charge density of the cell walls so that the effects on cation uptake become more pronounced. Additionally, competition between Mn and other divalent cations, such as Ca and Mg, for binding sites further modulates Mn compartmentalization [<xref rid="B36-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In response to Mn stress, plants can also modify the cell wall&#x02019;s composition to enhance Mn immobilization, including increased pectin synthesis and altered lignin deposition. Lignification of the cell wall reduces Mn mobility, thereby limiting its cytoplasmic entry [<xref rid="B8-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, enzymatic redox reactions, mediated by peroxidases, oxidize bioactive Mn into insoluble Mn oxides, which are subsequently immobilized in the cell wall [<xref rid="B38-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the temporal shift in the Mn distribution may also have been tied to the activation of the host plant&#x02019;s responses mediated by the AMF. Early in the interaction, AMF likely prioritize colonization and nutrient uptake, leading to increased Mn translocation into plant tissues. As the symbiosis develops, stress-alleviating pathways such as antioxidant enzyme activation, redox balance optimization, and selective nutrient transport come into play, reducing the negative impacts of Mn toxicity on wheat growth [<xref rid="B24-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B27-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B39-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This delayed reduction in Mn levels highlights the dynamic nature of AMF symbiosis. The initial spike in Mn may serve as a short-term adaptation to enhance nutrient acquisition, whereas the subsequent reductions reflect the establishment of long-term protective mechanisms. In previous work, we analyzed the changes in wheat roots&#x02019; transcriptome following colonization by these specific AMF consortia. Our findings revealed the upregulation of several transporter genes, including the heavy metal-transporting P1B-ATPase 2, five phosphate transporters&#x02014;none of which had been previously identified as AMF-inducible&#x02014;and two ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2) genes from the NRAMP family of metal transporters [<xref rid="B26-jox-15-00070" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Future research should investigate the specific biochemical and molecular changes occurring in wheat during this temporal shift. A deeper understanding of how AMF modulate Mn transporters and detoxification pathways could reveal novel strategies for enhancing plants&#x02019; resilience in soils exhibiting Mn toxicity. Additionally, exploring how these dynamics vary across different AMF consortia and host plants may offer insights for optimizing AMF-based biotechnological solutions in sustainable agriculture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-jox-15-00070"><title>5.
