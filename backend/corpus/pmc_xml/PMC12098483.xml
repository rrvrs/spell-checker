Participants were then divided into low- and high-learning groups based on the post-training change in GOT threshold (sensitivity). Cortical alpha-band power, which is associated with sensory processing efficiency, was compared between baseline and post-training in low- and high-learning groups.

A more complete description of the underlying neural mechanisms is needed as this form of perceptual learning underlies important human skills, while functional recovery of tactile perception is essential for motor rehabilitation following neuropathological events such as stroke (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Au-Yeung and Hui-Chan, 2009</xref>). Perceptual learning is defined as the process by which exposure to a specific perceptual stimulus, whether naturally or in a regulated training program, improves the sensitivity to that stimulus and the fine discrimination of similar stimuli within the same modality (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Sagi, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Dempsey-Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Sakai et al., 2021</xref>). However, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying perceptual learning has been hampered by the marked heterogeneity in both baseline competence and training-induced improvement among study participants (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Mukai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Muller-Gass et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Sakai et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous neural oscillations in the 8&#x02013;13&#x0202f;Hz (alpha) range enhance cortical information processing efficiency by inhibiting behaviorally irrelevant information (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Rihs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Haegens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, alpha oscillations in the primary somatosensory cortex are critical for the processing of tactile information. <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Ai and Ro (2014)</xref> reported an inverted U-shaped relationship between the alpha oscillation power in primary somatosensory cortex and tactile perception, indicating that tactile perception is sharpest when these regional alpha oscillations are of optimal strength. Similarly, paired-pulse depression (PPD), which reflects inhibitory control processes as well as alpha oscillation power, is associated with tactile spatial discrimination performance (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Lenz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2023</xref>). Our previous study revealed weaker PPD in the somatosensory cortex of healthy young individuals showing superior tactile two-point discrimination performance (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that optimal cortical inhibition associated with alpha oscillations is essential for tactile spatial discrimination performance.</p><p>Therefore, differential activation of alpha oscillations in sensory cortex and associated networks may contribute to individual differences in perceptual learning. <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Muller-Gass et al. (2017)</xref> reported that alpha oscillations in cortical areas, including early visual areas, were more powerful in a high-learner group than in a low-learner group following perceptual training. Furthermore, these oscillations grew even stronger in the high-learner group as training progressed. Similar findings have been reported in the tactile domain. <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brickwedde et al. (2019)</xref> also reported that perceptual learning was more effective when the baseline alpha oscillations were stronger in somatosensory regions. However, it is currently unclear how alpha oscillations in early somatosensory areas are related to interindividual variations in tactile perceptual learning. Functional connectivity (FC) strength between the early (primary) sensory cortex and other cortical regions may also contribute to the individual differences in perceptual learning. <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Mukai et al. (2007)</xref> found that the FC between early visual areas and the intraparietal sulcus/frontal eye field was enhanced by training on a visual discrimination task among a high-learner group, whereas the FC between the early visual areas and the fusiform gyrus was strengthened in a low-learner group.</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that high and low learners engage distinct neural mechanisms. Thus, alpha oscillation power in the relevant early somatosensory area and the FC strength between this early somatosensory area and other cortical regions may be responsible for interindividual variations in tactile perceptual learning, although this remains to be conclusively demonstrated. Therefore, this study compared regional alpha oscillation power and FC of early somatosensory areas with other cortical regions between high and low perceptual learners to determine if individual differences in perceptual learning efficiency result from the engagement of distinct neural mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-nine right-handed males (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, 21.1&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.5&#x0202f;years of age; range, 20&#x02013;22&#x0202f;years) participated in a perceptual learning experiment using the tactile grating orientation discrimination task (GOT).

To examine the relationship between tactile learning efficacy and alpha-band oscillations in cortical areas, including the primary somatosensory cortex, as well as alpha-band FC based on the primary somatosensory cortex, participants were first stratified into high- and low-learner groups according to whether the relative change in GOT discrimination threshold after complete training (four sessions) was above or below the median change in GOT discrimination thresholds for all subjects and compared for alpha-band PSD and imaginary coherence within the alpha-band. The Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test was performed to determine whether the GOT discrimination threshold was normally distributed in the high- and low-learner groups.

Similarly, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Muller-Gass et al. (2017)</xref> reported that a visual discrimination training task increased the alpha oscillation strength in early visual areas only among high-learner participants. The primary somatosensory cortex encodes tactile information from peripheral sensory receptors (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Salinas et al., 2000</xref>), and alpha oscillations modulate information processing in this and other brain regions by suppressing task-irrelevant information (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Haegens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). However, the baseline alpha-band PSD in the high-learner group appears to differ between touch and vision modalities. The analyses presented here showing that weak baseline alpha-band PSD was subsequently strengthened by training suggest that inhibitory control in the left somatosensory cortex is enhanced by training on the tactile GOT using the right index finger, while <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Muller-Gass et al. (2017)</xref> found that only strong baseline alpha oscillations in early visual areas were subsequently strengthened by training. Several studies also have similarly reported an association between weaker baseline alpha oscillations and superior perceptual learning. Further, we recently reported that alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (&#x003b1;-tACS) over primary somatosensory cortex improved tactile orientation discrimination in participants with weak baseline alpha oscillations but not in those with strong baseline alpha oscillations (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that perceptual learning is most efficient when alpha oscillations are relatively weak prior to perceptual training. In addition, alpha oscillations in the left somatosensory cortex were increased after only a single training session in the high-learner group, suggesting that weaker baseline alpha oscillations promote more efficient perceptual learning. This notion is consistent with the report by <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Neuling et al.

However, tactile discrimination training improved their ability to suppress task-irrelevant information and strengthened the neural networks, ultimately improving tactile orientation discrimination. Conversely, low-level learners had higher baseline tactile orientation discrimination, attributable to a stronger ability to suppress task-irrelevant information and stronger neural network involvement in perceptual decision-making. However, tactile discrimination training may have excessively enhanced this suppression not only in the primary somatosensory cortex but also in frontal lobe regions involved in perceptual decision-making. This resulted in the suppression of task-irrelevant information necessary for tactile orientation discrimination, which prevented improvement in their tactile orientation discrimination performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec25"><label>4.5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, the small number of participants limited the statistical power. In addition, the small number of participants limits grouping by training effect to two groups (high- or low-learner group), which could result in participants being in opposite groups. Second, GOT performance was measured only at baseline and immediately after the final training session and EEG recordings, so the long-term effects of training on neural network activity and tactile discrimination are still unknown. Finally, we used a mass training protocol, while spaced training conducted over multiple days is frequently more effective and may result in distinct performance and neurological changes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec26"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Training-induced strengthening of alpha-band power in the somatosensory cortex and the FC between the somatosensory and frontal-central cortices is essential for tactile learning.
