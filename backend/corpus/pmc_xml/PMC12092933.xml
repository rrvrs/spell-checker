</sup> Thus, percutaneous deep venous arterialization (pDVA) might serve as an alternative in selected high risk for amputation patients.</p><p>Besides the distal tibial occlusions, severe calcification might further complicate the revascularization of CLTI patients. It is estimated that 30%&#x02013;50% of patients with peripheral atherosclerosis have a significant vascular calcification, which is a negative predictor for the outcome of surgical and endovascular treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-17085381241257736" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-17085381241257736" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In cases of pDVA, the presence of heavily calcified disease might challenge the crossing from the arterial to the vein system, leading to inadequate stent graft expansion and occlusions. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has been both used for the modification and treatment of calcified disease. Accordingly, the combination of pDVA and IVL might be useful in patients with heavily calcified disease and distal tibial and foot arterial occlusion. We report the first two cases of IVL-assisted pDVA with the LimFlow system.</p><sec id="sec6-17085381241257736"><title>Case Report 1</title><p>An 81-year-old male patient was submitted with rest pain and gangrene of the right first toe (<xref rid="fig1-17085381241257736" ref-type="fig">Image 1</xref>).

</sup> The procedure was conducted in a hybrid operating room under general anesthesia. First, retrograde venous access was obtained, and a 4F 45&#x000a0;cm sheath was advanced up to the proximal posterior tibial vein. Afterward, a 7&#x000a0;F antegrade arterial sheath was introduced. Following the diagnostic imaging, a 0.014&#x02033; glidewire advantage guidewire (Terumo inc.) and a 0.035&#x02033; Navicross catheter (Terumo inc.) were used to cross the calcified lesions of the distal popliteal artery and the TPT. Both vessels were predilated with an undersized plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) catheter (3&#x000a0;mm Coyote, Boston Sci) to allow the delivery of the IVL catheter. A 6.5&#x000a0;mm IVL device (M5+, Shockwave Medical) was then used to treat the severely calcified stenosis of the distal popliteal artery and the TPT. A drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty (6&#x000a0;mm Ranger, Boston Sci) was then applied as anti-restenotic treatment. The pDVA was completed based on the instructions for use for the LimFlow system. Following crossing and valvulotomy, the posterior vein was dilated with a 5&#x000a0;mm balloon catheter and the LimFlow straight covered stents were deployed (three 5.5 &#x000d7; 100&#x000a0;mm stents and one 5.5 &#x000d7; 60&#x000a0;mm stent) from the level of the calcaneus to the crossing point. A tapered covered stent (3.3 to 5&#x000a0;mm &#x000d7; 60&#x000a0;mm) was then used to bridge the crossing point. DCB angioplasty with a Stellarex 5 &#x000d7; 60&#x000a0;mm Balloon was conducted at the distal end of the deployed grafts to avoid an edge stenosis. The final angiography showed a good result with rush blood flow through the stents and through the pedal veins with outflow through the vein arch (<xref rid="fig2-17085381241257736" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The postoperative course was uneventful. During 4 months of follow-up, the patient did not undergo any secondary procedure or minor/major amputation and rest pain relieved as ongoing patency of the pDVA was controlled with regular clinical and color duplex ultrasound examinations. Four months after the procedure, the patient died secondary to complications of urosepsis.<fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="fig2-17085381241257736"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Intravascular lithotripsy-assisted percutaneous deep vein arterialization.

A diagnostic angiogram showed a single-vessel run-off through the peroneal artery and no patent foot arch vessels (desert foot). The proximal posterior and anterior tibial arteries exhibited stenotic and heavily calcified arteriosclerosis, followed by long segment occlusions.

</sup> IVL is an effective and safe modality for the treatment of heavily calcified femoropopliteal and tibial disease; however, its use prior to pDVA has never been described.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-17085381241257736" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-17085381241257736" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This report presents the combination of both treatment strategies within limb salvage procedures in patients with heavily calcified, non-reconstructable distal PAD. IVL was used to optimize the inflow to the arteriovenous circuit and enable the crossing from the tibial arteries to the vein, while pDVA provided arterial flow to an otherwise occluded arterial foot arch.</p><p>Several studies assessed the performance of pDVA. The ALPS registry evaluated 32 patients who underwent pDVA with a reported 1-year amputation-free survival (AFS) of 71% and a 68.2% rate of complete wound healing.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-17085381241257736" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup> In the PROMISE I Study, 32 patients were evaluated with a 70% AFS and 75% of wound healing at 1&#x000a0;year. Nonetheless, re-intervention rates were high in both studies (54.8% and 52%, respectively).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-17085381241257736" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> More recently, the PROMISE II trial enrolled 105 patients who had non-reconstructable CLTI. A limb salvage was attained in 67 patients, and wounds were completely healed in 16 of 63 patients (25%) and were in the process of healing in 32 of 63 patients (51%). Again, re-interventions to treat both native vessels and to optimize the flow were performed in 38 patients (36.5%).<sup>

</sup></p><p>Zaman et al proposed five different patterns of DVA failure (failure types) based on the location of the lesion. Most of the patients presented with multiple types of failure concurrently.<sup>

</sup> The use of IVL for calcified lesions of the arterial inflow and especially of the popliteal artery and the TPT may improve the patency of the circuit and eventually avoid an inflow re-intervention.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-17085381241257736" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> Additionally, IVL was used to change the compliance of the vessel wall and enable an easier crossing, which can be technically demanding.</p><p>Although several options can be used for the treatment of calcified disease, the use of IVL has several advantages.
