syndrome, headache, xerostomia, halitosis, myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome amongst population of Southern Rajasthan is of interest
to dentists. Cross sectional study had been conducted on 5214 patients from 18-60 years age group who visited the Department of the Oral
Medicine and Radiology, Pacific Dental College and Research Centre, Bedla, Udaipur. Findings such as burning of oral mucosa, presence of
vesicles and ulcers, striation in oral cavity, limitation of jaw movement, muscular pain were assessed for the establishment of
diagnosis. prevalence of stress associated oral mucosal lesions/conditions like oral lichen planus, apthous ulcers, burning mouth
syndrome, headache, xerostomia, halitosis, myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome was reported to be 12%, 17%, 3%, 21%, 6 %, 23 and 18%
respectively. Besides stress management therapy, Professional consultation along with proper investigation and medicinal treatment is
required.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stress associated oral mucosal lesions/conditions</kwd><kwd>apthous ulcers</kwd><kwd>burning mouth syndrome</kwd><kwd>myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background:</title><p>Stress was originally derived from the Latin word "stringi" which means, "to be drawn tight." Stress is a psycho physiological
response of the organism to a perceived challenge or threat as defined by Brevik <italic>et al.</italic> in the year 1996. Stress is not
what happens to someone, but how someone reacts to what happens [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It can also be defined as
adoptive response of an organism to a threatening stimulus, which provides the link between the psychological and physiological
processes that are associated in the onset of disease [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both physical and psychological stress
affect different aspects of the immune system, partly by increasing serum catecholamines and corticosteroids [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]
and as a side effect to prolonged exposure to these chemical changes body develops endocrinal, metabolic homeostatic immunological
disturbances leading to diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, periodontal emotional stress syndrome,
osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, preterm delivery are related stress either as a physiological response
to stress or as a behavioral response [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The oral cavity represents an organ of the expression
as it is connected specifically or emblematically to the significant human senses and interests and is charged with a high psychologic
potential. Certain diseases which affect the oral mucosa may be the direct or indirect expression of emotions or conflicts
[<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, Stress has a direct relation with oral
lesions and conditions (directly proportional), <italic>i.e.</italic>, there are many studies which state that, oral lesions become more
prominent when the level of stress rises above the threshold. For example Lichen Planus, Recurrent apthous stomatitis, where severity of
oral lesions increases along with increase in level of stress [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
Therefore, it is of interest to determine the prevalence of stress associated oral mucosal lesions/conditions such as Oral lichen planus,
Apthous ulcers, Burning mouth syndrome, Headache, Xerostomia, Halitosis, Myofacial pain Dysfunction syndrome amongst population of
Southern Rajasthan.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A cross sectional study had been conducted on 5214 patients from 18-60 years age group who visited the Department of the Oral
Medicine and Radiology, Pacific Dental College and Research Centre, Bedla, Udaipur after obtaining ethical clearance from the ethical
committee. An informed consent had been taken for all the patients. They were subjected to thorough case history related to stress and a
detailed clinical examination of the oral cavity was carried out under artificial light. On intra oral examination findings such as
burning of oral mucosa, presence of vesicles and ulcers, striation in oral cavity, limitation of jaw movement, muscular pain and some
routine parameters included in the establishment of diagnosis for the conditions such as Oral lichen planus, Apthous ulcers, Burning
mouth syndrome, Headache, Xerostomia, Halitosis, Myofacial pain Dysfunction syndrome was done according to diagnostic criteria
[<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Patient having habit history of tobacco, areca nut or alcohol, having drug history, any
graft placement or restoration, taking any treatment for oral lesions or suffering from carcinoma had been excluded from the study
Following establishment of diagnosis, each patient was informed about the condition, its precancerous potential.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion:</title><p>The data shows that out of 5214 cases; the prevalence of stress associated oral mucosal lesions/conditions was reported to be 25.4 %
being observed in 1325 cases. Amongst them 38% were reported to be males and 62% were females. Hence, female predominance in association
with occurrence of stress associated oral mucosal lesions is seen. This could be explained that females are more sensitive to stress and
emotional disturbances which could affect their immunity in turn a leading cause of occurrence of oral mucosal lesions as reported by
Chaturvedi <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Maximum number of patients diagnosed with stress
associated oral mucosal lesions had been observed to be among young age group of 20-25 years. The least number of patients had been
observed in the age group exceeding 50 years. Thus, younger age group are prone to stress associated oral mucosal lesions.</p><p>Prevalence of stress associated oral mucosal lesions/conditions like oral lichen planus, apthous ulcers, burning mouth syndrome,
headache, xerostomia, halitosis, myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome was reported to be 12%, 17%, 3%, 21%, 6%, 23% and 18% respectively.
This is because psychological stress affects the normal nerve-endocrine-immune pathway of the human body, leading to over-activation of
the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nerve-adrenal medulla. The hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis is
regulated by the HPA axis, which can inhibit or over activate endocrine and immune systems, and the secretion of corresponding hormones,
cytokines and proteins changes accordingly This may damage the oral mucosa and induce disorders such as lichen planus, apthous ulcers
and others [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The prevalence of stress associated oral mucosal lesions had been reported in 25.4% of the population. Moreover, significant
association of young age group (20-25) years among female had been observed. However, further studies should be conducted with a large
sample size to determine the role of stress in occurrence of oral mucosal lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Financial support:</title><p>NIL</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN2" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>None</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="FN" fn-type="other"><p>
