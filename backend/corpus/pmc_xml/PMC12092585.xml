Here, we report that histone methyltransferase ASH1L is genetically amplified and is required for bone metastasis in men with prostate cancer. ASH1L rewires histone methylations and cooperates with HIF-1&#x003b1; to induce pro-metastatic transcriptome in invading cancer cells, resulting in monocyte differentiation into lipid-associated macrophage (LA-TAM) and enhancing their pro-tumoral phenotype in the metastatic bone niche. We identified IGF-2 as a direct target of ASH1L/HIF-1&#x003b1; and mediates LA-TAMs&#x02019; differentiation and phenotypic changes by reprogramming oxidative phosphorylation. Pharmacologic inhibition of the ASH1L-HIF-1&#x003b1;-macrophages axis elicits robust anti-metastasis responses in preclinical models. Our study demonstrates epigenetic alterations in cancer cells reprogram metabolism and features of myeloid components, facilitating metastatic outgrowth. It establishes ASH1L as an epigenetic driver priming metastasis and macrophage plasticity in the bone niche, providing a bona fide therapeutic target in metastatic malignancies.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The histone methyltransferase ASH1L has been linked to tumorigenesis, mainly in leukemia.

The success of cancer therapies and improvements in overall survival mainly depend on the prevention and treatment of metastatic malignancies. Although advances have been made in cancer treatment over the decades, effective therapies are urgently needed for patients with metastatic disease. During metastasis, cancer cells undergo loss of cellular adhesion, increased invasiveness, dissemination into the circulation, and eventual colonization at distant sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Recent large-scale genomic studies have uncovered many emerging genetic alterations in metastatic cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Characterizing and functionally defining the roles of these alterations in different steps of the metastatic cascade will advance our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of metastasis and facilitate the development of improved treatment for patients with lethal diseases.</p><p id="Par4">Increasing evidence suggests that most steps in the metastasis cascade are largely driven by interactions between cancer cells, extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and immune components in the tumor microenvironment and metastatic niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant myeloid cells in primary tumors and metastasis lesions and are associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The molecular and cellular communication between invading cancer cells and TAMs results in tumor vascularization, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), intravasation, and colonization of distal sites, including the bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Understanding how invading cancer cells interact with TAMs facilitates the development of effective therapeutics and combinations for metastatic diseases.</p><p id="Par5">Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) catalyze the methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histone tails, which affect chromatin compaction and transcriptional programs. ASH1L (absent, small, or homeotic 1-like) is a SET domain-containing HMT that methylates Lys36 of histone H3 (H3K36me2/3) and is required for maintaining the trimethylation of Lys4 of H3 (H3K4me3) and active transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. By regulating <italic>HOX</italic> gene expression, ASH1L supports the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells and plays a vital role in leukemogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Overexpression of ASH1L was also found in solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; however, its biological function in metastatic diseases remains elusive.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we identify ASH1L as an epigenetic determinant and a bona fide therapeutic target in metastatic malignancies. We uncovered that ASH1L is genetically amplified and overexpressed in diverse metastatic cancer types. Using prostate cancer (PCa) as a model system, we characterized the loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects of ASH1L on cancer invasiveness and bone metastases. Then, we performed high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling to dissect the molecular basis of ASH1L&#x02019;s role in transforming invading cancer cells. Besides, we generated a PCa bone metastasis model in immunocompetent mice, which recapitulates human diseases. Combining it with single-cell transcriptomics, we determined the role of ASH1L in modulating the communication between disseminated cancer cells and host immune cells in the bone niche. Furthermore, we assessed the relevance of ASH1L amplification or overexpression with cancer progression, clinical outcomes, and immunophenotype in men with metastatic PCa. At last, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of agents targeting ASH1L and its partner hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in preclinical models of metastatic PCa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ASH1L is genetically amplified and overexpressed in metastatic cancers</title><p id="Par7">In a meta-analysis of human cancers, we found that amplification and gain of the <italic>ASH1L</italic> gene occur in &#x0003e;40% of metastatic PCa, much more frequently than in localized tumors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). High ASH1L mRNA levels are correlated with genetic amplification status and are strongly associated with metastatic diseases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>). Besides, we found that genetic amplification of <italic>ASH1L</italic> was associated with worse overall survival in men with metastatic PCa (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>), and human prostate tumors with high ASH1L mRNA levels exhibited an enriched cancer metastasis profile (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of ASH1L in human PCa tumors revealed that ASH1L protein levels were positively correlated with cancer progression and aggressiveness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). In human PCa cell lines, PC-3M, a metastasis-derived variant from PC-3, showed an increased expression of ASH1L (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). Our prior studies established and characterized a metastatic PCa genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model with PB-Cre-driven co-deletion of <italic>Pten</italic>/<italic>Smad4/Trp53</italic> (<italic>PbPPS</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This model develops invasive prostate adenocarcinoma with lymph node, lung, and liver metastases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1g</xref>).

In addition to PCa, frequent genetic amplification of ASH1L was found in other malignancies (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1i</xref>). We observed that breast and melanoma cells with higher metastatic potential also expressed higher levels of ASH1L than their parent cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1j</xref>). Collectively, these studies in human samples, GEM models, and cancer cell lines demonstrate that histone methyltransferase ASH1L is genetically amplified and overexpressed in metastatic PCa, among other malignancies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>ASH1L promotes cancer invasiveness and bone metastasis.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The percentages of genetic alterations of <italic>ASH1L</italic> in human localized (TCGA) and metastatic (SU2C) PCa samples. <bold>b</bold> Correlation of ASH1L protein expression with Gleason grade in human prostate tumors.

To this end, we intracardially injected control and ASH1L-depleted PC-3M cells expressing RFP reporter and firefly luciferase into male nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging showed that depletion of ASH1L suppressed the metastasis of cancer cells to the tibia, femur, or mandible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Importantly, depletion of ASH1L significantly prolonged the overall and metastasis-free survival durations of mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2h</xref>).

Identifying genetic and epigenetic determinants promoting bone metastases and the crosstalk between invading cancer cells and metastatic bone niches facilitates the development of effective treatments. In this study, we identified an understudied histone methyltransferase, ASH1L, as a bona fide epigenetic driver in metastatic PCa. We found that ASH1L was genetically amplified and overexpressed in metastatic tumors and was associated with disease progression and worse prognosis. By characterizing the loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects, we report that ASH1L primes metastasis and reshapes the immune landscape in the bone niche (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Mechanistically, ASH1L co-opts with HIF-1&#x003b1; to induce a pro-metastatic transcriptome in cancer cells via catalyzing histone methylations at H3K4 and H3K36. Furthermore, we identified an unrecognized regulatory axis of ASH1L-IGF-2 in invading cancer cells, which induces lipid-associated and angiogenic TAMs and maintains their pro-tumoral and anti-inflammatory phenotypes by enhancing OXPHOS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

More importantly, we identified ASH1L as a key epigenetic regulator mediating the crosstalk between invading cancer cells and TAMs in the metastatic bone niche. By epigenetically reprogramming invading cancer cells, ASH1L not only induces tumor-infiltrating monocyte differentiation into lipid-associated and angiogenic TAMs, but also suppresses antigen presentation, interferon signaling, and immunostimulatory molecule expression in inflammatory TAMs. In myeloid cells, chromatin remodeling or histone modifications were reported to affect lineage differentiation, phenotype switch, and activation states during hematogenesis and tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>.

In this study, we reported that the ASH1L/HIF-1&#x003b1; complex in invading cancer cells promotes IGF-2 expression, which triggers AKT-GSK3b-mTOR signaling and activates OXPHOS pathways in monocytes in the bone niche. This leads to monocyte differentiation into lipid-associated and angiogenic TAMs and maintains their pro-tumoral function during metastatic tumor outgrowth. In autoimmune diseases, IGF-2 was also found to prime macrophages to acquire an OXPHOS-dependent anti-inflammatory phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, highlighting that IGF-2&#x02019;s regulation on TAMs is a broadly applicable mechanism. IGF-1R, the receptor of IGF-2, is recognized as a promising target of cancer therapy, and monoclonal antibodies targeting human IGF-1R have been studied in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Future studies are warranted to evaluate IGF-1R blockade&#x02019;s therapeutic potential and its effects on TAM plasticity in preclinical models of bone metastasis.</p><p id="Par45">Given ASH1L&#x02019;s crucial role in leukemogenesis, small-molecule inhibitors have been developed and tested in preclinical leukemia models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Our studies support ASH1L as a promising therapeutic target in metastatic malignancies, particularly in patients with bone metastases. In cellular experiments, we showed that AS-99, a small-molecule inhibitor against ASH1L, suppressed cancer cell migration and invasion. In preclinical mouse models, AS-99 also exhibited considerable effects in suppressing bone metastases and reversing the pro-tumoral TAM-enriched metastatic bone niche, providing proof-of-concept evidence for targeting ASH1L in metastatic PCa and other malignancies. In summary, we identified ASH1L as a bona fide epigenetic oncoprotein and a promising therapeutic target in metastatic cancers, uncovered its cancer cell-intrinsic and extrinsic roles in metastatic progression and bone niche remodeling, and shed light on ASH1L-targeted therapy in PCa and other malignancies with high metastasis rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par46">All mouse experimental procedures followed the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol (#00001955).
