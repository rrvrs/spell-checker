Although no evidence suggests negative effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) within defined exposure limits, authorities responsible for risk communication provide precautionary advice to help citizens reduce personal exposure. However, previous research indicates that precautionary information can increase risk perception and decrease trust.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This cross-sectional study investigated effects of precautionary information on risk perception and trust in the context of 5G, using large general population samples in Germany and Greece. For the first time, personal relevance was examined as a potential moderating factor, using a novel approach to assess practical and thematic relevance. Participants were first surveyed on their relevance of the topic, then provided with basic information about &#x0201c;RF-EMF and health&#x0201d;, and, in the experimental group, with additional precautionary information. Different measures for risk perception and trust followed. We expected higher risk perception and lower trust for the experimental group, and assumed that at lower personal relevance, this effect would be stronger.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Contrary to expectations, precautionary information increased just one risk perception measure and only in Germany. The anticipated moderating effect of personal relevance was not found, but relevance itself significantly predicted risk perception, with higher relevance correlating with higher risk perception. Exploratory findings revealed higher risk perception among females compared to males and in Greece compared to Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>That there were only few effects of the precautionary information may be linked to the focus on actions to reduce personal exposure when using mobile devices. The results underline the importance of considering personal relevance and demographic factors in risk communication and highlight directions for future research.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>Plain Language Summary</title><p>Advances in technology, like 5G in mobile communications, bring both opportunities and concerns. There is no evidence that mobile phone radiation (electromagnetic fields) harms health when kept within safety limits. Nevertheless, authorities often give information on how they can reduce their exposure if they wish to do so (precautionary information). However, such information can sometimes make people more worried and less trusting.</p><p>In this study we tested whether providing precautionary information about mobile phone radiation and 5G affects how risky people think it is and how much they trust in authorities providing it. Participants came from Germany and Greece, and they took part in the study online. First, they were asked how much the topic &#x0201c;mobile phone radiation and health&#x0201d; mattered to them. Then, one group of participants received only general information on the topic and the other one received extra precautionary information. We then asked them for their perceptions of risk (for example, how worried they feel about the topic) and trust. We expected that people who read the precautionary information would perceive higher risk and experience less trust than people who read the basic information. Also, we expected that people who cared less about the topic might be more affected by the precautionary information.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found that for the most part the group that read precautionary information did not perceive them as more risky or less trustworthy than the group that read basic information. People to whom the topic mattered more perceived it as riskier. However, there was no difference in how they perceived the precautionary information. The study also found that Greek participants compared to German ones and women compared to men perceived the topic as riskier.</p><p>In summary, precautionary information had little effect on risk perception or trust. Personal relevance and other individual differences, like gender and nationality, played a role in how people viewed the risks. This is important to consider for people who inform the public about risks and health-related topics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>personal relevance</kwd><kwd>risk communication</kwd><kwd>precaution</kwd><kwd>mobile communications</kwd><kwd>RF-EMF</kwd><kwd>5G</kwd><kwd>risk perception</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018693"><funding-source>Horizon Europe Framework Programme</funding-source><award-id>101057622</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This project has received funding from the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101057622 (SEAWave). </funding-statement><funding-statement>

As technologies are advancing fast, such consequences may emerge over time, making it challenging to predict and manage their full effects.</p><p>In response to these challenges, the precautionary principle has become an important approach, particularly when scientific uncertainty limits our understanding of potential risks, for example because there is not enough research regarding the topic or because scientific evidence is inconclusive (
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Klinke &#x00026; Renn, 2001</xref>). Precautionary measures can be implemented by governments or health authorities, usually by legally enforcing limit values, and they can also be shared with the public, giving individuals the option to adopt them voluntarily (
<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). For risk communicators it is important to understand how information about precautionary measures is perceived by the public, especially if they refer to voluntary actions that citizens can decide to implement individually.</p><p>One area where precautions, and particularly the effects of communicating about them to the public, has been a topic of discussion, is the field of MC, and particularly the new fifth generation technology standard 5G. Recommended precautionary actions in this field concern reducing personal exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF). However, experimental studies have found that providing precautionary information can result in higher risk perception (RP) and lower trust compared to providing basic information only. In the study presented in this paper, the effects of giving voluntary precautionary information are investigated with a large general population sample, considering the introduction of 5G, and for the first time including personal relevance of the topic as a possible influencing factor.</p><sec><title>The case of 5G, RF-EMF and health</title><p>Exposure to RF-EMF at frequencies from 100 kHz to 300 GHz has been steadily increasing during the last 70 years, with primarily radio and television signals and, more recently, including wireless telecommunications and other applications (e.g., industrial and medical). To achieve the increased performance of 5
<sup>th</sup> generation (5G) services, there is a need to make use of the electromagnetic spectrum at higher frequencies than those used for previous standards. Thus, two frequency bands are assigned to 5G technology: FR1 (3.3 &#x02013; 3.8 GHz) and FR2 (26&#x02013;28 GHz). Due to the ubiquitous and increasing exposure to RF-EMF, the question, if RF-EMF from MC-technology have negative impacts on human health, has been researched for many years now. So far, the only biological effects that have been consistently found are the thermal effects, meaning the heating of tissues for whole body or for partial body (local) exposures (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Foster &#x00026; Colombi, 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">ICNIRP, 2020</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">IEEE, 2019</xref>). Other effects that may be negative for human health have not been consistently found (
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Wood &#x00026; Karipidis, 2017</xref>). This is the case for both older MC-standards as well as for the latest standard 5G (

<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Udo
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) has an ongoing project to update the assessment regarding potential health effects of exposure to RF-EMF in the general and working population. The analysis and synthesis of available evidence will be published as a monograph in the WHO Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) series. To this end, WHO has commissioned a set of systematic reviews related to several health outcomes (cancer, adverse reproductive outcomes, cognitive impairment, and symptoms) and biological outcomes (heating and oxidative stress). Many of these systematic reviews are already published (
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Ijaz
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). The International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the Institution of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) recommend exposure limits for health protection, which many countries have adopted (

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Stam, 2017</xref>) and legally enforced. These limits are typically not fully utilized, for example in Greece (

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Manassas
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2025</xref>). Also the limits are reviewed periodically in order to keep up with the latest scientific developments and research outcomes. Nevertheless, scientific uncertainties remain, e.g., regarding long-term effects on heavy users of MC-technology or effects on children (
<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2010</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2014</xref>). In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified the RF-EMF emitted by mobile phones as &#x0201c;possibly carcinogenic to humans&#x0201d; (Group 2B), a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence (
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">IARC, 2013</xref>). This means that the risk of developing brain tumors for heavy mobile phone users cannot be ruled out by the current state of scientific evidence but may be also due to other factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Communication of precautionary information to the public</title><p>According to the World Health Organization (
<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2012</xref>), their scope of responsibility contains only recommendations regarding prevention and does not include precaution, because there is no evidence for negative health effects from RF-EMF within the limits. They also argue that the recommendation of measures should depend on other factors (e.g., socio-economic reality) and be therefore left to national authorities. Many national health authorities (e.g., the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, BfS, in Germany (
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">BfS, 2024</xref>), the Greek Atomic Energy Commission, EEAE, in Greece (
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">EEAE, 2020</xref>), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, EPA (
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">EPA, 2024</xref>) presented precautionary information on their websites at the time this study took place, often focusing on measures regarding mobile devices that citizens can decide to implement in their daily lives. Besides informing about legally enforced limits, this information refers to voluntary precautionary behavior that citizens can choose to take even when RF-EMF values are (far) below legal limits.</p></sec><sec><title>Previous research on effects of precautionary information on risk perception and trust</title><p>A closer look at precautionary information reveals that it might be considered as inconsistent by those who receive the information. The general public usually has no elaborate understanding of RF-EMF exposure, but a rather heuristic understanding of exposure-related factors (
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Link
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). Why are people informed about actions to reduce exposure if there are no known health effects? The question how presenting precautionary information regarding RF-EMF in MC influences RP, i.e. the subjective evaluation of a (potential) hazard, influenced by the perceived probability of a hazard occurring and its expected severity (
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Sj&#x000f6;berg
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Wilson
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), and trust (i.e. in public health protection or the communicating institution) has been researched in several studies.</p><p>In 2020, Boehmert, Freudenstein, and Wiedemann conducted a systematic review to summarize the previous research on risk communication regarding RF-EMF in MC-technology. For precautionary recommendations, they found that across all studies, there was no significant effect on general RF-EMF RP, but recommendations led to significantly higher RP concerning specifically mobile phones and mobile phone base stations (small effect sizes). The effects regarding trust however were not consistent and they were measured less often. It is important to note that those studies differed regarding several aspects in their design and contents. For example, they either communicated precautionary measures that are implemented by authorities (like implementing stricter limit values for RF-EMF exposure, e.g.,

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Boehmert, 2018</xref>). In addition, there are indications that the effect of precautionary information is moderated by some variables, i.e., gender, country of origin, or general concern and anxiety. For example, Boehmert and colleagues (

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Boehmert, 2018</xref>) included gender and trait anxiety in their analyses. Though their results were not consistent, their findings indicate that females have a higher RP compared to males and that people with high trait anxiety are less affected by the precautionary information than people with low trait anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Personal relevance of the topic</title><p>While the influence of some individual characteristics on the effects of precautionary information has been investigated, it has not yet been researched how the effect is related to personal relevance of the topic. To consider relevance would be particularly important if it moderated how different information affects RP and trust.</p><p>While relevance has to our knowledge not yet been examined as an influencing factor in studies on precautionary information in MC, a study on RP and exposure perception regarding EMF in general by
<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2017)</xref> asked participants not only how concerned they were in this moment (during the study), but also how relevant the topic (potential health effects from EMF) was in their daily lives. They found differences between those that were &#x0201c;enduringly concerned&#x0201d; (high concern in the questionnaire and high thematic relevance, 13% of the total sample) and those that were &#x0201c;not enduringly concerned&#x0201d; (high concern in the questionnaire, but no high thematic relevance, 30% of the total sample). Those participants who were enduringly concerned considered EMF-exposure to a higher extent as a moral and affective issue, saw themselves as more exposed, and had a less elaborated concept on how EMF-exposure impacts health (e.g., they were more likely to believe that even low exposure can have detrimental effects on health and less likely to agree with the principle &#x0201c;the dose makes the poison&#x0201d;). These findings can be related to a concept by
<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Zwick (2005)</xref> who states that there is a difference between &#x0201c;pervasive risks&#x0201d; (those that are permanently perceived as risks) and &#x0201c;switching risks&#x0201d; (those that are only perceived as risks after an external trigger and are otherwise not relevant in the everyday life). Risks can consequently be &#x0201c;switched on&#x0201d; by, for example, news reports (e.g., about new technologies like 5G), conversations with friends or family or on social media, or by questions in a study context.</p><p>This is important because recent studies on RP (
<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and exposure perception (
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Link
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>) regarding RF-EMF from MC-technology have shown that for many people, the topic is not very relevant in their everyday lives. According to
<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Zwick (2005)</xref> this would not necessarily mean that study participants could not express concerns or report high RP.</p><p>Transferring these findings to the field of precautionary information, it is noteworthy that none of the previous studies on the effects of precautionary information has considered relevance of the topic as a moderating factor. Studies so far have been conducted with student or general population samples without considering how likely those people are to look for or come across precautionary information in their daily lives. It is plausible to assume that people who regularly think about the topic &#x0201c;EMF and health&#x0201d; or who find information about it generally interesting are more likely to come in touch with precautionary information, for example when they come across, for example in articles or online. This has important practical implications, because communication effects can only become practically relevant in people that actually come across the information in real life. It is possible that in a study context, the effects of precautionary information on RP and trust are stronger for those people with lower relevance of the topic, because even though they likely had a lower RP and little engagement in precaution initially but might feel momentarily threatened when they learn about the scientific uncertainties and the existence of precautionary measures. In other words, this study attempts to test whether the effects reported in former studies (e.g.,
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Boehmert
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) are of any practical relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>Research questions and hypotheses</title><p>In this study, we research the effects of precautionary information on RP and trust in a large general population sample, using information that focused on individual mobile phone use. Furthermore, we investigate whether personal relevance of the topic moderates the effect of precautionary information.</p><p>As most previous studies found that precautionary information led to higher RP than basic information, we expected to find this effect as well, however, only if participants assume that they take no precautionary measures.</p><p>

These countries were chosen because when researching RP regarding RF-EMF, it is interesting to look at two countries where RP is initially quite different. According to the Eurobarometer 2010 (
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">TNS Opinion &#x00026; Social, 2010</xref>) the percentage of citizens concerned about EMF is much higher in Southern Europe (e.g. Greece: 81%) than in middle and Northern Europe (e.g. Germany: 24%). The high percentage of Greek citizens concerned about EMF was also confirmed in 2018 according to the results of a nationwide public opinion survey about perceptions, attitudes and knowledge on radiation-related topics (
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">EEAE, 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample</title><p>To determine the sample size necessary for this study, a power analysis with G-Power was performed. It was assumed that linear multiple regression (LMR) analyses with up to six predictors would be used, with a significance level of .05, a power of .8 and the aim to detect small effects. This resulted in a sample size of
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 688 participants, which was rounded up to a target sample size of
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 700 in each country. In the process of recruiting the final participants, this target was slightly overachieved, see below.</p><p>We aimed to recruit a heterogenous sample, using interlocking quotas for age and gender. To create the quotas while maintaining anonymity, six age ranges were defined (18&#x02013;29, 30&#x02013;39, 40&#x02013;49, 50&#x02013;59, 60+). The proportions of the population to create the quota were based on data from Eurostat. In the final stage of data collection, it turned out that particularly in Greece, quotas for older people (especially females) were impossible to fill, consequently we increased participant numbers for the bordering quotas. For interpretation, it therefore needs to be considered that the older population is underrepresented. The second quota was the "personal relevance of the topic", which was measured by showing participants the teaser of an article on the topic of MC and health and asking them how likely they would decide to read this article, assuming they have time (7-point Likert scale). The quota was used to ensure that the distribution of relevance is roughly balanced (about 1/7 on each point of the scale) to have a diverse sample regarding relevance. In the final sample, each of the seven scale points was represented with 91 to 110 participants. In Germany, it was easier to fill the quotas representing lower relevance (1&#x02013;3), in Greece the other way around (5&#x02013;7), which was an indication that relevance of the topic is higher in Greece compared to Germany.</p><p>A market research company was assigned to recruit the samples, participants were panel members who fulfilled the general entry criteria (being at least 18 years old and having not participated in previous studies about RF-EMF by the same researchers). They were contacted by the panel provider by email, received a link to the study, and were incentivized by collecting points/money from the panel provider.</p><p>While over 5000 potential participants clicked on the link, many of them did not start the study or were screened out for different reasons. Planned reasons for exclusions after starting the study were full quotas, failed attention checks, speeding or long inactivity. Due to missing data because of a small programming mistake, which was noticed after the soft launch, 9 participants had to be excluded at a later point.

After reading the study information and giving consent to take part in the study, personal relevance of the topic &#x0201c;RF-EMF and health&#x0201d; was captured. Then, participants received a basic information text and, only if they were in the corresponding condition, a precautionary information text. There was a timer on each text page that allowed continuation only after 30 seconds. Afterwards, participants responded to several questions, particularly regarding their RP and trust. Finally, they were debriefed and thanked for participation.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="f1"><label>Figure 1. </label><caption><title>Procedure of the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="openreseurope-5-22171-g0000" position="float"/></fig><p>Participants received two attention check questions, not passing led to immediate exclusion from the study.

There were four response options, which could all in theory be abbreviated to &#x0201c;EMF&#x0201d;, the only correct one being &#x0201c;Electromagnetic Fields&#x0201d;.

In the basic text, participants were first told that the information is provided by the &#x0201c;German/Greek radiation protection agency&#x0201d;, which is a fictional agency. Naming a fictional institution as information source was chosen to avoid any influence of prior attitudes or knowledge about the existing institutions.</p><p>In the basic text, it was first explained what EMF are and how MC works, mentioning also different MC-standards like 5G. Regarding possible health effects the text informed that there is no evidence for negative effects below the statutory limits, but that scientific uncertainties remain, particularly for the recent technological developments (5G). In the precaution text, information on possible measures to reduce personal exposure to RF-EMF when using mobile phones was given. A total of six precautionary measures was introduced, e.g., keeping phone calls short and making no calls when the reception is poor. The exact wording differed between the information version (using terms like &#x0201c;inform&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;precautionary measures&#x0201d;) and the recommendation version (using terms as &#x0201c;advice&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;precautionary tips&#x0201d;).

</bold> Personal relevance of the topic &#x0201c;mobile phone radiation and health&#x0201d; was assessed in two different ways. As a novel approach to capture
<italic toggle="yes">practical relevance,</italic> which was supposed to capture a general interest, resulting in a higher likelihood that someone will come across information on the topic in their daily lives, participants were shown three article suggestions with a title and two descriptive sentences (see
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) that all resolved around health-related topics, one of them being titled &#x0201c;mobile communication and radiation protection&#x0201d;. They responded on a scale from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely) how likely they would click on each of the articles to read them, assuming that they have to wait a while and consequently have some time. The other two articles, which were about &#x0201c;hospital hygiene&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;vitamin pills&#x0201d;, were just included to make the scenario more realistic and add a reference if necessary. This was followed by one explicit question on

<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) presented mostly precautionary information that are impossible or hard to implement by citizens individually, for example informing about possible limits enforced by the government. In our study, as well as in the more recent precursor studies, precautionary information referred to measures that citizens can implement voluntarily when using their own mobile devices. Consequently, even though precautionary information may lead to people becoming aware that there are uncertainties, and their RP increases as a result, they may feel less helpless and more confident in their ability to control their own exposure to RF-EMF. Our exploratory finding of higher self-efficacy in the precaution group as well as the finding that trust in Greece was higher in the precaution group (though only if including relevance in the analysis) support this possible explanation. In the future, it would be interesting to systematically compare these different kinds of precautionary information regarding their effects on RP and trust.</p><p>Of course, there were more differences between our study and previous ones that may have influenced results, like different wording in the information texts and different choices of dependent variables. For example, Wiedemann and colleagues (
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann &#x00026; Sch&#x000fc;tz, 2005</xref>) used the term &#x0201c;electrosmog&#x0201d; while we used &#x0201c;electromagnetic fields&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;mobile communication radiation&#x0201d;. These terms may well lead to different associations and affects in participants. We think our choice of experimental material can be justified well as we used actual government agency communication material as a base for it.</p><p>Finally, another potential explanation for the absence of a more pronounced effect of precautionary information might be that RF-EMF as a potential risk triggers less strong responses nowadays than ten or 15 years before. People might nowadays be less ready to increase their RP in response to information on the topic than before. </p><p>Concerning trust, it is important to keep in mind that effects in previous studies have been much less consistent than those on RP. As explained above, there were large differences regarding content but also regarding wording and lengths of the precautionary information not only between our studies and previous ones, but also among the previous ones. All these factors may influence how trustworthy the information is perceived. Furthermore, how trust is measured, and the object of trust could play a role. In previous studies, the object of trust was &#x0201c;public health protection&#x0201d; (e.g.,
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann &#x00026; Sch&#x000fc;tz, 2005</xref>) or &#x0201c;trust in risk regulation&#x0201d; (
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In our study, we asked more specifically for trust in national institutions of radiation protection, naming the source of the information texts as an example. Also, we used a short questionnaire with five items, instead of one item only. It was interesting to see in the analysis that trust is not explained well by any of our predictors. Possibly, trust is something that develops more long-term and is less influenced by reading short texts than RP, which can change momentarily when triggered by something, e.g., information received in the context of a study (
<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Zwick, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we did not find personal relevance of the topic to be a moderator on the effect of precautionary information on RP or, in the one analysis where we did see an effect, the effect was countervailing. Given that the effect of precautionary information on RP was not very pronounced in the current study, it is generally not surprising that this moderation hypothesis is also not supported. Relevance correlated highly with all RP-measures in both countries and particularly thematic relevance was a significant predictor for explaining individual differences in RP. Consequently, it seems that including relevance as a predictor or covariate when investigating effects on RP is important. For example, the group differences regarding affective RP in Germany and regarding trust in Greece became only visible in our analysis when relevance was included, indicating that only by not considering the variance explained by relevance, the detection of group differences was possible. Practical relevance added additional value in some models (CR1 in Germany, trust in Greece). It is too early to tell if our approach to use general interest in the topic as a proxy for personal relevance is helpful for studying effects of risk communication. While it could capture better what role a topic plays in people&#x02019;s daily lives, the explicit question on thematic relevance turned out to be the more important predictor in our analyses.</p><p>As it had proven to be a good idea in previous studies, we used a conditional measure for general RP. Our results confirm that this differential measure is important when investigating the effects of precautionary information. As expected, results for RP were very different between the conditional measures. We recommend that future researchers use conditional measures as well.</p><p>We found some interesting exploratory results in our study. Regarding country differences, both personal relevance and RP were significantly higher in Greece, which is in line with previous findings from, for example, the Eurobarometer. Apparently, the topic of RF-EMF and health is more relevant in people&#x02019;s daily lives and more critically perceived in Greece than in Germany. Practical relevance of two other health-related topics was higher in Greece as well, indicating that perhaps the interest in health-related topics is generally higher in Greece. However, this should be looked at more systematically in other studies.</p><p>We also found some gender differences; however, they were stronger in Greece. In Germany, females reported higher affective RP and general RP under the condition that no precautionary measures are taken. In Greece, females reported higher RP and relevance across all measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>As our study took place online, attention check items and survey completion time were our only way to control if people paid attention to the questions. As it is usually the case with anonymous studies, there is no guarantee that participants took it seriously or responded honestly. Furthermore, there is no way of knowing why participants responded in a certain way, only qualitative research could give more insight into this.</p><p>Because we measured the dependent variables only once, instead of capturing them before and after reading the information, we did not measure individual changes. This decision was made because a pre-information measurement would have drawn participants&#x02019; attention to the topic of health risks from MC and could therefore have influenced the uptake of the information. This is a common trade-off in psychological research between pre-post designs and between-subject designs.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The finding that precautionary information did not result in lower trust compared to basic information may be good news for institutions that inform about MC and health. Even though the group reading precautionary information indicated higher RP in some measures, one could argue that this is not a problem if it doesn&#x02019;t go along with lower trust. Furthermore, in this study, self-efficacy was higher if receiving the precautionary information, indicating that even though RP may be increased, people felt more that they could control their personal exposure. For communicators, e.g., agencies for radiation protection, it is likely a good idea to focus their precautionary recommendations on such measure that citizens have control over, because this might allow them to make informed decisions without undermining trust. Also, perceived consistency of the text was higher in the precaution group, which is an indication against the assumption that precautionary information leads to higher RP because they are perceived as inconsistent (
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Boehmert
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is also important to keep in mind that information may be perceived differently depending on how relevant the topic is for recipients. Future researchers on this topic may consider including a relevance measure in their studies. Finally, it is important to consider that the perception of risk-related and precautionary information may differ hugely between for example countries, genders, and age groups. Consequently, one cannot necessarily generalize findings from studies with a limited target group to other populations. More studies on comparisons between countries should be considered to deepen our understanding of sociodemographic and intercultural differences in RP and trust.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study investigated the impact of precautionary information on risk perception and trust in the context of 5G and electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), with a focus on the moderating effect of personal relevance. The results showed that precautionary information increased only one measure of risk perception, and only in Germany. The expected moderating effect of personal relevance was not found, but personal relevance itself significantly predicted risk perception. Exploratory findings indicated higher risk perception among women compared to men, and in Greece compared to Germany. The limited effects of precautionary information may be related to the focus on measures to reduce personal exposure when using mobile devices. The findings highlight the importance of considering personal relevance and demographic factors in risk communication and suggest directions for future research.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and consent</title><p>All procedures in the study were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and have been approved in form of an ethics approval (01/12/2023) by the ethics commission of the IU International University of Applied Sciences before data collection started (approval number: 121201).

The authors aim to demonstrate several hypotheses including the trust in national institutions (which provide the precautionary information).</p><p> First of all, I want to point out that I am not a sociologist or an expert on social and/or psychological behaviour. I am an expert on mobile network technology, and I can only offer a review on this matter. The problem is that the paper only superficially touches on the problem of exposure to EMF.</p><p> In the parts of the EMF exposure, I can say that there seems to be a misunderstanding in the authors' approach to the EMF limits. The precautionary advice to reduce exposure to EMF is the provision of the limits of EMF. This means that the precaution is to limit the exposure. In several parts of the text (e.g., in the background of the Abstract), the authors say that there is precautionary advice to do something more than&#x000a0;stay within the limits of EMF exposure.</p><p> About the important content of the paper, I have no expertise to understand whether the socilogical study methodology is correct or not, even if it seems quite logical.&#x000a0;</p><p> However, I want to introduce another point to the debate of the misunderstanding of the issue for potential future research. I acquired this opinion after several meetings and discussions with people who believe that EMF is really damaging to health. I think that one of the main problems is the incapacity of the people to distinguish a serious research analysis from a pseudo-research and even, sometimes, fraudulent analysis. In my opinion (but this is not the opinion of an expert in social behaviour), the problem of pseudo-science obfuscates strongly the debate.</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it engage with the current literature?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are all the source data and materials underlying the results available?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Mobile network technology - Telecommunications</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report51566"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/openreseurope.20820.r51566</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sali</surname><given-names>Aduwati</given-names></name><xref rid="r51566a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1692-6516</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="r51566a1">
