</self-uri><abstract><sec id="sec007"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in healthcare workers (HCWs) is critical to inform vaccination policies. We measured COVID-19 VE against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infection in HCWs in the country of Georgia from January &#x02013; June 2022, during a period of Omicron circulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a cohort study of HCWs in six hospitals in Georgia. HCWs were enrolled in early 2021. Participants completed weekly symptom questionnaires. Symptomatic HCWs were tested by RT-PCR and/or rapid antigen test (RAT). Participants were also routinely tested, at varying frequencies during the study period, for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or RAT, regardless of symptoms. Serology was collected quarterly throughout the study and tested by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We estimated absolute and relative VE of a first booster dose compared to a primary vaccine series as (1-hazard ratio)*100 using Cox proportional hazards models.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Results</title><p>Among 1253 HCWs, 141 (11%) received a primary vaccine series (PVS) and a first booster, 855 (68%) received PVS only, and 248 (20%) were unvaccinated. Most boosters were BNT162b2 (Comirnaty original monovalent) vaccine (90%) and BBIBP-CorV vaccine (Sinopharm) (9%). Most PVS were BNT162b2 vaccine (68%) and BBIBP-CorV vaccine (24%). Absolute VE for a first booster was 40% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -56&#x02013;77) at 7&#x02013;29 days following vaccination, -9% (95% CI -104&#x02013;42) at 30&#x02013;59 days following vaccination, and -46% (95% CI -156&#x02013;17) at&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60 days following vaccination. Relative VE of first booster dose compared to PVS was 58% (95% CI 1&#x02013;82) at 7&#x02013;29 days following vaccination, 21% (95% CI -33&#x02013;54) at 30&#x02013;59 days following vaccination, and -9% (95% CI -82&#x02013;34) at&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60 days following vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In Georgia, first booster dose VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was moderately effective but waned very quickly during Omicron. Increased efforts to vaccinate priority groups in Georgia, such as healthcare workers, prior to periods of anticipated high COVID-19 incidence are essential.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>World Health Organization (Europe)</institution>

HCWs are at high risk of occupational exposure, and ensuring the safety and health of HCWs is critical for maintaining functioning healthcare systems in pandemic and interpandemic periods.</p><p>COVID-19 vaccines are an important tool to reduce morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infections [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

While COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) has been widely studied in high-income countries (HICs), few studies have evaluated COVID-19 booster dose VE in middle-income countries (MICs) in Europe, where populations are different, and a variety of COVID-19 vaccines have been used in resource-limited settings.</p><p>Georgia is an upper-MIC in the South Caucasus with a population of 3.7 million people [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Four two-dose COVID-19 vaccines are currently approved for use among adults in the Republic of Georgia: Oxford/AstraZeneca AZD1222, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Sinopharm (Beijing) BBIBP-CorV, and Sinovac (CoronaVac) [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HCWs were a priority group for vaccination after vaccines became available on 15 March 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As of May 2023, in Georgia, 34.6% of the population had received at least one dose, 31.6% had received a PVS, and 6.7% had received a booster dose [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In April 2021, we initiated a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 VE in HCWs in Georgia. VE estimates against the Delta variant from this study have been previously published [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but VE estimates against the Omicron variant have not been previously published. Georgia was heavily affected by the Omicron wave; daily new cases peaked in early February, 2022 [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here we evaluated COVID VE during the early Omicron period using data from the same cohort (January 1 &#x02013; June 1, 2022).</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This cohort study has been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, we enrolled HCWs from six hospitals in Georgia. We collected information on socio-demographics, underlying conditions, hospital role, self-assessed health status, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 history. Every participant provided a blood sample for serology testing at the time of enrolment, and quarterly during the course of the study. Serology samples were tested for anti-nucleocapsid antibody (Anti-N) and anti-spike antibody (Anti-S), as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Throughout the study timeline, participants completed a weekly symptom questionnaire, administered by study personnel. Participants who reported any COVID-19 symptoms included in the Georgia Ministry of Health (MoH) suspected COVID-19 definition (fever, cough, general weakness, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, altered mental status, loss of taste, or loss of smell) provided a respiratory specimen, which was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or RAT.

In order to be consistent with Georgia MoH guidelines, participants were considered to be eligible for a first booster dose &#x02265;150 days after PVS. If participants reported a previous PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection they were considered as having a prior infection. In addition, unvaccinated participants and participants who had not received any inactivated vaccines were seropositive for Anti-Nucleocapsid antibodies at the beginning of the analysis period were considered to have previous infection. We could not use serology test results to determine prior infection for participants who were previously vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine (BBIBP-CorV or CoronaVac), as these vaccines routinely generate anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and therefore positive serology test results in these participants could reflect either prior infection or prior vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Statistical model</title><p>We estimated VE as (1 &#x02013; hazard ratio)*100. Hazard ratios comparing vaccinated and referenced groups were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with vaccination as a time-varying exposure. Vaccination status of some individuals changed over time from unvaccinated to PVS, and from PVS to boosted. Person-time from participants with either only one dose or more than three doses were excluded. Calendar time was used as the underlying time in the Cox regression. We calculated unadjusted and adjusted VE including the hospital site as strata to account for site-specific variation. We adjusted the multivariable regression model using a priori fixed covariates: age groups, sex, any underlying chronic condition (yes/no), self-assessed health status, household size, daily face-to-face patient contact, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by RT-PCR, RAT, or serology), smoking status.

Another study in England of COVID-19 VE against symptomatic infection during BA.1 and BA.2 (January &#x02013; March, 2022) found VE of a first booster dose against symptomatic infection with BA.1 or BA.2 1 week after vaccination was 71% and 74%, respectively.

Our HCW setting differs from these studies, all of which are in the general population. HCW are likely to have higher exposure levels to SARS-CoV-2 than the general population [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Within our study population, the epidemic curve was extremely steep (<xref rid="pone.0311337.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>); 95% of HCWs infected during the study period had a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 January and end of February. This comprises 28% of the total study population. This force of infection, and the context of COVID-19 vaccine being at least a partially leaky vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], meaning that protection may be affected by a number of exposures, may explain at least in part the more rapid decline in VE observed in our study.</p><p>The higher point estimates for relative VE compared to absolute VE suggest that the risk of symptomatic infection among individuals who completed their primary series more than 150 days ago was higher than the risk of symptomatic infection among the unvaccinated. We would expect that the risk of symptomatic infection among those vaccinated with primary series more than 150 days ago would be the same or if anything slightly lower than the unvaccinated, in case of residual protection. This difference may reflect differences between unvaccinated HCWs and those vaccinated more than 150 days ago in terms of virus exposure or variability in seroprotection related to previous infection. However, as confidence intervals overlap between estimates, there is uncertainty in this difference, and it may be due to random error.</p><p>While we found that moderate VE against symptomatic infection rapidly waned, we were not able to evaluate VE against more severe endpoints than medically attended COVID-19. Studies have found that the COVID-19 vaccine continues to be effective in preventing severe disease. A multi-country study in Europe during a period of Omicron-predominant circulation (December 2021 &#x02013; July 2022) found that COVID-19 VE against hospitalization was 43% for PVS and 59% for a first booster dose for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;150 days between the last PVS and symptom onset or last PVS and booster dose with 85% VE if illness onset was 14&#x02013;59 days after booster receipt [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A study in the Netherlands from October &#x02013; December 2023 looking at VE in those aged &#x02265;60 during found VE against hospitalization was 71% [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Our study had several strengths. We used PCR-confirmed infection and serology to determine participants with prior infections. We used both PCR testing and rapid antigen tests to identify infections more completely among study participants. We were able to adjust for different confounders in our VE analysis. We were also able to evaluate VE against the more severe endpoint of medically attended infections.</p><p>Our study also had limitations. Our study was underpowered to detect the true effect in some sub-group analyses, particularly those with a low number of events. Therefore, the results of sub-group analyses should be interpreted cautiously. Our study was not powered to assess VE against more severe outcomes such as hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. Our sample size was low for estimating certain time periods of VE and medically attended VE, which resulted in wide CIs. We did not account for variability in routine testing of asymptomatic participants. However, we focused our analysis on symptomatic infection, an outcome which is less likely to be affected by the variability in routine asymptomatic testing. Because we could not use serology tests to determine previous infection status among the 22% of participants who had received inactivated vaccines, we likely underestimated the number of previous infections in this population. However, because we did not conduct a stratified analysis based on previous infection, this underestimation should not have biased our VE estimates. We did not have the resources to do micro-neutralization tests which would have given us more accurate results. We may have missed previous infections not captured by PCR testing or serology testing. While we could not find published data on the sensitivity of the ECLIA serology test against Omicron subvariants, the pooled sensitivity of the test against the original strain for IgG and IgM were 0.93 and 0.85, respectively, compared to rRT-PCR [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We were unable to stratify VE by prior infection status or estimate vaccine products other than BNT162b2 due to the small sample size. The high rates of prior infections among participants likely led to an underlying level of immunity not seen in uninfected populations. While the immunity likely blunted the magnitude of VE, it reflects the real world setting of Georgia at the time of the study. HCWs in our study enrolled voluntarily, which may have caused selection bias. Participants may have been healthier and more likely to be compliant with the study criteria compared to HCWs in the hospital. However, we do not know if this would have an overall impact on VE. While the hospitals included in our study are large hospitals in the Georgian capital, we do not have demographic and comorbidity data for all Georgian HCWs, and therefore we are unable to determine the extent to which our study population is representative of all HCWs in the country. However, we managed to enroll 40% of HCWs in the 6 study hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Enrolling a large proportion of HCWs helps generalize our findings to all HCWs in Georgia.</p><p>Overall, we found that COVID-19 booster doses were moderately effective at preventing symptomatic infection in hospital based HCWs in Georgia but VE rapidly waned. Our overall VE results should be interpreted cautiously as we used both inactivated and mRNA vaccines in our study. This study was conducted in the context of high previous infection and a high force of infection. These results suggest that timing COVID-19 vaccination campaigns prior to periods of anticipated high SARS-CoV-2 incidence, if practical, could be important to reduce COVID-19 infections. The moderate but waning VE in this study against symptomatic and medically attended infection combined with the more durable COVID-19 VE against severe outcomes described in other studies, underscores the need for broader efforts in Georgia to increase vaccine coverage among priority groups such as HCWs, and to encourage the adoption of guidelines that encourage high-risk individuals to receive annual COVID-19 revaccination, as recommended by WHO [<xref rid="pone.0311337.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the study team at the Georgia National Centers for Disease Control and at all the participating study hospitals.

Participants were selected from healthcare workers vaccinated with either mRNA or inactivated vaccines available. The report indicates that the booster dose is moderately effective in preventing symptomatic infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Georgia, but its effectiveness wanes over time. These findings have been previously reported in other countries with similar conclusions, and the same authors had published a similar study (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0307805)." ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0307805</ext-link>). In this study, the authors determined the VE of COVID-19 vaccines containing the ancestral virus during Omicron circulation. The authors should discuss other studies that reported the VE of ancestral monovalent vaccines against Omicron. Furthermore, some participants received inactivated vaccines, while others received mRNA vaccines. The results should be interpreted cautiously since both vaccines are produced differently. Therefore, it is not clear whether these findings and conclusions represent the VE of mRNA or inactivated vaccines. Authors should comment and discuss on this in the discussion.</p><p>Minor edit: The Sinopharm vaccine is written as BBIBP-CorV in some places, but used differently as BIBP-CorV in other places.

Could this limitation bias results?</p><p>We could not use serology test results to determine prior infection for participants who were previously vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine (BBIBP-CorV or CoronaVac), as these vaccines routinely generate anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and therefore positive serology test results in these participants could reflect either prior infection or prior vaccination.</p><p>We have added the additional language above to the methods section.</p><p>Because we could not use serology tests to determine previous infection status among the 22% of participants who had received inactivated vaccines, we likely underestimated the number of previous infections in this population. However, because we did not conduct stratified analysis based on previous infection, this underestimation should not have biased our VE estimates.</p><p>We have added the text above to the limitations section.</p><p>&#x02022; Adjustments for confounders (Lines 106&#x02013;109) are comprehensive, but their selection rationale should be better justified.</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the methods section: &#x0201c;These variables were chosen because they were previously found to be associated with vaccine uptake and effectiveness.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; (lines:76-78)Serology samples were tested for anti-nucleocapsid antibodies and anti-spike antibodies by Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA): what is the variant strain which was used as coated antigen in kits ? and what is the sensitivity of kit for detection the Ab against predominant circulating variants ?</p><p>Added to the limitations.</p><p>The ECLIA assay used antigens from the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.</p><p>We did not find any data on the sensitivity of these tests for antibodies from Omicron ba1 and ba2.

Limitations (Lines 221&#x02013;227): Expand on the potential selection bias due to voluntary participation and address whether the sample is representative of HCWs in Georgia.</p><p>We added the following to the limitations, &#x0201c;Participants may have been healthier and more likely to be compliant with the study criteria compared to HCWs in the hospital. However, we do not know if this would have an overall impact on VE. While the hospitals included in our study are large hospitals in the Georgian capital, we do not have demographic and comorbidity data for all Georgian HCWs, and therefore we are unable to determine the extent to which our study population is representative of all HCWs in the country.&#x0201d;</p><p>3. Implications for Future Research: Suggest areas for further study, such as VE against severe outcomes.</p><p>Reviewer #2: he study report on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic infection from January 2022 to June 2022, during the Omicron era in Georgia. Participants were selected from healthcare workers vaccinated with either mRNA or inactivated vaccines available. The report indicates that the booster dose is moderately effective in preventing symptomatic infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Georgia, but its effectiveness wanes over time. These findings have been previously reported in other countries with similar conclusions, and the same authors had published a similar study (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0307805)." ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0307805</ext-link>). In this study, the authors determined the VE of COVID-19 vaccines containing the ancestral virus during Omicron circulation. The authors should discuss other studies that reported the VE of ancestral monovalent vaccines against Omicron. Furthermore, some participants received inactivated vaccines, while others received mRNA vaccines. The results should be interpreted cautiously since both vaccines are produced differently. Therefore, it is not clear whether these findings and conclusions represent the VE of mRNA or inactivated vaccines. Authors should comment and discuss on this in the discussion.</p><p>We added the following sentence to the discussion, &#x0201c;Our finding of moderate VE against symptomatic infection that rapidly waned during Omicron is similar to findings from other studies showing moderate VE using ancestral monovalent vaccines against Omicron that decreased over time.&#x0201d; 1,2</p><p>1.

It addresses a critical public health question in a middle-income country context and fills a regional data gap. The study is timely, methodologically sound, and generally well-written, with appropriate use of statistical tools such as Cox proportional hazards modeling.</p><p>1. Waning Immunity Interpretation</p><p>&#x02022; The finding of VE rapidly waning within 60 days post-booster dose is striking and may suggest either a true biological decline or potential bias (e.g., higher exposure in boosted HCWs).</p><p>&#x02022; While the manuscript discusses this, a more detailed comparison with immunogenicity studies or observational findings from similar HCW cohorts (e.g., Andrews et al., 2022) would help contextualize the rapid waning.</p><p>2. Combining Vaccine Platforms</p><p>&#x02022; The study combines mRNA and inactivated vaccines (e.g., BNT162b2 and BBIBP-CorV) in the VE estimates, but these have distinct immunogenic profiles.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors do provide stratified estimates for BNT162b2, which is commendable. However, additional emphasis on this heterogeneity and implications for interpretation should be added to the discussion.</p><p>3. Selection Bias and Generalizability</p><p>&#x02022; The discussion notes potential selection bias due to voluntary participation, but does not provide a comparison to national-level HCW demographics. If such data is unavailable, state this explicitly.</p><p>&#x02022; Consider expanding the limitations to clarify how this might influence VE estimates, especially if HCWs in the study were more health-conscious or had differential testing behaviors.</p><p>4.Clarity of VE Estimates in Abstract</p><p>&#x02022; The abstract includes negative VE estimates, which may confuse non-expert readers. Consider clarifying that these negative values reflect non-significant findings with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes or waning protection.</p><p>5. Terminology Consistency</p><p>&#x02022; There was previously an inconsistency in naming BBIBP-CorV as BIBP-CorV. This appears to have been corrected, but a final proofread is advised.</p><p>6. Figure Integration</p><p>&#x02022; Figures and tables are informative but are not consistently discussed in the text. Specific references to Fig 4 and Table 2 within the results and discussion would improve clarity and reinforce interpretation.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
