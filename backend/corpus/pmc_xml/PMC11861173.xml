Introduction</title><p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the family <italic toggle="yes">Arteriviridae</italic> [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is the etiological agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and causes major economic losses to the swine industry worldwide due to reduced growth rates, elevated mortality, and increased secondary bacterial infections [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One study estimated the costs of PRRS to the swine industry in the United States at USD 663 million per year in 2013 [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. More recent studies have estimated this at USD 1.2 billion [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PRRS viruses are divided into two distinct species, Betaarterivirus suid 1 (PRRSV-1) and Betaarterivirus suid 2 (PRRSV-2) [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with the former originating from the former Eastern Europe and the latter originating from North America [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PRRS viruses have a high level of genetic diversity, and consequently, PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 are further categorized into four subtypes [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and 11 lineages [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], respectively, according to phylogenetic analysis of the ORF5 region. PRRSV-2 has a high level of genetic diversity, and lineage 1 has become the most prevalent and diverse lineage in Asia and the United States. In China, lineage 1 strains have become dominant [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], with NADC30-like strains being prominent [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Thailand, South Korea [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and Taiwan [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], lineage 1 strains have also been reported; however, lineage 3 isolates are predominant in Taiwan [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PRRSV-1 isolates have also been reported to circulate in Asia [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and it is likely that farms may be simultaneously infected with both virus species.</p><p>While PRRSV control at the local level relies on biosecurity [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], in high-pig-density regions, where the infection is enzootic, with frequent emergence of variant strains, the main tool available to producers to mitigate the economic losses induced by PRRSV is vaccination. In Asia, numerous PRRS modified-live vaccines (MLVs) are commercially available, which can be based on VR2332, R98, NEB-1, P129, CH-1R, HuN4-F112, or JXA1-P80 strains. Vaccine strains VR2332, CH-1R, and R98 are of lineage 5 [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; NEB-1 is of lineage 7 [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; and the others belong to lineage 8 [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several authors have advocated for MLV selection criteria based on an &#x0201c;as close as possible&#x0201d; approach, relying on genetic or antigenic matching of field strains with the vaccine strain to be chosen. In practical terms, this means selecting an MLV based on a strain belonging to the same lineage as that detected on the farm. However, infection at farm level with multiple strains makes this approach more and more difficult to implement, more so when co-infection with PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 strains is detected [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Generally, inactivated PRRS vaccines provide poor protection against both homologous and heterologous strains [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while modified-live vaccines can provide adequate protection in a homologous challenge.</p><p>The literature provides limited and sometimes conflicting information on cross-protection from existing MLV vaccines against heterologous NADC30 or NADC34 isolates. For instance, reports have shown that a VR2332-based MLV is able to induce cross-protection against a lineage 1 strain upon challenge [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while others have shown that VR2332-based vaccines provide limited cross-protection against lineage 1 strains [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Clear information on cross-protection is necessary for veterinarians to decide on PRRS control measures in the field. A new commercial lineage 7 MLV (PrimePac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PRRS, MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA) has recently become available in Taiwan. Both lineage 1 and lineage 3 are prevalent in Taiwan. To understand the cross-protection against lineage 1 strains, the present study was performed under both laboratory and field conditions in order to understand whether a commercial lineage 7 MLV would be able, through cross-protection, to reduce physiological and economic losses associated with field lineage 1 and lineage 3 strains from Taiwan.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00102"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>The animal experimental procedure was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Pingtung University of Science and Technology (NPUST) with approval number NPUST-111-070. The vaccine used was a commercially available lineage 7 MLV (PrimePac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PRRS, MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA, Batch Number A606CE05). It was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer and injected either via intradermal (ID) injection (each dose reconstituted to 0.2 mL with Diluvac Forte<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA), minimum 4.0 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub> per dose) using a purpose-built intradermal injector supplied by the vaccine manufacturer (IDAL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA) or via intramuscular (IM) injection (each dose reconstituted to 1 mL with Diluvac Forte<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA), minimum 4.0 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub> per dose).</p><sec id="sec2dot1-vaccines-13-00102"><title>2.1. In Study 1 (Laboratory Efficacy Trial)</title><p>Thirty 3-week-old PRRS antibody-negative conventional (high health) piglets were randomly allocated to one of the three following groups (10 piglets per group): i. intramuscular (IM) injection of a dose (1 mL) of a commercial lineage 7 MLV (PrimePac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PRRS, MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA) into the right side of the neck, ii. intradermal (ID) injection into the right side of the neck of a dose of the same vaccine (0.2 mL), or iii. IM injection of the vaccine diluent (1 mL) into the right side of the neck muscle. Vaccinated piglets were kept in the same facility; control (diluent-injected) piglets were housed in a separate facility. At 7 weeks of age (4 weeks after immunization), all groups were challenged with 2 mL of a 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL suspension of a Taiwanese PRRSV strain (lineage 1 NADC34-like strain, GenBank accession no. OM779010), with 1 mL via the nasal route and 1 mL via the IM route. All pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs. Control (challenged) pigs remained in a different facility from the other two groups. Two weeks after challenge (6 weeks post immunization), all pigs were humanely euthanized and necropsied (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>All pigs were individually weighed before immunization, before inoculation and before euthanasia, and the average daily weight gains were compared between groups (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). The rectal temperature of all pigs was measured before challenge, and daily after challenge. Mortality events and respiratory clinical symptoms were recorded on a daily basis. Respiratory clinical scoring was performed in compliance with the scoring previously described for PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 pathogenicity comparison [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, individual pigs were scored from 0 (no apparent clinical signs) to 6 (severe dyspnea/tachypnea at rest). Gross lung lesions were assessed in all pigs, using the method detailed in the same publication. The calculation used for lung lesion percentage is 100 &#x000d7; {(0.10 &#x000d7; left apical lobe) + (0.10 &#x000d7; left cardiac lobe) + (0.25 &#x000d7; left diaphragmatic lobe) + (0.10 &#x000d7; right apical lobe) + (0.10 &#x000d7; right cardiac lobe) lobe) + (0.25 &#x000d7; right diaphragmatic lobe) + (0.10 &#x000d7; middle lobe)}. Individual blood samples were taken from all pigs on the day of immunization, 2 weeks later, before challenge (4 weeks after immunization), and 3 days, 7 days, 10 days, and 14 days after the challenge. Sera were collected and frozen (&#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C) until they were processed. Once thawed, reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on the sampled sera, in compliance with the protocol detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Serum anti-PRRSV antibodies were detected using commercially available ELISA kits (PRRS X3<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ab Test, IDEXX, ME, USA). These kits allow for the determination of antibody titers. All sera were also processed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Briefly, MARC-145 cells were cultured in 96-well culture plates. First, they were inoculated with 100 TCID<sub>50</sub>/well of a PRRSV suspension. Sera were serially diluted with a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and then added to the cell plate wells. After induction for 1 h, wells were rinsed three times with PBS, then the FITC-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG antiserum was added. After 1 h incubation, the wells were rinsed three times with PBS, and residual fluorescence was measured under UV-light microscopy. Lung tissue and hilar lymph nodes were collected from all necropsied pigs. After homogenizing, genomic load was measured by RT-qPCR, also in compliance with a previously described method [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vaccines-13-00102"><title>2.2. In Study 2 (Laboratory Reversion to Virulence Trial)</title><p>Sixteen specific pathogen-free (SPF) piglets aged 3 to 5 weeks old, negative for PRRSV genome and antibodies, were used in pairs. The first pair was intranasally inoculated with 1 mL of 10 times the registered vaccine dose of the PRRS Nebraska MLV strain (10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL or more). The two piglets were sacrificed 14 days later, and 50 mL PBS were injected into the trachea; after flushing, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected (about 30 mL were recovered) and an aliquot was tested by RT-qPCR. Positive specimens were concentrated (centrifuged at 2000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C, after which the supernatant was removed and a bronchoalveolar lavage pellet was obtained) and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until further use. The pellet was thawed and dissolved in 3 mL PBS. PRRSV titer was determined by RT-qPCR, and the suspension was aliquoted for further passage in another SPF pair of piglets (four pairs in total). The fourth-passage pellet was similarly resuspended and inoculated into 8 SPF piglets, which were sacrificed 21 days later. Again, PRRSV was harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage. All piglets were monitored daily for clinical signs and mortality, and lung scoring was performed at necropsy. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were used for virus isolation and viral genome detection (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-13-00102"><title>2.3. In Study 3 (Field Efficacy Trial)</title><p>A PRRS-positive pig farm in Taiwan with a lineage 3 isolate was selected to conduct the field trial. Identification of the different PRRSV lineages was based on the complete open reading frame 5 sequences [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The farm selected was a single-site 1200-sow farrow-to-finish production farm located in the southern area of Taiwan. No PRRS vaccination was used on this farm at the time of the study. Three hundred 2-week-old piglets were randomly selected and divided into three groups of 100 piglets each and individually marked (ear tags) with different colors (one color per group). In the immunized groups, pigs were injected with the PrimePac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PRRS vaccine (MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA), (lineage 7) into the right neck muscle (1 mL) or intradermally (0.2 mL), with 100 pigs per group. In the control group, 100 pigs were sham-vaccinated (vaccine diluent, 1 mL via the IM route). All 300 piglets were comingled to avoid introducing a bias that might be associated with farm management; stockmen were blind to the allocation of the color of earmarks to the treatment group. Pigs were monitored daily for clinical symptoms and mortality until 12 weeks of age. Necropsy was performed on all dead animals. Blood samples were collected from 30 piglets per group before immunization (2 weeks of age) and then 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks later (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). The same RT-qPCR and ELISA techniques were used as mentioned in the efficacy trial section. All pigs were individually weighed at 2, 4, and 12 weeks of age (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Mortality rate, average daily gain (ADG), serum viremia, and ELISA titers were measured.

Tukey&#x02019;s test was used to conduct post hoc tests between the two groups in both the field trial and the laboratory efficacy study. Discrete variables (mortality rate, virus positivity rate, clinical respiratory symptom score, lung gross lesion score, and pig dysplasia rate) were analyzed by Chi-square test (pig stunting rate is defined as the proportion of pigs whose weight is below 75% of the average pig weight of the group).

Discussion</title><p>The on-farm PRRS disease situation in Asia is complex, often with multiple isolates present on farms [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vaccination is a commonly used strategy to mitigate the effects of PRRS infection on farms. Regulatory approval of new PRRS vaccines is a complex process that assesses safety and efficacy, often taking years before granting new vaccines commercial licenses [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Given the high mutation rate of the PRRS virus resulting in high variability and diversity, the availability of new commercial PRRS vaccines struggles to keep up with the strains of the day. It is therefore difficult for field veterinarians to find homologous commercially available MLV strains&#x02014;in particular, against the NADC30 or NADC34-like strains. Ideally, a PRRS MLV that exhibits cross-protection against heterologous strains will demonstrate efficacy by decreasing clinical symptoms such as viremia and lung lesions and hence improve production parameters such as average daily gain or mortality against a control group that has not received the vaccine [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the field, a common approach by veterinarians is to use existing commercial MLVs with matching genotype but different lineages to achieve cross-protection. It is hence necessary to investigate whether commercial modified-live vaccines can provide cross-protection against contemporary circulating PRRS strains of different lineages. When designing such studies, vaccines should be evaluated for both safety and efficacy under laboratory and field conditions. Safety is key when using PRRS modified-live vaccines, as recombination events have been detected between field and vaccine strains [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and even between MLV strains [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In terms of efficacy, vaccines may perform differently under laboratory and field conditions. The higher density of pigs in the field contributes to elevated disease pressure [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as to potential co-infection with other pathogens, such as <italic toggle="yes">G. parasuis</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">S. suis</italic>, a situation that is difficult to replicate under laboratory conditions [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is therefore important to evaluate vaccines in both the field and the laboratory to understand their efficacy. We therefore designed the present study to evaluate the safety and protection provided by this lineage 7 MLV under laboratory conditions against a lineage 1 strain and under field conditions against a lineage 3 strain.</p><p>From the vaccine safety perspective, the present trial confirmed that the PrimePac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PRRS MLV strain has minimal shedding when administered to pigs compared to another MLV strain [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Under both laboratory and field conditions, pigs vaccinated with PrimePac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PRRS did not exhibit hyperthermia or adverse reactions, also confirming the high safety level reported for NEB-1, including regarding limited secondary bacterial infection levels in vaccinated field piglets [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. No significant differences were observed in any of the measured outcomes between pigs vaccinated by the IM or the ID routes. These characteristics (limited shedding and very limited adverse reactions) should provide assurance to veterinarians.</p><p>From the vaccine efficacy perspective, the laboratory trial showed that vaccination induces a rise in specific anti-PRRSV antibodies and an immune protection that limits both clinical signs and viremia upon a heterologous challenge. However, ADG and microscopic lung lesion scores were not significantly different between groups under the good sanitary conditions of the experimental controlled environment (Study 1). In the field trial (Study 3), with a &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; challenge of the same vaccine by a lineage 3 strain, pig mortality rate, average daily weight gain, and pig stunting rate were significantly improved in the vaccinated (IM and ID) groups compared to the control group (vaccine diluent, IM). We believe that the difference in the latter outcomes, as compared to the laboratory trial, is likely due to the higher swine density and greater infectious pressure of secondary bacterial infections [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is further supported by our necropsy results on pigs that died of clinical respiratory disease in the field study. We found that most pigs necropsied were found to be co-infected with PRRS and secondary bacterial infections caused by <italic toggle="yes">M. hyorhinis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">G. parasuis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">S. suis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> sp., and/or <italic toggle="yes">P. multocida</italic>. Work by other authors supports that PRRSV infection alone may be mild, but clinical signs and impact on productivity can be greatly potentiated by secondary bacterial infections [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], coming together into porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). These observations also support the finding that a major impact of PRRS is the increased use of antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infection [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In terms of protection in the face of maternally derived antibodies (MDAs), our field study was controlled to ensure that all animals in the study had similar initial PRRS ELISA titers of an S/P ratio of 1.5 at the 2-week mark when they were vaccinated. Other studies have found that at levels between SP 1.5 and 2, the development of the antibody response was delayed or reduced [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Despite this potential interference by MDAs [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the pig mortality rate, average daily weight gain, and pig stunting rate in our study were significantly improved in the vaccinated (IM and ID) groups. This is potentially due to the protection still afforded by the vaccine due to cell-mediated immunity [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which is not impacted by MDAs. In the field, the nursery is the peak PRRS infection period, as piglets of different immune status are comingled. Hence, producers may still opt to vaccinate at the 2-weeks-of-age mark when piglets are still in the farrowing crates, MDA levels are high, and before the peak of infection in the nursery. Our study hence shows that there is still value in vaccinating in the face of medium to high maternal-derived antibodies in the field to reduce production losses due to PRRSV infection.</p><p>Pigs vaccinated by the ID route presented significantly lower average genomic PRRSV loads in the blood and hilar lymph nodes than those vaccinated via the IM route. They also developed consistently significantly higher ELISA antibody titers against PRRSV. The ID-vaccinated piglets also developed an earlier and more limited peak of infection upon heterologous challenge, in agreement with a similar observation by other authors [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The mechanism for this is supported by the work of multiple authors [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] where ID vaccination induced faster development of cell-mediated immunity compared to the IM route. An improved cell-mediated immune response has been demonstrated to reduce clinical symptoms in PRRSV-infected piglets and sows [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] through potentially faster clearance of viremia post infection. Our findings in the laboratory study where lung lesion scores could be measured found that ID-vaccinated pigs had significantly lower lung lesion scores compared to the control group, whereas the IM-vaccinated pigs did not reveal a significant difference, providing a clinical correlation and consequence of improved viremia control.</p><p>Despite these findings, in the laboratory and field studies, differences in immune outcomes between the IM and ID groups did not lead to overall differences in long-term production outcomes. This is explained by the lack of secondary bacterial infections potentiating PRRS infections [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] in the laboratory study, resulting in relatively similar outcomes between IM and ID outcomes. In the field study, it is possible that because pigs were co-mingled, differences between groups may not have been as evident. In a real field situation, all pigs would be vaccinated to a similar level and there would not be &#x0201c;seeder&#x0201d; or intentionally non-vaccinated animals present to artificially increase the infectious pressure on the farm. Future study designs will take this into account. Despite the lack of finding long-term production outcomes in our study, other studies have detailed additional benefits of ID vaccination, which include reduced stress and muscle damage&#x02014;ultimately contributing to improved animal welfare [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and reduced iatrogenic transmission of pathogens, and contributing to improved farm biosecurity [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The use of ID vaccination may thus provide other results for swine producers compared to the IM route.</p><p>In both the laboratory and the field trials, we acknowledge the limitation of the RT-qPCR of our laboratory not being able to distinguish between vaccine or field strains. Several authors have demonstrated a differential RT-qPCR method that would have been able to distinguish the viremia titer changes of PRRSV lineage 7 vaccine strain and PRRSV lineage 3 wild strain in the field study [<xref rid="B44-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, we were not able to identify authors who have carried out work to distinguish PRRSV lineage 7 vaccine strain or PRRSV lineage 1 strain in viremia. One possible confounding factor may hence be the possibility of vaccine virus causing disease in vaccinated animals. In our opinion, this is unlikely, as other authors [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] who have worked with this similar vaccine isolate have found that the viremia and shedding induced by the vaccine strain is low and short-lived compared to field strains. Our study findings also conclusively support this in Study 1 and Study 2. We found that vaccine virus administered alone exhibited a short shedding period, did not revert to virulence after passage, and did not cause clinical symptoms such as pyrexia or respiratory symptoms in the absence of viral challenge. Separately, in Study 3, given that only the vaccinated groups (ID and IM) demonstrated a reduction in mortality and stunting rate and that there was an increase in ADG despite viremia levels being statistically similar across all three groups, the lineage 7 vaccine virus strain provides clinical benefits and protection against lineage 3 isolates in the field without causing problems in itself.</p><p>Another limitation of our study was the lack of lung lesion evaluation in the three groups of pigs in the field study. In Taiwan, a majority of pigs are individually sold through a wholesale auctioning system in the slaughterhouse [<xref rid="B45-vaccines-13-00102" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This caused difficulties in tracing the groups to the slaughterhouse. We attempted to compensate for this by carrying out the lung lesion scoring in the laboratory study instead. Finally, farm management did not allow for tracing of the total volume of antibiotics used for treatment in the groups of pigs, which prevented the assessment of the economic value of vaccination in this context. These aspects will be added to the inclusion criteria for farms in further trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00102"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In the complicated context of PRRSV infection in Asia, where multiple NADC30- or NADC34-like (lineage 1) strains are co-circulating with other lineage strains (and sometimes with PRRSV-1 strains), science-based information on cross-protection provided by commercially available MLV strains is highly desirable from a prescriber point of view. The present studies demonstrated that the NEB-1 (lineage 7) strain, used in the PrimePac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PRRS MLV, is both stable and safe in pigs. The vaccine induces cross-protection in a heterologous challenge with field strains under both controlled (lineage 1) and field (lineage 3) conditions. In the latter trial, ID and IM routes of vaccination significantly improved production parameters such as mortality compared to the non-vaccinated group. ID-vaccinated pigs developed earlier infection control than the IM-vaccinated ones, but this did not result in a significant difference in performance between the two experimental groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all members of the Animal Disease Diagnostic Center of the National Pingtung University of Science and Technology for assisting with the diagnostic work.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
