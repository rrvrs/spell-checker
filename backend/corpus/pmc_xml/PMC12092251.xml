Here, using a multicohort approach, we investigated the associations of social disadvantage with age-related plasma proteins and age-related diseases. We found proteomic signatures of accelerated immune aging and 14 specific age-related proteins linked to social disadvantage during both early and later life. Individuals experiencing social disadvantage had an increased risk of 66 age-related diseases, with up to 39% of these associations mediated by the 14 age-related proteins (for example, DNAJB9, F2, HSPA1A, BGN). The main enriched pathway involved the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory regulator NF-&#x003ba;B24 and its downstream factor interleukin-8. Our findings support the hypothesis that social disadvantage throughout the life course may accelerate aging, a biological mechanism that could explain why social stratification plays such a fundamental role in determining human health.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Individuals with social disadvantage, during both early and later life, have an increased risk of 66 age-related diseases mediated by 14 age-related proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Risk factors</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland (Suomen Akatemia)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>350426</award-id><award-id>350426</award-id><award-id>350426</award-id><award-id>339568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kivim&#x000e4;ki</surname><given-names>Mika</given-names></name><name><surname>Pentti</surname><given-names>Jaana</given-names></name><name><surname>Nyberg</surname><given-names>Solja T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindbohm</surname><given-names>Joni V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Academy of Finland 350426</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust (Wellcome)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>221854/Z/20/Z</award-id><award-id>221854/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kivim&#x000e4;ki</surname><given-names>Mika</given-names></name><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust (Wellcome)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S011676, Y014154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kivim&#x000e4;ki</surname><given-names>Mika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute on Aging (U.S. National Institute on Aging)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG056477</award-id><award-id>R01AG056477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kivim&#x000e4;ki</surname><given-names>Mika</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh-Manoux</surname><given-names>Archana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>P&#x000e4;ivikki and Sakari Sohlberg foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature America, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par3">Most human health conditions are socially patterned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Such a breadth of health effects is rarely observed for a single risk factor, except age.

Many components of the immune system also deteriorate with age.

Notably, the same changes are characteristic of the effects of social disadvantage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, there is evidence linking social disadvantage to biological aging, as measured by epigenetic aging clocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">If social disadvantage accelerates the aging process, it should be linked to one or more of the nine original hallmarks of cellular aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These include four primary contributors to age-related cellular damage&#x02014;genomic instability (GI), telomere attrition (TA), epigenetic alterations (EA) and loss of proteostasis (LOP, the breakdown of the cellular mechanisms that regulate the proper synthesis, folding, trafficking and degradation of proteins). In addition, they comprise five compensatory or integrative hallmarks&#x02014;deregulated nutrient sensing (DNS), mitochondrial dysfunction (MD), cellular senescence (CS), altered intercellular communication (AIC) and stem cell exhaustion (SCE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Although not diseases themselves, these hallmarks contribute to age-related conditions, such as SCE increasing cardiovascular risk, CS heightening susceptibility to infections and GI being linked to cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">To better understand the links between social disadvantage and biological aging, we examined whether social disadvantage is associated with 83 age-related diseases (ARDs) and over 3,900 age-related circulating proteins, including those linked to accelerated organ-specific and organismal aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our findings support the concept that social disadvantage may accelerate age-related changes, aligning with the social causation hypothesis. While reverse causality&#x02014;in which ARDs contribute to social disadvantage&#x02014;and genetic predisposition influencing both the likelihood of social disadvantage and the development of ARDs were also observed, their roles appear more limited.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the study design.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Summary of study characteristics and analyses from the UK Biobank and the FPS. Indicators of social disadvantage were education and adulthood SES, measured by residential neighborhood deprivation and occupational position. In individuals with social disadvantage, a higher risk of ARDs was observed across all nine hallmarks of aging. This was evident for the onset of the first ARD, cumulative ARD burden and ARD multimorbidity. By contrast, there was limited evidence for the reverse direction of the relationship, in which ARDs lead to social disadvantage, or for genetic factors explaining the observed associations. <bold>b</bold>, The characteristics and analyses of the Whitehall study, including proteomic data, are summarized. With the exception of immune function and kidney aging, proteomic signatures of organ-specific aging were not strongly associated with social disadvantage. By contrast, of the 1,040 hallmark-related proteins associated with chronological age at proteome-wide significance, 14 were consistently linked to indicators of social disadvantage and hallmark-specific ARDs, partially mediating this association. Additional analyses supported the modifiability of these proteins in relation to changes in social disadvantage and a dose&#x02013;response association indicating accumulated risk. <bold>c</bold>, Characteristics and analyses of the two cohorts of the ARIC study, including data on 11 of the 14 proteins, are summarized. The associations between social disadvantage and protein levels replicated the findings from the Whitehall study. Similarly, the longitudinal associations between these proteins and all-cause mortality, with both 23-year and shorter 8-year follow-ups, were consistent with those observed in Whitehall.

Two large-scale studies, the UK Biobank and the Finnish Public Sector Study (FPS), were used to test the social causation hypothesis in relation to ARDs associated with hallmarks of aging (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). We tested the alternative health-related selection hypothesis using the FPS, with its repeated measures of social disadvantage, to examine whether ARDs increase the risk of social disadvantage. In addition, genetic data from the UK Biobank enabled an investigation into the genetic contributions to these associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To identify age-related protein mediators of the associations between social disadvantage and hallmark-specific ARDs, we used proteomic data from the UK Whitehall study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and replicated the main findings in the US Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, including both midlife and older-age cohorts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">In these four studies, social disadvantage was measured in both early and later life (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Education, typically spanning ages 5&#x02013;7 to ages 15&#x02013;25, was assessed in all cohorts as a marker of social standing in early life and across the life course.

To better understand the aging process in relation to social disadvantage, beyond its outcomes, we examined the association between social disadvantage and blood-based proteomic signatures of aging. Our rationale for these analyses is threefold. First, aging is associated with measurable changes in the plasma proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Circulating proteins regulate the aging process, while aging also modifies blood protein composition. Some proteins additionally serve as markers of aging, entering the plasma through leakage from damaged or dying cells. Second, ARDs and age-related proteins are empirically distinct constructs: the former are based on hospitalization diagnoses, and the latter on biomarker measurements, together providing a complementary assessment of aging from two independent information sources. Third, proteins reflect multiple age-related processes that precede ARDs. Analyzing them helps identify specific aging processes influenced by social disadvantage and the extent to which these processes mediate the associations of social disadvantage with individual aging outcomes.</p><p id="Par20">The Whitehall study is one of the few long-term prospective cohort studies that provide extensive data on indicators of social disadvantage, link participants to electronic health records for assessing hallmark-specific ARDs and store plasma samples for biomarker measurements collected between 1997 and 1999, coinciding with the assessment of social disadvantage. In addition, consistent with findings from the UK Biobank and FPS, education and adult SES (including neighborhood deprivation and occupational position) were associated with hallmark-specific ARDs in the 22-year follow-up of the Whitehall study (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">13</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">To analyze differences in age-related plasma proteins among 6,235 Whitehall participants with high and low levels of social disadvantage (mean age 56, 29% women), we assessed expression levels of up to 7,360 circulating proteins using the SomaLogic proteomic platform assays version 4.0 (<italic>n</italic> participants&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,213) and version 4.1 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,022).
