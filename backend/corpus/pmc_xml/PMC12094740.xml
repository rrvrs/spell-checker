</self-uri><abstract><p><italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> yeasts are commensals of human skin. In contrast to culture-based studies, metagenomic studies have detected abundant <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> reads in the gut, especially in patients living with HIV. Whether <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> colonizes and persists in the gut remains an open question. This study aimed to describe the influence of HIV-associated immunodeficiency on gut colonization by <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> and to assess whether <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> are alive. Stool samples were prospectively collected over one&#x02013;five visits from ten controls and 23 patients living with HIV (10 had CD4&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;200/mm<sup>3</sup> and 13 had CD4&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;500/mm<sup>3</sup>). Each sample was cultured and subjected to <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> viability PCR and both fungal and bacterial metabarcoding. Abundant <italic toggle="yes">M. furfur</italic> colonies were cultured from an HIV-immunocompromised patient. <italic toggle="yes">M. furfur</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">M. globosa</italic> were isolated in very low quantities from healthy volunteers. Viability <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic>-specific qPCR was positive in three HIV-immunocompromised patients. Metagenomic analyses showed that <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> reads were significantly more abundant in immunocompromised patients living with HIV and erratic over time in all participants. Our findings emphasise that <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> are rarely cultured from human stool samples, despite the use of specific culture media. Although HIV-related immunosuppression appears to be associated with the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic>, these yeasts do not persist and colonise the gut, even in immunocompromised patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

However, these yeast species are primarily involved in skin infections such as pityriasis versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In rare cases, they cause bloodstream infections, mainly in patients receiving lipid parenteral nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and are involved in cases of infectious endocarditis [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recent advances in sequencing technologies have provided new insights into the different niches of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> species. It appears that the distribution of these yeasts is not restricted to the skin, but is ubiquitous in the human body [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In many studies on gut mycobiota based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> has been found to be one of the most abundant and prevalent fungi in this biotope [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].The presence of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> yeasts in the digestive tract raises many questions regarding their physiological and fastidious nature. Some authors have suspected that the <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> DNA detected in the digestive tract is contaminated [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].This hypothesis seems to have been dismissed as the findings have been reproduced in many studies conducted in various laboratories worldwide. A metagenomic study based on the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) barcode in a large cohort of healthy volunteers detected <italic toggle="yes">M. restricta</italic> in 88% of 317 samples, and its presence was stable in 78% of 129 healthy volunteers over the course of approximately one year [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].These authors concluded that <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> is a resident commensal and a part of the human core gut mycobiome. In the context of human diseases, <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> has been shown to be associated with Crohn&#x02019;s disease and exacerbated inflammation in a mouse model [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].It has also been shown to be significantly more abundant in the digestive tract of patients with colorectal cancer [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]and accelerated pancreatic oncogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].A metagenomic study reported a significantly higher prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">M. restricta</italic> in 31 persons living with HIV (PLWH) than in 12 healthy volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].The authors advocate that further research should aim to understand whether <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen in the digestive tract of HIV-infected patients. Interestingly, most PLWH in this study had a low CD4 T cell count of&#x02009;~&#x02009;200 cells/mm3 [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].HIV infection triggers a massive depletion of CD4 T cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which is a major site of viral replication [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Another question concerns the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> yeasts detected in the gastrointestinal tract. The DNA-based methods used in the metagenomic studies cited above cannot distinguish between DNA originating from dead and living yeasts. Owing to their fastidious nature, <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> do not grow on traditional mycological media, and <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic>-specific culture media are rarely used in digestive mycobiota studies. Furthermore, a negative stool culture can result from several factors, and this finding does not indicate that the microorganism is alive in the gastrointestinal tract. Using complementary culture methods is key to answering the question of viability. Several methods have been used to study cell viability based on membrane integrity. Among them, Propidium MonoAzide (PMA), a DNA-chelating compound that cannot enter the membranes of living cells, has been widely used in a variety of biological samples, including stools [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].PMA is usually coupled with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or high-throughput sequencing to quantify the proportion of viable microorganisms within a sample [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].To the best of our knowledge, no study has used multiple approaches to determine the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> in the gastrointestinal tract. This study aimed to characterize and assess the influence of HIV infection and HIV-associated immunodeficiency on human gut <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> yeast communities and to assess whether the <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> DNA detected stems from living yeasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participant recruitment and sample collection</title><p>Patients in this study were informed of the study protocol and were included in the infectious diseases outpatient ward of the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e Infection (IHU-MI) at the La Timone University Hospital in Marseille, France. Between 08/11/2019 and 08/9/2021, 33 volunteers were included in the study, including 23 PLWH and ten healthy (not HIV-infected) controls. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age of at least 18 years and no history of systemic or local antifungal treatment in the last 30 days. In this longitudinal cohort study, five visits over a minimum period of one year were planned.

However, no study has investigated in depth the viability of the detected <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> yeasts and whether they colonize the digestive tract of IC PLWH in a stable manner. Using a <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic>-specific culture medium, we first isolated many <italic toggle="yes">M. furfur</italic> strains from one IC PLWH&#x02019;s stool. At Visit 4, we isolated one colony each of <italic toggle="yes">M. furfur</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">M. globosa</italic> from the stools of two distinct healthy controls. Data on the isolation of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> spp. from the gut are scarce in literature. To date, three studies have reported the isolation of <italic toggle="yes">M. globosa</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">M. restricta</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">M. pachydermatis</italic> from single stool samples of four distinct individuals [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].One strength of our study was the use of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic>-specific culture medium. Our findings suggest that cultivable <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> within the human gut is rare. When analysing the diversity of non-<italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> fungal species, we only isolated 13 taxa from healthy volunteers and 15 taxa from PLWH (<xref rid="pone.0322982.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). However, these taxa were isolated at a low frequency, and none were significantly associated with any of the groups of study participants. All participants shared a core mycobiome, with a dominance of <italic toggle="yes">G. candidum</italic> (49.4%) and <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> (32.2%). <italic toggle="yes">G. candidum</italic> is infrequently isolated in culture compared to <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> which is a human gut commensal and is frequently cultured [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].Most of the fungal species that we cultured have been reported to be isolated from human stool samples [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Using PMA-viability PCR, we amplified <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> DNA from three stool samples collected from IC PLWH. In two of them, PMA-viability PCR indicated the presence of non-living <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic>, even though <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia furfur</italic> was cultured from only one of these samples. In the third patient, although the culture was negative, PMA-viability PCR indicated the presence of living <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic>. The discrepancies between the PMA-viability PCR and culture results may be explained by the difficulties of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> culture and the fact that distinct subsamples of the stools were used for PCR or culture. PMA-PCR and culture methods have distinct analytical sensitivities. Additionally, culturable <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> spp. were present in relatively low abundance. Thus, we can hypothesize that their distribution within the sample was highly heterogeneous, and the probability of detecting <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> spp. in all sub-samples was low. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use PMA-viability PCR to assess the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> spp. detected in anatomical niches such as the digestive tract. PMA-viability PCR was used for various sample types [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].It has been used mainly in stool samples for the study of bacteria and cryptosporidia [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Only the Shannon diversity index with the ITS1 barcode differed significantly between PLWH and controls (<xref rid="pone.0322982.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The gut fungal community structures of non-immunosuppressed patients living with HIV and the controls were heterogeneous (<xref rid="pone.0322982.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). In particular, the <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> genus was highly abundant in IC PLWH (<xref rid="pone.0322982.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Consistent with the ITS metabarcoding results, abundant colonies of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> were cultured in 50% of our HIV-immunocompromised patients. A high abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> spp. in the gut of patients living with HIV has also been reported by Hamad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].However, the causes and clinical impact of this higher <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> spp. abundance in the gut of PLWH remain unknown. In line with Nash et al. [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we found that <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> were relatively stable in the gut, which suggests that these species belong to the human gut core mycobiome. While Nash et al. [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]reported similar findings regarding <italic toggle="yes">M. restricta</italic>, we observed a low prevalence of the <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> genus and erratic intra-individual dynamics of the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> reads, which both indicate that this genus does not belong to the human core mycobiome.</p><p>In this study, we found a high abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> spp. reads in the gut of PLWH (<xref rid="pone.0322982.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and we isolated abundant <italic toggle="yes">M. furfur</italic> colonies from one of the IC PLWH who also tested positive <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> by PCR. Our results suggest that further investigations are needed to understand the composition of the gut fungal community in PLWH. Notably, abundant <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> colonies were isolated from stool samples of one IC PLWH. Unfortunately, we had no follow-up samples because the patient died. Remarkably, our viability PCR results were positive only for IC PLWH. Untreated HIV infection is known to cause massive depletion of CD<sub>4</sub> T cells, and the digestive tract is one of the major sites of viral replication [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].Therefore, our results warrant further investigation to better understand the potential pathogenic role of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> in PLWH. Indeed, there is little clinical data on the effect of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> on the digestive tract, but a pathogenic role of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> in Crohn&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]and pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="pone.0322982.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]has been shown in mice.</p><p>Our study had several strengths. It analysed the dynamics of the gut <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> yeast community over time, something which has seldom been done, and metagenomic analysis provides insights into both fungal and bacterial gut communities associated with HIV infection. The main limitations of our study were the heterogeneity of the sample collection period, the follow-up visits of our participants, and the number of PLWH who were lost to follow-up. These minor deviations from the protocol were a consequence of the generalized disorganization of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another limitation was the relatively small sample size of our cohort owing to recruitment difficulties. Finally, many fungal and bacterial sequences were not well identified owing to the incompleteness of the fungal nucleotide databases currently available.</p><p>In conclusion, both our culture and PCR findings indicate that live <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> yeasts are infrequent in the human digestive tract and that HIV-related immunosuppression is likely to promote the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Malassezia</italic> spp. in the human gut.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Thanks for invitation. The authors showed a correlation between Malassezia and HIV. The manuscript was written well.</p><p>But I have some concerns.</p><p>1. In this study, were the main covariates for group comparisons limited to HIV status and absolute CD4 count, or were other common factors that could affect microbiota outcomes, such as age and diet, also adjusted for?</p><p>2. The authors analyzed both bacterial and fungal communities. Could the results be interpreted together rather than separately? I believe that, regardless of causality, there would be interactive effects between the two.</p><p>3. As the authors mentioned in the limitations, this is merely a descriptive study without any associated clinical outcomes, let alone the references to conditions like Crohn's disease (CD) mentioned in the paper. This is the study's biggest limitation.</p><p>4. As a clinician, I find that such descriptions offer very limited help for clinical practice. I am not very familiar with the French healthcare system. Is it possible to trace the gastrointestinal conditions of these patients, such as unformed stools or other related issues?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The manuscript titled &#x0201c;Do Malassezia yeasts colonize the guts of people living with HIV?&#x0201d; from St&#x000e9;phane Ranque&#x02019;s laboratory presents analyses of stool samples collected from a longitudinal cohort. The study aims to compare the effects of HIV infection on Malassezia in human gut using conventional culture methods, metagenomics and PMA-qPCR. While the data presented are limited due to the small sample size, they are intriguing and could serve as a foundation for further research on this topic. However, I recommend the authors significantly improve the way they present the data before publication.</p><p>Major points: The primary issue lies in the presentation of the data, which is not easy to follow. Here, I will highlight some points that the authors may consider for improvement:</p><p>1. Title: While I like the title, I think that the manuscript did not fully address the question it poses. Since the data is not strong enough to provide a definitive answer, I suggest slightly modifying the title to better align with the study's findings.</p><p>2. Abstract: The authors may need to reorganize the abstract. It should be concise, with fewer methodological details and a stronger focus on the findings and conclusions. Readers will likely expect a more engaging abstract based on the manuscript&#x02019;s title. As it stands, I lost motivation because the abstract does not clearly address the question posed in the title.</p><p>3. Main results: This section faces similar issues as the abstract. For each subsection, it would be more effective to present the key findings in the subsection titles rather than describing the results as if outlining research steps. Readers are more interested in what the data tells, not just what the data is or what the authors did. Due to this presentation style, the primary focus on Malassezia is not clearly emphasized.</p><p>4. Figure 1: Author could include a cartoon or schematic to illustrate your sample collection and patient information. This will give the audience an overview of the patient samples, including how many were used for culture, sequencing, how many patients completed the full study, and how many dropped out.</p><p>In Figure 1A, it would be helpful to include the number of positive cultures for each species. Additionally, labeling "Visit 1" and "All visits" more clearly in Figures 1A and 1B would improve clarity.</p><p>The font styles and sizes are inconsistent across the figures. Please use a consistent Sans-serif font, and increase the font size to improve visibility.</p><p>There are many following figures based on only &#x0201c;Visit 1&#x0201d;. Authors can consider collecting them together in a big figure or indicate &#x0201c;Visit 1 analysis&#x02026;&#x0201d; directly on these figures that would be easier to understand.</p><p>5. Figure S1: author may replace this figure with a table or bar plots showing the Ct values. The current figure is difficult to interpret due to the colors and lines, and it doesn&#x02019;t provide much information. A table or bar plots would make it easier for readers to compare the data. The figure primarily needs to indicate which samples are PCR-positive (+) and which are negative (-). The current presentation is unnecessarily complex and takes too much time for readers to grasp the simple results.</p><p>6. Figure 2: Although Figure 2B shows two significant comparisons, the Shannon diversity analysis may be biased due to the small sample size. Therefore, the figure essentially indicates no significant difference between the samples. The title of the figure should reflect this main result. Additionally, "Visit 1" should be indicated earlier in the title or directly on the graph for better clarity and understanding.</p><p>7. Figure 4: The font size is too small and needs to be increased for better readability. Additionally, the organization of this figure could be improved. I suggest arranging the x-axis based on health conditions, from healthy to severe disease. This would make it easier to compare how the microbiome changes across different health conditions.</p><p>8. Table 2: The table lacks meaningful impact unless the authors consider how many samples are positive and the variability of read counts between samples.</p><p>9. Overall, there are so many descriptions, statistical number (percentage) that describe in the main text, however, lack of conclusion from each section and even each paragraph make the manuscript very hard to follow. I could not really catch the main finding of each section. Notably, the focus in this manuscript should be answering &#x0201c;Do Malassezia colonies the guts of HIV patients?&#x0201d; which are blurry because of many details and descriptions about statistical numbers of microbiome.</p><p>Therefore, while the data is valuable, the authors need to better organize the manuscript and focus on presenting the findings rather than just describing the data. Detailed descriptions should primarily be presented in the Figures and Tables, while the Results section should briefly summarize, analyze, and provide clear conclusions.

However, it is not written in a way that depicts its significance from the referees' report.</p><p>Please provide additional clinical data if possible on these HIV patients and to improve the logic and writings.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this interesting suggestion. However, our study design was based on the comparison of 'healthy' controls and people living with HIV, among whom we distinguished between immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised on the basis of CD4 cell count. The characteristics of these participants are detailed in Table 1. We have described in the manuscript the clinical condition of the patient from whose stool we isolated numerous Malassezia furfur colonies. Otherwise, the results were too heterogeneous to analyse all patient characteristics.</p><p>Comments to the Author</p><p>Reviewer #1: Thanks for invitation. The authors showed a correlation between Malassezia and HIV. The manuscript was written well.</p><p>But I have some concerns.</p><p>1. In this study, were the main covariates for group comparisons limited to HIV status and absolute CD4 count, or were other common factors that could affect microbiota outcomes, such as age and diet, also adjusted for?</p><p>Response: We agree that many factors, including age and diet, affect the microbiome. However, our sample size was relatively small and we lacked the statistical power to account for the effect of multiple covariates.</p><p>2. The authors analyzed both bacterial and fungal communities. Could the results be interpreted together rather than separately? I believe that, regardless of causality, there would be interactive effects between the two.</p><p>Response: This suggestion runs counter to the reviewer&#x02019;s recommendations for simplifying the manuscript.</p><p>3. As the authors mentioned in the limitations, this is merely a descriptive study without any associated clinical outcomes, let alone the references to conditions like Crohn's disease (CD) mentioned in the paper. This is the study's biggest limitation.</p><p>Response: We agree that our study is a descriptive study and by design we did not investigate clinical outcomes. However, in the Introduction and Discussion sections, we mentioned data from experimental studies, mainly in mice, suggesting a potential pathogenic effect of Malassezia in Crohn's disease to rationalise our approach, which included isolation of Malassezia from stool samples. This in particular was a real mycological challenge as we had to develop a specific culture medium.</p><p>4. As a clinician, I find that such descriptions offer very limited help for clinical practice. I am not very familiar with the French healthcare system. Is it possible to trace the gastrointestinal conditions of these patients, such as unformed stools or other related issues?</p><p>Response: we agree that this is a preliminary study, which cannot aim to help the clinical practice.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript titled &#x0201c;Do Malassezia yeasts colonize the guts of people living with HIV?&#x0201d; from St&#x000e9;phane Ranque&#x02019;s laboratory presents analyses of stool samples collected from a longitudinal cohort.

Abstract: The authors may need to reorganize the abstract. It should be concise, with fewer methodological details and a stronger focus on the findings and conclusions. Readers will likely expect a more engaging abstract based on the manuscript&#x02019;s title.

Figure 1: Author could include a cartoon or schematic to illustrate your sample collection and patient information. This will give the audience an overview of the patient samples, including how many were used for culture, sequencing, how many patients completed the full study, and how many dropped out.</p><p>Response: We agree that a schematic illustrating sample collection and study flow would be helpful. However, due to the general disorganisation of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, minor protocol deviations make it difficult to draw a clear and simple scheme, and we would be reluctant to do so.</p><p>In Figure 1A, it would be helpful to include the number of positive cultures for each species. Additionally, labeling "Visit 1" and "All visits" more clearly in Figures 1A and 1B would improve clarity.</p><p>The font styles and sizes are inconsistent across the figures. Please use a consistent Sans-serif font, and increase the font size to improve visibility.</p><p>Response: The figure has been modified in accordance with the reviewers' comments.</p><p>There are many following figures based on only &#x0201c;Visit 1&#x0201d;. Authors can consider collecting them together in a big figure or indicate &#x0201c;Visit 1 analysis&#x02026;&#x0201d; directly on these figures that would be easier to understand.</p><p>Response: For clarification, &#x0201c;Visit 1&#x0201d; has been added to each relevant Figure caption.</p><p>5. Figure S1: author may replace this figure with a table or bar plots showing the Ct values. The current figure is difficult to interpret due to the colors and lines, and it doesn&#x02019;t provide much information. A table or bar plots would make it easier for readers to compare the data. The figure primarily needs to indicate which samples are PCR-positive (+) and which are negative (-). The current presentation is unnecessarily complex and takes too much time for readers to grasp the simple results.</p><p>Response: We agree that this figure is complex, which is why we have chosen to position it as a supplementary figure. However, we do not want to oversimplify our data by summarising it as positive or negative results in a table.</p><p>6. Figure 2: Although Figure 2B shows two significant comparisons, the Shannon diversity analysis may be biased due to the small sample size. Therefore, the figure essentially indicates no significant difference between the samples. The title of the figure should reflect this main result. Additionally, "Visit 1" should be indicated earlier in the title or directly on the graph for better clarity and understanding.</p><p>Response: We agree that the small sample size results in too little power to detect a statistically significant difference. However, we are required to present the results of our statistical tests, although we acknowledge this limitation in the discussion section.</p><p>7. Figure 4: The font size is too small and needs to be increased for better readability. Additionally, the organization of this figure could be improved. I suggest arranging the x-axis based on health conditions, from healthy to severe disease.

Table 2: The table lacks meaningful impact unless the authors consider how many samples are positive and the variability of read counts between samples.</p><p>Response: There is a striking difference between the relative numbers in PLWH and controls, despite the variability in Malassezia sp. read counts.</p><p>9. Overall, there are so many descriptions, statistical number (percentage) that describe in the main text, however, lack of conclusion from each section and even each paragraph make the manuscript very hard to follow.

However, this study has generated a lot of data that cannot be found elsewhere. For this reason, we would like to present a detailed summary of our findings. We recognise that this will make the paper more difficult to read, but we think that some of these details may be of interest to the reader.</p><p>Therefore, while the data is valuable, the authors need to better organize the manuscript and focus on presenting the findings rather than just describing the data.
