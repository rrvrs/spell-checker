However, whether S100A8 promotes the proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer (BC) is still not completely clear. To investigate the influence of S100A8 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of BC.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, genes related to the grading, staging, proliferation, migration and invasion of BC were screened, and S100A8 was selected as the target gene for further studies. Immunohistochemical staining were employed to examine the protein expression levels of S100A8 on adjacent tissues and BC tissues. The gene expression level of S100A8 in Pan cancer cell lines was analyzed through the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database, and the HT-1376 cell line was selected for subsequent experiments. Overexpression recombinant lentivirus and short hairpin RNA-encoding lentivirus were used to overexpress and knock down S100A8 in HT-1376 cells via infection. The mRNA and protein expression levels of S100A8 were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. The proliferation of BC cells was analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays. The Wound&#x02011;healing assay and Transwell assay were used to estimate the migration and invasion of BC cells.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The results demonstrated that S100A8 was highly expressed in BC based on the GEO and TCGA databases. In addition, compared with those of HT-1376 cells and the negative control group, the proliferation, migration and invasion of S100A8-overexpressing HT-1376 cells were enhanced, while those of S100A8-knockdown HT-1376 cells were reduced. Furthermore, S100A8 was differentially expressed in non-muscle invasive BC and muscle invasive BC, and in low- and high-grade BC.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this study, the bioinformatics and in vitro experiments revealed that S100A8 could promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. Consequently, S1008A emerges as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for BC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>S100 calcium-binding A8</kwd><kwd>bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bladder cancer (BC) is a widespread neoplastic disease, mainly originating from the bladder lining, with ~75% arising from the urothelium, presenting as pure urothelial carcinoma, and histological variations accounting for the remaining 25% <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In 2020, there were 523,278 new cases and 212,536 deaths worldwide <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The prevalence and mortality rates in men are 3-4 times those in women, and both morbidity and mortality of BC are second only to prostate cancer among urinary system tumors <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. An estimated 92,900 new cases and 41,400 deaths occurred in China in 2022. Among the new cases, 73,200 were diagnosed in men and 19,700 were diagnosed in women. In addition, there were 32,500 deaths in men and 8,800 deaths in women <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. BC ranks eighth in terms of both age-standardized incidence rate and age-standardized mortality rate <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. BC can be classified as both high- and low-grade cancer, and can also be divided into muscle invasive BC (MIBC) and non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. NMIBC accounts for ~75% of new-onset BC cases <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Patients with NMIBC have a longer survival period and a lower risk of tumor-specific death than those with MIBC <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Compared with low-grade cancer, high-grade cancer is more likely to invade the muscularis and is associated with a higher mortality rate <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. However, NIMBC has a 70% recurrence rate and 30% of NMIBC can progress to muscle-invasive disease after initial treatment. Recurrence and progression to high-grade cancer may lead to poor prognosis <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and good prognosis of patients <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The gold standard for the positive diagnosis of BC is cystoscopy, but its invasiveness hinders its early use and non-invasive diagnostic markers are required <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Urine cytology is the most cost-effective urine-based method for the diagnosis of high-grade BC <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Notably, the sensitivity of any cytological classification method for low-grade BC is lower than that for high-grade BC due to the closer similarity between low-grade lesions and normal cellular morphology <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. In the past, much effort has been invested in developing protein- and molecule-based urine tests to diagnose BC, such as bladder tumor antigen and urine nuclear matrix protein 22 tests <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Although a number of these tests are more sensitive than urine cytology in detecting BC, they are usually limited by lower specificity, false-positive results and better utility in high-grade lesions <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Although transurethral resection of bladder tumor is the standard of care for the treatment of NMIBC, it is a major surgery requiring formal anesthesia, which could be a burden for patients with recurring diseases <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Immunotherapy has been applied to patients with bladder cancer in the form of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), which is still the first-line treatment for non-muscle invasive disease <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. However, the remarkable results achieved with checkpoint inhibitor drugs, including pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, have driven the exploration of optimizing these and other forms of non-muscle invasive and advanced bladder cancer immunotherapy <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Radical cystectomy is a standard of care in localized MIBC <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. To sum up, it is vital to find a valid biomarker to predict the staging, grading, diagnosis and prognosis of BC.</p><p>In 1956, S100 family proteins were found in the brain, and were referred to as S100 proteins because they are soluble in 100% ammonium sulfate at neutral pH <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. One of these is S100 calcium-binding A8 [S100A8; also called myeloid-related protein (MRP)-8 or calgranulin-A], which binds to S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9; also called MRP-14 or calgranulin-B) to form polymers, which serve a role in inflammation and cancer <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. S100A8/A9 promotes inflammatory responses to protect the body from pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. For example, after being released at the site of infection, it induces a host defense function locally and exhibits a wide range of antifungal and antibacterial potential <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The expression of S100A8 and S100A9 is tissue- and cell-specific and is changeably enhanced in various cancer types and inflammation-related diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that S100A8 and S100A9 can stimulate the proliferation, migration and invasion of most cancer types <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. For instance, S100A8 activates the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, and then blocks BC cell apoptosis <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. S100A8 can activate the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, which upregulates VEGF expression, and thus, leads to the invasion and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma cells <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. In addition, S100A8/A9 may also participate in the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>.</p><p>However, whether S100A8 promotes the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC is still not completely clear. Therefore, the present study explored the proliferation, invasion and migration of S100A8 in bladder cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Public data access</title><p>All public bioinformatics data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes were screened from the GEO database, in which the keyword were bladder cancer. Finally, three groups (GSE13507, GSE31684 and GSE120736) were selected, which can simultaneously meet the requirements of grouping MIBC and NMIBC, low-grade and high-grade bladder cancer, and were used for subsequent screening and analysis of candidate differential genes. Next, the intersection of expressed genes with significant differences was analyzed. In addition, The R software package TCGAbiolinks version 2.21.1 was used to capture the transcripts per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (TPM) of the TCGA-BLCA dataset in real time to screen for superficial BC transitional cell carcinoma of bladder, the invasion of bladder cancer or not, the stage of BC and so on. Next, the R language was used to batch calculate the S100A8 gene, calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient between S100A8 and all mRNA genes, and sort all gene correlation coefficients of S100A8 gene from high to low. Finally, the Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) model of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways was constructed by using the R software package clusterProfiler version 4.11.0. GSEA of S100A8 was performed by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from the BC dataset in TCGA.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>The SV-HUC-1 normal urothelial cell line (Procell Life Science &#x00026; Technology Co., Ltd.) and the HT-1376 BC cell line (Annoron Life Science &#x00026; Technology Co., Ltd.) were used in the present study.

Patients were included when: i) they had primary BC, excluding recurrence cases; ii) they did not receive radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other neoadjuvant treatment; iii) their diagnoses were confirmed by professional pathologists according to the BC histopathological diagnostic criteria; and iv) had no history of other malignant tumors. A total of 46 patients were included, including 6 female and 40 male patients. Among them, 28 were above 60 years old and 18 were below 60 years old. The diagnosis of patients indicated 25 cases of low-grade BC and 21 cases of high-grade BC. According to another staging method, patients were also divided into 26 NMIBC cases and 20 MIBC cases. The present study was conducted with approval from the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University (ethics committee approval no. KJ2021-277-01; Shihezi, China).

The paraffin sections containing pathological tissues were dried in an oven at 65&#x002da;C for 40 min, and were subsequently dewaxed with xylene and descending gradient ethanol. The tissue sections were microwaved in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0; Wuhan Servicebio Science &#x00026; Technology Co., Ltd.) at 95&#x002da;C for 10 min. After antigen retrieval was completed, the sections were cooled in citrate buffer at room temperature for 20 min. The endogenous peroxidase activity was then inactivated by 3% hydrooxidase (Shandong Anjie high tech Technology Co., Ltd) at room temperature for 20 min. Next, the tissues were covered with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) dropwise and blocked for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x002da;C with primary antibodies, namely rabbit anti-S100A8 antibody (1:1,000; Abcam; no. ab288715).

Differences in S100A8 gene expression between adjacent noncancerous tissues and cancer tissues were examined using a paired t&#x02011;test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Results based on the bioinformatics prediction</title><p>To clarify S100A8 expression in BC, MIBC was compared with NMIBC, and high-grade BC was compared with low-grade BC in three BC datasets from the GEO database (GSE13507, GSE31684 and GSE120736). Next, the intersection of expressed genes with significant differences was analyzed. Finally, 16 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified: ANXA10, ST3GAL5, TMPRSS4, CYP3A5, SLC14A1, BTBD16, SPOCD1, CDC42EP5, BCAS1, VSIG2, CAPNS2, FAM3D, HSD17B2, S100A8, CDCA5 and FAM83D. Among them, S100A8, CDCA5 and FAM83D were significantly upregulated, and the remaining genes were significantly downregulated (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and B). The PrognoScan tool was used to perform a meta-analysis of the prognostic value of the sur vival data in the GSE13507 dataset for the overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) of candidate genes in BC. The results showed that the high expression of S100A8 and CDCA5 in bladder cancer was associated with DSS Significantly correlated with poor prognosis of OS (<italic>HR</italic> &#x0003e;1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0. 05, Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This study will focus on the sub gene S100A8, and other up-regulated and down-regulated genes are also sub genes of this study, which will be the content of subsequent research.</p></sec><sec><title>S100A8 expression in a public BC database and the local cohort</title><p>To evaluate the effect of S100A8 on the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC, the GSE13507 dataset from the GEO database was analyzed and further grouped based on muscle layer invasion, and high and low grades. The results indicated that S100A8 gene expression was significantly higher in MIBC than in NMIBC, and its gene expression was significantly higher in high-grade BC. The survival analysis results implied that the high S100A8 expression group had a lower overall survival and cancer-specific survival than the low S100A8 expression group (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). To further evaluate whether the S100A8 gene has a promoting effect on BC, GSEA of S100A8 was performed by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from the BC dataset in TCGA. The analysis results demonstrated that S100A8 was significantly positively associated with multiple types of BC, such as stage IV BC and MIBC, suggesting that the S100A8 gene may be involved in the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In addition, paraffin sections of BC tissues and adjacent tissues were collected from 46 patients with BC. The clinicopathological data of 46 patients are shown in Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Next, S100A8 protein expression in BC tissues and adjacent tissues was examined using Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results revealed high staining scores of the S100A8 protein in BC tissues compared with adjacent tissues (P&#x0003c;0.0001; Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Subsequently, pathological BC tumor tissue specimens were analyzed and further grouped based on muscle layer invasion, and high and low grades. The IHC results showed that the staining scores of the S100A8 protein in the high-grade BC group were higher than those in the low-grade group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01; Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). The staining scores of the S100A8 protein were higher in the MIBC group compared with the NMIBC group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.0001; Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). These results are similar to those obtained from the geo database. In order to screen better BC cell lines for subsequent studies, we analyzed the gene expression level of S100A8 in BC cell lines through Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database, and the results showed that the S100A8 expression of bladder cancer cell line HT-1376 was high (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F). Then, the differential expression of S100A8 in the HT-1376 BC cell line and the SV-HUC-1 normal urothelial cell line was verified using Western blot (WB) and Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at the cellular level. The results revealed high S100A8 protein and mRNA expression in HT-1376 cells compared with SV-HUC-1 cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001; Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G). These results indicated that S100A8 was highly expressed in BC and was positively associated with tumor stage and grade.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of S100A8 on viability in BC cells</title><p>To further determine the role of S100A8 in cell proliferation, migration and invasion, S100A8 was overexpressed and knocked down in HT-1376 cells via infection with overexpression recombinant lentivirus (OE group) and shRNA&#x02011;encoding lentivirus with two sequences (KD-1 and KD-2 group), respectively. In addition, HT-1376 cells were also infected with a negative control lentivirus as a negative control group (NC group). WB and RT-qPCR were used to verify the infection efficacy. High S100A8 mRNA and protein expression was observed in the OE group compared with the HT-1376 group and NC group (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The additional results revealed lower S100A8 mRNA and protein expression in both the KD-1 group and the KD-2 group compared with the HT-1376 group and NC group (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), and the knockdown infection efficiency in the KD-1 group was stronger than that in the KD-2 group. Thus, cells from the KD-1 group were used for subsequent experiments. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine <bold>(</bold>EdU) assays were performed in HT-1376 cells after S100A8 was knocked down or overexpressed. Downregulation of S100A8 inhibited the viability of BC cells (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and E), while overexpression of S100A8 promoted the viability compared with that in the uninfected HT-1376 group and NC group (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D and F). These results suggested that S100A8 promoted the viability and proliferation of BC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of S100A8 on migration and invasion in BC cells</title><p>It was ascertained whether the change in S100A8 expression affected the migration and invasion of BC cells. Wound healing assays were used for cell migration assessment. The results indicated that the migratory ability of HT-1376 cells was inhibited due to S100A8-knockdown, while the migration of HT-1376 cells was promoted after the transfection of S100A8-overpression (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and B). Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed in HT-1376 cells after S100A8 was knocked down or overexpressed. Downregulation of S100A8 led to reduced migration, while overexpression of S100A8 promoted migration compared with that of the HT-1376 group and NC group (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Consistent with these findings, compared with that of the HT-1376 group and NC group, the invasion of S100A8-overexpressing HT-1376 cells were enhanced, while that of S100A8-knockdown HT-1376 cells were reduced (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). Thus, the present study suggested that S100A8 might promote the migration and invasion of BC cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>BC is a frequent malignancy of the urinary system, and early diagnosis is vital for effective treatment and patient prognosis <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The effect of S100A8 on the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of BC has not been fully clarified. The present study demonstrated that S100A8 promoted BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.</p><p>A related study has found that S100A8 and S100A9 expression is increased in gastric, lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer and adenocarcinoma <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. In addition, S100A8 and S100A9 expression is downregulated in some epithelial-derived tumors, such as esophageal, uterine, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. A previous study has shown that S100A8 and S100A9 are BC-related proteins <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>.

Using magnetic bead enrichment, ion trap tandem mass spectrometry and IHC analysis of 12 invasive BC tissue biopsies and normal bladder tissue from the same patient, Tolson <italic>et al.</italic> reported high S100A8 expression in tumor cells in 50% of the samples compared with that in normal urothelial cells <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. Nicklas <italic>et al.</italic> used tissue chip technology and IHC to evaluate S100A8 protein expression <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. The authors used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis to determine whether S100A8 expression was associated with recurrence-free, progression-free or cancer-specific survival. Their results revealed high S100A8 expression in NMIBC.</p><p>Therefore, S100A8 is a potential marker to identify patients at high risk of NMIBC recurrence and progression <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. These findings are consistent with the results of the present study. In the present study, MIBC was compared with NMIBC, and high-grade BC was compared with low-grade BC using the GEO database. The results demonstrated that S100A8 expression was significantly higher in MIBC than in NMIBC, and S100A8 expression was significantly higher in high-grade BC. The survival analysis results indicated lower overall and cancer-free survival in the high S100A8 expression group than the low S100A8 expression group. Next, GSEA of S100A8 was performed by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from the BC dataset in TCGA. The analysis revealed a significant positive association with multiple types of BC, such as stage IV and invasive BCs, suggesting that the S100A8 gene may be involved in the proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder urothelial cancer.</p><p>The present study confirmed through IHC that S100A8 protein expression was higher in BC tissues compared with adjacent tissues, higher in MIBC tissues compared with NMIBC tissues, and higher in high-grade BC tissues compared with low-grade BC tissues. Additionally, the present study confirmed by WB and RT-qPCR that the expression levels of both S100A8 protein and mRNA in BC cells were higher than those in normal urothelial cells, indicating that S100A8 expression was increased in BC cells.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that S100A8/A9 can stimulate the proliferation, migration and invasion of most cancer types. For example, Liu <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that S100A9 promoted the phosphorylation of JNK, P38 and ERK1/2, regulating the progression, migration, invasion and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> reported that S100A9 upregulated the phosphorylation of two important molecules, P60 and P65, in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, promoting hepatocellular carcinoma progression <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Lv <italic>et al.</italic> indicated that S100A9 binds to TLR4, activating the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway to stimulate tumor cells to secrete fibronectin, and subsequently activating integrin &#x003b2;1-focal adhesion kinase, which is involved in prostate cancer cell invasion <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. Pan <italic>et al.</italic> revealed that, in cholangiocarcinoma cells, S100A8 upregulated VEGF expression through the TLR4-NF-&#x003ba;B pathway to promote the invasion and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma cells <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. These findings are similar to the results of the present study.</p><p>The innovation of this study is to use the CCLE database to screen suitable bladder cancer cells, namely HT-1376. HT-1376 cells have higher S100A8 expression, which can better perform lentiviral knockdown and overexpression operations, and the results are more reliable. In the present study, S100A8 was overexpressed and knocked down by overexpression lentivirus and shRNA lentivirus infection of HT-1376 cells, respectively, and the infection efficiency was verified using WB and RT-qPCR. Subsequently, the effect of knockdown and overexpression on HT-1376 cell proliferation was examined using CCK-8 and EdU proliferation assays, and the effect of knockdown on HT-1376 cell invasion and migration was determined. These results demonstrated that S100A8 promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that S100A8 promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells, and was highly expressed in BC. Furthermore, it was differentially expressed in NMIBC and MIBC and in high-grade and low-grade BC. Therefore, S100A8 can act as a potential biomarker for BC and enable improved diagnosis, grading and prognosis of BC. The present study explored the role of S100A8 in BC at the tissue and cellular levels; however, its role in living animals remains unclear. In subsequent studies, HT-1376 cells with overexpression and knockdown of S100A8 should be developed and injected into nude mice. Thereafter, the difference in tumor volumes in nude mice in each group should be compared. It should further be elucidated whether S100A8 can promote the development of BC <italic>in vivo</italic> to provide novel potential targets for the diagnosis and prognosis of BC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by the Scientific research department of the Shihezi University (grant nos.
