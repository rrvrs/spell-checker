Primary outcome was LBP intensity; secondary outcomes included LBP duration and work limitations as well as intensity, duration and work limitations of neck/shoulder pain, stress, productivity, influence at work, meaning at work, sickness absence, interpersonal collaboration, and variation in physical behaviour. Home health care (HHC) workers in the self-governing teams were surveyed about their appraisal of the self-governing structure.

The increasing healthcare needs predict a future high demand for home health care (HHC) workers. Recruitment of HHC-workers has proven to be difficult (Danish Agency for Labour Marked and Recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>), indicating that initiatives that make work more healthy and sustainable for HHC-workers are essential to improving workforce retention and potentially recruitment over time (OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">HHC-workers find their work to be physically demanding and exhausting (Albanesi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2022</xref>; Delp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Grasmo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>; Merkus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>), they experience a high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain (Andersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Rasmussen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2019</xref>) and a diminished health status (Jensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>). The combination of these aspects may explain the high rates of sickness absence and early retirement among HHC-workers (Andersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). Until now, several workplace health initiatives have fallen short in effectively addressing work-related musculoskeletal pain among HHC-workers (Albanesi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2022</xref>; Freiberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The current structure in Danish HHC utilize a designated scheduling coordinator who is typically responsible for managing the distribution of citizens among HHC-workers. To the best of their abilities, the scheduling coordinator tries to consider a multitude of factors such as the relationship between HHC-workers and citizens, time-sensitive appointments, and daily changes arising from the evolving care situations of the citizens (Ramb&#x000f8;ll <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). This conventional approach might not be the best at distributing the workload as indicated by a study conducted in Norway, which objectively measured physical work demands in 13 HHC-units, showing an uneven distribution of work tasks among the HHC-workers (Tj&#x000f8;svoll et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2022</xref>). Furthermore, the physical work required to care for a citizen is an important predictor for end-of-day pain (Czuba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>) and physical exertion (Jakobsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2022</xref>). Thus, knowledge about alternative ways to plan and organize the visits and the care for the citizens to reduce high work demands for HHC-workers is needed.</p><p id="Par8">From 2022 to 2023, the Danish National Board of Social Services funded projects that aimed to develop and test new approaches to build greater sustainability in HHC (Buch and Topholm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2023</xref>). Drawing inspiration from the Dutch concept Buurtzorg (Heged&#x000fc;s et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2022</xref>) and the Swedish concept V&#x000e4;stervik (Schou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>), HHC-teams within 25 municipalities restructured their HHC into small self-governing teams (Buck, M.S., Topholm, E.H., Christensen, J., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2024</xref>). The restructuring of HHC into smaller self-governing teams could potentially result in a more evenly distributed workload than the conventional structure and thereby address work-related musculoskeletal pain. However, this remains to be established. A previous study found that eldercare workers in nursing home wards are more likely to experience LBP the higher the number of residents they care for over a year. In contrast, self-managed scheduling in HHC-teams may promote a more balanced distribution of work tasks. As a result, restructuring HHC-workers into smaller teams could be a beneficial organizational approach to prevent and reduce LBP among HHC-workers.</p><p id="Par9">Self-governing teams have only been implemented in a small number of HHC-teams across municipalities in Denmark and has not been compared to conventional teams regarding LBP and work-related factors. The present study will assess a natural experiment with self-governing team structure (Craig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>) using a cross-sectional design (Leatherdale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>). The opportunity of gaining knowledge from a natural experiment arises when events or interventions occur without being planned as a research project (Craig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>). The present natural experiment, where some HHC-workplaces have transitioned to self-government while other HHC-teams have not, offers a unique opportunity to compare the working environment between the two team structures. The use of a cross-sectional design provides point prevalence data, offering valuable insights that can be used to identify areas where future interventions should be targeted to improve the work environment for HHC-workers within the self-governing structure.</p><p id="Par10">Thus, the aim of this study was to compare HHC with self-governing and conventional team structure regarding self-reported LBP and work-related factors using a natural experiment with a cross-sectional design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par11">We assessed a natural experiment using a cross-sectional design. The study did not fall under the definition of the laws defined in Committee Act &#x000a7;&#x000a0;2 and &#x000a7;&#x000a0;1, and could be initiated without approval from The Committees on Health Research Ethics for the Capital Region of Denmark (Ref number: F-23031959). The study was registered as a clinical trial with ISRCTN (Ref number: 13586262) prior to data collection. Participants were given written information about the study and gave their consent prior to enrollment.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Recruitment and inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par12">A compilation sourced from the Danish National Board of Social Services, detailed the Danish municipalities that had received funds to implement self-governing teams in HHC in 2022&#x02013;2023 (Buch and Topholm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2023</xref>). Based on this we initiated contact by email with municipalities that had undergone the restructure to self-governing teams (i.e. self-governing teams) as well as teams that have not yet undergone the restructure to self-governing teams (i.e. conventional teams).</p><p id="Par13">Eligibility criteria for a conventional team was: (i) working day shifts and (ii) not yet undergone the restructure to self-governing teams. Eligibility criteria for a self-governing team was: (i) divided in groups with a maximum of 12 HHC-workers, (ii) working day shifts and (iii) having worked as self-governing for a minimum of six months. All HHC-workers within the participating teams were invited to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conventional structured teams and teams structured as self-governing</title><p id="Par14">There is a variation among the funded municipalities in their understanding and implementation of the self-governing elements, including team size and degree of interdisciplinary integration (Buck, M.S., Topholm, E.H., Christensen, J., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2024</xref>). However, all self-governing teams included in this study have organized their teams the same way. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the organisational differences between the conventional and self-governing teams included in this study. In conventional teams, there is typically one team manager responsible for 20&#x02013;30 HHC-workers and one scheduling coordinator. The scheduling coordinator is responsible for managing the allocation of visits and citizen care among the HHC-workers. Moreover, each team is supported by a group of nurses and needs assessors. The nurses are often located geographically close to the HHC-workers, and available for easy contact if needed. The needs assessors are often located in another geographic location. Therefore, the communication between HHC-workers and needs assessors primarily occurs in writing. In the self-governing teams, one team manager is responsible for 2&#x02013;3 groups which each include one nurse and a maximum of 12 HHC-workers. Each group is responsible for planning their own work schedules on a daily basis. The scheduling coordinator assists all groups in each team with the planning of work schedules. Each team has a weekly inter-disciplinary meeting that includes HHC-workers, the nurses and a needs assessor.</p><p id="Par15">

During the start-up meeting, the HHC-workers were introduced to the components of the study through a PowerPoint presentation presented by the researcher. Moreover, each HHC-worker was given an envelope containing information about the project, a data processing agreement, an accelerometer and a guide explaining how to attach the accelerometer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par19">The primary outcome of this study was to compare LBP intensity in self-governing and conventional team structure.

The HHC-workers in the self-governing teams in addition received questions concerning appraisal of the self-governing structure (i.e. (i) to what extent do you want to continue with being organised as self-governing? and (ii) do you think that other HHC-units could benefit from introducing self-governing teams? ).</p><p id="Par21">The secondary outcome; variation in physical behaviour was measured using a triaxial accelerometer (SENS Motion<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Copenhagen, Denmark) attached to the right thigh midway on the line between the anterior inferior iliac spine and the top of the patella (Skotte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>) for five consecutive weekdays (Monday-Friday). The HHC-workers logged their work and sleep hours using an app. The accelerometer recorded, sampled and stored triaxial acceleration data at a frequency of 25&#x000a0;Hz with a measurement range of &#x000b1;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;g. The data was processed using Motus algorithm (&#x0201c;ActiMotus [Computer software],&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2024</xref>), to determine physical behaviour, including time spent sitting, standing still, standing with movement, slow walking (&#x0003c;&#x02009;100 steps per minutes), fast walking (&#x02265;&#x02009;100 steps per minutes), stair climbing, running and cycling. These physical activities were then merged into three categories: (i) sitting (sitting and/or lying), (ii) standing (standing still and standing with movements), and (iii) active (slow walking, fast walking, stair climbing, cycling and running). Additionally, we also calculated cycling separately to gain insight into the extent to which HHC-workers utilized cycling for transportation between citizens. Non-movement periods lasting for more than 60&#x000a0;min were considered as non-wear time or sleep.

Additionally, the majority (72.3%) stated that other HHC-teams to some or very high degree could benefit of adopting a self-governing team structure (data not presented).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">This study gives a novel contribution to our understanding of the differences in LBP and work-related factors in self-governing compared to conventional teams. No significant differences in LBP or neck/shoulder pain were found. However, significant differences in the working environment favoring the self-governing team structure were revealed, including meaning at work, collaboration with manager and collaboration with needs assessors.</p><p id="Par35">The observed improvements in meaning at work and interpersonal collaborations may be considered as early indicators of positive changes in the working environment within the self-governing teams. This aligns with previous studies that identifies associations between interpersonal relationships and job satisfaction (Zolak Polja&#x00161;evi&#x00107; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>), as well as between the sense of meaning at work and stress (Annison and Davidson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2023</xref>). Both job satisfaction and stress are well-established factors that influence musculoskeletal pain (Linton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>; Vinstrup et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>). Therefore, it is possible, that HHC-teams included in this study have not been self-governing for a sufficient length of time for the positive changes in meaning at work and interpersonal collaborations to translate into measurable changes in health outcomes, including reduction in LBP intensity. To explore whether these factors contribute to a reduction in LBP intensity among HHC-workers in self-governing teams over time, we acknowledge that a longitudinal study would be a valuable approach for future research.</p><p id="Par36">Other possible explanations for the lack of difference in LBP intensity could be that the self-governing team structure does not impact the amount of physical workload, as the work tasks remain the same regardless of the team structure. Nor does the self-governing structure influence how the HHC-workers perform their physically demanding work tasks. However, as it is embedded in the self-governing structure that each group is responsible of planning their daily work schedules, this could lead to a more equal distribution of physically demanding work tasks among HHC-workers. This has previously been suggested as a beneficial organizational approach to prevent LBP among eldercare workers (Wester et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2025</xref>). On the other hand, there is a possibility that some HHC-workers in the self-governing teams will secure themselves more favourable schedules, resulting in an even more unequal distribution of the physically demanding work tasks, affecting musculoskeletal pain negatively.</p><p id="Par37">We calculated the average distribution of daily working time spent in sedentary, standing, and active physical behaviours, revealing that the variation was somewhat similar in self-governing teams compared to the conventional teams. Moreover, the average distribution of physical behaviours at work in both the self-governing and conventional teams is consistent with previous accelerometer measurements of physical behaviours among HHC-workers (Tj&#x000f8;svoll et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2022</xref>). The consistency in our findings was expected, as the job tasks remain similar regardless of the organizational structure of the HHC-teams. In addition to the initial calculations, we calculated the amount of time spent cycling during active working hours, as the mode of transportation between citizens must be assumed to influence the level of active work time. Our findings indicated that HHC-workers in conventional teams spent more of their working time cycling. This could be due to the geographical areas that each teams covers, though we have no data to confirm this. The limited participation in the accelerometry measurements prevented us from assessing the inter-individual physical behaviour between team members in self-governing teams compared to HHC-workers in conventional teams. We recommend that further studies consider exploring this aspect further, as it could provide valuable insight into the distribution of work tasks among HHC-workers in the self-governing structure.</p><p id="Par38">The significantly higher level of perceived meaning at work among HHC-workers in self-governing teams (5.8 points on a 0-100 scale) compared to HHC-workers in conventional teams, is likely attributed to the high degree of autonomy in their work, and this has likely contributed to their sense of competence. Previous studies have shown that having sufficient influence to engage with work tasks in a relevant manner benefits employees&#x02019; job satisfaction and their experience of meaning (Andersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>; Sasser and S&#x000f8;rensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Semmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). Furthermore, the significantly higher level of collaboration with their manager (7.5 points on a 0-100 scale) and needs assessors (11.9 points on a 0-100 scale) compared to those in conventional teams, may likely be due to the regular interdisciplinary meetings that replaced the written communication. This change may foster an interdisciplinary collaboration that may positively impact the workers&#x02019; job satisfaction (Fo&#x000e0; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>; Ylit&#x000f6;rm&#x000e4;nen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>). Additionally, the establishment of a faster communication pathway will allow workers to complete their work tasks more efficient, which, in turn, is expected to enhance their sense of meaning at work (Andersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>; Sasser and S&#x000f8;rensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Semmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">Our study provides novel insights into the differences in the work environment of HHC-workers in self-governing versus conventional team structures. The absence of significant differences in the musculoskeletal pain outcomes emphasizes the continued necessity of developing interventions targeting musculoskeletal pain and health among HHC-workers.</p><p id="Par40">The self-governing team structure does not have a structural focus on employees&#x02019; health. However, we see a clear opportunity to integrate such focus into the self-governing structure, as factors like high autonomy and flexibility in task management provide a chance for the HHC-workers to continuously consider their health when distributing work tasks.</p><p id="Par41">A particularly well-aligned approach for such an integration is the Goldilocks Work principle, which aims to organize productive work in a way that is &#x02018;just right&#x02019; for the workers&#x02019; health (Holtermann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>; Straker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>). The Goldilocks Work approach has previously been developed and tested in the context of HHC (Lohne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2025</xref>; Vilhelmsen et al. Submitted). However, one of the studies focused solely on the physical aspects of the work tasks (Lohne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2025</xref>), while neither of the studies were specifically developed to address the self-governing structure. Furthermore, both studies found that their interventions were not adequately implemented within the organization, highlighting the need for further research with a strong focus on the developing and implementation of interventions in HHC.</p><p id="Par42">Thus, we argue that a logical next step could be to integrate a Goldilocks Work intervention in the self-governing team structure, using a participatory approach, as a promising way to reduce musculoskeletal pain and increase health among HHC-workers. The development and implementation of such an intervention would provide the HHC-workers with the skills to distribute a more appropriate and healthy distribution of work tasks, which could potentially reduce musculoskeletal pain and increase health.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par43">The natural experiment design is a methodological strength since it provides insight into the potential effect of implementation of self-governing teams in a realistic context. However, the use of a natural experiment design could be seen as a limitation, as natural experiments are more susceptible to bias (Craig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>). Due to practical matters, we were not able to collect baseline data as the self-governing teams had already restructured when it was possible to start the data collection. Consequently, we cannot ensure that the observed differences between the two team structures are solely attributable to the transition into the self-governing structure, as other unmeasured factors may have influenced the outcomes. However, rather than being a limitation, we argue that the design is a strength in the study, as the natural experiment design allows us a more realistic understanding of how implementation of the self-governing team structure may impact the working environment among HHC-workers. We did our data collection, when it was still possible to have a comparison group of teams, who had not yet undergone a restructure into self-governing teams, which is not always available in natural experiments.</p><p id="Par44">Possible biases should be noted when interpreting the results of our study. The teams that applied for funding resources for implementing the self-governing team structure may already have been well-functioning, with strong collaboration skills across professions. They therefore may have a higher capacity to experiment with the new organizational structure. Moreover, the voluntary recruitment process could have introduced a selection bias. We cannot determine if only well-functioning HHC-teams chose to participate, which means our results may not be representative for all HHC-teams across Denmark.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">Our study provides novel insights and enhances the understanding of musculoskeletal pain as well as work-related factors among HHC-workers in conventional and self-governing team structures. While no significant difference in musculoskeletal pain was found, self-governing teams demonstrated significant benefits in terms of increased meaning at work and improved collaboration with manager and needs assessors. Moreover, the HHC-workers in self-governing teams reported high appraisal of the self-governing structure. The similar level of LBP and shoulder/neck pain highlights the need for more comprehensive and tailored efforts to improve the physical health of HHC-workers. Future research should explore additional strategies to address these health issues among HHC-workers within the self-governing team structure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all the HHC-teams who agreed to participate in this study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
