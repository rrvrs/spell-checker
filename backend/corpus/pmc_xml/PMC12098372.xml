This investigation seeks to clarify the expression profiles, prognostic relevance, and diagnostic capabilities of FANCI across multiple malignancies, along with its links to immune cell infiltration, genetic alterations, protein-protein interactions, and functional roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>By utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of FANCI mRNA expression using R software and visualized the results with the ggplot2 package. Prognostic and diagnostic evaluations were conducted using Xiantao tools to produce survival and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The examination of genetic variation was facilitated through cBioPortal, while DNA methylation and mRNA modifications were analyzed utilizing UALCAN and SangerBox 3.0. Correlations with immune responses were assessed via the EPIC platform and SangerBox 3.0. Additionally, we constructed protein-protein interaction networks employing the STRING database and Cytoscape software.

Elevated FANCI expression is associated with unfavorable prognoses in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Methylation assessments demonstrated a robust inverse correlation between FANCI promoter methylation and its expression in LIHC. Moreover, FANCI expression was found to be connected to immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation burden in select cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, FANCI presents as a promising biomarker for cancer prognosis and diagnosis, with potential implications for therapeutic interventions.

According to the Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN 2023), an estimated 20.3 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths occurred globally in 2023, reflecting a 4% increase in incidence and 2% rise in mortality compared to 2020 estimates (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bray et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Inzani and Rindi, 2021</xref>). The complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, present significant challenges for effective treatment and management. Despite advancements in cancer research, the prognosis for many cancer types remains unfavorable, underscoring the urgent need for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Recent advances in multi-omics technologies and artificial intelligence-driven biomarker discovery have identified promising targets, such as clonal neoantigens and metabolic vulnerabilities (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, over 60% of advanced solid tumors still develop resistance to first-line therapies, highlighting critical gaps in precision oncology (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Arora et al., 2023</xref>). Urgent efforts are needed to unravel context-specific oncogenic mechanisms and translate molecular insights into durable clinical responses.</p><p>FANCI (Fanconi anemia complementation group I) is a critical gene involved in the DNA damage response and repair pathways, particularly within the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Smogorzewska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Sareen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Koczorowska et al., 2014</xref>). FANCI, in conjunction with FANCD2, forms a complex that is monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage, facilitating the repair of interstrand crosslinks (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Rego et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Martinez et al., 2019</xref>). Dysregulation of the FA pathway, including mutations or altered expression of FANCI, has been linked to genomic instability and increased cancer susceptibility (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Altintas et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted the involvement of FANCI in various cancer types. For example, FANCI mutations have been identified in ovarian and breast cancers, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Birkbak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fierheller et al., 2021</xref>). In colorectal cancer, altered FANCI expression has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). In lung cancer, FANCI downregulation has been correlated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Given the diverse roles of FANCI across different cancers, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis is warranted to elucidate its expression patterns, prognostic significance, and potential as a diagnostic biomarker. This study aims to investigate FANCI expression across multiple cancer types using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. Statistical analyses and visualization tools, including R software and ggplot2, will be employed to assess FANCI expression levels and their association with clinical outcomes.</p><p>Furthermore, we will explore FANCI&#x02019;s genetic alterations using cBioPortal, examining mutation types and copy number variations. DNA methylation and mRNA modification patterns will be analyzed using UALCAN and SangerBox 3.0 tools. The relationship between FANCI expression and immune cell infiltration will be evaluated via the EPIC platform, while its association with tumor mutation burden will be investigated using SangerBox 3.0. Protein-protein interaction networks will be constructed using STRING and Cytoscape software to identify key interacting partners and functional modules. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, will be conducted to uncover biological processes and pathways associated with FANCI. Additionally, we will utilize the CancerSEA database to study FANCI&#x02019;s correlation with cancer functional states at the single-cell level. Finally, a regulatory network involving long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and FANCI will be constructed using various online databases and StarBase 2.0.</p><p>In summary, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of FANCI&#x02019;s role in cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis, and uncovering novel therapeutic targets. By integrating multi-omics data and employing robust bioinformatics analyses, we hope to elucidate the complex interactions and regulatory mechanisms involving FANCI in different cancer contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression and subcellular localization analysis of FANCI</title><p>FANCI mRNA expression levels in tumor, adjacent paracancerous, and normal tissues were obtained from TCGA and GTEx databases (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Vivian et al., 2017</xref>) Samples with &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; expression were excluded, and paired samples were used for comparison. RNA sequencing data in FPKM were normalized to TPM using the Toil pipeline and log2 transformed. Statistical analyses were conducted with R software (v3.6.3), using &#x0201c;ggplot2&#x0201d; (v3.3.3) for bar charts of FANCI expression across 33 cancer types. Median expression values set cutoff thresholds, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed intergroup differences. Subcellular localization of FANCI was visualized in A-431 and U251MG cell lines using immunofluorescence from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), with immunohistochemistry images also sourced from HPA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evaluation of FANCI&#x02019;s prognostic and diagnostic significance</title><p>We utilized TCGA data and conducted COX regression analysis using the Xiantao tool, considering a P-value less than 0.05 as statistically significant. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from RNA sequencing data to assess the impact of FANCI expression on cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Results were visualized with a forest plot using the Xiantao tool. The diagnostic significance of FANCI across cancer types was evaluated with ROC curves and the area under the curve (AUC), categorizing diagnostic accuracy as low (AUC: 0.5&#x02013;0.7), moderate (AUC: 0.7&#x02013;0.9), and high (AUC &#x0003e;0.9).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Gene alteration analysis</title><p>We used the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to analyze gene data from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Study, aiding in the interpretation of molecular data from cancer studies. Gene alteration data from 2,683 samples of 2,565 pan-cancer patients were obtained from UCSC Xena and the ICGC data portal. The &#x0201c;Cancer Types Summary&#x0201d; module explored the mutation landscape of FANCI, including mutation types, copy number alterations (CNA), and mutation frequency. Somatic mutation datasets were retrieved from the TCGA database and analyzed with the HOME bioinformatics tool.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA methylation and mRNA modifications</title><p>UALCAN (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html</ext-link>) was employed to investigate the promoter DNA methylation levels of FANCI in normal and pan-cancer tissues. The &#x003b2;-value indicates DNA methylation levels, with low methylation defined as &#x003b2;: 0.3&#x02013;0.25 and high methylation as &#x003b2;: 0.7&#x02013;0.5. The DNA methylation profile of FANCI in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) was obtained from MethSurv using the &#x0201c;Gene Visualization&#x0201d; module. For mRNA modification analysis, SangerBox 3.0 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://sangerbox.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://sangerbox.com/</ext-link>) was used through the &#x0201c;Pan-Cancer Analysis-mRNA Modifications&#x0201d; module. This tool analyzed 45 methylation regulators involved in N1-methyladenosine (m1A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) across TCGA pan-cancer tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Correlation of FANCI expression with immunity</title><p>The EPIC platform provides scores based on stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE cell expression data in TCGA, detailing infiltration proportions for eight immune cell types. The LIHC dataset was exported using the &#x0201c;estimation&#x0201d; R package to evaluate tumor purity scores. The correlation between FANCI expression and eight immune checkpoints was explored using the &#x0201c;Gene_Corr&#x0201d; module, with &#x0201c;P-value&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;r-value&#x0201d; visualized via heatmaps in the Xiantao tool. Additionally, SangerBox 3.0&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Pan-Cancer Analysis - Heterogeneity Analysis&#x0201d; module was used to investigate the relationship between FANCI expression and Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis</title><p>The STRING database was used to gather potential protein interactions involving FANCI, with a confidence score threshold of 0.7. The data were imported into Cytoscape (v3.8.2) for visualization. The cytoHubba plugin identified key modules, with the top 10 nodes ranked by the MCC method designated as hub genes. Using the Pathlinker plugin, signaling pathways were reconstructed from these hub genes, calculating multiple short paths from receptors to transcription factors within the PPI network. We also explored correlations between hub genes across various cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Functional enrichment analysis of FANCI</title><p>We performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses on genes related to FANCI using the STRING database with the clusterProfiler and org packages. The significance threshold was set at (p &#x0003c; 0.01). Results were visualized in bubble plots using ggplot2. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified pathway differences between high and low FANCI expression groups, considering pathways significant with FDR &#x0003c;0.25 and adjusted (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Each analysis used 1,000 permutations. The top 15 enriched results were shown in a ridge plot, and GSEA results were illustrated with ggplot2 in R.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Identification of FANC1-Regulating transcription factors</title><p>To predict the transcription factors regulating the FANC1 gene, this study employed bioinformatics analysis using NetworkAnalyst 3.0 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.networkanalyst.ca/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.networkanalyst.ca/</ext-link>). The specific workflow is as follows: the gene symbol FANC1 was input into the platform, with the species set as <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. Using the promoter region motifs (1,500 bp upstream of the transcription start site) from the JASPAR database, a position weight matrix (PWM) score &#x0003e;85% and FDR &#x0003c;0.05 were set as the screening thresholds, and the transcription factor-gene interaction network was visualized.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>CancerSEA</title><p>We used the CancerSEA database to assess FANCI&#x02019;s functional roles across various cancer types at single-cell resolution. Our study focused on the average correlation between FANCI and cancer-related functional states, including invasion, metastasis, proliferation, EMT, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, differentiation, DNA damage response, DNA repair, hypoxia, inflammation, quiescence, and stem cell-like properties. A correlation threshold of 0.3 and a p-value below 0.05 were set for FANCI&#x02019;s associations with these states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Construction of the LncRNA - miRNA - FANCI regulatory network</title><p>The target miRNAs for FANCI were predicted using three online databases: DIANA-microT, miRWalk, and miRDB. StarBase 2.0 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/" ext-link-type="uri">https://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/</ext-link>) was utilized to analyze the lncRNA-miRNA interaction network and the correlation between miRNAs and FANCI (lncRNA). The filtering criteria included &#x0201c;strict specificity for mammals, humans, hg19, CLIP data with a threshold of &#x02265;5, with or without degradation group data.&#x0201d; The interactions between miRNA and lncRNA, as well as the lncRNA-miRNA-FANCI network, were visualized using Sankey diagrams in the Xiangtan tool and Cytoscape, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>siRNA transfection</title><p>The siRNA was synthesized by HanBio. Transfection was conducted in the Huh7 cell line utilizing JetPRIME Transfection Reagent (Poly Plus, #114-15). The Huh7 cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 12&#x000a0;h.

Key findings include miRNAs, such as hsa-miR-18a-5p, hsa-miR-18b-5p, and hsa-miR-450b-5p, that are connected to multiple lncRNAs. lncRNAs like NEAT1, XIST, and NORAD are targeted by several miRNAs.

This network illustrates the regulatory complexity involving FANCI, miRNAs, and lncRNAs, suggesting that FANCI expression in LIHC is modulated by a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. Overall, these results demonstrate the construction of a comprehensive ceRNA network involving FANCI in LIHC. The identification of key miRNAs and lncRNAs interacting with FANCI highlights potential regulatory mechanisms and provides insights into the molecular interactions that may influence FANCI expression and function in liver cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Knockdown of FANCI suppresses migration and tumor invasion in LIHC cells</title><p>We examined the expression of FANCI in LIHC, and our results revealed that FANCI mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in tumor tissues than in the corresponding non-tumor tissues (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figures 10A,B</xref>). To further investigate the role of FANCI in LIHC, we conducted experiments using Huh7 cells. In our study, following siRNA infection (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figures 10C,D</xref>), the wound healing assay results indicated that the migration speed slowed after FANCI was knocked down (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10E</xref>). Similarly, the transwell results showed that the migration and invasion abilities of the cells were reduced after FANCI was knocked down (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10F</xref>). These experimental results support the role of FANCI as a pivotal oncogene that facilitates LIHC cell invasion and migration.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>FIGURE 10</label><caption><p>Knockdown of FANCI suppresses cell migration and invasion. <bold>(A,B)</bold> Western blot and qPCR were performed to detect the expression level of FANCI in LIHC tissues. <bold>(C,D)</bold> Quantitative analysis of FANCI mRNA and protein in Huh7 cells following treatment with FANCI siRNA to verify the silencing efficiency of different siRNAs. <bold>(E,F)</bold> Wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay were used to evaluate the impact of FANCI downregulation on the migratory or invasive abilities of Huh7 cells.

Preliminary experiments further validated the expression levels and biological functions of FANCI in LIHC. The findings reveal that FANCI is significantly upregulated in most cancer types and closely associated with poor outcomes, suggesting that it plays a key oncogenic role in tumor initiation and progression.</p><p>FANCI is a critical component of the Fanconi anemia pathway. Its primary function is to form a heterodimeric complex with FANCD2; following DNA damage, FANCI becomes monoubiquitinated, which recruits DNA repair proteins to the site of damage and initiates the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Smogorzewska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Sareen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Koczorowska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Rego et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Martinez et al., 2019</xref>). Our results indicate that FANCI is significantly overexpressed in most cancer types, implying that by enhancing DNA damage repair capabilities, it may help cancer cells adapt to high levels of DNA damage stress, thereby promoting oncogenesis and tumor progression.</p><p>By integrating data from the TCGA and GTEx databases, we systematically analyzed the expression pattern and clinical relevance of FANCI in 33 cancer types. FANCI was found to be upregulated in multiple tumors, consistent with previous findings in CESC (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), BRCA (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2024</xref>), LUAD (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2023</xref>), and SKCM (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, FANCI expression was closely linked to tumor staging and grading, particularly in LIHC, where its expression significantly increased with tumor progression, suggesting a critical role in liver cancer development. Further Cox regression and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analyses demonstrate that high FANCI expression is significantly associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as KIRP, LIHC, PAAD, and ACC. Additionally, ROC curve analyses confirm that FANCI holds high diagnostic value in LIHC and PAAD (AUC &#x0003e;0.9), indicating its potential both as a prognostic biomarker and as an effective diagnostic indicator.</p><p>Our analysis also revealed that FANCI expression is subject to precise, multidimensional regulation. In LIHC, hypomethylation of the FANCI promoter is significantly negatively correlated with its overexpression, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation is one of the key mechanisms driving aberrant FANCI expression in liver cancer. Moreover, bioinformatic predictions identified several potential transcriptional regulators of FANCI&#x02014;such as HINFP, POU2F2, ELK1, JUND, and FOXC1. Previous studies have demonstrated that these transcription factors play critical roles in various cancers; for example, HINFP shows significant regulatory effects in bladder cancer (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>), POU2F2 is linked to lung cancer (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2021</xref>), and JUND and FOXC1 are key in colorectal (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2023</xref>) and breast cancer (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sizemore and Keri, 2012</xref>), respectively. They may act in concert to promote FANCI overexpression in diverse cancer contexts. In addition, we constructed a lncRNA-miRNA-FANCI competing endogenous RNA regulatory network in LIHC, revealing the complexity of posttranscriptional regulation and offering new insights into the mechanisms of FANCI dysregulation.</p><p>Functional enrichment analyses (GO, KEGG, GSEA) and single-cell functional state analysis (CancerSEA) consistently show that FANCI-associated gene sets are primarily enriched in core biological processes such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and homologous recombination. This is highly consistent with FANCI&#x02019;s known role in the Fanconi anemia pathway (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Smogorzewska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Longerich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Niraj et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, in cancers where high FANCI expression is linked to poor prognosis, pathways related to cell cycle checkpoints, DNA replication, and antigen processing and presentation are significantly enriched. These findings offer clues on how FANCI could promote tumor progression by maintaining genomic stability and supporting cell proliferation, while also possibly affecting tumor cell immunogenicity. Based on these analyses, we speculate that high FANCI expression not only facilitates DNA repair but also represents an adaptive mechanism&#x02014;enabling cancer cells to tolerate higher levels of genomic instability and avoid lethal damage, thereby securing a survival advantage in rapidly proliferating and hostile microenvironments (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fierheller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Rego et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, FANCI-mediated DNA damage response may synergize with aberrant cell cycle checkpoint regulation (as indicated by GSEA-enriched pathways), allowing damaged cells to continue dividing and accelerating tumor heterogeneity and evolution (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Maleki et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, its roles in DNA replication and homologous recombination could directly enhance cancer cell capacity to maintain high replication rates and cope with replicative stress.</p><p>In addition, our analysis shows that FANCI expression is positively correlated with the infiltration of various immune cells&#x02014;such as helper T cells, central memory T cells, and Th2 cells&#x02014;while it is negatively correlated with the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as well as with the tumor mutational burden in certain cancers. These findings are consistent with previous studies on the relationship between FANCI and immune infiltration in cervical cancer (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), melanoma (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2023</xref>), liver cancer (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2023</xref>), and lung adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). Such correlations suggest that FANCI may play a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby influencing immune evasion or immune response. In light of the enrichment of antigen processing pathways identified through GSEA analysis, we speculate that dysregulation of FANCI might reduce the efficiency of tumor antigen presentation, promoting immune evasion. Its regulation of DNA damage repair could also indirectly affect genomic stability and neoantigen production, thereby altering the recruitment and activation of immune cells. The observed pattern of increased immunosuppressive cells coupled with a decrease in effector cells may hint at direct or indirect signaling crosstalk. Clarifying these association-based hypotheses is critical for developing effective combination treatment strategies, such as pairing immunotherapy with DDR inhibitors (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alhmoud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). Future studies could explore whether FANCI expression levels might serve as a potential predictive marker for immunotherapy responses.</p><p>To validate predictions from our bioinformatics analysis, we performed functional experiments in LIHC tissues and cell lines. Results revealed that FANCI is highly expressed in liver cancer tissues, and specific downregulation of FANCI using siRNA significantly inhibited cellular migration and invasion, as demonstrated in wound-healing and Transwell assays. These findings directly confirm that FANCI promotes the malignant phenotype of LIHC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, thereby providing preliminary experimental evidence for its potential as a therapeutic target.</p><p>This study reveals the diagnostic and prognostic value of FANCI across multiple cancers, particularly demonstrating exceptionally high diagnostic accuracy (AUC &#x0003e;0.9) in LIHC and PAAD. These results suggest that FANCI has the potential to serve as an effective biomarker for early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation in liver and pancreatic cancers. Clinically, assessing FANCI expression in patient tissues or peripheral blood could aid in early tumor diagnosis and risk stratification. Moreover, the close association between FANCI expression with tumor staging and pathological grading further indicates its potential utility for monitoring tumor progression and evaluating therapeutic outcomes. Regarding treatment, given FANCI&#x02019;s key role in DNA damage repair within tumor cells, targeting FANCI may enhance tumor cell sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, thereby improving treatment efficacy. Our cell experiments also demonstrate that knocking down FANCI significantly suppresses the migration and invasion capabilities of liver cancer cells. Therefore, developing specific small-molecule inhibitors or RNA interference drugs targeting FANCI could represent a novel therapeutic strategy against malignancies such as liver cancer. In addition, considering the close relationship between FANCI and the tumor immune microenvironment, combining FANCI inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors might further enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy.</p><p>Although this study provides comprehensive bioinformatics insights and is supported by preliminary experimental validation, it primarily relies on public databases and computational analyses, with relatively limited <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments; this is the main limitation of the work. Future research urgently needs to adopt more complex model systems (such as gene-edited cell lines, tumor organoids, and patient-derived xenograft models) and advanced techniques (such as proteomics and single-cell sequencing) to precisely delineate the specific molecular pathways and interaction networks through which FANCI regulates DNA damage response, the cell cycle, and immune signaling in different cancer contexts. Concurrently, systematic screening and optimization of inhibitors targeting FANCI (or its pathways) should be conducted, with their efficacy and safety evaluated in preclinical models. Moreover, large-scale, multicenter prospective clinical cohort studies should be initiated to establish standardized FANCI detection methods and to confirm the association between its expression levels and responses to specific treatments (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy), which is a key step in exploring its clinical value as a predictive biomarker.</p><p>In summary, this study, through an integration of multi-omics analyses and preliminary experimental validation, systematically delineates the expression patterns, clinical significance, and potential functions of FANCI across cancers. The research emphasizes the ubiquitous upregulation of FANCI and its importance as both an adverse prognostic marker and a potential diagnostic biomarker in various cancers. Functional analyses and mechanistic investigations reveal that FANCI plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability, driving cell proliferation, and shaping the tumor immune microenvironment, with its expression being intricately regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. Preliminary <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have confirmed its role in promoting invasion and migration in LIHC. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the complex role of FANCI in cancer biology but also lay the groundwork for further development of FANCI as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker, thereby paving the way for future research aimed at advancing personalized cancer treatment strategies.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The human research involved in the experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, and the experiment was conducted in accordance with local regulations and institutional requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="s7"><title>Author contributions</title><p>YZ: Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review and editing.
