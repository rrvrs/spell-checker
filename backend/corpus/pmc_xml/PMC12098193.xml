As a key life course event, the perinatal period has been documented as a potential window to improve paternal health, behaviors, and psychological well-being (Garfield et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). In addition, it is an opportunity to address health disparities for men&#x02019;s health, and by extension potentially improve maternal and child health (Boykin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>; Jack et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>; Salvesen von Essen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>; Yogman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). Markers of poor paternal health during the perinatal period are linked to poor child health and maternal health (Azuine &#x00026; Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>; Cui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Freeman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>; Paulson &#x00026; Bazemore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>), including associations between paternal wellbeing and child wellbeing (Scarlett et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2024</xref>; Yogman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>), yet there are limited data on objective and subjective metrics for paternal health status and healthcare utilization.</p><p id="Par8">Despite the critical role that fathers play in the health and development of their families, male health in the United States continues to lag behind their female counterparts. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reveals that men have a higher all-cause mortality rate and lower life expectancy than women (National Center for Health Statistics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Lower healthcare utilization is one known contribution to these health disparities as fewer visits to physicians were made by males than females, a difference that was most pronounced among adults aged 18&#x02013;44 with males (National Center for Health Statistics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Improving healthcare utilization, especially primary care, is known to improve health outcomes and mitigate health disparities as it allows for prevention, early identification, and longitudinal management of diseases with significant morbidity and mortality risk such as diabetes and hypertension (Azuine &#x00026; Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). This is recognized by the Healthy People 2030 initiative, which outlines the goal of increasing the proportion of people with a usual primary care provider from 76% in 2017 to 84% by 2030.</p><p id="Par9">Poor healthcare utilization and healthcare behaviors by fathers during the perinatal period not only adversely impacts the health of the father, it can have downstream effects on his partner, and his offspring, particularly with respect to mental health (Azuine &#x00026; Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>; Cui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Paulson &#x00026; Bazemore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). A focus on the importance of connecting fathers with the healthcare system and preventive healthcare may therefore provide a three-way benefit to fathers, mothers, and infants. To drive research, community, and clinical initiatives aimed at improving health and healthcare utilization for fathers, data is needed to better inform these interventions and approaches.</p><p id="Par10">Although population-based maternal public health surveillance systems have been in place for decades (Kortsmit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>), no large-scale national public health surveillance system currently exists dedicated to paternal health and health behaviors in the perinatal period (Garfield et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2022</xref>). This pilot study examines the overall prevalence and associations of select paternal characteristics and three paternal healthcare outcomes during the perinatal period: (1) having a primary care physician (PCP), (2) having any type of personal healthcare visit during the perinatal period, and (3) self-reported health status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data Source</title><p id="Par11">Data was analyzed from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) for Dads, a novel population-based cross-sectional study piloted in the state of Georgia (GA) in 2018&#x02013;2019 (Garfield et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2022</xref>). The methodology of PRAMS for Dads has been further described elsewhere, with PRAMS for Dads contact protocols aligned with PRAMS (Garfield et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2022</xref>). Fathers were sampled if the infant&#x02019;s mother had been randomly sampled from a list of birth certificates for recent live births (Kortsmit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). For this pilot, fathers were sampled during the period from October 15, 2018-July 3, 2019 (representing infants born during May 28, 2018-May 3, 2019). Fathers were surveyed 2 to 6 months following the birth of their infant (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;857). Data on fathers was obtained from the infants&#x02019; birth certificates such as age, education, race and Hispanic origin, and marital status -- fathers were either married as identified on the birth certificate, or unmarried with a completed paternity acknowledgment form (PA). This study was conducted in accord with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Northwestern University and Georgia Department of Public Health (IRB of record).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Paternal Characteristics</title><p id="Par12">Paternal characteristics obtained from infant birth certificate records included: age (&#x0003c;&#x02009;25, 25&#x02013;34 or &#x02265;&#x02009;35 years), education (&#x02264;&#x02009;high school diploma or GED; some college, no degree; and college degree (associate degree, bachelor&#x02019;s degree or higher), marital status (married or unmarried with PA), and race and Hispanic origin (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic other). Because of small sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22), the category for &#x0201c;non-Hispanic, other&#x0201d; included all other reported races (e.g. Asian-Pacific Islander, multiple races, other) and unknown race and Hispanic origin. Information on health insurance status after the infants&#x02019; birth was obtained from responses to the question &#x0201c;What kind of health insurance do you have now?&#x0201d; where respondents could select all qualifying responses. Response options were categorized as either insured, if reporting having any type of health insurance (e.g. &#x0201c;Private health insurance from my job or the job of my wife or partner,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Private health insurance from my parents,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Private health insurance from the Health Insurance Marketplace or Healthcare.gov,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Medicaid,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;PeachCare for Kids,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;TRICARE or other military health care,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Other health insurance&#x0201d;), or uninsured if they selected &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t have health insurance now&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Healthcare and Health Outcomes</title><p id="Par13">Fathers having a healthcare visit during the perinatal period was assessed by answering affirmatively to &#x0201c;Did you have any healthcare visits with a doctor, nurse or other healthcare worker, including a dental or mental health worker?&#x0201d; in reference to either the time period &#x0201c;during your baby&#x02019;s mother&#x02019;s pregnancy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;since your new baby was born.&#x0201d; Having a PCP was assessed by affirmative answers to either &#x0201c;Did you have a primary care physician when your baby&#x02019;s mother was pregnant?&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Do you have a primary care physician now?&#x0201d; Responses for these two time points were combined to create variables for any healthcare visit and any primary care physician during the perinatal period. Self-reported health status was based on response to the question, &#x0201c;Would you say that in general your health is:&#x0201d; with five answer options ranging from &#x0201c;Excellent&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Poor.&#x0201d; This variable was then dichotomized as very good or excellent compared with good, fair, or poor to create two approximately equal groupings of fathers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="Par14">All analyses were conducted using STATA version 17 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas 77845 USA). We include descriptive statistics for paternal characteristics chosen due to associations with healthcare utilization for men (Schlichthorst et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Vaidya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>) (e.g. age, race and Hispanic origin, health insurance status, education, and marital status), three main outcomes during the perinatal period (e.g. having a primary care physician, having a recent health care visit, and self-reported health status) and 95% confidence intervals. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure associations between the previously described paternal characteristics and the three main outcomes. Healthcare utilization outcomes were examined (i.e., having a PCP and a recent healthcare visit) using self-reported health status as an independent variable to evaluate whether self-reported health status was associated with healthcare utilization outcomes. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated using STATA&#x02019;s post-estimation command adjrr (Norton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>). All analyses accounted for PRAMS for Dads complex survey sampling design and survey weights (sampling, nonresponse, and noncoverage weights) to be representative of fathers to live-born infants who were either married or unmarried, with a completed PA form in Georgia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p id="Par15">Among 266 respondents, 13.1% were less than 25 years old, 56.7% were 25&#x02013;34 years old, and 30.2% were 35 years or older.

Certain groups reported a lower prevalence of healthcare utilization and poorer self-reported health and may be a focus for future programs and interventions. These groups include fathers without health insurance who were significantly less likely to have a PCP or at least one recent healthcare visit than fathers with health insurance; likewise, fathers with a high school diploma/GED were less likely to have a PCP or at least one recent healthcare visit than fathers with a college degree, and more likely to have poorer self-reported health status. These findings could guide providers in creating community-based interventions to improve utilization of care for these at-risk subpopulations to promote more equitable and accessible care for the entire family. For example, improving opportunities for health insurance access for uninsured men during the perinatal period may benefit fathers by making health care more accessible and less costly (Salvesen von Essen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">Identifying key life course events for men as areas of focus for both community and clinically-based interventions is essential for public health. The perinatal period may offer unique opportunities to improve healthcare utilization for men transitioning into fatherhood (Salvesen von Essen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>). Our analysis further demonstrates the link between improved health and healthcare utilization as noted by the association between fathers reporting better health and having a PCP. Health behaviors of fathers during the perinatal period may extend throughout adulthood and can impact men&#x02019;s health outcomes long term.</p><p id="Par26">Prior studies highlight that the perinatal period can be an opportune time to intervene for the health benefit of new fathers. A qualitative study of urban fathers in the Midwest found that entrance into fatherhood coincided with a positive adjustment in health behaviors and attitudes out of a desire to live to see their child reach adulthood and to serve as a role model for their child (Garfield et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). Several innovative community-based initiatives capitalize on fatherhood as a lever for lifestyle change that begins with the father and continues to the larger family. One lifestyle health intervention &#x0201c;Healthy Dads, Healthy Kids&#x02019;&#x02019; aims to assist fathers in their weight loss goals while influencing the lifestyle behaviors of their children through weekly educational group sessions taught by physical education teachers. Results of the randomized trial found that fathers of the program had significantly greater weight loss and both they and their children had greater physical activity levels (Morgan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). Additionally, &#x0201c;Fathers and Babies,&#x0201d; a mental health intervention piloted in the family&#x02019;s home through a home-visiting program, utilizes cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques for fathers in the perinatal period and reported significant decreases in fathers perceived stress 3 and 6 month follow up from baseline (Tandon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>). Engaging fathers in healthcare and optimal health behaviors, especially during the perinatal period, may help them improve their own health as well as their families.</p><p id="Par27">Limitations exist for this study. The cross-sectional design limits the interpretation of any associations drawn between paternal characteristics and fathers&#x02019; healthcare utilization and self-reported health status. The survey design of this study may also increase the risk for response and recall bias as fathers completed the survey at one specific time point to report behaviors encompassing the pre- and postnatal period. Furthermore, the generalizability of these findings may be limited to fathers in Georgia. Finally, while the response rate (31.7%) was low, this is a pilot study and it is consistent with other surveys of fathers (Avenilla et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Carlson &#x00026; McLanahan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Despite these limitations, PRAMS for Dads is a novel population-based public health surveillance system that captures a snapshot of fathers&#x02019; utilization of healthcare and health during the perinatal period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par28">Fathers in this state-representative sample generally reported low healthcare utilization during the perinatal period. In particular, select paternal characteristics such as health insurance and education appear linked to healthcare utilization, which could contribute to the health status of fathers and have downstream impacts on families. The perinatal period may be perceived as a lever for change and used as an opportunity for programming that focuses on the health of prospective and new fathers.
