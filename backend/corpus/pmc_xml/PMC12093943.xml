Here, we pursue a comparative approach of large-scale DNA-affinity-capturing assays (DACAs) coupled with semi-quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to identify putative regulatory proteins from <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> M512, which bind to the heterologously expressed biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of the liponucleoside antibiotics caprazamycin and liposidomycin. Both gene clusters share an almost identical genetic arrangement, including the location of promoter regions, as detected by RNA sequencing. A total of 2,214 proteins were trapped at the predicted promoter regions, with only three binding to corresponding promoters in both gene clusters. Among these, the overexpression of a yet uncharacterized TetR-family regulator (TFR), Sco4385, increased caprazamycin but not liposidomycin production. Protein&#x02013;DNA interaction experiments using biolayer interferometry confirmed the binding of Sco4385 to P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> at different locations within both promoter regions, which might explain its functional variance. Sequence alignment allowed the determination of a consensus sequence present in both promoter regions, to which Sco4385 was experimentally shown to bind. Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of the Crp regulator, Sco3571, leads to a threefold increase in caprazamycin and liposidomycin production yields, possibly due to an increased expression of a precursor pathway.</p><sec><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Streptomycetes are well-studied model organisms for the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically, industrially, and biotechnologically valuable metabolites. Their naturally broad repertoire of natural products can be further exploited by heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in non-native host strains. This approach forces the host to adapt to a new regulatory and metabolic environment. In our study, we demonstrate that a host regulator not only interacts with newly incorporated gene clusters but also regulates precursor supply for the produced compounds. We present a comprehensive study of regulatory proteins that interact with two genetically similar gene clusters for the biosynthesis of liponucleoside antibiotics. Thereby, we identified regulators of the heterologous host that influence the production of the corresponding antibiotic. Surprisingly, the regulatory interaction is highly specific for each biosynthetic gene cluster, even though they encode largely structurally similar metabolites.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>TetR regulator</kwd><kwd>Crp regulator</kwd><kwd>heterologous expression</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic></kwd><kwd>regulation of heterologously expressed antibiotic gene clusters</kwd><kwd>liponucleoside antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group award-type="grant" id="award-1"><funding-source>

MK730-62F2 and were discovered in 2003 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These compounds consist of a central (+)-caprazol ring structure with an attached &#x003b2;-hydroxy fatty acid of variable length, by which we differentiate between caprazamycins A-G. The &#x003b2;-hydroxy fatty acid is linked to an uncommon 3-methylglutaryl (3-MG) moiety (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Caprazamycins exhibit strong antimycobacterial activity, for example, against a range of drug-resistant strains of <italic toggle="yes">Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and clinically relevant strains of <italic toggle="yes">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 6.25&#x02013;12.5 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Semi-synthetic analogs of caprazamycin were generated, and among them, compound CPZEN-45, a 4-butylanilide derivative, showed the highest antibacterial activity and improved pharmacological properties (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This compound entered clinical trials for the treatment of tuberculosis and is currently tested as a drug candidate in aerosol powder form for inhaled administration (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The mode of action of caprazamycins is to inhibit the phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase I (MraY translocase), which catalyzes the first membrane-bound step in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). We previously identified the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to produce caprazamycins and the closely related liposidomycins in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. MK730-62F2 and <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. SN-1061M, respectively (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For further investigation, both gene clusters were heterologously expressed in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> M512, generating strains <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/cpzLK09 and <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01. Liposidomycins carry a characteristic sulfate group at the (+)-caprazol, but sulfated caprazamycins have also been detected to a smaller extent (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Caprazamycins feature a permethylated rhamnose moiety attached to the 3-MG motif. However, as the genes for the synthesis of the deoxysugar are encoded outside of the gene cluster, only aglycons are produced upon heterologous expression (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The formation of liponucleoside antibiotics, especially of caprazamycins, has been extensively studied over the past decade (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The shared structural and biosynthetic features of caprazamycins and liposidomycins strongly indicate matching dependencies on primary metabolism for precursor supply. Interestingly, both BGCs show a highly similar genetic arrangement, and putative promoter regions are located at the same positions with regard to their genetic neighborhood (referred to as corresponding promoter regions). All four pairs of corresponding promoter regions share a high degree of DNA sequence identity, ranging between 52% and 72% (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="F1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of caprazamycins and liposidomycins (top).

Especially as the biosynthesis of caprazamycins and liposidomycins would feed from the same routes of primary metabolism. This is of particular relevance when a biosynthetic pathway is transferred between bacteria, e.g., by horizontal gene transfer or by the introduction into a heterologous host.</p><p>We previously investigated the regulatory influence of <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512 on the heterologously expressed gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin. This study revealed a &#x0201c;crosstalk&#x0201d; between the host primary metabolism and the novobiocin BGC, mediated by regulators that directly bind to the heterologous gene cluster and modulate novobiocin precursor supply as well (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Therefore, we used DNA-affinity-capturing assays (DACAs) with subsequent semi-quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) as a powerful tool to screen the whole proteome of a bacterial culture at a fixed time point for binding to an immobilized DNA sequence. This method has also been applied to investigate the regulation of the antibiotic gene clusters encoding for actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>We now demonstrate that fine-tuned regulation of the heterologous host <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512 affects the expression of two similar biosynthetic pathways, thereby manipulating the production of caprazamycins and liposidomycins. Using comparative DACAs, we show that regulatory proteins from the host indeed bind to the heterologously expressed gene clusters and affect the production of the respective compounds. We identify the binding site of an uncharacterized TetR-family regulator (TFR) and present a deduced consensus sequence for this protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of putative promoter regions and transcriptome analysis of the heterologous producer strains</title><p>A comparison of the genetic organization of the caprazamycin and liposidomycin BGC shows obvious similarities (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). All genes are arranged in the same order, with most of them sharing significant sequence similarity with each other, indicating common mechanisms for biosynthesis, transport, and regulation. The highly conserved AraC-type cluster-situated regulators (CSRs), Cpz9 and LpmG, exhibit 77% similarity (69% identity) on amino acid level. Although both CSRs affected caprazamycin and liposidomycin production, respectively, only LpmG overexpression resulted in a significant threefold increase in liposidomycin production (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). This is in accordance with previous reports that AraC-type regulators typically function as transcriptional activators (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Notably, <italic toggle="yes">cpz9</italic> overexpression did not have an effect on caprazamycin production. We thus speculate that the bottleneck in this pathway is not related to the abundance of its biosynthetic enzymes. To identify regions in the BGCs that could be targeted by regulatory proteins from <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512, we searched for intergenic regions larger than 100 bp. We determined four putative promoter sites, which are located at the same positions within both clusters. These corresponding promoter pairs were designated as P<italic toggle="yes">cpz6</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmD</italic>, P<italic toggle="yes">cpz9</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmG</italic>, P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic>, and P<italic toggle="yes">cpz24</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmV</italic>, which share 59%, 52%, 58%, and 72% of DNA sequence identity, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The intergenic region of 302 bp between <italic toggle="yes">cpz5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">cpz6</italic> (431 bp between <italic toggle="yes">lpmC</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmD</italic>) most likely contains promoters for both genes, which are transcribed in opposite directions. Another putative promoter region was identified upstream of the regulatory genes <italic toggle="yes">cpz9</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmG</italic> (103 and 259 bp, respectively). Overlapping open reading frames and intergenic regions &#x0003c;90 bp indicate that the genes <italic toggle="yes">cpz10-cpz31</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">lpmH-lpmY</italic> are likely transcribed as one polycistronic mRNA. This makes the putative promoters of <italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> (149 and 128 bp, respectively) an essential regulatory node. The last selected pair of intergenic regions, P<italic toggle="yes">cpz24</italic> (280 bp) and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmV</italic> (286 bp), would be large enough to facilitate a potential binding of the RNA polymerase and was therefore included in the DACA experiments.</p><p>The putative promoter regions were selected as bait sequences for DACAs in order to identify binding proteins from the heterologous host <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512. Confirmation of promoter regions was obtained by RNA sequencing of three biological replicates of each heterologous producer strain (<italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/cpzLK09 and <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01). Analysis of the transcriptome data revealed a highly similar operon structure for the caprazamycin and liposidomycin BGC with a continuous transcription of genes <italic toggle="yes">cpz10-cpz31</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmH-lpmY,</italic> respectively. However, there is a slight increase in transcription of genes <italic toggle="yes">cpz24</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmV</italic>. As the intergenic regions upstream of these genes are large enough to serve as putative promoters, we decided to include these regions in the following DACA experiments, although their transcriptional impact seemed to be of minor importance. As regions P<italic toggle="yes">cpz6</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmD</italic> form a bidirectional promoter and neighboring genes <italic toggle="yes">cpz5</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">cpz6</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmC</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">lpmD</italic> show strong transcription in our transcriptome data, these regions were included as well. We were also interested in investigating which regulators from the heterologous host bind directly upstream of the CSR genes. Therefore, we included regions P<italic toggle="yes">cpz9</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmG</italic>. According to the RNA-sequencing results, the putative promoter pair of P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> confers the strongest transcriptional activity within both gene clusters (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2 to S5</xref>). These two regions were thus included as bait sequences for the DACAs as well. For amplification, all intergenic regions were extended, reaching into the neighboring genes to ensure the trapping of proteins whose binding sites may overlap with the codon regions.</p><p>We additionally screened the caprazamycin and liposidomycin BGCs for transcription factor binding sites <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic>, using the recently published database LogoMotif (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, only one potential binding site could be detected in each BGC, and no regulator could be predicted to bind to both gene clusters. Therefore, we pursued our goal to identify binding proteins by experimental approaches using DACAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>20 L cultivation of heterologous strains for the production of whole-cell protein</title><p>To obtain whole-cell protein for the DACA, <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/cpzLK09 and <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01 were both individually cultivated in 20 L bioreactors. Samples for the determination of cell dry weight and liponucleoside production, as well as samples for RNA and protein extraction, were collected over a period of 90 hours (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In this experimental setup, <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/cpzLK09 entered the exponential growth phase 18 hours after inoculation. Caprazamycin aglycon levels constantly increased over 90 hours up to approximately 50 mg/L. <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01 exhibited a lag phase for 36 hours after inoculation and then entered exponential growth. Liposidomycin production was detectable only after 60 hours, but levels increased rapidly up to 6 mg/L after 90 hours of fermentation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and C</xref>). Transcription rates of the biosynthetic genes <italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> were lowest after 36 and 48 hours, and highest after 54 and 72 hours, respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and D</xref>).

The two selected time points reflect different stages of cell growth, either before or at the time of maximum production of liponucleoside antibiotics. This enhances the probability of trapping both activators and repressors that may only be expressed over limited periods of time.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="F2"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Growth curve and production levels of <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/cpzLK09 (A) and <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01 (C) during 20 L fermentation.

A total of 2,214 proteins were trapped on the promoter regions and identified by subsequent mass spectrometry with semi-quantitative abundances measured as label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities between 1.67E+07 and 1.2E+12 (see <xref rid="SuF1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data Set S1</xref> for a full list of all detected proteins). The vast majority of them bound to more than one tested promoter (83% and 85% in the DACAs with the caprazamycin and liposidomycin promoter regions, respectively) and were considered nonspecific. At the four intergenic regions of the caprazamycin BGC (and the negative control P<italic toggle="yes">hrdB</italic>), a total of 1,906 proteins were detected, while at the liposidomycin BGC, 1,540 proteins were detected. Comparing both data sets, most proteins bound at least once in both gene clusters (1,232), 674 proteins were found to bind exclusively in the caprazamycin BGC and 308 in the liposidomycin BGC. By defining specific binding as binding to only one of the promoter regions of both gene clusters, we drastically reduced the number of proteins of interest (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, regarding this strict definition of specificity, it must be noted that even proteins binding to multiple promoters within one gene cluster (but not P<italic toggle="yes">hrdB</italic>) may still represent specific binders.

We searched for proteins that only bound to either one of the corresponding promoter pairs (P<italic toggle="yes">cpz6</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmD</italic>, P<italic toggle="yes">cpz9</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmG</italic>, P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic>, or P<italic toggle="yes">cpz24</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmV</italic>) and ended up with three candidates matching this criterion (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>). These were a MarR-type regulator (Sco2987), which bound to P<italic toggle="yes">cpz6</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmD</italic>, and two TetR-family regulators (Sco4385 and Sco5956), binding to the P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> promoter pair. For the caprazamycin BGC, Sco2987 was found only at 54 hours, while for the liposidomycin gene cluster, it was detected at both tested time points. LFQ intensities were roughly similar in all samples in which Sco2987 was found, ranging from 1.35E+08 to 7.52E+08.

One precursor supply pathway, which was recently studied by our group, is the leucine-isovalerate-utilization (<italic toggle="yes">liu</italic>-) pathway, comprising genes <italic toggle="yes">sco2776-sco2779</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic>. B&#x000e4;r et al.

Interestingly, a well-studied cAMP receptor protein (Crp)-type regulator, Sco3571, was shown to strongly activate the transcription of the first <italic toggle="yes">liu</italic>-pathway gene <italic toggle="yes">sco2776</italic> by Gao et al.

However, it bound nonspecifically to all tested promoter regions <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>).

To this end, the genes <italic toggle="yes">sco2987</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">sco4385</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">sco5956</italic> were individually cloned under the control of the strong, constitutive <italic toggle="yes">ermE</italic>* promoter into the replicative vector pUWL-apra-oriT, resulting in plasmids pSW4 (<italic toggle="yes">sco2987</italic>), pSW6 (<italic toggle="yes">sco4385</italic>), and pSW7 (<italic toggle="yes">sco5956</italic>).

Therefore, pSW5 (encoding Crp-type regulator Sco3571) and pSW6 (encoding TetR-type regulator Sco4385) were transferred into <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01. Again, the presence of pSW5 elevated production levels by approximately threefold. Interestingly, under the influence of pSW6, the production levels were within the boundaries of biological variability as in the empty vector control (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The enhanced liponucleoside production by <italic toggle="yes">sco3571</italic> overexpression may be explained by an improved supply of the 3-MG precursor via the <italic toggle="yes">liu</italic>-pathway (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The regulatory mode of action of Sco4385 is unknown, but the different effects of its overexpression within the two heterologous producer strains spiked our interest. To identify the underlying molecular mechanisms of Sco3571 and Sco4385, we next aimed to perform gene deletion studies. Thus, we deleted both genes individually in the heterologous strains <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/cpzLK09 and <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01. While the deletion of gene <italic toggle="yes">sco3571</italic> led to accelerated growth and sporulation of the mutant strains, in accordance with previous observations (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the deletion of <italic toggle="yes">sco4385</italic> showed no morphological phenotype. Cultivation and semi-quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the culture extracts revealed that the deletion of s<italic toggle="yes">co3571</italic> in the heterologous caprazamycin producer strain led to a reduction in production rates of 15%&#x02013;53%, compared to the intact strain. This result supports the hypothesis that Sco3571 is a positive regulator of heterologous caprazamycin production. However, the results for <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01 were inconclusive in all repeated cultivations of the <italic toggle="yes">sco3571</italic> knockout mutants. The individual mutants showed considerable variations in liposidomycin production of 70%&#x02013;640%, compared to the unmodified heterologous strain. The deletion of gene <italic toggle="yes">sco4385</italic> had no significant impact on antibiotic production in both heterologous producer strains (data not shown).</p><p>Hence, we speculated that the recognition sites for Sco4385 within the promoters P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> could be located at different positions, allowing the regulator to facilitate diverging effects on the downstream genes upon overexpression.

The extended promoter regions of <italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic>, as applied in the DACA experiments, were divided into 14 segments, respectively. Thus, each segment spans 50 bp in length and overlaps with the upstream and downstream segments by 25 bp (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Incorporation of a biotin tag was performed through the annealing of complementary oligonucleotides with the anti-sense strand carrying a single-stranded overhang for a biotinylated ReDCaT linker (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). DNA&#x02013;protein interaction of Sco4385 with the 50 bp DNA segments was assessed using BLI. This technique detects molecular binding to a coated sensor surface through the wavelength shift of a light beam, which is proportional to the thickness and molecular weight bound to the surface (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A control experiment with unspecific DNA (50 bp segment of the <italic toggle="yes">hrdB</italic> promoter) was also conducted as a negative control. This resulted in a minor wavelength shift of 0.35 &#x000b1; 0.05 nm. The analysis of all recorded shifts (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8 and S9</xref>) revealed distinctive binding at P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> 1 and P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> 4 with intensities of 1.01 &#x000b1; 0.06 nm and 0.66 &#x000b1; 0.02 nm, respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

The differential dissociation pattern of Sco4385 with segments 7 and 8 indicates that the binding position is not entirely covered by the overlapping region alone (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S9</xref>).

Some bacterial strains are optimized to minimize the production of secondary metabolites from the host itself (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), thereby aiming at an enhanced production of the desired compound with less metabolic background. It is also a successfully employed approach to circumvent working with pathogens, such as biosafety level 2 organisms (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and to facilitate genetic studies on the respective BGC (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). At the same time, the regulatory fine-tuning of the BGC or metabolic changes occurring within the host organism are largely underexplored. Here, we addressed this question by using the highly similar caprazamycin and liposidomycin gene cluster for a comparative approach to unravel interactions between the host&#x02019;s proteome and the newly incorporated BGCs.</p><p>With our approach using DACAs and subsequent protein detection via mass spectrometry, we identified a new regulator influencing caprazamycin production. By focusing on proteins that bind solely to corresponding promoters of both gene clusters, we identified three proteins out of 2,214 host proteins, matching this criterion. A comparably low number in contrast to the overwhelming amount of binding proteins initially identified in our assay. This could indicate that the regulation of the caprazamycin and liposidomycin BGCs in the same heterologous host is rather BGC specific and distinct, even for the biosynthesis of these two highly similar compounds. The identified TFR Sco4385 bound specifically to the predicted main promoter regions of both gene clusters, P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic>. Based on our RNA-sequencing data, these promoter regions confer a strong impact on the transcription of downstream biosynthetic genes (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2 to S5</xref>). This observation was further supported as overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">sco4385</italic> in the heterologous caprazamycin producer strain significantly increased caprazamycin production. However, overexpression in the heterologous liposidomycin producer strain did not affect liposidomycin production levels. Notably, TFRs are the most abundant group of transcriptional regulators in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The genetic organization of <italic toggle="yes">sco4385</italic> and neighboring genes suggests a putative gene cluster ranging from <italic toggle="yes">sco4383</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">sco4386</italic> (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S11</xref>). While the function of gene <italic toggle="yes">sco4386</italic> remains unknown, gene <italic toggle="yes">sco4383</italic> is annotated as a 4-coumarate-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase and <italic toggle="yes">sco4384</italic> as an enoyl-CoA hydratase. These enzymes are most likely involved in fatty acid metabolism. Although the majority of TFRs act as transcriptional repressors, there are numerous examples of TetR regulators operating as activators (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) or as proteins with dual regulatory functions (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Their highly conserved structure consists of nine &#x003b1;-helices, of which helices one to three are involved in DNA binding, while helices four to nine form a ligand-binding domain (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This characteristic tertiary structure perfectly matches the protein structure of Sco4385 as calculated by Colabfold (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), supporting its classification to the TetR regulator family. Based on our SEC-MALS measurements, Sco4385 is present in a homodimeric state as it is the case for most TFRs. Nevertheless, a common binding sequence for TFRs does not exist due to their highly variable DNA-binding domain. Aiming for a hypothesis to explain the differential impact of Sco4385 on caprazamycin and liposidomycin production, we used BLI assays to validate Sco4385 binding to P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic>. Thereby, we revealed a binding site in the regions encoding for the cluster-situated regulators, Cpz9 and LpmG, respectively, which were part of the extended promoter regions. An additional binding site in P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> in the center of the intergenic region between <italic toggle="yes">lpmG</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> was identified. The presence of binding sites at different positions within P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic> might explain differential effects concerning the production yields for caprazamycins and liposidomycins. This observation demonstrates that the same regulatory protein may confer different outcomes in the same host strain expressing highly similar BGCs. Our results therefore imply that the regulation of every heterologously expressed gene cluster needs to be investigated individually.</p><p>We also applied the deduced consensus binding sequence for Sco4385 in a whole genome search in <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic>, but no alternative binding sites were identified. Only when allowing two mismatches was the sequence found at six positions within the genome. However, all matches are localized within coding regions of genes, stressing the fact that the binding sites within the heterologously expressed gene clusters may not represent their genuine recognition sequence.</p><p>Besides the investigation of new regulators, such as Sco4385, we researched literature for known regulators with an involvement in precursor supply. Thereby, we identified Sco3571 from the <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512 host, which regulates a precursor pathway of caprazamycin and liposidomycin biosynthesis. Its published binding site (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) is present in two of the corresponding promoter pairs (P<italic toggle="yes">cpz6</italic>/P<italic toggle="yes">lpmD</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">cpz10</italic> and P<italic toggle="yes">lpmH</italic>). However, in our DACAs, Sco3571 was trapped on all our tested promoter regions in both the caprazamycin and liposidomycin gene cluster. According to Gao et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">sco3571</italic> by an inducible promoter enhances transcription of <italic toggle="yes">sco2776</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">liuB</italic>), the first gene of the <italic toggle="yes">liu</italic>-pathway, by approximately 17-fold. B&#x000e4;r et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) recently described how the central intermediate in 3-MG biosynthesis, 3-methylglutacoyl-CoA, can originate from two different biosynthetic routes, i.e., via the host&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">liu</italic> pathway and via the cluster-situated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase Cpz5. Therefore, the stronger transcription of the <italic toggle="yes">liu</italic>-pathway could, to some extent, be the reason for increased caprazamycin production yields, which we observed when overexpressing <italic toggle="yes">sco3571</italic> in the heterologous producer strain. As the 3-MG moiety is a central building block in liposidomycin biosynthesis as well, the same mechanism most probably applies to the enhanced production yields of <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01 upon <italic toggle="yes">sco3571</italic> overexpression. The overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">sco3571</italic> in both heterologous strains, <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/cpzLK09 and <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512/lpmLK01, strongly increased the production of the respective liponucleoside. This demonstrates that DACA studies can be applied to screen for regulators with known or unknown function. Such proteins are promising candidates in strain optimization strategies to enhance the production of a desired natural product.</p><p>While it is known that Sco3571 is a highly conserved and widely distributed regulator in Streptomycetes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the regulatory significance of Sco4385 is yet unknown. A BLAST analysis revealed that it is also highly conserved and widely distributed, with over 100 different <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> strains carrying homologs with over 90% identity to Sco4385 on the amino acid level. Furthermore, other <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> strains commonly used as heterologous hosts, such as <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces lividans</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces griseus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces albus</italic>, contain homologs with high similarity as well (99%, 86%, and 83%, respectively).</p><p>Moreover, the regulatory impact of the host-encoded regulators Sco3571 and Sco4385 on heterologous liponucleoside biosynthesis raised the question of whether similar regulatory mechanisms could apply to the native producer strains as well. Therefore, we searched for orthologs in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. MK730-62F2 and <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. SN-1061M, from which the caprazamycin and liposidomycin BGCs were derived, respectively (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For the Crp regulator Sco3571, we identified orthologs in both strains exhibiting 97%&#x02013;98% identity on amino acid level, respectively. Furthermore, we identified orthologs of Sco4385, showing 87% identity (90% similarity) in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. MK730-62F2 and 86% identity (90% similarity) in <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> sp. SN-1061M. The presence of highly conserved orthologs within evolutionarily distant species indicates the importance of both regulators and a strong selective pressure. Thus, the regulatory influences of Sco3571 and Sco4385, described in this study, may most likely be transferable to the native producer strains.</p><p>In our study, we present the complete set of proteins from the widely used heterologous host strain <italic toggle="yes">S. coelicolor</italic> M512, which bind to the main promoter regions of the caprazamycin and liposidomycin BGC. By either screening the data set for known regulators involved in precursor supply or selecting uncharacterized regulators based on their DACA binding patterns, we identified and characterized Sco3571 and Sco4385 as two new regulators affecting the heterologous production of caprazamycins and liposidomycins. We describe a general approach to identify candidate regulatory genes that need to be deleted or overexpressed to increase production levels of a desired natural product in heterologous systems. In addition, our data strongly imply that regulation of natural product biosynthesis can indeed be cross-linked to the regulation of precursor supply to ensure product formation in a heterologous host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, oligonucleotides, and culture conditions</title><p>All bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in <xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> in the supplementary material.
