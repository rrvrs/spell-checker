Introduction</title><p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), as defined by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), is a condition in which the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus results in a number of symptoms and complications [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. GERD affects 10% to 20% of the western population, whereas in Asia, its presence is lower, affecting less than 5% of the people [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease is characterized in most people by repeated reflux of contents of the stomach leading to unpleasant heartburn, regurgitation, and several other problems [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is caused by increased relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which leads to regurgitation of gastric acid. If prolonged, the acid can cause damage to the tissues of gastroesophageal mucosa [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Acid-neutralizing agents, which work by neutralizing the acidic pH, are well-known to provide efficient support in the treatment of stomach hyperacidity. Nowadays, upon availability of various medications, they are mostly used to enable rapid relief [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Salts of calcium, magnesium, and sodium are some examples of commonly used antacids. While they achieve a high rate of neutralization, with short time needed to achieve marginally acidic to neutral pH in the stomach, sustained relief still stays unaddressed, as the relief obtained via acid neutralization diminishes with continued secretion of stomach acid [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, since the approval of omeprazole in 1989, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become a widely spread choice of treatment for GERD and other acid-related disorders. They have proven to be better than earlier treatments in terms of gastric acid reduction [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They work by inhibiting the gastric H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase via covalent binding to cysteine residues of the proton pump, thereby suppressing acid secretion in the stomach. For example, the inhibitory effect of omeprazole occurs within 1 h of administration, the maximum effect occurring in 2 h, reaching a plateau on the fourth day of the therapy [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Several issues associated with formulations of PPIs remain unresolved even after decades of use. The vast majority of available PPI formulations are based on enteric coating of the drug particles, which is a technologically complex and lengthy process. Such coatings also move drug release from stomach to higher pHs present in the small intestine. Even when the coating is dissolved, absorption of PPIs is still influenced by residues of enteric coating [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], potentially increasing variability of drug absorption. Thus, delayed release of PPIs is a consequence of acid-resistant coating of either drug-containing particles, or the whole tablets. A necessity for such acid-resistance, enteric coating originates from chemical instability of PPIs at low pHs [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Protection of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is mainly achieved by synthetic polymers, e.g., cellulose acetate phthalate and methacrylic acid copolymers [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which create a barrier against the acidic stomach environment. Enteric coatings, being insoluble in the stomach at acidic pHs, allow for drug release in the small intestine due to the increased pH [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Omeprazole (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) is a commonly used PPI for the treatment of GERD and other conditions caused by excessive gastric acid [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Being a weak base, omeprazole acts as a prodrug that accumulates within the acid space of the parietal cell, where it is transformed via a proton-catalysed process to generate a sulphenamide, or corresponding unstable sulfenic acid. The sulphenamide (sulfenic acid) interacts covalently with the sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, thereby inhibiting its activity [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Omeprazole is a racemate and exists in two, S and R, optical isomeric configurations. The S-isomer generates higher plasma levels than the R-isomer, due to lower metabolic conversion by hepatic cytochromes (CYP2C19). The active molecular species (the sulphenamide) is non-chiral and is equipotent after generation from both isomers. The two isomers showed identical dose&#x02013;response curves when tested in vitro for the inhibition of acid production in isolated gastric glands [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Omeprazole is a BCS class II lipophilic drug known for its acid lability, with stability increasing at higher pHs. As evident from the results of an in-house experimental evaluation (<xref rid="sec2dot2-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="sec">Section 2.2</xref>), the drug decomposes if directly exposed to the natural acidic pH of the stomach (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The degradation half-life of omeprazole is reported to be 10 min at pH &#x0003c; 5, but 18 h at pH 6.5 [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that upon exposure to acidic conditions, omeprazole breaks down into five degradation products through mechanisms not limited to, but including, radical cation formation and nucleophilic attack of the pyridine ring on the imidazole ring [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. If omeprazole degradation happens prematurely in the stomach, its bioavailability is significantly reduced. Thus, omeprazole is usually protected using an enteric coating [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Studies comparing several brands of omeprazole have reported that the acid-suppressive effect of those products markedly differed due to differences in the performance of the enteric coatings [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Even though enteric coatings provide chemical protection of omeprazole, challenges of the coating process itself significantly impact product performance, requiring a high level of technical knowledge and manufacturing experience.</p><p>There is, hence, a need for a formulation of omeprazole, which in addition to preventing its chemical degradation, will also allow for a simpler manufacturing process, immediate release of the drug, and its rapid absorption. Due to their acid-neutralizing effect, antacids can potentially be used to stabilize PPIs in the formulation. Zegerid (Salix Pharmaceuticals) is an example of such a formulation with an acid-neutralizing agent used along with omeprazole to prevent its decomposition by stomach acids. A clinical study showed that the Zegerid immediate-release formulation was efficient in providing a rapid onset of action, thereby helping to relieve heartburn associated with GERD [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This study, while proving fast relief originating from the administration of Zegerid, also showed overall non-inferiority to delayed-release Losec, which contains enteric-coated pellets [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. An immediate-release formulation of esomeprazole, similarly, using sodium bicarbonate as a stabilizing agent, showed rapid and sustained suppression of gastric acidity [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>While the mechanism of action of an immediate release formulation involving antacids is known, the reasoning behind selection of the most suitable antacid, from chemical and technological perspectives, still needs to be addressed. This study employs a technical approach to antacid selection, identifying the most effective antacid to be used in the formulation along with omeprazole. The aim of this research was to design an acid-neutralizing, stable, immediate-release formulation of omeprazole providing rapid release and absorption while employing standardly utilized manufacturing processes. An additional target of the formulation design was the size of the dosage form, i.e., the capsule as small as possible to aid easy swallowing. Chemical stability and hygroscopicity of the chosen formulation, indicating achieved pharmaceutical quality of the product, were tested in accordance with standard guidelines [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study in humans was used to compare the product performance to acid-resistant, delayed-release Losec (omeprazole marketed in 1989 in the form of enteric-coated pellets filled in hard gelatin capsules).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00161"><title>2.

In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study</title><p>The pharmacokinetic study was conducted as an open-label, non-randomized, single dose comparative bioavailability study in 18 healthy adult volunteers under fasting conditions (20 subjects were enrolled in this study; however, 2 subjects did not complete this study due to intermittent illness). The single dose was administered along with 200 mL of water. The washout period was set to be at least seven days. Healthy adult male and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding female volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years with body mass index 18.5 and 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (inclusively), non- or ex-smokers were eligible to participate in this study.

The HPLC/MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was equipped with 1250 Transcend pumps, and a PAL HTS autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Sweden) was employed. Chromatographic separation was achieved with gradient elution on a Luna C18(2) 100 &#x000c5; (100 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm) analytical column fitted with a Luna C18(2) Mercury (20 &#x000d7; 4.0 mm) guard column from Phenomenex, (Torrance, CA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of MeOH and water at flow rate 0.6 mL/min. Monitoring of the analyte and respective internal standard was achieved using TSQ Quantiva tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source (HESI) operating in the positive ionization mode. Quantitation was performed using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the following mass transitions: <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 346 to 198 for omeprazole, and <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 349 to 198 for d3-omeprazole. The linear dynamic range of the method in human plasma containing K2EDTA was from 10.0 to 3000.0 ng/mL. The concentrations were calculated using a linear regression model with weighted least squares (weight = 1/c, where c is the nominal concentration of the respective calibration sample).</p><p>Main pharmacokinetic parameters, such as maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>(0&#x02212;t)</sub>, measured by linear trapezoid method), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>(0&#x02212;inf)</sub>), and terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>half</sub>), were determined by non-compartmental methods using Phoenix WinNonlin, version 8.3 (Certara, Radnor, PA, USA). Statistical analysis was generated using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-pharmaceutics-17-00161"><title>3. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-pharmaceutics-17-00161"><title>3.1. Chemical Stabilization of Omeprazole</title><p>The average liquid volume of the fasting stomach prior to ingestion of any water is reported to be 28 mL, with a range of 18&#x02013;54 mL [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Omeprazole is known to be stabilized against acidic degradation when in a mixture with alkaline compounds. Hence, several such protectants were evaluated, testing their neutralizing activities in 54 mL of 0.1 M HCl. This is the maximum amount of gastric acid that would have to be neutralized to protect omeprazole against acid hydrolysis. Antacids screened in this study were bicarbonates (sodium, potassium), carbonates (calcium, magnesium), hydroxides (magnesium, aluminum), magnesium oxide, and meglumine.</p><p>The rates of pH increase and bulkiness of the material were used as the main parameters to select the stabilizing agent, as the aim of this study was to reduce the capsule size as much as possible, while still providing sufficient stabilization of omeprazole. The most ideal stabilizer would be the one with high bulk density (low volume), while also providing swift pH elevation. Based on these criteria, meglumine and MgCO<sub>3</sub> were excluded from further evaluation early on due to bulkiness of these materials (high volume, due to low bulk density). Their use would result in large capsules that could eventually cause difficulties in swallowing, hence negatively affecting patient compliance. Among the other neutralizing agents, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and MgO showed superior pH increase and were selected for further studies. NaHCO<sub>3</sub> exhibited the ability for rapid pH increase, while MgO, although demonstrating somewhat slower neutralization kinetics, achieved the highest pH levels.</p><p>As it was necessary to understand the release kinetics of omeprazole in the presence of acid-neutralizing agents, the next step was to perform in vitro dissolution measurements, including pH tracking in simulated gastric conditions. These measurements were expected to provide reliable information on the ability of MgO and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to protect omeprazole from degradation.</p><p>The mechanism of action of omeprazole protectants is based on simple neutralization, and can be described as follows:<disp-formula>HCl + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> &#x02192; NaCl + CO<sub>2</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O</disp-formula><disp-formula>2HCl + MgO &#x02192; MgCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</disp-formula></p><p>Since one molar equivalent of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is required to neutralize one mol of HCl, 5.4 mmol of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> would be required for 54 mL of 0.1 M acid, which is the maximum amount of gastric acid. However, if an equimolar amount of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was used, formation of CO<sub>2</sub> and consequent acidification of solution could cause unwanted omeprazole degradation. NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was, therefore, added in quantities greater than 5.4 mmol to ensure sufficient stabilization of omeprazole. The dissolution experiments, hence, involved varying amounts of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, with two specific quantities introduced: 7.6 mmol and 13.1 mmol (the upper level corresponding to the quantity of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> found in already marketed Zegerid). Only 13.1 mmol (matching the upper limit of the amount of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) of MgO was used for this initial observation, with plans to test the lower quantities if the results of initial testing confirm suitability to use MgO. Amounts of stabilizing agents greater than 13.1 mmol were not considered due to bulkiness of the blend and the need for larger capsule size, which would be difficult to swallow.</p><p>Direct mixtures containing 20 mg of omeprazole and corresponding amounts of MgO or NaHCO3 were prepared, as per <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and filled in the capsules. In vitro dissolution tests were conducted under simulated stomach conditions.</p><p>Cumulative dissolution profiles of these formulations (prepared as per <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. It was demonstrated that the release of omeprazole occurred immediately, with measurable amounts of omeprazole already recorded at the first sampling point (5 min).</p><p>However, while the formulations of omeprazole with high (13.1 mmol) and low (7.6 mmol) amounts of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> behaved similarly to each other, showing cumulatively increasing release of omeprazole, the amount of omeprazole released from the formulation containing MgO started to decline even in the initial stages of the experiment. Such a decline suggests that omeprazole undergoes chemical degradation, clearly demonstrating insufficient protection of omeprazole by MgO against acidic conditions (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>While the dissolution results confirmed the protective and stabilizing effect of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in the formulation, the degradation of omeprazole observed in the formulation with MgO was unexpected. Moreover, at the end of the analysis of MgO-stabilized formulation, pH of the dissolution medium was significantly above the degradation threshold for omeprazole (approximately pH 10). This confirmed the initial minutes of acidic exposure to be critical for the degradation or stabilization of omeprazole. Indeed, measurement of the evolution of the pH in the medium during the initial minutes of the experiment revealed a direct correlation between the cumulative amount of omeprazole released and the magnitude of the initial pH increase (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). According to the existing literature data, if used without a protectant in acidic environment (pH &#x0003c; 5), at least half of the omeprazole degrades within the first ten minutes of the test [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The formulation containing MgO as an acid-neutralizing agent did not reach the threshold of pH 5 within those first 10 min (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), which resulted in the degradation of omeprazole. Additional research and a deep dive into the solid state of MgO would be needed to understand the reasoning behind the slower neutralization kinetics originating from MgO.</p><p>In summary, compared to MgO, the results of in vitro dissolution tests and pH measurements highlight the superior ability of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to rapidly neutralize gastric acid, effectively protecting omeprazole from degradation. The amount of 9.7 mmol of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was chosen to be used in the final formulation to account for an additional possible acidification during the neutralization reaction (formation of CO<sub>2</sub>) and individual variability in acid secretion.</p><p>Confirming the stability of the final formulation represented the next step of this study. Given the significant impact of moisture on product stability, the hygroscopicity of the formulation was further tested. Long-term chemical stability of the formulation was evaluated under standard room conditions, commonly used for storing pharmaceutical products.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-pharmaceutics-17-00161"><title>3.2.

In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study</title><p>Omeprazole&#x02013;NaHCO<sub>3</sub> hard gelatin capsules were used in a pharmacokinetic (PK) study conducted with healthy male and female volunteers under fasting conditions. The pharmacokinetic profile of the test formulation was compared to that of the reference formulation, delayed-release enteric-coated Losec 20 mg capsules. Key parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub>), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;inf)</sub>), and terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>half</sub>), were determined for both formulations (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The results demonstrated that under fasting conditions, the 90% confidence intervals for the test (omeprazole&#x02013;NaHCO<sub>3</sub> capsules) to reference (Losec 20 mg enteric-coated capsules) and ratio of AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub> of omeprazole fell within the standard bioequivalence acceptance range (80.00&#x02013;125.00%), indicating equivalent bioavailability of both formulations. Given the chemical protection of omeprazole in the delayed-release (enteric-coated) formulation, the confirmed bioequivalence in AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub> indirectly suggests the absence of chemically degraded omeprazole in the immediate-release formulation, which might otherwise occur in the acidic stomach environment. In other words, the in vivo results validated the in vitro findings, showing stable levels of omeprazole attributed to the rapid and efficient acid-neutralizing effect of sodium bicarbonate (pH 6 reached in less than 5 min).</p><p>As seen in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00161-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, in comparison to the reference formulation, the t<sub>max</sub> of the test formulation was noticeably shorter, being 30 min versus almost 2 h. The shorter t<sub>max</sub> was expected due to the rapid release of omeprazole from the test formulation, which occurs immediately in the stomach, eliminating any barrier to fast omeprazole absorption. The first measured omeprazole plasma concentrations from the test capsules (at the 15 min sampling point) were comparable to the C<sub>max</sub> of the delayed-release formulation. Moreover, at 30 min, which was the time when the immediate-release formulation had already reached t<sub>max</sub>, the absorption of the reference (delayed-release) formulation had just started, reaching its C<sub>max</sub> at 1.75 h. Given that proton pump inhibition begins within 1 h of omeprazole administration [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the faster absorption of the immediate-release formulation provides an earlier onset of proton pump inhibition and, subsequently, reduced acid secretion. Similar fast suppression of acid secretion was also observed with the immediate-release formulation of esomeprazole, which absorbed more rapidly compared to the delayed-release formulation [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Delayed absorption of the reference products was expected, as it consists of enteric-coated pellets that do not release omeprazole in the stomach (unlike the immediate-release formulation). The enteric coating physically protects omeprazole from exposure to acid (and consequent degradation), directing drug release to areas with higher pH. This mechanism results in a longer time needed to reach maximum plasma concentrations. On the contrary, the test formulation, due to chemical stabilization of omeprazole, does not differ from standard immediate release capsules, quickly releasing API already in the stomach.</p><p>The bioequivalence demonstrated by AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub> and short t<sub>max</sub> (30 min) of the test formulation indirectly confirms the acid-neutralizing effect of sodium bicarbonate and efficient protection of omeprazole from chemical degradation. Direct, rapid release of omeprazole within the neutralized gastric juice facilitated quick absorption from the small intestine.</p><p>However, it must be noted that the C<sub>max</sub> of the test (immediate-release) formulation was higher than that of the reference (delayed-release) formulation. This was expected, as the test formulation releases the entire quantity of omeprazole within a short period of time, whereas the process is prolonged for enteric-coated pellets. This phenomenon needs to be considered in relation to safety and efficacy of the product. In this specific case, such supratherapeutic concentrations do not represent safety risks, as higher product strengths (40 mg formulations) are regularly used in clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-pharmaceutics-17-00161"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The aim of this study was to design an acid-neutralizing immediate-release formulation of omeprazole that prevents its chemical degradation, ensuring rapid release and absorption, while also providing technological insights in the design of such formulation. Since omeprazole undergoes chemical degradation in acidic pH environments, currently available formulations primarily rely on enteric coatings and further investigation of the stabilization mechanisms is desirable, on both API and formulation levels. In addition, incorporating more comprehensive in vivo studies or computational modeling could greatly aid in the selection and optimization of the formulation strategies. In this study, mechanisms of omeprazole stabilization were investigated without the use of enteric coatings. Since sodium bicarbonate showed superior rapidity in pH neutralization, a combination of omeprazole and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was formulated into immediate-release capsules. NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, by neutralizing the acid in the human gastrointestinal tract, prevents the degradation of omeprazole. The amount of used NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was optimized to provide sufficient chemical stabilization of omeprazole while maintaining a sufficiently low concentration to support easy swallowing of the capsules. In vitro studies demonstrated the completion of acid neutralization in less than 5 min, enabling the fast release of omeprazole. In vivo studies further confirmed the rapid absorption of omeprazole and its availability for therapeutic effects. Plasma concentrations comparable to the C<sub>max</sub> of the delayed-release formulation (achieved by Losec in 1.75 h) were reached within 15 min after omeprazole release from the immediate-release formulation. Maximum concentrations of omeprazole were achieved in just 30 min, whereas, at that time, the absorption of a standard delayed-release formulation only started. Since proton pump inhibition begins within 1 h of omeprazole administration, faster omeprazole absorption allows for earlier proton pump inhibition and an earlier onset in the reduction of gastric acid secretion. Maximum concentrations of omeprazole released from a delayed-release formulation were reached in almost 2 h. In other words, the synergy of omeprazole and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> resulted in a stabilized all-in-one immediate-release formulation capable of achieving rapid acid neutralization, followed by rapid omeprazole release within the stomach, and rapid absorption from the small intestine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Ondrej Dammer and Jakub He&#x00159;t for their insights related to pH-dependent stability of omeprazole.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
