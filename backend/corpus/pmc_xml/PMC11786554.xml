In the current investigation, we focused on the nociceptor-localized K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cotransporter 2 (KCC2) to investigate its role in BPA-induced NP and related pain sensitization. A novel mice model of BPA on the middle trunk (C7) was established, and BPA mice showed&#x000a0;a significant reduction in mechanical withdrawal threshold of the affected fore- and hind- paws without affecting the motor function through CatWalk Gait analysis. Decreased expression of KCC2 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was detected through Western blot and FISH technology after BPA. Overexpression of KCC2 in DRG could reverse the hyperexcitability of DRG neurons and alleviate the pain of BPA mice synchronously. Meanwhile, the calcium response signal of the affected SDH could be significantly reduced through above method using spinal cord fiber photometry. The synthesis and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was also proved reduction through overexpression of KCC2 in DRG, which indicates BDNF can also act as the downstream role in this pain state. As in human-derived tissues, we found decreased expression of KCC2 and increased expression of BDNF and Tr&#x003ba;B in avulsed roots of BPA patients compared with normal human DRGs. Our results indicate that nociceptor-localized KCC2 can suppress BPA-induced NP, and peripheral sensitization can be regulated to reverse central sensitization by targeting KCC2 in DRG at the peripheral level through BDNF signaling. The consistent results in both humanity and rodents endow great potential to future transformation of clinical practice.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13578-025-01354-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Brachial plexus avulsion</kwd><kwd>Neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>Central sensitization</kwd><kwd>Peripheral sensitization</kwd><kwd>KCC2</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82072526</award-id><award-id>82330036</award-id><award-id>32071002</award-id><award-id>82221001</award-id><award-id>82302681</award-id><award-id>82302880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xian</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Ceng</given-names></name><name><surname>Cong</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013076</institution-id><institution>National Major Science and Technology Projects of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0203100 (2021ZD0203104)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Ceng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017550</institution-id><institution>Shaanxi Science and Technology Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022TD-49</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Ceng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Society of Chinese Bioscientists in America (SCBA) 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par18">Brachial plexus avulsion (BPA) is the most severe injury of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) involving the upper extremity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Not only can it bring motor function loss of the affected limb, but also results in paresthesia of the innervation territory. Well-designed reconstruction surgical procedures can help restore satisfactory motor function after avulsion injury. However, the residual neuropathic pain (NP) is still an unsolved issue that needs special attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If the pain is not effectively controlled, the following comorbidities will further worsen the quality of life of patients and their families. According to previous reports, the NP occurrence rate after BPA can reach up to 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], while there&#x02019;s still little known about the underlying mechanisms.</p><p id="Par19">Injury on the somatosensory pathway, including&#x000a0;the PNS level and the&#x000a0;central nervous system (CNS) level, can induce severe pain, and the characteristic chronicity of this pain will further complicate the pathophysiology of the progress of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. BPA is a kind of injury that involves both PNS and CNS, which is a different injury from others, such as SNI-induced NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and CFA-induced inflammatory pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Accumulated evidence shows pain sensitization plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of BPA-induced NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Targeting BDNF at the peripheral level can reverse the peripheral sensitization and related mechanical allodynia of BPA mice, and blocking the EZH2 in anterior cingulate cortex and the receptor of CCL2 in spinal dorsal horn (SDH) can also control the central sensitization and achieve an analgesic effect of BPA model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An increasing number of evidence revealed dorsal root ganglion (DRG) at the peripheral level as the generator of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while, the afferent and efferent fibers have lost connection with the spinal cord once the BPA happens. Whether specific regulation of DRG neurons can synchronously control the activity of SDH and what is the domination role at the DRG to SDH loop level in BPA-induced pain is still unclear.</p><p id="Par20">K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cotransporter 2 (KCC2) is a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> extruder that uses the K<sup>+</sup> gradient for maintaining a low concentration of intracellular Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, which is almost expressed in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There are dynamic changes in the expression of KCC2 during maturation of CNS, and destruction of KCC2-mediated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport will attenuate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition effect of signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This phenomenon has also been identified in several pathological disorders, including neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Decreased KCC2 expression was observed in SDH tissue of NP mice and was&#x000a0;proved to regulate pain state at the spinal cord level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and similar decreased level of KCC2 was also observed in inflammatory pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. KCC2 in higher levels of CNS, such as the&#x000a0;medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and&#x000a0;the hippocampus, has also been&#x000a0;proven to play an important role in pain regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Upstream brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high affinity receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) is the mostly identified possible cascade reaction that participates in the process of pain in CNS through regulating downstream KCC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The middle trunk (C7 root) of the brachial plexus was carefully dissected. A soft silk thread was used to hook the C7 nerve root and pull the thread with constant traction toward the distal limb to best mimic the avulsion mechanisms of root avulsion injury in clinic. Then, the DRG body of the C7 could be observed in the stump of the avulsed root.

Starting with 0.008&#x000a0;g, filaments were applied to stimulate the plantar surface of the left fore- and hind- paws. The &#x02018;positive responses&#x02019; to the stimulation were recorded including rapid flicking and/or biting, licking and shaking of the paw while excluding walking movements. Each filament was applied for 10 times, and the positive paw respond frequency was recorded.

The activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be treated as a reliable index of neuron activities in the whole nervous system.

The existing treatments show little analgesic effect on this kind of pain. To explore whether avulsed cervical nerve roots (including DRG soma) of BPA patients share similar molecular profile as BPA mice, we collected the avulsed nerve end of patients with chronic pain during surgery. A 31-year-old male patient was diagnosed with complete root avulsion of the brachial plexus according to a series of examinations including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, SFig 7A). The onset of pain is early and becoming increasingly severe. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score of pain during first admission of this patient reached up to 8 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The decreased expression of KCC2 in the affected DRG of BPA mice was confirmed through using both IHC at the translational level and FISH at transcriptional level. Specific genetic manipulation of KCC2 in peripheral DRG could reverse the hyperexcitation of DRG neurons and alleviate the pain state induced by BPA. Meanwhile, the calcium activity of the corresponding cervical SDH could be decreased synchronously. Possible molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon was also explored. Nociceptor-localized KCC2 suppresses the release of its upstream BDNF from presynaptic terminals that innervated into superficial laminae of SDH, and this maybe the possible molecular basis of the analgesic function of it. Similar molecular changes of nerve roots from human present great translational potential of the current study to clinic.</p><p id="Par47">Chronic pain is becoming a global burden worldwide that affects millions of people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Neuropathic pain (NP) often persists or manifests with recurrent painful states, with prevalence ranging from 6.9 to 10% of the general population according to epidemic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The chronicity characteristic of NP strongly suggests its complicated mechanisms during the occurrence and maintenance process. Diverse disorders including both function and molecular plasticity changes on the somatosensory pathway of pain transduction have been observed and reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of pain hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain induced by BPA are still poorly understood. Rodrigues-Filho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] reported the classical lower trunk BPA rat model and the detection of rats showed persistent mechanical and cold allodynia without affecting thermal hyperalgesia of both ipsilateral and contralateral hindpaws, and similar results were also observed on mice model reported by Quint&#x000e3;o and his collegues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Following BPA related research focused on&#x000a0;exploring new model, pain mechanisms and motor neuron regeneration are gradually started, referring to narrative review by Xian H et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, an unsolved problem in terms of pain behavioral tests is all the behavioral tests are performed on other extremities except the avulsed one. Previous studies have proved glial cells were activated both in injured and uninjured level of cervical spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] reported astrocytes activated on the avulsion side and microglia activated on bilateral side of cervical spinal cord under BPA-induced pain state. Interestingly, glial cells activation at higher C3-C4 level of dorsal horn in lower trunk C8-T1 of BPA may also play an important role in facilitating pain transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These may be the reason why previous BPA models show mechanical pain on other paws except the injured paw. Multiple trunks avulsion of brachial plexus can lead to paralysis of the affected forelimb, which is unable to conduct pain behavior tests on the injured paw directly. Whether this indirect pain response detection can represent the real pain state of BPA models is still ambiguous. This novel designed single 7th root avulsion model we used in this study showed no impairment of motor function of the affected forepaw, which laid a good foundation of the following pain behavioral tests. Persistent mechanical allodynia through direct detection of the affected forepaw after BPA could be treated as a reliable parameter of pain state of BPA mice. Similar decreased mechanical threshold of the ipsilateral hindpaw could be considered as the result of central sensitization in spinal cord, which is in line with the previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While, whether top-down crosstalk occurred between cervical level and lumbar level in spinal cord under BPA-induced pain state is still unknown. Another problem is that the existing investigations are scattered, and there&#x02019;s still a lack of in-depth study relating the integrality of pain transduction on the somatosensory pathway, especially on the level of crosstalk between peripheral and central levels.</p><p id="Par48">Central sensitization is assumed to have close relationship with chronic pain. The peripheral nerve ending innervates into the superficial laminae of SDH where synaptic transmission first takes place, and the nociceptive signals from afferent fibers are enhanced during this process under pathophysiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The increased release of neuroactive factors from nociceptive primary afferent terminals after nerve injury, including BDNF, was proven to produce and lead to pain hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The pivotal phenomenon of synchronized hyperexcitation activity at the level of both peripheral and central has recently been recognized in the pathophysiological process of NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], while, investigation relating the underlying molecular basis remains sparse. Pain exists in other parts of the body except the injured area is considered as the external representation of central sensitization. Through using whole-cell patch&#x02011;clamp recording and spinal cord fiber photometry, the synchronized hyperexcitation activity of DRG (the peripheral level) and SDH (the central level) was detected under BPA-induced pain state. This could be the functional mechanism for that BPA mice showed pain behavior not only on the affected paw, but also on other paws. Thus, to further explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we focused on peripheral localized KCC2. Overexpression of KCC2 in DRG could reverse the decreased mechanical allodynia induced by BPA of both ipsilateral forepaw (the peripheral level) and hindpaw (the central level), and agonist of KCC2 can lower the hyperexcitation of DRG neurons and relive pain at the same time. Interestingly, level of calcium activity of SDH could also be reduced through peripheral manipulation of KCC2. These results provide the evidence on the crosstalk between PNS and CNS after BPA-induced pain sensitization, and the central sensitization could be regulated through the peripheral method by targeting KCC2 in DRG neurons.</p><p id="Par49">The movement of Cl<sup>&#x02010;</sup> is crucial to neuronal Cl<sup>&#x02010;</sup> homoeostasis and plays an essential role in regulating neuronal excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

While, inhibition of GABAergic neurons has been well studied at&#x000a0;the CNS level, more and more GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors have also been identified at the PNS level. It is reported that &#x003b1;2, &#x003b2;3, &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b3; subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expressed in DRG soma and nerve fiber ends, and the plasticity change expression of them under pain state showed their different roles in pain modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

We conducted IHC and FISH technology to test the expression of KCC2 in DRG of BPA mice, and the results showed the fluorescence intensity decreased. Quantitative analysis using western blot showed the same decreased expression profile of KCC2 in DRG under BPA-induced pain state. These evidence confirmed the expression of KCC2 in DRG, and the function based research above proved its analgesic role at the peripheral level. These findings also provide evidence that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor can function normally at the peripheral level.</p><p id="Par50">BDNF, as a member of neurotrophin family of neurotrophic factors, is known for its effects on neuronal survival and growth, also playing crucial role in synaptic development and plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

At the level of CNS, overexpression of BDNF after injury can lead to downregulation of the downstream KCC2 through its receptor Tr&#x003ba;B, which is critical in regulating excitation homeostasis condition of neurons in the superficial lamina of SDH and spinal projection neurons, and this downregulation can further impair the inhibition effect of GABAergic neurons, thus initiates pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This mechanism of disinhibition effect mediated by BDNF-Tr&#x003ba;B-KCC2 signaling is also proved in higher level of CNS during chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Accumulating evidence shows persistent activation of peripheral nociceptors following nerve injury/inflammation could enhance the presynaptic input from periphery to postsynaptic dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Numerous neurotransmitters released from nociceptive terminals participate in this pathological process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Our study identified BPA-induced the overexpression of BDNF in DRG, and the hyperexcitation state of neurons can increase excitatory evoked BDNF release from nociceptive terminals to the superficial lamina of the dorsal horn. Overexpression of KCC2 in DRG could in turn reduce the synthesis and release of BDNF and achieve pain relief. These evidence strongly suggest that peripheral KCC2 can suppress BPA-induced neuropathic pain and related central sensitization through its upstream BDNF signaling in reverse. Surprisingly, the expression tendency of KCC2 and its upstream BDNF and Tr&#x003ba;B in tissues derived from BPA patients is consistent with the changes in BPA mice, and the KCC2 positive neurons have a&#x000a0;close colocalization relationship with Tr&#x003ba;B also hinting their close interaction possibility. This provides a robust evidence of clinical transformation in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par51">In sum, our study showed the possibility of manipulating central sensitization through peripheral method, which could avoid numerous side effects of CNS medication delivery. This molecular based therapeutic method also points to a novel therapeutic strategy with promising prospect of clinical translation. On considering the possible molecular mechanism mediated by peripheral KCC2, we proved DRG localized KCC2 participated in feedback down regulation of its upstream BDNF at the DRG to SDH loop level, which provides a theoretical basis for the future accurate treatment of this kind of pain. Yet, unraveling the complex mechanisms of pain is still a long way to go, and investigations based on human tissues will do&#x000a0;accelerate the pace for future clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
