ligates molecular building
blocks in
a robust and high-yielding manner and has found major application
in the rapid modification of important molecular actors in biological
systems. However, the high reactivity of click handles often correlates
with decreased stability, which presents a significant challenge in
the practical application of these systems. In the current study,
we describe a survey of the stability of commonly deployed click manifolds
across a range of widely used ligation conditions. Incompatible click
handle and ligation condition combinations are identified, with kinetic
half-lives and side products of each undesired reaction determined,
including the assessment of stability over extended periods and in
a protein environment. This data set provides researchers with a roadmap
to expediently determine the most appropriate click reaction conditions
for any given bioorthogonal application, thus elevating the probability
of success of procedures that utilize click chemistry.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic xlink:href="bc5c00095_0010.jpg" position="float"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic xlink:href="bc5c00095_0008.jpg" id="tgr1" position="float"/></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-1"><funding-source>

by Sharpless in 2001
as a reaction that must be wide in scope, give very high yields, generate
only inoffensive byproducts, and be stereospecific.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"/> In the past two decades, click chemistry has revolutionized
a range of disciplines, from chemical biology through to radiochemistry,
protein engineering, and materials science.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> The
copper-catalyzed azide&#x02013;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has enabled
notable progress in combinatorial chemical synthesis as it offers
mild, reliable, and high-yielding reaction conditions and has also
inspired novel approaches within polymer science, including the development
of rapid and modular dendrimer syntheses.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/> The development of click chemistry has underpinned innovation in
chemical biology through its ability to avoid cross-reactivity with
the diverse range of functionalities present in a biological milieu.
This bioorthogonal approach provides a valuable means of selectively
derivatizing biological systems, from the synthesis of protein conjugates
to profiling enzymatic activities within whole cells and animals.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content>
</p><p>The CuAAC reaction is the most commonly used click reaction;<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/> however, its dependence on the use of metal catalysts
presents a key limitation, as these can promote the generation of
toxic reactive oxygen species, which often precludes its applications
in a cellular context.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/> This limitation
of the CuAAC process prompted the development of strain-promoted variants,
which remove the requirement for toxic metal catalysis. Bertozzi and
co-workers described the strain-promoted azide&#x02013;alkyne cycloaddition
(SPAAC) in 2004, in which a strained alkyne rapidly ligates an azide,
affording a triazole.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"/> The group demonstrated
the applicability of SPAAC reactions by the selective, covalent modification
of biomolecules in cellular systems with no observed toxicity.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Further click reaction classes have been
developed, which have
broadened our toolbox to study biological processes in their native
settings,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"/> including, but not limited
to, the strain-promoted alkyne&#x02013;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC),
ketone condensation, and the strain-promoted inverse electron demand
Diels&#x02013;Alder (IEDDA) reactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). Each of these reaction classes offers
unique strengths within specific applications; notably, the bioorthogonal
nature of these reactions has underpinned significant developments
in chemical biology. For example, the CuAAC reaction enables the incorporation
of small, relatively stable reactive handles into chemical probes,
with limited disruption of target&#x02013;ligand interactions and physicochemical
properties of the parent molecule.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Meanwhile,
the major advantage of the IEDDA reaction is its rapid kinetics of
around 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>,
and thus it can be used to monitor and image reactions or processes
in a biological setting.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/> As such, Sharpless,
Bertozzi, and Meldal were awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in
2022 for the &#x0201c;development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal
chemistry&#x0201d;.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"/> Numerous excellent
reviews detailing each of these reactions and their extensive application
are available, including Oliveira et al.,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/> Meldal et al.,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"/> Moses et al.,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"/> Mackenzie et al.,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"/> Kaur et al.,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"/> and Nair et al.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"/>

as click handles within the listed click reactions. Michael addition
and thiol&#x02013;ene reactions are included within the figure, as
they are not formally click processes but are often considered as
bioorthogonal click reactions due to their rapid kinetics and innocuous
byproducts.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/> Furthermore, there is known
reactivity associated with maleimides; therefore, we deemed it suitable
for assessment in this comparative study. Norbornenes are only discussed
in the context of IEDDA reactions herein due to the requirement for
photoactivation of their thiol&#x02013;ene reaction. Photoactivated
click reactions are not discussed herein.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bc5c00095_0001" id="gr2" position="float"/></fig><p>Due to the inherently high reactivity
of most click
handles, they
can be susceptible to undesirable cross-reactivity. In many applications,
this is not an appreciable concern, as the rate of the click reaction
generally surpasses that of any competing reaction pathways. Click
reactions can be compromised, however, when the competing reaction
occurs prior to initiation of the desired click reaction. For example,
when generating antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) or chemically linked
bispecific antibodies, ligation of a chemical linker containing a
click handle to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) or antibody fragment (Fab)
is often carried out prior to a click reaction.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> During this ligation, the click handles
may be exposed to conditions that promote the undesired cross-reactivity.
For example, cysteine conjugation reactions require reducing agents
such as tris&#x000ad;(2-carboxyethyl)&#x000ad;phosphine (TCEP) to reduce the mAb interchain
disulfide bonds to liberate free thiols under aqueous conditions.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/> Therefore, the click handle employed must be
stable to TCEP, free thiols, aqueous conditions, and other chemical
groups on the conjugation warhead. Conditions used for the subsequent
click reaction must also not interfere with the mAbs themselves; for
example, CuAAC conditions may cause oxidation of mAb binding regions,
which may potentially decrease target binding.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Click reactions are a final stage of many multistep
workflows,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"/> and many researchers are focused
on attaching
two reactive groups to proteins, which can be done chemically or via
genetic code expansion.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> Therefore, it
is imperative during experimental design to understand how all experimental
parameters could impact the selected click reaction and whether the
click handles are compatible with reaction conditions throughout.
As there is no universal click reaction class suitable for all applications,
the benefits and limitations of each click reaction should be carefully
considered before the selection of a reaction for a specific application.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"/> There are several excellent reviews addressing
the challenges and limitations of click reactions, which enable practitioners
to consider the choice of click reaction suitable for a given application.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

</named-content> However, to our knowledge, no authoritative comparative study has
been performed to assess the stability and general applicability of
common click handles across a range of standard reaction conditions
in order to inform click handle selection for a specific application.</p><p>Accordingly, in the current study, we describe a comprehensive
assessment of the compatibility between commonly used click handles
and bioorthogonal reaction conditions. Incompatible click handles
and ligation condition combinations are identified, kinetic data of
the undesired reaction between each incompatible combination are discerned,
and a ranking of click handle stability within each ligation condition
is compiled. Competing reaction products were isolated and characterized
where possible, and long-term click handle stability studies for each
combination (at room temperature and 4 &#x000b0;C over 4 weeks) were
performed. Example click handles were also conjugated onto a model
protein to assess their stability within a protein environment, which
was compared with their small molecule stability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Generation
of Test Molecules Containing Common Click Handles</title><p>To investigate
the stability and general properties of click handle
functional groups, a literature survey was carried out to identify
14 representative click handles, which have extensive application
in chemical biology and provide broad coverage of commonly employed
click and bioorthogonal reaction classes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>

handles that are available for use in click reactions; therefore,
a subset were selected for profiling in this work, which are representative
of click handles commonly used in bioorthogonal applications. Fourteen
click handle-containing constructs were subsequently generated, attached
to a solubilizing linker consisting of a PEG-3 species, and a UV active
pyrimidine core to aid liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS)

compound in 12 ligation conditions: a range of six pH values, redox
active glutathione (GSH), two common disulfide reducing agents (TCEP
and dithiothreitol (DTT)), a CuAAC cocktail consisting of copper&#x000ad;(II)
sulfate, tris&#x000ad;(benzyltriazolylmethyl)&#x000ad;amine (THPTA), and sodium ascorbate,
the oxidizing agent dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), and the protein-denaturing
reagent urea. These conditions were selected to span a range of potential
conditions to which click handles may be exposed during frequently
executed chemical biology workflows. Each combination of click handle
substrate and ligation condition, in a 5 equiv excess if applicable,
was incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h prior to LCMS analysis, in which
the ratio of each compound (P) relative to the internal standard (STD)
was calculated.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"/> Combinations that showed
statistically significant instability over a 24 h period were determined
using Tukey&#x02019;s honestly significant difference (HSD) multiple

regression models fit to the ratios. Models were fit to each compound
separately with the 12 treatments and plate IDs included as categorical

Compatibility of 14 click handles with 12 ligation conditions following
a 24 h incubation at 37 &#x000b0;C in a 5 equiv excess of additive, if
applicable. Click handle abundance was measured and interpreted by
LCMS at 24 h time points, and the extent of material loss compared
to a constant concentration of internal standard (across three sample
replicates) was used as a measure of instability. Significance was
calculated using the HSD procedure described in the text. Combinations

of the maleimide to the condition. Maleimide <bold>10</bold> additive
results were confirmed by kinetic studies carried out at pH 2.8, which

whether combinations

after 4 weeks do so at both room temperature and 4 &#x000b0;C. However,
a group of combinations tested were stable for 4 weeks at subambient
temperatures; however, they were unstable at room temperature, such
as hydrazide <bold>8</bold> and base. Compounds that showed substantial
instability over the 4 week study, including DBCO <bold>5</bold>,

BCN <bold>3</bold>, cyclopropene <bold>4</bold>, norbornenes <bold>6</bold> and <bold>7</bold>, and TCO <bold>12</bold>. Within this
substrate
class, it was pleasing to observe a differentiation in the ligation
conditions, which resulted in instability, offering a choice of click
handle based upon stability in the selected reaction conditions. The
norbornene species provide a more stable alternative to other strained
species within IEDDA reactions, while BCN <bold>3</bold> displays
poor long-term stability across several reaction conditions. However,
norbornenes demonstrate much slower IEDDA kinetics than other strained
species, further highlighting the compromise required between stability
and the rate of click reaction.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Compatibility studies of TCO <bold>12</bold> provided more variable
data than the other compounds screened; however, the data were still
statistically valid. It was demonstrated that this was not solubility
driven (solubility &#x02265; 661 &#x003bc;M) and is potentially due to
light-mediated isomerization of TCO to the <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic> isomer.
It has been reported previously that copper and thiols can promote
TCO isomerization, likely via a radical pathway, which can result
in unusual kinetic profiles.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> However, a surprising
finding here was the stability of TCO <bold>12</bold> to thiols GSH
and DTT over a 24 h period. All of this should therefore be considered
when selecting TCO as a click handle, and due to this variability
in TCO <bold>12</bold> data compared with the other data collected,
this substrate was omitted from further investigation.</p><p>Many
of the strained species examined can also be used as dipolarophiles
within SPAAC and SPANC reactions in addition to IEDDA, and therefore
their differential stability can be harnessed within experimental
design across a breadth of click reactions and applications. For example,
DBCO <bold>5</bold> showed instability to TCEP over a 24 h period;
therefore, if reducing conditions are required, BCN <bold>3</bold> would be a more appropriate strained alkyne choice, or an alternative
reducing agent such as DTT should be employed.</p><p>SPAAC and SPANC
1,3-dipoles demonstrated reasonable stability across
the ligation conditions explored, for example, azide <bold>2</bold> instability was only observed in the presence of TCEP, resulting
in a Staudinger reduction, which is well documented in the literature.<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/> While both azide <bold>2</bold> and nitrone <bold>11</bold> were unstable in TCEP, they were stable to DTT, which is,
therefore, the preferable reducing agent prior to SPAAC or SPANC reactions.</p><p>Interestingly, standard conditions used for CuAAC reactions showed
incompatibility with around half of the click handles within 24 h,
suggesting that experiments that carry out orthogonal click chemistries
post-CuAAC reaction may not be successful. For example, dual-payload
ADC synthesis often requires two or more orthogonal click chemistries,
of which CuAAC is commonly used;<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"/> therefore,
the selection pool of available click chemistry pairs is limited by
the stabilities of many click handles in CuAAC conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Kinetic
Studies of Click Handle Instability</title><p>The click
handle and ligation condition combinations, which demonstrated statistically
significant undesired reactivity, were progressed to kinetic studies
to confirm observations from the initial compatibility studies. The
kinetic half-lives of each construct were determined and used to compare
relative rates of click handle undesired cross-reactivity under specific
ligation conditions. Each combination under investigation was incubated
at 37 &#x000b0;C, and then the relative abundance of the intact click
handle compound was monitored by LCMS, at 10 time points over a time
frame appropriate for the kinetics of each combination. The first-order
kinetics of each reaction were plotted, from which the half-life of
the reaction was calculated. For compounds with half-lives of &#x0003e;24

a robust corroboration between pH and rate of instability
of maleimide <bold>10</bold>, as exemplified in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B, where the kinetic half-lives of hydrolysis
of maleimide <bold>10</bold> in buffers ranging from pH 6 to 10 were
plotted against pH. Therefore, maleimides should be used in mildly
acidic conditions, unless confident that the desired reaction kinetics
are more rapid than the undesired base-mediated hydrolysis. Due to
the instability of maleimide <bold>10</bold> at pH 7.2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B), in contrast with its stability
in pH 2.8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A), each kinetic analysis of reactions between maleimide <bold>10</bold> and all of the additives were conducted at pH 2.8. Maleimide <bold>10</bold> and DHA showed no reaction at pH 2.8 (SI <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5c00095/suppl_file/bc5c00095_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S43N</ext-link>), indicating that the instability previously observed
was caused by the buffer of the reaction (PBS pH 7.2) and was not
caused by the DHA itself. Maleimide <bold>10</bold> instability was
observed in the presence of all other additives tested, however, at
pH 2.8; therefore, this instability was indeed caused by the additives
rather than the buffer conditions.</p><p>Tetrazine-H <bold>13</bold> also showed instability under basic
conditions; therefore, kinetic studies were also carried out at pH
2.8, at which it is stable. This revealed that conditions found to
induce tetrazine-H <bold>13</bold> cross-reactivity were indeed due
to the additive conditions rather than the buffer conditions. It should
also be noted that tetrazine-H <bold>13</bold> indicated much greater
instability in basic conditions than tetrazine-Me <bold>14</bold>,
which showed instability only in strongly basic conditions (pH 10),
with a half-life of around 4 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A), which is potentially due to the increased substitution
around the tetrazine ring.</p><p>Three of the constructs examined
reacted with GSH: BCN <bold>3</bold>, DBCO <bold>5</bold>, and maleimide <bold>10</bold> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A). Maleimide <bold>10</bold> rapidly reacted with the thiol with
a measured 4 min half-life,
as anticipated.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr"/> Of the two strained alkynes
assessed, which can be used in IEDDA (BCN only), SPAAC and SPANC click
reactions, BCN <bold>3</bold> was significantly more stable to GSH
than DBCO <bold>5</bold>, with a stark difference between their half-lives
(&#x0223c;6 h vs 71 min, respectively). DBCO <bold>5</bold> was also
reactive to TCEP, as noted in the initial incompatibility studies;
however, kinetic analyses demonstrated a half-life of greater than
24 h, suggesting that this combination may still be suitable for applications
that take less than a day, provided the buffer does not contain any
nucleophilic species in which the click handle is unstable to.</p><p>Three strained alkyne reactive species were also identified to
show instability in the TCEP: both tetrazines <bold>13</bold> and <bold>14</bold> and azide <bold>2</bold> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C). Interestingly, the kinetics of the undesired
reactions of both tetrazines <bold>13</bold> and <bold>14</bold> were
more rapid than that of azide <bold>2</bold>, despite the well-documented
reaction between azides and phosphines.<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/> Maleimide <bold>10</bold> also demonstrated instability toward TCEP,
with a kinetic half-life comparable to its undesired reactivity in
GSH. Maleimide <bold>10</bold> also showed instability when using
the second reducing agent tested, DTT, with a half-life of less than
an hour. Therefore, if using an excess of either of these reducing
agents prior to maleimide conjugation, a rigorous buffer exchange
step is required to minimize the extent of the undesired side reaction.
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) should ideally also be used
within the reducing agent containing buffer solutions to limit reoxidation
of the reduced disulfide bonds during these buffer exchanges.<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Of the species that were not stable to
CuAAC conditions, maleimide <bold>10</bold> and hydrazide <bold>8</bold> reacted most rapidly, with
half-lives of less than an hour (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D). Tetrazine-H <bold>13</bold> reacted at
a slower rate, with a half-life of around 4 h, and tetrazine-Me <bold>14</bold> reacted with a half-life of around 8 h. The kinetics of
these processes are slower than a typical CuAAC click reaction; however,
residual CuAAC reagents may interfere with subsequent click reactions
if these click handles are utilized.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Identification and Characterization

</p></fig><p>We observed that following the addition of soft nucleophiles into
maleimide <bold>10</bold>, the nucleophilic attack of water onto the

during maleimide conjugation reactions (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C).<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/> Maleimide <bold>10</bold> also reacted with TCEP, as previously discussed in a study
by Kantner et al.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr"/> Both a species containing
TCEP connected to the maleimide via a carbon&#x02013;phosphorus double
bond adjacent to a carbonyl and the hydrolyzed form were observed
throughout our study. The phosphorus-containing species was detected
during kinetic analysis; however, the hydrolyzed species was isolated
upon scale-up, suggesting that the purification conditions used triggered
the release of phosphorus from the construct. Both LCMS and NMR analyses
of the reaction product when maleimide <bold>10</bold> was incubated
in the presence of urea suggested a potential addition of urea into
the enone, followed by hydrolysis of the ring forming <bold>20</bold>.</p><p>Due to the large number of conditions under which tetrazine-H <bold>13</bold> was shown to be unstable, larger-scale reactions were carried
out instead using tetrazine <bold>21</bold>, which contained the click
handle alone, as a more significant quantity of material was available
for experimentation (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D). Tetrazine <bold>21</bold> was subjected sequentially to
different CuAAC cocktail components to determine which component caused
the cross-reactivity. This was determined to be sodium ascorbate,
after the addition of which a 2 Da mass increase was reported via
LCMS analysis, corresponding to a reduction. Earlier compatibility
studies suggested that reaction with TCEP also provided a compound
with the same mass with varying degrees of conversion over a 24 h
period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>).
NMR analysis revealed that the product structure of the reaction between
tetrazine-H <bold>21</bold> and both reducing agents was triazole <bold>22</bold> (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D). It is known that tetrazines can rearrange in this manner;<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr"/> however, to our knowledge, this is the first
report of the triazole product formed under these conditions.</p><p>Tetrazine-Me <bold>14</bold> showed a similar reactivity, undergoing
ring contraction to the corresponding methyl triazole <bold>24</bold>. However, reaction kinetics varied depending on the reducing agent
used, when compared with tetrazine-H <bold>13</bold>. Tetrazine-H <bold>13</bold> reacted most rapidly in sodium ascorbate compared with
TCEP, with the respective half-lives differing by around 3 h (241
min vs 53 min, respectively), while tetrazine-Me <bold>14</bold> reacted
much more rapidly in TCEP than sodium ascorbate, with half-lives differing
by over 7 h (44 min vs &#x0223c;8 h, respectively). This suggests that
if reducing agents are required prior to an IEDDA reaction, they should
be chosen according to the substituents present on the tetrazine ring.</p><p>Although neither tetrazine analogues <bold>13</bold> or <bold>14</bold> reacted with DTT over the time frame of the compatibility experiments
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A), a large-scale
reaction between tetrazine <bold>21</bold> and DTT was carried out
to assess whether DTT also causes a ring contraction observed previously
with TCEP, but on a much slower time scale. LCMS and NMR analyses
suggested that the ring contraction previously observed did not occur
using DTT. Instead, the data suggested a simple reduction of the tetrazine
to form dihydrotetrazine <bold>23</bold> (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D); however, isolation was difficult, potentially
due to further degradation or reoxidation to the tetrazine occurring.</p><p>Tetrazines <bold>13</bold>, <bold>14</bold>, and <bold>21</bold> also showed instability under basic conditions, resulting in the
production of at least seven compounds in the case of tetrazine-H <bold>21</bold> (reaction details can be found in the <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5c00095/suppl_file/bc5c00095_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">SI</ext-link> in the synthesis of click substrates section).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>On-Protein

(Fab) was reduced using TCEP, buffer-exchanged to remove any residual
reducing agent and then &#x0201c;rebridged&#x0201d; using the pyridazinedione
compounds to generate two click handle-containing Fab conjugates.
Each of these conjugates was subjected to four different ligation
conditions overnight (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C,D). These conditions were selected to cover a range of stable
and unstable combinations, as seen under small molecule conditions
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). Following
a 24 h incubation at 37 &#x000b0;C, each Fab conjugate was capped with
an excess of its corresponding click handle and then analyzed by intact
protein mass spectrometry to determine conversion to capped Fab conjugate.
Any uncapped Fab conjugate was associated with the instability of
the click handle, and an estimate of percent cross-reactivity was
calculated from the relative signal intensities of the Fab conjugate,
containing inactive click handle, versus the capped Fab conjugate
species.</p><p>As expected from the small molecule stability studies,
tetrazine <bold>26</bold> was stable at pH 7.2, and to GSH, and showed
full conversion
to capped Fab conjugate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D). Additionally, BCN <bold>25</bold> showed instability
to GSH, as observed in a small molecule setting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C vs <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A). However, BCN <bold>25</bold> also showed
instability at pH 7.2, CuAAC conditions, and TCEP. In the case of
TCEP, this was to a greater extent than to GSH, whereas it had been
stable in this condition previously, except for over a 4 week period
at room temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B). This suggests that a protein environment may sometimes
encourage the instability of click handles to reagents they are stable
to over a comparable time frame in a small molecule setting.</p><p>Tetrazine <bold>26</bold> was unstable under TCEP and CuAAC conditions
in a protein environment, as well as in a small molecule setting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>). However, a greater degree of instability was observed under
CuAAC conditions than TCEP in a protein environment, contrasting with
the kinetic rankings of tetrazine <bold>14</bold> as a small molecule
(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>). Similar levels of remaining active click handle
were observed for both tetrazines <bold>14</bold> and <bold>26</bold> under CuAAC conditions; however, tetrazine <bold>26</bold> showed
much greater stability to TCEP than tetrazine <bold>14</bold>. This
could potentially suggest that the increased steric bulk around the
click handle in some protein environments may protect the click handle
from undesired cross-reactivity. The lack of an IEDDA reaction observed
following incubation of conjugated tetrazine <bold>26</bold> with
TCEP and CuAAC conditions suggests that the aminotriazole product
formed under these conditions is unable to react within IEDDA reactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Decision Trees and Recommendations</title><p>After reviewing

click chemistry have been
identified, and key parameters to consider when selecting appropriate
click handles are presented through profiling 14 commonly used handles.
Although the individual reagents are considered to be bioorthogonal,
this work has shown that many are not orthogonal to each other, placing
limitations on their use in sequential click processes, e.g., in the
preparation of ADCs and related constructs. Incompatible combinations
of click handles and common ligation conditions have been identified,
the kinetic half-life of each of these undesired side reactions was
determined, and where possible, the undesired side products were identified.
Exemplar click handles were also conjugated onto an antibody fragment
to explore their stability within a protein environment. We envisage
that this comparative study will provide a roadmap to enable the expedient
