The optimal blending ratio of ultrasound-treated rice and potato starch was found to be 25:75, resulting in a product with enhanced stability and viscosity similar to xanthan gum. A mathematical model was developed to adjust the viscosity of clean-label starch to match xanthan gum at various concentrations and shear rates, showing high predictive accuracy (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.988). The clean-label starch was then tested in food applications, including as a thickener in tomato ketchup. In ketchup, samples with added clean-label starch exhibited similar serum separation and viscosity reduction as those with xanthan gum. Overall, clean-label starch shows strong potential as a functional, clean-label alternative to xanthan gum, offering both economic and nutritional benefits in food products.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10068-025-01825-y.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Clean label starch</kwd><kwd>Xanthan gum</kwd><kwd>Starch blending</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound</kwd><kwd>Modeling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></funding-source><award-id>2019R1A2C1010708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Yong-Ro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Rural Development Administration of Korea</institution></funding-source><award-id>RS-2019-RD007810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Yong-Ro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Seoul National University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Seoul National University.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recently, there has been a growing global trend toward the preference for &#x02018;&#x02018;clean label food&#x02019;&#x02019; (Cao and Miao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2023</xref>; Park and Kim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>). The initiative to designate foods with a clean label, signifying adherence to criteria such as the use of natural ingredients and minimal processing, originated in the United Kingdom during the 1990s (Baines and Seal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>). Current trends reveal an unprecedented level of consumer interest in the ingredients and manufacturing processes of food products. In other words, today&#x02019;s consumers are not merely opting for 'healthy food'; rather, they are meticulously scrutinizing the ingredients of their food and evaluating the environmental impact of the products they consume (Seo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). Consequently, the current clean label paradigm is being expanded to include the entire spectrum of food processing.</p><p id="Par3">Xanthan gum (XG) is among the most widely utilized hydrocolloids, attributed to its distinctive and beneficial attributes. It is synthesized by the bacterium <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic>, which is typically found on the leaves of plants such as those belonging to the cabbage family (Afnan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2023</xref>). The structural backbone of the xanthan molecule is similar to that of cellulose. However, the presence of trisaccharide side chains surrounding the primary chain gives xanthan a relatively rigid, rod-shaped structure. This unique structure imparts distinctive rheological properties, making xanthan highly useful in various industries (Garc&#x000ed;a-Ochoa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>). XG is valued in the food industry for its emulsion-stabilizing properties, especially in products like salad dressings and mayonnaises, where it helps create a desirable gel-like texture. Its thermal stability, compatibility with a wide range of food ingredients, and pseudoplastic rheological characteristics also significantly contribute to its extensive applications (Preichardt and Klaic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). Nevertheless, XG may be associated with various side effects, including the production of intestinal gas (flatulence) and abdominal distension (bloating). People who are exposed to xanthan gum powder might experience flu-like symptoms, as well as irritation of the nasal passages and throat, and respiratory issues (Sargent et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1990</xref>). Additionally, hydrocolloids are categorized as &#x02018;&#x02018;additives&#x02019;&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;&#x02018;ingredients,&#x02019;&#x02019; which could make XG less suitable for the current food trend promoting clean label products.</p><p id="Par4">Some alternatives to overcome these issues include the physical modification of starch, such as blending, ultrasound treatment, and pre-gelatinization. Starch is extensively utilized within the food industry for its functions as a viscosity modifier, freeze&#x02013;thaw stabilizer, and emulsion stabilizer. These properties are crucial for imparting functionality to foods and improving their texture and taste (Chen et al., 2003; Jobling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>). These effects can be further maximized through blending, ultrasound or pre-gelatinization. Consequently, these processes enable the substitution of conventional food additives with environmentally sustainable ingredients. As previously indicated, this method aligns with contemporary consumer food trends and has the potential to produce healthier and hypoallergenic food ingredients.</p><p id="Par5">This research focuses on developing clean label starch (CLS) as an alternative to XG through various physical treatment techniques such as ultrasound, blending and pre-gelatinization. Based on preliminary experimental results by Park and Kim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2023</xref>), rice and potato starches, chosen for their strong viscosity-enhancing effects when blended, were used. Regression analysis was performed to match CLS properties with those of XG, followed by a comprehensive examination of CLS&#x02019;s physicochemical characteristics. CLS was then incorporated into the formulation of tomato ketchup. An investigation was conducted to assess the stability of the ketchup.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par6">Rice starch was extracted from native rice (<italic>Ilmibyeo</italic>, Korea) through an alkaline steeping method as described by Kim et al.

Concentrated tomato paste was obtained from a local retailer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Production of clean label starch</title><p id="Par7">Blending, ultrasound, and pre-gelatinization treatments were used to manufacture clean label starch as a replacement for xanthan gum. Binary starch blends were prepared from rice and potato starch samples at different blending ratios (100:0, 75:25, 67:33, 50:50, 33:67, 25:75, 20:80, 17:83, 0:100) and then used in the experiment. For the ultrasound treatment, 30&#x000a0;g of starch was dispersed in 150&#x000a0;mL of distilled water. During the stirring process, ultrasound waves were applied using an ultrasound probe (VC 750, Sonics, USA). The operational parameters were set to a frequency of 20&#x000a0;kHz and a power output of 750 W, with the treatment duration established at 30&#x000a0;min. Samples with the final determined mixing ratio were dispersed in distilled water at a concentration of 3 wt% and gelatinized for 20&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with gentle stirring. After gelatinization, the starch pastes were stored at -80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;day to form frozen hydrogels. The hydrogels were then freeze-dried using a freeze dryer (FDS8508, Ilshin Biobase Co., Seoul, Korea) at -50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 5 mTorr for 3&#x000a0;days. The resulting dried gel was evenly crushed using a blender and stored at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pasting properties</title><p id="Par8">The starch's pasting properties were evaluated with a Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA 4 Newport Sydney, Australia). Following dispersion of 3&#x000a0;g of starch in 25&#x000a0;mL of distilled water, it was kept at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;min before proceeding with the experiment. The experiment involved heating to 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 7.5&#x000a0;min, maintaining the temperature for 2.5&#x000a0;min, and then gradually cooling to 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 7.5&#x000a0;min. During this procedure, pasting temperatures, peak viscosity, trough viscosity, and final viscosity were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Steady-state flow test</title><p id="Par9">A steady-state flow test was conducted using a rheometer (AR 1500ex, TA Instruments Ltd., USA) to simulate the viscosity of xanthan gum with clean-label starch paste.

The steady shear rheological properties of the samples were then described by fitting the data to the well-known power law model.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e285">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The degree of alteration in starch is influenced by the duration, temperature, frequency, and intensity of ultrasound treatment, as well as the starch's properties. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the pasting property data for rice and potato starch, highlighting the differences before and after ultrasound treatment. From these results, it was confirmed that peak viscosity (PV) increased after ultrasound treatment for both rice starch (from 4655&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;209.0 cP to 5275&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;229.2 cP) and potato starch (from 11,685&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;586.2 cP to 17,176&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;871.1 cP), demonstrating that ultrasound treatment could significantly enhance the thickening ability of these starches. Notably, this increase in viscosity was sustained through to the final viscosity (FV), indicating that the ultrasound-treated starches retained their structural integrity over the heating and cooling phases(Carmona&#x02010;Carmona-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>; Chan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). It is also noteworthy that both the viscosity and the stability ratio of the starches improved after ultrasound treatment. The stability ratio of paste refers to the ratio of viscosity at the onset of cooling to the maximum viscosity achieved before cooling (Tsakama et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>). The stability ratio rose from 0.396 to 0.436 for rice starch and from 0.119 to 0.139 for potato starch after ultrasound treatment. This improvement in the stability ratio suggests that the starch paste may become more resistant to shearing forces, enhancing its ability to withstand mechanical stress during processing. Furthermore, the observed increase in FV for ultrasound-treated starch indicates that, after the initial swelling and collapse of granules, the solubilized starch components were more capable of re-associating and forming a cohesive network during cooling (Sit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>). This effect may also be due to increased amylose leaching, which is a result of ultrasound-induced alterations in the internal structure of the starch granules. Rice starch (5.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9% amylose) and potato starch (25.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.2% amylose) were used in this study, and the greater amylose availability not only enhances the viscosity but may also improve the gel strength and cohesiveness of the starch, making it highly beneficial in applications that require stable and resilient gels (Biduski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>). These ultrasound-induced modifications underline the potential of ultrasound as a useful technique to modify starch functionality, improving its performance as a thickening and gelling agent in various food systems.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Pasting properties of starch before and after ultrasound treatment.

Additionally, the yield stress showed a substantial increase, suggesting enhanced structural framework within the blend (Coussot, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). Interestingly, when the proportion of potato starch in the blend was increased relative to rice starch, the synergistic effect on viscosity became even more pronounced. The data reveal that the viscosity-enhancing effect was optimized at a rice-to-potato starch ratio of 25:75. However, beyond this ratio, as the potato starch content continued to increase, the synergistic effect began to diminish. This optimal ratio of 25:75 for maximizing viscosity is likely due to the &#x0201c;packing density&#x0201d; effect, which refers to the arrangement and compactness of particles within a material. When granular particles are combined, packing density has a significant influence on properties like flowability, suspension rheology, porosity, permeability, and mechanical strength (Jung et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Kwan and Chen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>; Li and Park, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref>). Packing density can be inferred by the void content within the mixture.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Steady-state flow curve by blending ratio of ultrasound treated rice and potato starch</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10068_2025_1825_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">In fact, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the highest viscosity was indeed achieved at the 25:75 rice-to-potato starch ratio. This finding suggested that the rice starch granules filled the voids between the larger potato starch granules, thereby reducing the empty spaces seen when only potato starch is present as observed by a light microscope (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The rice starch in these voids likely generates frictional forces during shearing, which increases the mixture's overall viscosity (Hossen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). Wong and Kwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>) demonstrated that when two types of particles with different sizes are blended, the highest packing density is achieved with a small-to-large blending ratio of approximately 30:70, particularly when the particle size ratio is around 0.28. The results observed in this study appear to follow a similar trend, as the maximum viscosity (i.e., packing density) was reached at a rice-to-potato starch ratio of 25:75. This is consistent with the particle size ratio of rice starch (5.17&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m) to potato starch (25.21&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m), which is approximately 0.2, thus supporting the concept that an ideal mixing ratio of small to large particles can enhance the packing density and viscosity of starch blends.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Apparent viscosity (at 50&#x000a0;s.<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of rice-potato starch blends by blending ratio (<bold>A</bold>) and microscopic images of them (<bold>B</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10068_2025_1825_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">To produce CLS as a replacement for XG, ultrasound-treated rice and potato starches were blended at the optimum ratio of 25:75, gelatinized, and freeze-dried.

Therefore, to make CLS a viable industrial alternative to XG, it is necessary to adjust its viscosity to match that of XG at varying concentrations. Referring to previous study (Park and Kim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2023</xref>), the curve estimation technique was applied to determine the relationship between the apparent viscosity of CLS and XG at a shear rate of 50&#x000a0;s&#x0207b;<sup>1</sup>, resulting in the following equation:<disp-formula id="Equ2"><label>2</label><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e550">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

This equation provides the concentration of CLS required to achieve a desired viscosity level equivalent to that of XG at a given shear rate. For example, to determine the CLS concentration that matches the viscosity of a 2% XG solution at a shear rate of 30&#x000a0;s&#x0207b;<sup>1</sup>, substitute 30 for SR and 2 for X, yielding a Y value of 2.06. This means that the viscosity of a 2.06 wt% CLS solution is comparable to that of a 2 wt% XG solution at a shear rate of 30&#x000a0;s&#x0207b;<sup>1</sup>.</p><p id="Par19">To evaluate the predictive capability of the developed equation (Eq.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>), the predicted values were compared with actual experimental values. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows a predicted-experimental scatter plots of modeling and validation parts. In the modeling part, experimental data on the viscosities of CLS and XG at various shear rates were used to construct the regression equation. The strong alignment between observed data and predictions indicated the model&#x02019;s accuracy in capturing the viscosity relationship as a function of shear rate and concentration. Validation part then provides the predicted CLS concentrations needed to match the viscosity of XG at specific shear rates not used in the modeling stage, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of the equation developed. Since the slope of the trendline between the predicted and experimental values in validation part was approximately 0.903, and the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was calculated to be 0.988 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), it was concluded that CLS could effectively mimic the viscosity of XG under different conditions.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Predicted-experimental plotting for matching the viscosity of clean label starch and xanthan gum.

However, limitations in the model include a relatively small dataset and variability in starch properties, which can differ based on regional, seasonal, and processing factors. To improve the model&#x02019;s accuracy, future research should incorporate a larger, more diverse dataset that accounts for these variations. Additionally, the influence of external factors such as temperature and storage conditions on viscosity should be studied. Nevertheless, these findings are significant as they demonstrate the potential of CLS to replicate XG's characteristics through the synergistic effects of physical processing, achieving both 'economic' and 'clean label' status.</p><p id="Par21">Applications</p><p id="Par22">Thus far, the manufacturing process of CLS has been explored as a potential substitute for XG, a widely used thickening agent in food products. To evaluate CLS's ability to replicate the industrial characteristics of XG, it was tested in XG-based food products, with tomato ketchup being selected as a representative example due to the common use of XG to achieve its complex texture and stability (Omidbakhsh amiri E et al.., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). This application provided insight into CLS&#x02019;s potential to match the performance of XG in texture and quality, supporting its use in clean-label formulations.</p><p id="Par23">The physical properties of ketchup have a significant impact on user convenience, making it crucial to control them effectively. Ketchup is generally known to contain around 0.5% xanthan gum (Koocheki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>). In this experiment, simple tomato ketchup was prepared by mixing concentrated tomato paste with either XG solution or CLS solution, and the stability of each mixture was evaluated. Distilled water without a thickener was added as a control.</p><p id="Par24">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates the appearance and extent of serum separation in the manufactured tomato ketchup samples. Initially, there was no visible difference in appearance between the control group and the samples with added XG and CLS immediately after production. However, a slight thickening of the surface texture was observed in the XG and CLS samples, suggesting that these additives may enhance the initial stability and consistency of the ketchup formulation. Following centrifugation (315xg, 10&#x000a0;min), significant differences in serum separation were observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). In the control group, a notable 36.8% of the initial sample weight separated as serum, indicating a lack of internal cohesion that allowed considerable water loss (Song et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2024</xref>). In contrast, the XG and CLS samples exhibited minimal serum separation, with only 0.0% and 1.9% of the initial sample weight separating, respectively. These results suggest that the superior stabilizing properties of both XG and CLS, which effectively maintain the ketchup matrix's integrity. This stabilization reduces serum separation, ensuring improved product consistency, enhanced structural integrity, and a more desirable texture.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Application of clean label starch in ketchup. (<bold>A</bold>: appearance, <bold>B</bold>: stability from serum separation)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10068_2025_1825_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par25">Moreover, after two weeks of storage at 40&#x002da;C, the viscosity reduction observed in the CLS-added sample was nearly identical to that in the XG-added sample (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This outcome indicates that CLS not only matches XG in preventing serum separation but also demonstrates comparable efficacy in preserving the rheological properties of the ketchup over time. Such performance underlines CLS's ability to maintain product stability during extended storage, a critical factor in ensuring quality in food formulations. The ability of CLS to provide these functional benefits positions it as a viable and effective stabilizer in food formulations where structural stability, consistency, and consumer-pleasing attributes are essential. Consequently, CLS offers a promising clean-label alternative to traditional stabilizers like XG, aligning with industry trends and consumer preferences for transparent and natural ingredient labeling.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>The apparent viscosities that change during the 2&#x000a0;weeks storage at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (XG&#x02009;=&#x02009;xanthan gum, CLS&#x02009;=&#x02009;clean label starch).

Ultrasound treatment effectively enhanced the properties of rice and potato starch, leading to increased peak and final viscosities as well as improved stability ratios. By blending ultrasound-treated rice and potato starch at an optimal 25:75 ratio, CLS with excellent viscosity and gel-forming capabilities comparable to XG was produced. The manufactured CLS was easily dissolved in cold water, forming a viscous paste comparable to freshly gelatinized starch without additional heat treatment. To match the viscosity of XG at different concentrations, a predictive equation was derived, demonstrating the ability of CLS to replicate XG's viscosity under varying shear rates. The CLS's performance was validated against experimental data, showing a high degree of accuracy. In application, CLS was successfully incorporated into food products like tchoomato ketchup, where it showed promising results. In ketchup, CLS demonstrated comparable stability to XG, with minimal serum separation and viscosity reduction, confirming its suitability as a thickening agent.</p><p id="Par27">Overall, CLS offers an effective, economically viable, and clean-label alternative to XG, with applications extending to various food products.
