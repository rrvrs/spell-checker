This growing interest in body studies within sociology reflects how the body has become a central topic in sociological research (Shilling, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Social studies on the body have extensively explored how individuals engage with their bodies in various contexts (Shilling, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In other words, they have examined how race, class, gender, and fatness have shaped individuals' experiences with their bodies from the 1980s to the present. Sociologists have increasingly turned to the body as a critical aspect of both individual identity and social organization (Grogan, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Some scholars, such as Goffman (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>), examine how the body operates within social interactions, while others, like Foucault (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>), have demonstrated the power of discourse in disciplining and regulating bodies. Yet other scholars see the body as a form of physical capital and argue that bodies bear social class because of three major interrelated factors: social location, taste, and habitus (Bourdieu, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). However, sociological studies on the body from different perspectives are missing key dimensions that need to be addressed. In the next section, I will briefly illustrate some of the issues and gaps in sociological studies of the body concerning gender, race, and fatness. Most sociological studies focus primarily on women's bodies, with a predominant emphasis on the white race. Additionally, research tends to center on Western societies while neglecting other parts of the world. Furthermore, fatness is not adequately considered as a social issue, as many studies approach it solely from a medical or psychological perspective rather than examining its social and cultural implications. In addition, I will briefly illustrate the perspective of future about the sociological studies in terms of body, gender, and fatness.</p><sec><title>Most social studies focusing on women's body/bodies</title><p>Researchers in sociology and other academic fields related to fatness and gender have argued that men are less concerned about their weight or body image compared to women (Wolf, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Faludi, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bordo, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), Most researchers in different academic disciplines focus on women's bodies and body image. In the last century, women have been subjected to certain 'aesthetic pressures' more than men (Bell and McNaughton, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Since the 1960s, scholarship has focused on women's bodies more than men (Gilman, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Bell and McNaughton, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, some scholars have argued that men's current concern about their bodies is a new phenomenon (Bordo, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Therefore, studies on the male body and men's body concerns have emerged only recently (Wolf, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Faludi, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bordo, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>).</p><p>This transformation is particularly noticeable in contemporary Western societies, where men increasingly dedicate substantial time and effort to enhancing their physical appearance (Bergling, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Drummond, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Duncan, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Scholars and media outlets suggest that this trend stems from the growing emphasis on physical attractiveness within male culture, which prioritizes body aesthetics and appearance (Bergling, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Drummond, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Duncan, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kassel and Franko, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Yelland and Tiggemann, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The heightened focus on maintaining an ideal physique has been linked to rising concerns about body image among men, potentially increasing their susceptibility to body dissatisfaction and related psychological challenges (Boisvert and Harrell, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Chaney, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Morrison et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>In short, studies on bodies and gender have generally focused more on women's experiences with their bodies than on men's experiences. Even though attention to studies on men's bodies has been increasing in recent years, this field still needs further expansion. For example, these studies give more attention to the negative consequences of not adhering to ideal cultural body standards for women, such as eating disorders, social anxiety, dissatisfaction, and depression, while paying little attention to men's bodies and the consequences of not meeting these ideal standards. As a result, this has created a gap in body-related studies between men and women. On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies on bodies and gender face the same issue regarding gender representation. Men's bodies have received less attention than women's bodies in academic research (Wolf, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Faludi, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bordo, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Therefore, achieving a balance between studies on men's and women's bodies can provide a clearer picture of the inequalities between men and women in terms of body representation and societal expectations.</p></sec><sec><title>Most social studies in bodies focus on one race</title><p>The majority of academic research, and in particular, Western studies, has sought to study race and body by focusing more on white women and their concepts of beauty, self-esteem, body image, and body satisfaction, in comparison with other races such as Black, Latino, and others (Tiggemann, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jaffee and Mahle Lutter, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Casanova, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In addition, the intersection of race and gender has received increased attention in recent years (Casanova, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Some studies have argued that race and gender are both structures of social differentiation &#x0201c;whose markers are borne on the body&#x0201d; (Morris, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>: 133). Social scientists, psychologists, and scholars from other academic disciplines have sought to analyze how the Western ideal of body image can contribute to lower body image and self-esteem levels among non-white racial groups (Rucker III and Cash, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>).</p><p>However, recent studies in this field have found that African American women tend to have higher levels of positive body image and self-esteem compared to white women, which is largely attributed to a rejection of white beauty standards (Rucker III and Cash, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Jaffee and Mahle Lutter, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Casanova, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, some studies have been done about body acceptance among different races such as African American, Asian American, white or non-white Hispanic/Latina, and multiracial groups. For example, some studies examined how race impacts body acceptance among majority-race women as compared to ethnic minority samples. Most of this research was conducted with white women and measured their level of body satisfaction compared to that of minorities (Grabe and Hyde, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Hrabosky and Grilo, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kashubeck-West et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lovejoy, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Schaefer et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). More studies also sought to analyze the body and body image and body acceptance by using a comparative framework of white European or American women (Smolak and Striegel-Moore, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Many studies have found that white women worry more about their weight, have lower body satisfaction, more desire to hide body size with clothing, a higher level of eating disorders, and a higher level of body-related depression and anxiety compared with women from other racial groups (Rucker III and Cash, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Roberts et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Hesse-Biber et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Research suggests that cultural and societal pressures to attain a thin ideal are more pronounced among white women, contributing to heightened body dissatisfaction and a greater prevalence of disordered eating behaviors (Grabe and Hyde, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Shaw et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). These findings highlight the racial disparities in body image concerns and the influence of sociocultural factors on body perception and mental health.</p><p>Moreover, several studies have examined body image and dissatisfaction by comparing white and African American women. Strings (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) emphasizes that fatphobia has historical racial origins, where Black bodies (African American women) have been systematically marginalized and excluded from Western beauty standards. Research suggests that, overall, Black women tend to report greater body satisfaction and lower levels of body dissatisfaction compared to their white counterparts (Overstreet et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Merten et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Roberts et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In addition, Black women have fewer preoccupations with weight and have a lower level of eating disorders (Kronenfeld et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Black women are also more satisfied with their bodies compared to other women of different ethnic and racial groups (Sanderson et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Black women are happier with their bodies and they appreciate the special features of the race such as skin color, body shape, and lip size (Bond and Cash, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Mucherah and Frazier, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Furthermore, some researchers have attributed the differences in body image and satisfaction between African American and white women to the historical legacy of racism against African American, which has given them greater emotional resilience to overcome negative comments about their bodies from the dominant culture (Stombler and Padavic, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Additionally, some scholars have found that African American strongly adhere to their cultural identity, which enhances their body appreciation in contrast to the body standards of the dominant race (Brook and Pahl, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Although most of the literature related to race, body, and gender has focused on themes such as beauty, self-esteem, body image, body satisfaction, and eating disorders, few studies have examined the impact of the dominant culture (e.g., body image and beauty standards of white women in Western culture) on minorities and how these influences affect the body image and body satisfaction of minority groups (Hesse-Biber et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Additionally, little attention has been given to issues related to body and race, such as the experiences of minorities in different settings (e.g., college, school; Hesse-Biber et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). For example, some have studied the complexity of the relationship between the increased acculturation of dominant culture like the norms of White beauty and its impact on Black women's bodies (Roberts et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Smolak and Striegel-Moore, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). They found that Black women who attend colleges where there is a predominance of white women have more eating disorders (Roberts et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Smolak and Striegel-Moore, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), and are more concerned with body image than other Black women (Stice et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) and other women of color (Mulholland and Mintz, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Williams, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>).</p><p>In addition, much literature in recent years has shown that the standards of body image and satisfaction are different across cultures and historical periods, and that women experience their bodies in many different ways (Chrisler and Johnston-Robledo, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For example, although Latino women and African American women are less disturbed with heavier bodies than White women, Asian women prefer to be extremely thin unlike White women (Guan et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Moreover, studies have shown that young Korean women are more dissatisfied with their bodies than young American women (Choi and Choi, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some studies compared body dissatisfaction between Asian American females and other racial groups, and the result showed that Asian American females have greater body dissatisfaction than their European, Hispanic, and African American peers (Forbes and Frederick, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kennedy et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). They are also more concerned with body weight and eating disorders than White women (Nouri et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Most academic research and studies focused on body and race in different academic disciplines have examined how race can influence the body. Recently, more attention has been paid to the intersection of race and gender (Casanova, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) which can give a better understanding of how women/men of different races see their bodies in comparison to the dominant race. Most studies in different academic disciplines have sought to analyze the connections between race and body and how this relation can influence beauty, self-esteem, body image, body satisfaction, and body acceptance among races (Rucker III and Cash, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Jaffee and Mahle Lutter, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Casanova, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). These studies and scholar's contributions open doors for more studies and questions, such as, can race and body work differently in non-western societies, how can governments and official institutions play a role in reducing the influence of the perception of the body through race, social and economic status, as well as social life?</p></sec><sec><title>Most social studies in bodies focus on western societies</title><p>Most social studies on the body focus on Western societies (e.g., the United States and Europe) while giving little attention to other parts of the world (e.g., Middle Eastern societies, China, India, etc.). This trend can be attributed to the increasing academic interest in studying the body and the social experience of embodiment, which emerged in the 1990s in most Western societies (Shilling, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Turner, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The body, as a topic in sociology, has become a focal point for understanding comprehensive social life in Western studies. Various phenomena, problems, and issues in society are connected to the human body, influencing both everyday life and bodily experiences. The increasing focus of studies on some issues related to the body in sociology, as well as the development of medicine, health, and illness in Western countries, this led to the founding of the Journal of Body and Society which was first published in 1995 (Boero and Mason, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In addition, the American Sociological Association recognized a new area of study about the body and embodiment in 2008 (Boero and Mason, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Despite the growing academic interest in body studies within Western societies, this focus has not been equally extended to the study of bodies in other parts of the world. There remains a significant gap in sociological research regarding non-Western perspectives on the body and embodiment.</p><p>Literature on bodies in the English language in other parts of the world is also rare (Jafar and de Casanova, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>). Studies in this field have focused almost exclusively on the United States and Europe while most people live outside the United States and Europe (Jafar and de Casanova, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>). Therefore, studies and findings (In English Language) on the body in non-Western parts of the world remain significantly fewer compared to those conducted in Europe and the United States. In addition, it is hard to cover all the world, but at least there needs to be an attempt to produce comparative studies about the body in other parts of the world with Western studies. Therefore, achieving balance in this field helps to develop comprehensive body studies in terms of the nature of the body in different cultures and how individuals in these different cultures interact with their bodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Most social studies on the body do not focus on fatness as a social issue</title><p>Over the last few decades, the increase in gender studies has contributed to the emerging field of fatness studies (Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This field focuses on the social, cultural, psychological, economic, and historical aspects of fatness and seeks to explain how fat individuals are treated and represented. It views body weight and size as carrying a set of social meanings, which vary depending on gender, traditions, values, and cultural contexts. Consequently, these meanings may change over time and across different societies (Sobal and Maurer, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Therefore, fatness is perceived differently between cultures and across history in terms of accepting the fat body or not based on the social discourse in society (Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Even though studies on fatness and its effects have increased over the last decade, further research is needed to explore more areas of social life. This remains a fertile and expansive field that allows researchers to investigate various social phenomena, particularly those related to fatness and gender.</p><p>Some scholars analyze theoretical approaches to the study of fatness, and they categorize the study of fatness and weight as objectivist or constructivist (Sobal and Maurer, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The objectivist approach tends to describe the problems associated with fatness (obesity, ill health, etc.), and concentrates on describing the problem of fatness, while the constructivist approach concentrates on the ways an individual's body is defined based on its weight. It also focuses on the fact that, more than ever, a greater number of people are overweight (Sobal and Maurer, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>A constructivist approach studies the processes whereby various social actors and institutions have erected boundaries between normative and non-normative bodies (Foucault, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). As a result of such processes, the bodies are seen as different and separated based on the judgement of society as to what determines. fatness or thinness, or healthy bodies and unhealthy bodies (Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). All of these differences between bodies, either normative or non-normative, are considered social constructions. Thus, normative and non-normative bodies are linked to the social meanings that reflect the history, culture, tradition, values, and norms of certain nations. For example, social acceptability and respectability have always been linked to body size. Historically, the respectable body of both men and women [LA(1] was stout and sturdy, but now the respectable body is thin (Featherstone, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). This is especially so for women, and increasingly so for men as well (Galioto and Crowther, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Cordes et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>The gap in academic research regarding fatness and the body in feminist literature is evident. First, most research on fatness has been predominantly dominated by the medical paradigm (Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The focus has primarily been on viewing fatness as a medical issue. Medical analyses of fatness and the body have been widely disseminated, particularly in relation to specific medical concerns associated with fatness. For example, there were a large number of research projects about the ideal of thinness, dieting (e.g., Orbach, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Bordo, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), body norms and ideals, eating disorders (e.g., MacSween and Macsween, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hesse-Biber, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), but fatness and the experiences relating to being fat did not get more attention, and some studies do not deal with fatness directly but emphasize thinness or dieting (Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In addition, the majority of studies about fatness came from medical and psychological studies about the dangers of obesity (Harjunen, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). As a result, there is a limited amount of social scientific research on fatness. However, scholars have emphasized the importance of viewing fatness as a social phenomenon rather than merely a medical issue (Paus&#x000e9; and Taylor, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Fatness is a social phenomenon, and it is part of social reality that needs analysis and investigation by social science to understand its experience among different genders, races, and classes and how it impacts the everyday life of individuals (Paus&#x000e9; and Taylor, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). So, there is a limited amount of social scientific research on fatness. Fatness is a social phenomenon, and it is part of social reality that needs analysis and investigation by social science to understand its experience among different genders, races, and classes and how it impacts the everyday life of individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Social studies on bodies, gender, and fatness in the middle east: present and future</title><p>The importance of the body in sociological studies has increased for several reasons. First, the historical development of medicine, consumerism, and industry has contributed to understanding and analyzing the body as a system with meaning and a specific structure. In the 19th century, the rapid rise of consumerism and industrial development heightened interest in enhancing the body's efficiency and capabilities through exercise, diet, and management. These practices contributed to the regulation of the body and the promotion of better health (Shilling, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Boero and Mason, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>In the 20th century, the entertainment industry expanded significantly, and its development was remarkable. The greatest focus was then on industries that valued consumption more than production (Turner, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). According to some scholars, &#x0201c;The transition from the Renaissance to the modern world thus involves a transition from the &#x02018;open body' linked to the public world through ritual and carnival to the &#x02018;closed body' of individualized consumer society&#x0201d; (Turner, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, p. 39; Adelman and Ruggi, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The body, especially the external body, was the cornerstone of this development. The body has become a central element in the commodification of everyday life. Advances in medical health and beauty have also influenced perspectives on treatments such as plastic surgery, which, in various ways, reshape the body to align with cultural expectations or evolving global standards, either directly or indirectly (Turner, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). In addition, the development of entertainment industries such as sports and film, along with cultural openness between countries, increased travel and cultural convergence, and the rapid advancement of media, has turned the body into a primary marketing tool. This has also led to the creation of body preferences within societies, such as the idealization of a thin and muscular body based on gender norms, as well as negative reactions toward physical forms that do not conform to these standards (e.g., a fat body; Turner, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>).</p><p>On other hand, we can see the important development of tech and how this development of tech impact on our lives including our bodies (Arnaldi et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). For example, social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, and X function as sites of body surveillance and self-regulation, where individuals construct and curate their digital selves based on dominant beauty ideals. Studies suggest that these platforms reinforce unrealistic beauty standards, influencing body image perceptions and self-esteem (Aparicio-Martinez et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Perloff, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Research also indicates that social media usage is associated with increased body dissatisfaction, particularly among young women and adolescents (Fardouly et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tiggemann and Slater, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Furthermore, the algorithmic nature of these platforms amplifies content that idealizes certain body types, contributing to a culture of self-comparison and validation-seeking behavior (Holland and Tiggemann, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Given these dynamics, it is essential for body studies to integrate digital subjectivities as a key element in examining contemporary body politics. Future research should delve deeper into the intersection of technology, identity, and embodiment, recognizing influences of digital spaces in shaping body norms</p><p>Moreover, future studies should address several gaps in body research, such as: examining how different cultural contexts influence body image perceptions and body representations, especially in non-Western societies (e.g., the Middle East, Asia, and Africa). Investigating how shifting cultural norms and societal expectations affect body perceptions over time, particularly in relation to gender, race, and class. In addition, incorporating sociological, psychological, and anthropological perspectives to provide a more holistic understanding of body image formation across different cultural and historical contexts. Moreover, exploring how government regulations, public health initiatives, and socio-economic policies impact body norms and societal attitudes toward body diversity.</p><p>While there has been an increasing focus on body studies in various cultural contexts, research on the Middle East remains limited. Although this study touches upon the region, it does not extensively reference Middle Eastern scholars or in-depth research from the area. Future research should aim to incorporate contributions from Middle Eastern scholars to enrich the understanding of body norms beyond Western frameworks.</p><p>Feminist scholars such as Abu-Lughod (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and Mahmood (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) provide critical tools for analyzing body politics in Middle Eastern societies. While this paper does not delve deeply into their frameworks, their work can serve as a foundation for developing alternative methodologies and epistemologies that challenge other perspectives, such as those critiqued by Donna Haraway.</p><p>In conclusion, in the last few years, scholars have increasingly paid attention to the body as an important aspect of individual identity. They have studied race, class, and gender and how they are related to the body. However, it is rare to find studies that emphasize the body and fatness across cultures. In other words, many researchers have studied and analyzed the body in Western societies, but we have few studies that have made cross-cultural analyses of the experiences of bodies (Gailey and Harjunen, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In addition, many scholars have studied women's experiences of their bodies, but as of yet, not much scholarship has focused on men (Burlew and Shurts, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), even though it is a growing field (Daniel and Bridges, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Castonguay et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec><title>Research design</title><p>This study employs a systematic literature review to analyze the spectrum of coverage and focus distribution on body characteristics in existing literature.

Additionally, cross-cultural and interdisciplinary studies that examine body image across different societies (e.g., Gailey and Harjunen, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Turner, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) were considered relevant.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The study excluded: non-peer-reviewed sources, such as blogs, news articles, and opinion pieces.
