High-content image analysis (HCIA) is a multi-parameter approach for cytotoxicity screening. This study provides new insights into HCIA-derived response patterns of murine J774A.1 cells and primary human alveolar macrophages (hAM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Several compounds were compared with reference groups (cationic amphiphilic drugs and apoptosis inducers) at different concentrations (0.01 to 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M). After incubation, cells were stained with fluorescence markers and HCIA was performed (Cytation&#x02122; 5 Cell Imaging System). Ten parameters were analysed: non-adherent cells, increased or reduced mitochondrial activity, membrane permeability, cell area, nuclear area, polynucleated cells, vacuole area, neutral and phospholipid content. A new system of response categorisation was developed for data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Murine J774A.1 cells exhibited a drug-induced response pattern that was distinct to the corresponding pattern of hAM cells. Comparison with the literature revealed that primary cells (rat or human origin) have similar response patterns, while cell lines (mouse, rat or human) exhibited a different response pattern. Hierarchical clustering revealed toxicologically aligned clusters of compounds, suggesting potential use for understanding mechanisms of drug effects in cell lines and primary cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Valuable information for selecting a suitable cell type for HCIA screening of macrophage responses to drug compounds is provided. All cell types were suitable for screening drug-induced phospholipidosis. Still, human primary alveolar macrophages responded differently to drug treatment compared to macrophage cell lines and may be required to evaluate broader response-patterns and mechanisms of toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11095-024-03806-y.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cationic amphiphilic drugs</kwd><kwd>drug-induced phospholipidosis</kwd><kwd>high-content image analysis</kwd><kwd>human primary alveolar macrophages</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011961</institution-id><institution>Stiftung zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Erforschung von Ersatz- und Erg&#x000e4;nzungsmethoden zur Einschr&#x000e4;nkung von Tierversuchen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P-064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tietze</surname><given-names>Lysann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16GW0168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>H&#x000e4;drich</surname><given-names>Gabriela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Vienna</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by University of Vienna.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">The development of new oral inhaled drug products shows two important trends: 1) an increasing number of compounds with low solubility and 2) an increase in powder-based formulations for powder inhalers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, it is postulated that vacuolated macrophages may also be induced through phagocytosis of poorly soluble inhaled drug particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which may lead to a temporary increase in vacuolated macrophages in the lung during drug treatment. When this effect is excessive, it is unclear whether these vacuolated macrophages contribute to pathological processes or constitute a non-adverse subclinical response to inhaled poorly soluble matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In 2014, Cook <italic>et al</italic>. reported that unacceptable safety was the main source of compound failures in development at AstraZeneca. The majority of preclinical safety failures could be attributed to specific organ toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As a result, most new compounds undergo an extensive <italic>in vitro</italic> screening process before progressing to non-clinical safety assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Murray <italic>et al</italic>. (2016) described how AstraZeneca carries out multiple cell-based high throughput screens to measure the toxicity of compounds, which includes a cell viability screen followed by orthogonal assays to test cell membrane integrity (LDH and CellTox&#x02122; Green from Promega), as well as a four-parameter apoptosis assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On top of this, advances in computational methods are making <italic>in silico</italic> screens more relevant indicating that they may represent a feasible option for augmenting the current screening paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">As described above, screening processes for lung-specific toxicity increasingly incorporate both cytotoxicity endpoints as well as drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. DIPL is a cellular disorder resulting in the accumulation of 100&#x02013;2400&#x000a0;nm inclusion bodies consisting of lamellar phospholipid aggregates with a concentric coiled appearance. Phospholipid-rich inclusion bodies appear in various cell types, in the lung, liver, and kidneys, following exposure to cationic, amphiphilic drugs (CADs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is proposed that CADs, which accumulate in acidic lysosomes due to their weakly basic nature, can bind to phospholipids and induce the formation of non-digestible aggregated phospholipid structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It remains unclear whether the development of phospholipid-rich inclusion bodies is simply a morphologic feature of DIPL or has direct pathological consequences. DIPL is usually reversible with the disappearance of cellular inclusion bodies upon the termination of drug treatment. However, due to the unknown toxicological impacts and the high number of therapeutic compounds associated with DIPL, there is significant interest in research to understand better the mechanisms of induction and pathophysiological implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The usefulness of <italic>in vitro</italic> high content image analysis (HCIA) pre-screening of drug compounds for DIPL and other toxicity endpoints relies on the assumption that the <italic>in vitro</italic> results will reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of drug compounds both in animal and human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To this end, several studies have compared the responses of different cell lines (rat, mouse, and human-derived) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] with primary macrophages from rat bronchoalveolar lavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; first using amiodarone as a well-documented model CAD inducer of DIPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], then expanding to a larger panel of compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One of the most salient observations reported by this compilation of studies was that the response of two commonly used macrophage cell lines, rat NR8383 and human U937, to amiodarone was very similar, while primary rat alveolar cells derived from a bronchoalveolar lavage responded differently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Specifically, the two cell lines showed dose-dependent increases in mitochondrial activity and phospholipid content when exposed to amiodarone at concentrations from 0.1, 1 and 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M at both 24 and 48&#x000a0;h. The primary rat alveolar macrophages, in contrast, showed elevated membrane permeability and vacuole area at 24&#x000a0;h, but unexpectedly did not show the same increases in phospholipid staining at 24&#x000a0;h as the cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The data suggest that the rat primary cells were either less responsive to amiodarone or possess a different kinetic profile of DIPL development.</p><p id="Par9">Analysis of the studies mentioned above provide an indication that primary cells may exhibit an inherently different response pattern to cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; however data on primary cells is still scarce. To broaden our understanding of this phenomenon, the current study assessed the effect of amiodarone and a panel further compounds on primary human alveolar macrophages (hAM,) as compared to the murine monocyte-derived macrophage-like J774A.1 cell line, shown previously in Hoffman <italic>et al</italic>. (2015) to develop a robust response to amiodarone treatment over a similar concentration range (0.03&#x02013;40&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The hAM were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage of hospitalised patients undergoing bronchoscopy for various clinical assessments, e.g. diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia, microbiological lavage in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, or investigations of suspicious pulmonary nodules. The choice of using the murine J774A.1 cell-line was based on the ease of handling and low variability exhibited by this cell line compared to the previously investigated semi-adherent rat NR8383 cell line, which caused difficulties in high-content imaging due to loss of adherent cells during the staining procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The extended panel of tested compounds investigated in this study is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>. Representatives of most classes of orally inhaled drug products on the market were included alongside two reference groups, CADs and compounds inducing apoptosis. Amiodarone (3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M), served as an in-plate control compound for assay validation purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The response of macrophages to this panel of compounds was assessed using HCIA, whereby ten attributes describing cell number, metabolic activity (increased or decreased), membrane integrity, nuclear area, cell area, vacuole area, number of polynucleated cells, intracellular neutral lipid and phospholipid content were assessed. Taken together, these attributes can provide a more holistic picture of drug-induced cytotoxicity compared to single assay endpoints alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Six pictures were acquired and analysed for each well using the Gen5 software (BioTek). The HSC CellMask&#x02122; Deep Red stain was used to identify single cells in each image for analysis of the fluorescence intensity of each marker on a single-cell basis. The Gen5 software was programmed to automatically calculate the percentage of abnormal cells in the treated cell population in each well compared to the mean values of the untreated cells in six wells on the same plate. As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], fluorescent markers were used to assess each attribute in untreated and treated cells.

Due to species differences variations between primary cells and cell lines, and possible impacts of age and health status of the hAM donors, it was hypothesised that certain baseline attributes such as cell size and metabolic activity would differ and, secondly, that the hAM would show a higher variation due to interindividual differences in donors. Indeed, the mean cell area of the hAM was slightly higher (338&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;53 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>) than the J774.A1 cells (249&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;58 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>), however, the adherent hAM showed a narrower size range than the J774.A1 (252&#x02013;393 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>

First, it is easy to identify data sets where both the box and whiskers are visibly lower than the 10% threshold (roughly 33% of all data sets). In contrast, only one out of the 54 data sets has a distribution in which all six replicate values exceed the 10% threshold (i.e., amiodarone 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M; percentage of cells with elevated phospholipid content: 98.3&#x02013;100%). The remaining 67% of data sets contain values which are both above and below 10% threshold, prompting the question of whether these outcomes should be classified as treatment-related or not.</p><p id="Par24">Since this question was not addressed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we propose a revised system for categorising HCIA endpoints (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>). The revised system is simple and easy to apply to data sets with different replicate numbers or distribution functions. It also avoids the complexity of parametric or non-parametric statistical analyses, which are able identify significant increases in abnormal cell populations between the untreated <italic>vs</italic> treated groups but do not shed light on whether these differences are biologically or toxicologically meaningful. For example, applications of statistical tests to this data set (e.g., comparisons of % abnormal cells in treated and non-treated populations for all nine parameters) yielded several examples of statistically significant increases in the % of abnormal cells in the treatment groups, but often these increases were so minor that they were not biologically relevant (data not shown). Further, statistically significant differences were more likely to occur for sample sets with lower variability. As Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> clearly shows, low variability tends to correlate with negligible treatment-related effects, while parameters visibly altered by the treatment showed both a higher % of abnormal cells and a greater variability.

In some cases, data at a lower dose may be more narrowly distributed and are therefore categorised as &#x0201c;likely treatment related&#x0201d;, while data from a higher dose may spread across a broader range, in which case the category &#x0201c;possibly&#x0201d; treatment related&#x0201d; is applied. This occurrence is shown in Figs. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref> of the supplementary information, where the two endpoints, abnormal nuclear area and elevated neutral lipid content, are depicted following treatment with increasing doses of beta-agonists (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) and anticholinergics (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The box and whisker plots depicted in these figures clearly visualise how the spread of the data may impact the categorisation of the results. For full transparency, the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec16">supplementary information</xref> section also contains tables listing all replicate values, the calculated quartiles for each endpoint tested and categorisation scores. The raw data illustrates that there are some cases where the compound effects are very close to the 10% threshold (e.g. the lower quantile value for formoterol-induced elevation in neutral lipids was 9.9%). This again highlights that the classification system used is highly dependent on the data spread. An increase in replicates can be useful in such borderline cases.</p><p id="Par30">Physical chemical properties (predicted solubility and partition coefficients) were also provided to explore whether compound properties correlate with the response patterns. No correlations were determined between <italic>in vitro</italic> response patterns and compound physicochemical properties. We therefore hypothesise that the response pattern indicates a general form of cell stress with an underlying mechanism that is more complex than compound lipophilicity alone. An expanded panel of endpoints (e.g. apoptosis markers etc.) would be needed to gain more mechanistic information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Effects of Compound-Treatment on hAM Cell Populations</title><p id="Par31">The incubation of primary hAM with the same panel of pharmaceutical compounds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) showed a very different response pattern compared to J774A.1 cells. Incubation with CADs (24&#x000a0;h) was characterised by treatment-related increases in the percentage of cells with 1) reduced membrane integrity, 2) increased vacuole area per cell and 3) elevated phospholipid content (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Interestingly, this response pattern closely resembles that of primary rat alveolar macrophages (also collected by lavage; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Thus, the emerging picture from the growing body of literature on HCIA analysis of macrophage responses using different cell lines and primary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] is that primary cells show <italic>response patterns</italic> distinct from cell lines and the species of origin may be less important. However, it is equally valid to conclude that all cells tested in the current study and the literature show robust evidence of phospholipid accumulation following incubation with CADs. Therefore, if the primary research question is to determine whether a compound has the potential to induce DIPL (i.e. a single parameter), rapid screening of phospholipid staining in a representative cell line, such as the robust, easy-to-use J774A.1 cell line, will likely be the most efficient and predictive tool to answer this question. In such cases, the generation of a large HCIA data set may be more time-consuming without providing significant additional knowledge gain.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Influence of (<bold>A</bold>) CADs, (<bold>B</bold>) apoptosis inducers and (<bold>C</bold>) beta-agonists on the mean percentage of abnormal cells in hAM cell populations (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 hAM donors).

This parameter (i.e., reduced mitochondrial activity) was not included in earlier related studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] so comparison data in primary rat alveolar macrophages is not available. Nearly all compound classes showed slight increases in the cell population with reduced mitochondrial activity. This was surprising because it was not observed at all in the J744 cell line. Secondly, it was also unexpected to see that treatment with the apoptosis inducers did not show this pattern, since this compound group should be associated with this effect. We hypothesise that the doses used in this group were not sufficient to cause a profound reduction in mitochondrial activity (&#x0003e;&#x02009;2SD) in a majority of the cells, but further studies with higher doses would be required to confirm this.</p><p id="Par33">&#x000d6;hlinger <italic>et al</italic>.

Thus, differences in the underlying assay mechanism, as well as the data analysis may account for the different observations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Hierarchical Clustering Analysis</title><p id="Par34">Although the heatmaps shown above provide an efficient visual summary of the results, which is useful for the qualitative identification of response patterns in the data and comparison of cell types, they cannot provide insights into mathematical similarity between the data sets. To explore this, we employed hierarchical clustering analysis (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This method organises compounds into a tree-like structure (dendrogram) based on the similarity of their population response profiles. In our analysis, each compound was represented as a vector of features, including all measured responses (i.e., the nine HCIA parameters and the percentage of non-adherent cells). The similarity between these vectors was calculated using Euclidean distance. The clustering algorithm then iteratively grouped the most similar data points or clusters, revealing relationships between compounds based on their overall effect patterns. Clustering can be a useful tool when assessing novel compounds, as it may suggest potential similarities in cellular responses among different drugs and provide insights into toxicological behaviour prior to <italic>in vivo</italic> investigation, thereby aiding hypothesis-generation and guiding further investigations.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Hierarchical cluster map of (<bold>A</bold>) J774A.1 cells and (<bold>B</bold>) hAMs treated with selected compounds (5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M).

In this case, all CADs group together along with the beta-agonists indacaterol and salmeterol (recently classified as a CAD subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). On the other end of the clustering spectrum, compounds with elevated neutral lipids have been grouped together. The pattern of clustering calculated for the hAM data (5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B) show a very different picture. In this case, the inclusion of the data describing treatment-related loss of adherent cells (which was not depicted in the heatmaps), together with the phospholipid accumulation, drives the clustering on one end of the spectrum, while reductions in mitochondrial activity appear to drive clustering on the opposite end. Although the hierarchical clustering analysis roughly reflects trends observed in the hAM heatmaps (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), it also reveals that hAM cells are more prone to detachment from the 96-well plates and therefore this is an important factor that should be included in the interpretation of toxicity.</p><p id="Par36">The hierarchical clustering analysis for J774A.1 cells treated with a higher 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M compound dose (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A) shows a high degree of similarity to the 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M clustering map, even though compounds with a higher cytotoxicity, such as amiodarone, had to be excluded from the analysis. Again, the CADs group together with the indacaterol and salmeterol. On the other end of the clustering spectrum, compounds with higher cell detachment have been grouped together. The pattern of clustering calculated for the hAM data (10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B) is driven quite visually by phospholipid accumulation, reduction in mitochondrial activity and treatment-related loss of adherent cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par37">The usefulness of HCIA as an experimental tool to both screen and better understand macrophage responses to drug treatment has been systematically explored in a series of investigations, whereby macrophage cells lines (rat NR8383, human U937 and THP-1, murine RAW264.7, J774A.1 and DMBM-2) have been compared with primary cell types (rat alveolar macrophage cells from lavage and human MDM with M1 and M2 phenotypes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, different incubation time points (typically 24 or 48&#x000a0;h), drug concentration ranges, pharmaceutical classes and image analysis methods (cell numbers evaluated, fluorescent microscopes, imaging software type and statistics), have been reported. The current study adds to this growing body of literature by contributing new data on the response patterns of murine J774A.1 macrophages to an extended panel of compounds across a wide dose range and compares these results to human alveolar macrophages obtained from bronchoscopy. The current study data was generated using a different fluorescence microscope and HCIA software compared to previous reports and demonstrates the comparability of the HCIA approach across various imaging platforms.</p><p id="Par38">When considering the combined contributions of all studies published to date, it is possible to see a larger picture emerging. It is now apparent that cell lines, regardless of species of origin and compound incubation time, do not exhibit the same morphometric response patterns to drug treatment as primary alveolar macrophages obtained by lavage (Hoffman, 2017). However, within the groups of cell lines compared across studies, differentiated U937 cells appeared to be less responsive than the murine or rat-derived cell lines (Hoffman, 2017; Hoffmann, 2023). Some commonalities across cell types (cell lines and primary cells) can be observed, such as the reliable detection of phospholipid accumulation in all studies reporting this parameter. However, other parameters, such as elevated neutral lipids or impacts of drug treatment on nuclear area were highly variable across the studies. It follows that the use of convenient and inexpensive cell lines for large scale screening of drug candidates for responses such as DIPL can be performed to identify compounds which may have potential adverse effects, but such screening assays may not be suitable for understanding more complex mechanisms of drug responses. In this case, primary cells may be more suitable.</p><p id="Par39">An evaluation of the more limited information on primary cell behaviour following CAD treatment showed a remarkable similarity in the HCIA response patterns between rat alveolar macrophages (Hoffman, 2017) and human alveolar macrophages investigated in this study. Since the procurement of alveolar macrophages by lavage is often impractical, expensive and, in the case of rat cells, contrary to efforts to reduce, refine or replace animal experiments, the proposal by &#x000d6;hlinger <italic>et al</italic>. (2020) to use human blood-derived MDM cells for mechanistic studies of macrophage responses is an intriguing prospect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Future studies investigating the response patterns of the MDMs with M1 and M2 phenotypes to a wider panel of pharmaceutical agents, such as described here and in Hoffman <italic>et al</italic>. (2023) would be useful to confirm whether MDM responses are similar to primary alveolar macrophages and whether the polarisation state influences response patterns to a larger extent than observed by &#x000d6;hlinger <italic>et al</italic>. (2020) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Finally, two methods of HCIA data analysis were investigated in this study. The first method utilised the population quartile data to group responses into categories of: 1) non treatment-related, 2) possibly treatment-related, 3) likely treatment-related and 4) treatment-related. The response category was then plotted in a heat map to identify response patterns and compounds with treatment-related abnormalities. The second approach used the mean values of the percentage of abnormal cells in a hierarchical clustering analysis to group compounds with similar response patterns. Both methods reflected the same trends in the data sets. The first method, however, was a more suitable tool for rapid &#x0201c;go-no go&#x0201d; decision-making, as it provided a simple and easy categorisation of the response to treatment. The hierarchical clustering analysis, in contrast, is perhaps less easy to use to establish if a response is treatment-related but can be useful for identifying prevalent mechanisms of cell responses and showing which compounds produce similar responses.</p><p id="Par41">Future research should focus not only on expanding the panel of fluorescent markers (including additional relevant biomarkers) but also on offering deeper insights into macrophage biology, such as the impact of the polarisation state on the cellular responses to drug compounds. Furthermore, investigating the usefulness of HCIA in screening other cell types, such as epithelial cells, could broaden its utility in the drug development process. Additionally, the translation of these <italic>in vitro</italic> results to <italic>in vivo</italic> effects still requires careful consideration and validation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">This study has contributed new and useful information characterising multi-parameter HCIA for the early detection of alveolar macrophage responses to a wide panel of pharmaceutical compounds. Crucially, we demonstrated that human primary alveolar macrophages responded differently to drug treatment than macrophage cell lines. Comparison with literature data show that the human primary alveolar macrophages show more similar response patterns to primary rat alveolar macrophages, while cell lines (regardless of the species of origin) show different response profiles with a high degree of similarity to each other. Therefore, while the integration of multiple parameters provides a more comprehensive assessment of cellular responses to drug candidates, interpretation of HCIA data sets should be made with these differences in mind. At the same time, it is important to recognise that the detection of phospholipid accumulation within cells (as a single parameter for the screening of DIPL) was highly robust across all cell types tested, not only in this study but in several others. This observation suggests that a variety of macrophage-like cell types (regardless of species of origin, primary or cell line) can be used for DIPL screening of novel compounds. On the other hand, the choice of cell type may be more crucial for mechanistic studies on macrophage biology and further research characterising the response patterns of MDM with different phenotypes to a wider panel of pharmaceutical agents would be an important next step.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="11095_2024_3806_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (XLSX 102 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="11095_2024_3806_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Supplementary file2 (XLSX 216 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="11095_2024_3806_MOESM3_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file3 (DOCX 987 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all researchers participating in the UK NC3R Crack It Challenge 14: Inhalation Translation program for their collaborative insights and providing a context for this follow on study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by University of Vienna.
