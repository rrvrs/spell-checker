Accurate diagnosis is essential for determining whether inflammation is reversible, allowing conservative treatment, or irreversible, necessitating root canal therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current diagnostic practices, including pain history and percussion tests, rely heavily on subjective assessments, often failing to accurately reflect the pulp&#x02019;s condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These methods lack sensitivity and specificity, leaving a gap in reliable diagnostic tools to guide clinical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Histopathological analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are considered gold standards for diagnosing pulp inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, their high cost, time consumption, and requirement for specialized personnel render them impractical for routine clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This limitation has driven the need for simpler, more accessible diagnostic alternatives. Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests, such as those measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, have demonstrated potential in systemic inflammatory conditions and periodontal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. CRP, an acute-phase protein, is a nonspecific marker of inflammation produced in response to tissue injury or infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Its application in dental pulp diagnostics remains underexplored but holds promise for chairside use due to its rapidity and simplicity [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biopanda.co.uk/php/products/rapid/crp.php">https://biopanda.co.uk/php/products/rapid/crp.php</ext-link>].</p><p id="Par7">The scientific rationale for evaluating CRP in this context stems from its ability to detect localized dental pulp inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. By correlating CRP levels with clinical indicators such as pain history and percussion test results, we hypothesize that CRP testing can offer an objective measure of pulpitis severity. Specifically, this study seeks to fill the knowledge gap regarding the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of CRP rapid POC testing in detecting dental pulp inflammation.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par8">The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using a CRP rapid POC test as a potential diagnostic aid in distinguishing between reversible and irreversible pulpitis.

The findings suggest that the test may offer preliminary insights into inflammation status, which could help refine diagnostic strategies in endodontics. However, given the small sample size, these results should be interpreted cautiously, and further validation in larger, controlled studies are needed.</p><p id="Par47">Although evidence suggests that vital pulp therapy may be effective even in cases of irreversible pulpitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the supporting data remains weak or of low quality. Consequently, many dentists favor root canal treatment due to its more predictable outcomes. Current diagnostic methods for assessing pulp inflammation severity and distinguishing between reversible and irreversible pulpitis rely largely on subjective evaluation, which lacks reliability. Given the critical role of accurate diagnosis in the success of vital pulp therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the CRP POC test offers a more objective and precise approach.</p><p id="Par48">The CRP test allowed for a semiquantitative grading of inflammation, categorizing cases into no, mild to moderate, or severe inflammation. This preliminary classification system may support clinical decision-making and potentially assist in differentiating between reversible and irreversible pulpitis. However, due to the study&#x02019;s exploratory nature, these findings should be validated against gold-standard diagnostic methods such as histopathology or ELISA.</p><p id="Par49">Compared to subjective diagnostic methods like patient-reported pain history, the CRP test demonstrated preliminary diagnostic performance trends, particularly in sensitivity and NPV. This study observed that the CRP test had an estimated sensitivity of 94.3% and NPV of 91.9%, suggesting it may help reduce false-negative diagnoses. However, given the small sample size and absence of a gold standard, these estimates must be interpreted with caution and should not be used to make definitive clinical recommendations.</p><p id="Par50">Pain history exhibited a slightly higher specificity (92.6%) and PPV (95.8%), indicating its potential for confirming inflammation when present. However, subjective assessments depend on individual pain perception, which introduces variability. In this study, thermal tests were not used, as they primarily assess neural response rather than vascular inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which is a limitation to consider.</p><p id="Par51">This study employed Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to assess the preliminary diagnostic performance of the CRP test, as gold-standard validation (e.g., histopathology or ELISA) was not feasible due to ethical and practical constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While LCA provides a probabilistic approach to diagnostic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it cannot replace direct validation against a confirmed pathological diagnosis. Future studies should aim to validate these findings with a larger sample size and gold-standard comparisons.</p><p id="Par52">Our findings align with prior research by Proctor et al., who demonstrated that CRP levels in inflamed dental pulp are localized rather than influenced by systemic CRP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This reinforces the potential feasibility of using a chairside CRP POC test to provide real-time clinical insights [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biopanda.co.uk/php/products/rapid/crp.php">https://biopanda.co.uk/php/products/rapid/crp.php</ext-link>]. Similar rapid tests have been explored in periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], further supporting the potential for molecular-based diagnostic tools in dental practice.</p><p id="Par53">The observed lack of significant correlation between CRP levels and patient pain history in regression analysis raises questions about pain history&#x02019;s reliability as a diagnostic tool. Variability in pain perception and reporting among patients may contribute to inconsistencies in clinical diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the strong association between percussion test results and CRP levels (<italic>p&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) suggests that percussion testing may better reflect localized inflammatory severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Findings by Garrido et al. demonstrated elevated CRP levels in apical lesions of endodontic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], further supporting the hypothesis that CRP is a localized inflammatory marker. However, periapical pain on percussion can also result from periodontal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], indicating that CRP testing should not be used in isolation but rather as an adjunct to other diagnostic tools.</p><p id="Par55">Demographic diversity, including age and dentition type, may influence pulp response. This pilot study included only two cases (10%) with primary teeth and six patients (30%) under 13 years of age, which may introduce variability in tissue response or symptom reporting. To address this, pain history for pediatric participants was collected via structured parental reporting, a validated method in pediatric dental research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although we assessed local CRP expression, WHO data indicate that serum CRP levels are generally stable across age and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While further research is needed, this suggests a low likelihood of systemic bias. Future studies should stratify by age and dentition to validate these findings.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par56">Several limitations must be acknowledged:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par57">Small sample size: As a pilot study, the limited sample size restricts the generalizability of the results and increases the potential for statistical variability.
