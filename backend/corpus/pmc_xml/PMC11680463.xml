They are defined as the ascent of the abdominal content into the thoracic cavity. DH is usually categorized into congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDHs) and acquired diaphragmatic hernias (ADHs) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The presence of CDH beyond the neonatal period is estimated to be between 5% and 25%, and such defects in the adult population are presumed based on anatomical similarities to those of neonatal patients [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The most common type of CDH is the posterolateral defect (Bochdalek hernia), which represents 90% of CDH and is associated with an incomplete fusion of the septum transversum and the pleuroperitoneal membrane [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The other types of CDH are the anterior-retrosternal hernia (Morgagni hernia), diaphragmatic eventration, and central tendon defects, which account for 2-4% each [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, ADH is subdivided into hiatal, traumatic, and iatrogenic hernias. Hiatal hernias are classified into four types: Type I hernias are sliding, while types II-IV are para-esophageal hernias, which allow for the ascent of the stomach and esophagus in types II-III and a more significant number of viscera (colon, spleen, omentum) in type IV&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Finally, traumatic DH is caused by either blunt or penetrating trauma to the abdomen, giving rise to a tear in the diaphragm, with the resulting ascent of the abdominal content into the thorax [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In adult patients, symptoms vary depending on the size of the defect and the herniated organ. Patients often remain asymptomatic, although some may develop gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For these patients,&#x000a0;surgery is the only curative treatment and is traditionally done through an open abdominal and/or thoracic approach [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Because of the low frequency of this disease in adult patients, the actual knowledge about symptoms, adequate diagnosis, imaging techniques, and appropriate treatment modalities are based on the surgeon&#x02019;s experiences as well as case reports and small case series [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This study aimed to describe our institutional experience in the surgical repair of DH in adult patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee approved this protocol with the following registered number: C3-24. A cross-sectional review was conducted, including all adult patients with DH who were diagnosed and surgically treated between 2012 and 2023 at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias in Mexico City. We excluded pediatric patients. The IRB of the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias waived consent for data extraction. Medical records were screened for demographic data, symptoms, defect location, surgical technique, surgical findings, and complications.</p><p>Surgical technique</p><p>Patients undergoing open thoracotomy were positioned in the lateral decubitus position for a posterolateral approach through the sixth intercostal space. After identifying the hernial sac, it was gently reduced into the abdominal cavity. The diaphragmatic defect was closed using mattress sutures with no. 1 non-resorbable suture. For posterior defects without a diaphragmatic border, sutures were anchored to the nearest costal arch.</p><p>For laparotomy hernia repair, patients were placed in the supine position, and a median supraumbilical laparotomy was performed. The hernia sac was visualized, and its contents were reduced to the abdominal cavity. The defect was then closed using the same technique as in thoracotomy. For defects &#x02265;10 cm or in cases where diaphragmatic integrity was compromised, mesh reinforcement was applied, either alone or in conjunction with primary closure, depending on the extent of the compromise. The mesh was secured to the diaphragm with non-absorbable sutures, ensuring at least 2 cm of overlap around the defect.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Categorical data was represented as frequencies with percentage (%), while continuous data was presented as mean with standard error (SE) or median and interquartile range (IQR) when data was skewed. Data distribution was ascertained through the Shapiro-Wilk test. Univariate analysis was carried out through independent t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). For nonparametric data, variables were analyzed using the Chi-squared test with Fisher's exact test and the&#x000a0;Kruskall-Wallis test. For missing data, values were replaced by the variable median when data was skewed, with the mean when there was a normal distribution, and with the mode for categorical variables. Imputation was fulfilled only when the missing values were at most 5% of the variable data [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Statistical analysis was carried out with Statistical&#x000a0;Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM&#x000a0;Corp., Version 25.0, Armonk,&#x000a0;NY). Statistical significance was defined by a p-value of &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 24 patients were included in this study, with a predominance of females (65.2%).

In the studied group, there was a recurrence rate of 16% (n=4), which did not differ when comparing it with hernia type, size, or surgical approach. These patients were submitted for a second surgical intervention, which did not present with any additional complications or recurrence.

CDHs represented 75% of our cohort, which seems similar to the distribution reported in the literature. Although DH in adults is an uncommon condition, the prevalence for CDH is estimated to be near 6%, while for ADH, reports are scarce regarding the true prevalence of this entity [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, a recent report estimates that ADH is present in &#x0003c;5% of adult patients [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In most cases, adult patients with DH are asymptomatic, and hernias are found incidentally, while symptomatic patients vary between 19% and 28% [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our study, all of the patients presented with dyspnea or thoracic pain, representing the most common presenting complaints. These share similarities with other reports of DH in adults, such as the work by Katsaros et al., in which authors report that the most common presenting symptoms were pulmonary (45%), abdominal pain (40%), and nausea and vomiting (30%) [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In some patients, DH may be undetected for years and present with respiratory failure, intestinal occlusion, strangulation, and perforation, which may lead to emergency admission [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Diagnosis of DH can be achieved on most occasions through CXR or abdominal X-ray, CT, barium studies, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In our study, DH was confirmed in eight patients through CXR, while the rest required CT for diagnosis. In CXR, DH can be seen as changes in the opacity of the thorax, with a deviation of the mediastinum and abdominal gas within the chest. In comparison, CT allows for herniated organ visualization and diaphragmatic integrity evaluation [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>For symptomatic patients, surgery is the only curative treatment and should be done promptly after diagnosis to prevent complications. Trans-thoracic and trans-abdominal surgical approaches, both by conventional open surgery as well as minimally invasive surgery, have been described in the literature [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both approaches have some advantages. The abdominal approach provides better exposure to the hernia, which facilitates the reduction and treatment of hernia-associated intra-abdominal complications like strangulation and perforation [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The thoracic approach provides better visualization during the dissection of the hernial sac from the mediastinum, pleura, and pulmonary structures [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our cohort, all of the patients were operated on by open surgery, 66% by posterolateral thoracotomy, 21% by laparotomy, and 13% by both approaches. Recommendations regarding the approach could be based on the clinical state of patients, as an abdominal or thoracoabdominal route may be preferred for urgent cases. At the same time, access through the thorax carries the most significant benefit for elective surgeries [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the former was only present for patients undergoing laparotomy in our study since combined approaches were not used in emergency admissions. This combined route may instead be indicated for greater posterolateral defects, as shown in our study and as mentioned in the study by Giuffrida et al. [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], to exclude complications in both cavities or to overcome the limitations of each technique as reported by Kumar et al. [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Unfortunately, the evidence for hernia management is still based solely on surgeon or institutional experience, and official recommendations still need to be made. However, Giuffrida et al. published a position paper for diagnosing and managing complicated DH [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Even though open procedures have been the mainstay for treating DH, more institutions are becoming experienced in minimally invasive techniques, which show promising results. Minimally invasive techniques have shown reduced hospital stays in studies such as the report by Young et al. In said study, the authors compare the outcomes between open and minimally invasive techniques. Although they encountered a longer operating time for minimally invasive procedures, overall hospital stay was decreased compared to open repair (three vs five days) [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, these findings apply to laparoscopy only, as this study did not carry out hernia repair through thoracoscopy.</p><p>Furthermore, the benefit of minimally invasive treatment seems to be limited to laparoscopy, as in a review carried out by Horton et al., patients who underwent repair through thoracoscopy had a comparably similar hospitalization time to open repair [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A more recent report on treating three cases of DH in adults showed promising results with combined approaches through laparoscopy-thoracoscopy, with hospitalization ranging from two to three&#x000a0;days [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Regardless of the results, some authors have raised concerns regarding the technically challenging aspects of minimally invasive techniques in hernia repair and the impact of increased intra-abdominal pressure produced by pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopy, which may be associated with the progression of herniation [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Just like the surgical technique, the role of primary closure, mesh reinforcement, and the use of both is quite disputed, although evidence seems more evident. Primary closure alone has been recommended for minor defects that range up to 10 cm<sup>2</sup>, while for larger defects, mesh reinforcement should be considered to decrease the risk of excessive tension in the area associated with primary closure [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These have been applied to defects of 20-30 cm<sup>2</sup> with good results. At the same time, combined repair with primary suture and mesh reinforcement may only be necessary for more extensive defects or when diaphragmatic integrity is compromised [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For larger defects or patients with poor diaphragmatic integrity, in addition to combined closure, reattachment of the diaphragm by encircling the ribs with suture has also been used successfully in the literature and our study [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In our study, mesh was used in 50% of patients, while primary and combined closure was used in 38% and 13%, respectively. This shows a similar distribution to the report by Ryan et al. in which authors had a rate of primary closure, primary closure with mesh reinforcement, and mesh interposition of 34.5%, 14.1%, and 49.6%, respectively [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The overall complication rate in our study reached 20%, with most complications occurring during the surgical procedure. Regarding technique, the complication rate appears decreased in minimally invasive techniques, as shown by Horton et al., who reported a complication rate of 17%, 6%, 5%, and 0% for laparotomy, thoracotomy, laparoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Although the complication distribution for technique differed from those in our study, the overall complication rate was similar to our cohort (19%) [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Considering our study's outcomes, DH repair in adults through an open thoracic or abdominal approach is feasible, particularly in centers where minimally invasive techniques are unavailable. This study's main limitations are its small sample size, lack of follow-up, and retrospective nature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>DHs are rare in adult patients. Although evidence on diagnosis and optimal treatment strategies may be limited, recent publications highlight the benefits of both open repair and minimally invasive procedures. This study demonstrates the feasibility of open hernia repair. Nonetheless, minimally invasive techniques should be offered first when available.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
