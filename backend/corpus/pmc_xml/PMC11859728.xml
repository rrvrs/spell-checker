These defects have a deep impact on people&#x02019;s psycho-social functions. Although computerized cognitive training has positive results in some people, the effect of these treatment programs in schizophrenia is not clear.</p></sec><sec id="sec8075"><title>Objectives</title><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of computerized cognitive exercises on the components affecting the mental health and cognitive functions of schizophrenic patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec8076"><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty-four adults with schizophrenia were randomly divided into two intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group received 30 sessions of 5-45 minutes of computerized cognitive training in addition to the usual treatment programs. While the control group only received their usual rehabilitation programs (Pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and occupational therapy).</p><p>Mental health was evaluated with Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale and Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS), and cognitive functions with CANTAB tests Batteries before the intervention, after and two months after the intervention (follow up). The set of CANTAB tests used in this study included the following tests: Spatial Recognition Memory (SRM), Paired Associates Learning (PAL), Stockings of Cambridge(SOC), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), and Spatial Span (SSP).</p></sec><sec id="sec8077"><title>Results</title><p>The analysis of the findings showed that the patients&#x02019; performance in the cognitive tests related to memory and executive functions improved significantly in the intervention group after the intervention. In problem solving skills, despite the better performance in the intervention group, the difference between the two groups was not significant. Also, the intervention was able to significantly improve mental health and reduce stress. But no significant difference was observed in reducing anxiety and depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec8078"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As a result, the study showed that 30 sessions of computerized cognitive training can have a positive effect on overall mental health and some cognitive functions.</p></sec><sec id="sec8079"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
