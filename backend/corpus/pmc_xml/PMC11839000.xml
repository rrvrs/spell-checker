Based on evidence that maternal blood pressure (BP) may be raised in pregnancies with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (fetal overgrowth), a possible contributing factor to the association between male sex and term pre-eclampsia is that males grow faster, reaching ~130 g higher birth weight, on average, than females. The association between fetal sex and maternal BP in healthy pregnancies is not known. We hypothesized that male sex would be associated with higher maternal BP in healthy pregnancies, and that this association would be explained by birth weight differences between males and females.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods and findings</title><p id="P4">We tested the association between fetal sex and maternal systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), measured at ~28 weeks of gestation, in a meta-analysis of five different cohorts of mother-child pairs (n up to 109,842). Maternal BP was analyzed as both a continuous and dichotomized (high BP: yes or no) outcome. Linear regression models were constructed with and without adjustment for birth weight to assess whether any difference in maternal BP was explained by the difference in birth weight between male and female babies. Lastly, we constructed a fetal genetic score for birth weight using 186 own-birth-weight-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to test whether birth-weight-raising-alleles in the fetus were associated with maternal BP in pregnancy (n up to 32,232). Both maternal SBP and DBP were higher in pregnancy when carrying a male fetus compared to a female fetus (mean difference 0.35 mmHg [95%CI: 0.15&#x02013;0.55] and 0.35 mmHg [95%CI: 0.21&#x02013;0.49], for SBP and DBP, respectively). An independent effect of fetal sex remained when including birth weight but attenuated slightly (0.22 mmHg [95%CI: 0.02&#x02013;0.42] and 0.31 mmHg [95%CI: 0.17&#x02013;0.45], for SBP and DBP respectively). A positive effect estimate was found for odds of experiencing high maternal BP given pregnancy with a male fetus, but confidence intervals were wide (OR 1.05 [95%CI: 0.98&#x02013;1.12]). No evidence for an association was found between a fetal birth weight genetic score and SBP or DBP when conditioned on maternal genotype.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P5">We found strong evidence to support a small effect of male fetal sex on higher maternal BP in pregnancy and that larger fetal size at birth does not contribute to a substantial part of this association. Our findings do not indicate a difference in maternal BP that would warrant changes to routine monitoring in clinical practice but do suggest that male sex may be a contributing risk factor for BP-related complications.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award01"><funding-source>QUEX Institute, a collaborative program between the University of Exeter and the University of Queensland</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award02"><funding-source>Wellcome Senior Research Fellowship</funding-source><award-id>WT220390</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award03"><funding-source>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health &#x00026;

However, the fetus may also influence maternal physiology. There is evidence to suggest that expectant mothers are at greater risk of experiencing different pregnancy complications depending on whether they are carrying a male or female fetus. In the literature, a higher risk of stillbirth<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, preterm birth<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, gestational diabetes<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and hypertensive complications such as term pre-eclampsia<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> is reported for mothers carrying male babies, compared to those carrying female babies. Altered mechanisms of placental function may underlie these differences with males more susceptible to abnormal placentation and impaired responses to stress<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Another possible reason for the observed sex differences is that male babies are larger and demonstrate faster fetal growth than their female counterparts<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. One example of greater fetal growth leading to maternal clinical outcomes is when the fetus has Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, where mothers carrying macrosomic babies develop gestational hypertension at a higher rate compared with normal sibling controls<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Cases such as these have led to the idea that variation in the fetal genome can influence maternal physiology to enhance nutrient transmission and optimise growth. This idea is known as the fetal drive hypothesis, which posits that the genotype of the offspring may drive, at least in part, the physiology and behaviour of the mother<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Genetic studies have predominantly investigated the effects of maternal genotype and physiology on the development of the fetus<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, but less so potential effects of fetal genetics on maternal physiology in pregnancy. A previous study that explored this issue found that fetal alleles that increase birth weight are associated with a shorter gestational duration, and a higher blood pressure (BP) in the mother<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Given the observed links between higher birth weight and raised maternal BP, we hypothesized that male sex would be associated with higher maternal BP in large datasets of healthy pregnancies, and that this association would be explained by birth weight differences between males and females.

Analyses were run in models where maternal BP was measured as a continuous trait, as well as in models where maternal BP was dichotomized (high BP: yes or no). Models were constructed with and without the inclusion of fetal birth weight to assess whether any difference in maternal BP was mediated by the difference in birth weight between male and female babies. Lastly, we constructed a fetal genetic score for birth weight to test whether birth-weight-raising-alleles were associated with maternal BP in pregnancy.</p><sec id="S6"><title>Study populations</title><sec id="S7"><title>Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study</title><p id="P11">The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study is an observational study which sought to determine the risks of adverse outcomes associated with varying levels of elevated maternal glucose that do not constitute overt diabetes mellitus<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

We devised a protocol to take the singular BP measure at 28 weeks if only one was present, otherwise, to take the median of multiple measures at 28 weeks. If measures at 28 weeks were not available, we expanded to a range of two weeks either side of 28 weeks (26&#x02013;30 weeks) to maximize sample size, with a stepwise approach to then take the measures at 27 and 29 weeks together and select the median; if measures at those time points were unavailable, to then take the median of the measures at 26 and 30 weeks.</p><p id="P21">In our stepwise approach of BP measure selection, observations within each pregnancy were first sorted by SBP so that SBP was ordered lowest to highest over the range of time. Where there were instances of multiple BP measures to choose from, if the number of measures was odd, we took the middle (median) observation to use in analysis as mentioned above. If the number of measures was even, we looked to gestational age to decide which of the two middle values to use and took the later measure (latest GA).

Participants within the cohorts were largely consistent in many of the characteristics including mean offspring birth weight, distribution of sex amongst offspring, gestational age at birth, maternal height, and maternal age, with mothers in BiB being on average slightly younger. Mothers in the HAPO and BiB studies had higher mean BMIs as the measurements for these women were taken at the time of an OGTT at approximately 28 weeks gestation, whereas pre-pregnancy measurements were obtained for the women in the other cohorts. Women in HAPO also had the lowest mean measures of SBP and were predominantly primiparous relative to the women of the other cohorts who were fairly evenly split between primiparous and multiparous. Cohorts were largely of White ethnicity aside from HAPO and BiB where a more ancestrally diverse sample was available.</p><sec id="S15"><title>Fetal sex and maternal blood pressure &#x02013; continuous</title><p id="P39">After meta-analysis of individual fetal sex effects across cohorts, both maternal SBP and DBP were higher in pregnancy when carrying a male fetus compared to a female fetus (a mean difference of 0.35 mmHg [95%CI: 0.15&#x02013;0.55] and 0.35 mmHg [95%CI: 0.21&#x02013;0.49], for SBP and DBP, respectively]; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>).

When adjusting for birth weight, and thus the inherent difference in size between male and female babies, the effect of fetal sex attenuated slightly, although more so for maternal SBP than DBP. This may suggest that the small increases in maternal BP associated with male fetal sex are not primarily driven by males being heavier and that a mechanism altering this aspect of maternal physiology during pregnancy through fetal sex exists independent of birth weight. In a secondary analysis, we assessed this relationship using a dichotomous outcome where women were assigned to groups of &#x02018;high BP&#x02019; or not. Compared to the overall sample, there were few cases of &#x02018;high BP&#x02019; (n = 3,820) and thus low statistical power despite the larger overall sample size, though the results were directionally consistent with our continuous outcome findings. The estimates obtained in this study give an indication of any increased clinical risk associated with having a male baby (which is small).</p><p id="P43">Given the attenuation in the fetal sex effect when adjusting for birth weight, we sought to test for an association between a fetal genetic score for birth weight and maternal BP to better determine whether birth weight could be mediating some of the effect of sex. In our study, we did not find evidence for an association between a fetal birth weight genetic score and maternal BP in pregnancy. One study published by Chen et al. investigated this relationship previously and found that fetal alleles that increase birth weight are associated with a higher BP in the mother and a shorter gestational duration<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Though we did not find the same, the effect estimates were directionally consistent with Chen et al. (0.09 mmHg higher SBP per 1 SD change in fetal BW score, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.39 vs. 1.4 mmHg increase in SBP per 1-SD change in fetal growth rate, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.023, respectively). There are some key differences between our methods of analysis and those used in their study, notably in how the genetic scores were composed. We included 186 autosomal SNPs associated with birth weight in an unweighted score, while Chen et al. constructed haplotype genetic scores independently for maternally and paternally inherited alleles using only 86 SNPs associated with birth weight with confirmed fetal effects, weighted by SEM-adjusted fetal effect sizes from the Warrington et al. GWAS. The use of maternal and paternal transmitted and non-transmitted haplotypes by Chen et al. controlled for the correlation between maternal and fetal genotype in their analysis, because under random mating the paternally transmitted fetal haplotype for birth weight should not be correlated with maternal genotype. We used the full set of birth weight loci to maximise power. With many variants included, rather than adjust for maternal genotype at each fetal genetic score locus separately in our models, we took an unweighted score approach, generating a fetal unweighted genetic score for birth weight and adjusting for maternal genotype at those same loci by including a maternal unweighted genetic score for birth weight in the models<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P44">Further comparisons between our study and that of Chen et al. concern the cohorts shared between our studies, ALSPAC and HAPO. Though we share the inclusion of the HAPO cohort, we have used non-overlapping samples, where our sample of individuals were genotyped locally in Exeter, UK, while their individuals came from a central study sample that did not include the Exeter sample at the time of their analysis. Mother-child pairs included from ALSPAC in our study (SBP/DBP n = 4,993) almost completely overlapped with those included in Chen et al.&#x02019;s study (SBP n = 4,923, DBP n = 4,943). We did however use slightly different BP measurements in ALSPAC. Our study used maternal BP predicted at 28 weeks gestation for ALSPAC women allowing us to have a consistent time point with HAPO and our other included cohorts who were similarly measured at ~28 weeks, while Chen et al. used the average of all BPs in ALSPAC measured between 30 to 36 weeks gestation<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Overall, despite non-uniform methods employed between the two studies, we would still expect both methods of analysis to obtain a similar result if there was a strong effect of child&#x02019;s birth weight on maternal BP. Replication with greater power in the future, as well as the use of alternative metrics capturing fetal growth, may elucidate this further.</p><p id="P45">Our finding regarding fetal sex is consistent with our hypothesis that male sex is associated with higher maternal BP. However, our results cannot exclude the possibility of a reverse-causal association, where maternal BP before pregnancy somehow influences the sex of the baby. Such findings were reported by Retnakaran et al.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>, who conducted a prospective preconception cohort study of approximately 1,400 newly married Chinese women who had cardiometabolic measures assessed prior to an eventual first pregnancy. They found that SBP before pregnancy was higher in women who delivered a boy than in those who delivered a girl, even after adjustment for covariates (106.0 vs. 103.3 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0015). However, when following a proportion of the women with BP measured throughout their pregnancy, this difference in BP between mothers of boys and girls was not observed in any trimester of pregnancy. While this observational association raises the possibility that maternal pre-pregnancy BP could affect offspring sex, the association was not observed during pregnancy. Associations such as these highlight the need for further studies to support these findings and definitively determine the direction of influence between mother and fetus for this relationship.</p><p id="P46">A prominent example of fetal drive on maternal BP in pregnancy, and what helped form the fetal drive hypothesis, is that mothers of children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome who give birth to macrosomic babies experience higher rates of gestational hypertension<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Further evidence that originally spurred the hypothesis came from the suggestion of a fetal genetic effect on maternal BP in animal models of mice exhibiting loss of the imprinted p57<italic toggle="yes"><sup>kip2</sup></italic> gene, an inhibitor of a variety of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes which regulate the cell cycle of placental trophoblasts and other cell types<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. In the study, half of the unborn offspring were p57<italic toggle="yes"><sup>kip2</sup></italic> deficient and exhibited enlarged placentas and growth restriction. Their functionally wild type mothers exhibited pre-eclampsia-like symptoms of pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria in late pregnancy which went away after birth.</p><p id="P47">Additional evidence has been found in the literature for a relationship between fetal factors and hypertensive disorders in human pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Broere-Brown et al. found that fetal sex was associated with pre-eclampsia, a disorder characterized by placental insufficiency, in a gestational age dependent manner, where the occurrence of preterm pre-eclampsia was greater when carrying a female fetus and the association reversed when carrying a male fetus with greater occurrence of term and post-term pre-eclampsia<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The authors theorized that this trend suggests that males that are not viable due to impaired placentation will be lost early while those that make it to term, though with late-onset pre-eclampsia, represent a comparatively heathy subset. This idea is supported by Orzack et al.&#x02019;s human sex ratio study where an excess male mortality was observed within approximately the first week following conception, followed by greater female-biased mortality until approximately 20 weeks gestation, and then excess male mortality towards the end of pregnancy<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. Additionally, in a recent GWAS of placental weight (PW), causal methods indicated that a fetal genetic predisposition to a higher PW increases the risk of pre-eclampsia<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. While an association with sex was not investigated in that study, the findings serve as an additional example of fetal genetic influence on maternal physiology and BP-related outcomes.</p><p id="P48">The fetal sex association results of our study contribute an example in healthy human pregnancies of fetal effects on the mother. We do, however, acknowledge some important limitations. We know that male babies grow larger and faster <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> than female babies<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and that birth weight alone, as we have assessed here, does not entirely capture fetal growth and the full extent of growth differences between males and females, nor does it fully capture their effects on the mother. Therefore, despite the lack of association found between genetically determined birth weight and maternal BP, some of the residual differences between males and females in our study may still be due to growth differences that should be investigated further. It should be noted that our fetal genetic score for birth weight likely accounts for only a small proportion of variation in birth weight (including, presumably, genetically determined variation in birth weight), which may also contribute to the absence of an association. A further limitation in our study is that birth weight is likely to be a collider variable along the path between our exposure (fetal sex) and outcome of interest (maternal blood pressure), making interpretation uncertain as adjusting for it in our analysis could lead to the opening of a pathway of association from some unmeasured variable that affects both birth weight and maternal BP to our exposure of interest, fetal sex i.e. collider bias<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. However, given the consistency of our estimates when adjusting for birth weight or not, it is unlikely that this is impacting our results.</p><p id="P49">Additionally important to note is that despite the overall sample sizes achieved, we are likely underpowered in the analysis of maternal hypertension as there was a bias toward healthy women in the included studies with comparatively few women that met the threshold for high BP. Within the high BP group, we also must acknowledge the general pitfalls of self-reporting coming from the MoBa study (i.e. the largest contributing sample in our study), where there are varying time points for when BP would have been measured during each pregnancy compared to if collection took place at a specified clinic visit, as well as variation in quality of response e.g. whether the measure given adhered to the questionnaire definition of high BP or not and how this contributed to how women were grouped for analysis. For the continuous maternal BP analyses, the data were censored at the defined threshold for high BP, however, for the dichotomous BP outcome, women were sorted into the &#x02018;high BP&#x02019; group so long as they answered &#x02018;yes&#x02019; to the initial binary question of whether they had, or had had, high BP during their pregnancy. Thus the &#x02018;high BP&#x02019; group contained some women who answered &#x02018;yes&#x02019; but then provided a measure below the threshold.</p><p id="P50">Lastly, our study was performed in a largely White European ancestry sample, where non-Europeans comprised only 7.4% of the total study sample size (n = 8,156 / 109,842). Though our results did not indicate substantial differences between ancestral/ethnic groups across our analyses, larger samples of non-European individuals may provide greater power to detect differences in strength of association and more precise estimates in diverse populations in the future.</p><p id="P51">In conclusion, we found that carrying a male fetus is associated with a higher maternal BP in pregnancy relative to carrying a female fetus, and through both observational and genetic analyses investigating a role for birth weight, our results suggest that larger fetal size at birth does not account for a substantial part of this association. The residual association may be attributable to faster male growth that is not captured by birth weight or may be partially driven by an independent mechanism related to fetal sex. Our findings do not point to a difference in maternal BP that would warrant significant changes to routine monitoring in clinical practice, but they do suggest that male sex may contribute as a risk factor for BP-related complications. We add here to the body of literature supporting the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism exists within the spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes and that male fetuses may present greater cardiometabolic challenges to their mothers compared to female counterparts. Future research would benefit from further observational studies looking at fetal sex and its association with other maternal physiological outcomes within the normal range, not only in the disease state, and especially in more ancestrally diverse populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="media-1.pdf" id="d67e1254" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P52">This study represents independent research supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Exeter Clinical Research Facility.
