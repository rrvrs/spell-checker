However, its applicability and validity in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remain understudied. This research seeks to validate ESS's ability to predict postoperative outcomes, including 30-day mortality, complications, and ICU admissions, among patients undergoing emergency laparotomies (EL).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This retrospective study analyzed 230 EL cases from 2017 to 2021. ESS scores were calculated for each patient, and its predictive accuracy was compared with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification using c-statistic methodology. We also compared postoperative outcomes between MENA and non-MENA cohorts to assess potential regional variations in ESS performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Out of 230 patients, 118 were from MENA and 112 from non-MENA regions. Sepsis was the most common diagnosis (69.6%). ICU admission was recorded in 63.4% of cases, and the 30-day mortality rate was 13.91%. ESS scores did not differ significantly between MENA and non-MENA patients (median: 7.5 vs. 7; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45). ESS outperformed ASA in predicting postoperative outcomes: complications (c-statistic: 0.79 vs. 0.73), ICU admissions (0.81 vs. 0.76), and mortality (0.86 vs. 0.78). Optimal ESS cutoffs for complications, ICU need, and mortality were 6, 8, and 10, respectively. ESS performed similarly across both MENA and non-MENA populations in predicting mortality, complications, and ICU admissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The ESS is a superior tool compared to ASA for predicting postoperative outcomes in emergency surgical patients, and it is applicable to diverse populations, including those from the MENA region. ESS enhances preoperative risk stratification, informs counseling decisions, and supports quality benchmarking across different healthcare settings. Future studies should address potential biases, including selection and information bias, and further explore ESS's role in different cultural contexts.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Emergency laparotomy</kwd><kwd>Emergency surgery score</kwd><kwd>Validation</kwd><kwd>MENA</kwd><kwd>Predictor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hamad Medical Corporation</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Emergency general surgery (EGS) imposes a substantial and steadily rising burden on the healthcare system due to its associated increases in mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Emergency laparotomy (EL), a critical EGS procedure, is performed on patients with a high-risk condition for a range of underlying emergency surgical diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The mortality rates following emergency laparotomy vary significantly, and there is a need for accurate risk assessment tools to predict outcomes and guide clinical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) has emerged as a promising tool for evaluating risk in EL patients. Developed from a large contemporary dataset of patients undergoing EL, ESS has been validated in several populations, demonstrating its potential for improving patient outcomes and informing clinical management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Given the complexity of emergency surgeries, the role of validated risk assessment tools like ESS becomes crucial in standardizing the evaluation and prediction of outcomes for EL patients. This is especially important considering the heterogeneous nature of patients undergoing EL, who are often presented with a wide range of underlying conditions. ESS may help standardize the approach to evaluating these patients, potentially leading to more consistent and improved outcomes across different populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is particularly critical in light of the high morbidity and mortality associated with EL, as well as the need for efficient risk assessment tools to guide clinical care, enhance patient survival, and inform preoperative counseling for both patients and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, patients often seek information about the risks of surgery, including the likelihood of complications and success rates. Similar concerns are observed in non-MENA patients&#x02014;often immigrants&#x02014;who may be anxious about receiving different levels of care compared to citizens of the host country. Given the diverse and multiethnic nature of the MENA population, there is a need for a reliable and standardized tool like ESS to address these concerns and provide effective preoperative counseling. While the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score is currently used at our institution to assess patient risk, it does not fully address postoperative complications or the need for intensive care unit admissions. Therefore, we aim to retrospectively validate the performance of ESS in predicting postoperative outcomes for EL patients at our institution in Qatar, where we provide care for patients with acute surgical conditions. The effectiveness of ESS has been demonstrated in various countries, making it a valuable tool to evaluate its performance in our population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p id="Par8">This retrospective study included all patients aged 18 years and above who underwent emergency laparotomy (EL) procedures at Hamad Medical Corporation, the primary healthcare facility in Qatar, between January 2017 and December 2021. EL was operationally defined as any surgical abdominal intervention performed promptly following the patient's diagnosis, where any delay could potentially compromise the patient's health and prognosis. Exclusions were made for emergent procedures related to trauma, vascular issues, and gynecological conditions, as well as elective laparotomies, laparoscopic surgeries, hernia repairs, and soft tissue procedures. Patients lacking the necessary data to calculate the Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Calculating ESS</title><p id="Par9">ESS was calculated for each patient using pre-operative demographic variables (age, race, BMI, and transfer from an external inpatient facility or emergency department), comorbidities (ascites, hypertension [HTN], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], dyspnea, disseminated cancer, functional dependency, steroid use, ventilator requirement within 48 h preoperatively, and weight loss &#x0003e;&#x02009;10% in the preceding 6&#x000a0;months), and laboratory values (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, creatinine [Cr], INR, platelet count [PTL], AST, sodium [Na], and WBC). Each variable was assigned a point value based on its contribution to the overall risk score for patients undergoing emergency surgery (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The AUC ranges from 0.5 (no discriminative ability) to 1 (perfect discrimination). An AUC score between 0.7 and 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is excellent, and above 0.9 is outstanding. ESS&#x02019;s predictive performance was compared with the ASA classification by juxtaposing their respective AUC scores, with statistical tests (e.g., DeLong's test) used to evaluate the significance of differences. Additionally, a subset analysis explored ESS&#x02019;s predictive capacity for specific complications, providing a more granular assessment of its utility in predicting adverse outcomes in surgical settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p id="Par18">Among our 230 patients (118 from MENA and 112 from Non-MENA) who underwent EL procedure and matched our inclusion criteria, 156 were male, accounting for 67.8% of the study population, with a male-to-female ratio of &#x02243;2:1.

We took advantage of the multiethnic nature of the Qatari population as it contains population from MENA area and also has almost the same percentage from non-MENA. We compared these two groups regarding the validity of ESS, and we found it a good valid score with almost equal C statistics (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The median ESS in both groups was non-significant (7.5 for MENA vs. 7 for non-MENA, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;= 0.45).</p><p id="Par40">In a bi-institutional study comparing two nationality (Greek and American) EL cases, Christou et al. discovered that ESS was significantly beneficial in both groups with relation to postoperative ICU need, mortality percentage, and morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In the literature, the ASA classification showed overestimation of mortality risk and was considered a subjective test, as it depends on factors that may be interpreted in variable ways according to the physician's opinion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Nandan et al. compare ASA and ESS in predicting postoperative complications, and this study revealed that there is a very narrow difference between them (C statistics: 0.78 for ESS vs. 0.77 for ASA), but he recommended ESS as it is more objective and designed specifically for EGS cases, and there are well defined variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Conversely, Alburakan et al. found a significant difference between ESS and ASA scores regarding mortalities prediction (C statistics: 0.88 vs. 0.78), postoperative complications (C statistics: 0.82 vs. 0.71), and the need for ICU admissions, which also showed that ESS was more significantly superior (C statistics: 0.85 vs. 0.78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, we confirm the superiority of the ESS over the ASA score in EL cases, especially for mortality (C statistics: 0.86 vs. 0.78) and the need for ICU admission (C statistics: 0.82 vs. 0.77).</p><p id="Par43">According to our statistical method, we defined certain cutoff scores for each of these study outcomes: for mortality, the cutoff score is 10, for complication prediction, the cutoff score is 6, and for the need for ICU admission, the cutoff score is 8. It is adjusted according to institutional resources and plan of care. In the literature, we could find an ESS score of 7 as a cutoff value for ICU admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Alburakan et al. reported that ESS of 10 was the cut-off value of mortalities; above it, the mortality rate increased dramatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. </p><p id="Par44">This study has limitations. To test the differences between MENA and non-MENA patients, a larger sample size for some subgroup findings would have been advantageous.</p><p id="Par45">This study represents a single-center data from Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), the primary healthcare provider in Qatar, comprising three major hospitals (Hamad General Hospital, Al Khor Hospital, and Al Wakra Hospital). While this covers a substantial portion of emergency surgical care in Qatar, the findings may not be fully generalizable to other healthcare systems with different patient populations or resource availability. Additionally, the study lacks surgeon-level variability analysis, as all procedures were performed within a single healthcare system with potentially similar surgical techniques and decision-making patterns. This may limit the applicability of our findings to institutions with different surgical practices. Retrospective medical record reviews have limitations of data quality. Exploring such limitations could be beneficial for future studies. Additionally, our study's focus on emergency laparotomy patients may limit generalizability, as this represents a higher-risk population compared to those eligible for laparoscopic approaches. While this selection reflects real-world scenarios where laparotomy is often reserved for severe cases, our findings may not apply to centers where laparoscopy is the primary emergency approach.</p><p id="Par46">Nevertheless, the study has many strengths. To our knowledge, it is the first to validate ESS among the MENA region, especially in comparison with the non-MENA population, employing many variables. In addition, it is representative of the population living in Qatar, as our institution receives all cases across the country. We are not aware of any previous study that undertook such an analysis, and we hope it will add to the literature for future studies targeting the MENA region&#x02019;s population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">We demonstrated that the ESS score is an accurate and reliable tool for predicting 30-day mortality, postoperative complications, and ICU admission in our emergency general surgery (EGS) population. Its performance remained consistent across both MENA and non-MENA patient groups, supporting its generalizability across diverse populations. Given its objectivity and ease of use, ESS offers a practical advantage over traditional tools like ASA, particularly in emergency settings. It can aid acute care surgeons in risk stratification, support informed preoperative counselling, and serve as a benchmark for evaluating and improving the quality of EGS care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Mohamed Said Ghali and Samer A.
