The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> among medical students who have varying levels of exposure to the hospital environment to provide valuable insights into the risk of colonization and transmission. Nasal swabs and fingerprints were obtained and cultured on a selective medium for staphylococci. The obtained isolates were confirmed as methicillin-sensitive <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant (MRSA) using PCR. Antibiotic resistance, the presence of virulence genes including enterotoxin encoding genes, and <italic>spa</italic> typing were performed. Among pre-clinical students, MSSA was detected on the nose in 45.2% and on the fingerprints in 10.6% of the participants. Among clinical students, MSSA was detected on the nose in 42.0% and on the fingerprints in 25.4%. Only one MRSA isolate was obtained. Genes <italic>seg</italic> and <italic>sei</italic> were the most frequently detected in both student groups, with their presence in over 40% of isolates among clinical students. The <italic>eta</italic> and <italic>etb</italic> genes were mainly detected from the nose in both student groups. In pre-clinical students, <italic>S. aureus</italic> carrying <italic>eta</italic> gene occurred in 6.4% and <italic>etb</italic> in 8.5%. In clinical students, the occurrence was 5.1% for <italic>eta</italic> and 8.5% for <italic>etb</italic>. The <italic>tst</italic> gene was identified only in the nose and fingerprints of the clinical student group. The most frequently observed resistance was to clindamycin and erythromycin. In total 58 different <italic>spa</italic> types were identified. High rates of asymptomatic MSSA carriage were observed in both groups of medical students. Detected MSSA strains showed a high degree of genetic variability, with a number of them carrying the virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Although students do not exhibit increased risk to their patient&#x02019;s, increased hygiene is required in asymptomatic carriage personnel. The overall prevalence of MRSA was low, with a minimal risk of spread.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12223-024-01237-1.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>MRSA</kwd><kwd>Medical students</kwd><kwd><italic>Spa</italic> type</kwd><kwd>Antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>Virulence genes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003243</institution-id><institution>Ministerstvo Zdravotnictv&#x000ed; Cesk&#x000e9; Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NU23-09-00488</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karp&#x000ed;&#x00161;kov&#x000e1;</surname><given-names>Ren&#x000e1;ta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Masaryk University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access publishing supported by the institutions participating in the CzechELib Transformative Agreement.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Sa) is a well-known cause of infections but also a common inhabitant of the human body. Approximately 20&#x02013;30% of the healthy human population can be asymptomatically colonized by Sa, with the most common colonization sites being the nasal mucosa and nasopharynx (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>; Stensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>). Sa infections can arise from carriage, and there is also the risk of transmitting Sa to more susceptible individuals, leading to dermatitis, abscess formation, or serious systemic bloodstream diseases (McCaig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>; Pomorska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Treating Sa infections can be challenging, particularly in cases involving methicillin-resistant isolates of Sa (MRSA). MRSA can originate from various sources. Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) occurs within communities of individuals with close contact, such as athletes, military personnel, school students, or people sharing households. Transmission to pets is also possible (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>; Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Sa is the second most common causative agent of healthcare-associated infections overall and is the most common cause of surgical site infections (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2023a</xref>). Hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) is associated with the hospital environment and can be acquired through exposure to infected patients or during hospital stays and surgeries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2024</xref>). Livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) is found among livestock animals and in food products of animal origin (Anjum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">There is a significant risk of asymptomatic carriage of virulent isolates of Sa including MRSA among medical personnel who have frequent contact with patients and the hospital environment. According to the CDC, approximately 2% of people are colonized by MRSA without developing infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). A systematic review conducted on hospital personnel in Europe and the USA estimated the pooled MRSA colonization rate to be 1.8%. Furthermore, there are substantial variations in the prevalence of invasive MRSA across European countries with a gradient of increasing prevalence from north to south (Dulon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2023b</xref>). Medical students also face risks, as they are intensively exposed to the hospital environment during their studies and come into direct contact with patients. Studies confirm that an extended duration of stay in hospital facilities by medical students increases the risk of MRSA carriage as well as methicillin-sensitive Sa (MSSA) (Ar&#x00131;kan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>; Bhatta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The transmission of Sa is influenced by the level of hygiene, particularly hand hygiene. Sa isolates, including MRSA, are commonly found on frequently touched surfaces, not only in the hospital environment. These isolates have also been detected in the surroundings of university campuses, public transport, and shopping baskets in supermarkets (Domon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Lutz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>; Thapaliya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">A study from the Czech Republic conducted in 2012&#x02013;2013 in medical students from the Olomouc region showed MSSA carriage in 61 of 206 (29.6%) first-year medical students and 32 of 101 (32.5%) fifth-year general medicine students. MRSA was not detected (Holy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>). However, a more recent study conducted in 2021 from the city of Prague shows that the colonization rate in students was almost 45%, of which 2 isolates (1.1%) were characterized as MRSA. Of the 178 students involved in the study, 118 belonged to the first year and 60 to the sixth year, with no significant difference in carriage between the groups. MRSA was detected in both groups (Smelikova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2023</xref>). Despite the similar methodological approach, the study produced different prevalence results.</p><p id="Par8">The aims of the study are as follows: (i) to determine the prevalence of Sa among medical students who have varying levels of exposure to the hospital environment, (ii) to assess the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Sa (MRSA) among medical students, (iii) to characterize the obtained isolates of Sa, including their virulence factors and antibiotic resistance profiles, (iv) to provide valuable insights into the risk of Sa colonization and transmission among medical students and the potential implications for patient care and infection control measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subject and sample collection</title><p id="Par9">The study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine Ethics committee at Masaryk University with approval number 34/22 and it was conducted in the pre-clinical (March 2022&#x02013;June 2022) and in the clinical student groups (October 2022&#x02013;January 2023).

For medical students, this risk increases with longer stays in hospital facilities during mandatory internships. Although the prevalence of MSSA may increase with the length of exposure to the hospital environment, we did not observe a significant difference in the nasal prevalence of MSSA between our groups of students (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.623) as well as other authors (Ar&#x00131;kan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>; Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">The prevalence of MSSA in both groups of students exceeded the reported rates in other studies, where nasal carriage of Sa ranged from 20 to 30% (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>; Gualdoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>). The higher prevalence observed in this study may be attributed to the methodology used for sample processing. Studies that employed direct culture without pre-enrichment reported lower rates of MSSA detection, whereas those utilizing enrichment techniques demonstrated higher rates (Sarkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>; Stensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>). Stensen et al. (2002) compared the recovery of Sa using direct culture and using enrichment culture, identifying Sa in 30.3% of samples using direct culture and 42.6% using enrichment culture (Stensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>). These findings underscore the impact of different laboratory methods on the observed prevalence rates and highlight the need for standardized protocols in future studies.</p><p id="Par34">Interestingly, the incidence of MSSA from fingerprints was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004) in the clinical student group compared to the pre-clinical one. This difference may be attributed to variations in exposure to environmental contamination, frequency of contacts and other behavioral factors or, more likely, differences in attitudes towards hand hygiene This finding emphasizes the ongoing need for reinforcing the importance of proper hand hygiene practices among medical students throughout their education.</p><p id="Par35">The presence of MRSA isolates among medical students is a concerning finding, as it suggests potential colonization even before exposure to the hospital environment or gradual acquisition over time (Orlin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). In our study, MRSA was detected in one of 138 students enrolled in the clinical group. This is less than reported by a study focusing on hospital personnel in Europe and the USA (Dulon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>). The low prevalence may be related to the current epidemiological situation and the declining trend of MRSA incidence in the country. Within Europe, the Czech Republic is among the countries with a lower MRSA incidence and a gradual decline was reported in recent years (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2023b</xref>). The MRSA isolate identified in this study was not a multidrug-resistant strain but exhibited resistance to fusidic acid, which is commonly used for decolonization purposes. The resistance to fusidic acid raises concern regarding potential treatment failures (Banerjee and Arg&#x000e1;ez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). The student carrying the MRSA isolate had no risk contacts and had not recently taken antibiotics. During her compulsory practice, she visited the Department of Pulmonary Diseases and was in contact with patients with tuberculosis. The CC8 to which MRSA isolate belonged is frequently circulating in Czech hospitals, suggesting a possible acquisition during the student&#x000b4;s stay in a hospital environment (Pomorska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">Enterotoxins <italic>seg</italic> and <italic>sei</italic> dominated in both groups of students, with a significant difference in nasal swab isolates. The clinical student group, with higher exposure to the hospital environment, exhibited a higher prevalence of <italic>sei</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034) and <italic>seg</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017) genes compared to the pre-clinical group. These enterotoxins lay close to each other on the chromosome and are therefore often found together in the same isolate (Jarraud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1999</xref>). Enterotoxins <italic>seg</italic> and <italic>sei</italic> are also associated with toxic shock syndrome and scarlet fever. This was also confirmed by our results, where all isolates from both groups that carried <italic>eta</italic> or <italic>etb</italic> simultaneously carried <italic>seg</italic> and <italic>sei</italic> genes. <italic>tst</italic> genes were demonstrated only in clinical students with a significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.42E-10) compared to pre-clinical students. All isolates obtaining the <italic>tst</italic> gene simultaneously carried only the <italic>seg</italic> gene and not the <italic>sei</italic> gene (Jarraud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1999</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">In terms of antibiotic resistance, the majority of isolates were found to be sensitive to tested antibiotics. However, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin, particularly the inducible MLS resistance type, was prevalent among MSSA isolates in both groups. Sa with inducible MLS resistance, appear to be sensitive to clindamycin, but due to the presence of <italic>erm</italic> genes, they are resistant to this type of antibiotic. This finding is of clinical significance as clindamycin is an important antibiotic for treating staphylococcal infections, including MRSA, and its efficacy may be comprised in the presence of inducible resistance (Sasirekha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">The analysis of <italic>spa</italic> types provided insights into the genetic diversity of Sa isolates among the student groups. A total of 58 different <italic>spa</italic> types were identified among the 152 isolates, indicating a high variability of <italic>spa</italic> types within the MSSA circulating among the students. The generated phylogenetic tree shows the mutual relatedness based on the <italic>spa</italic> type. Six clusters were formed, with the three larger clusters indicated by numbers in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Interestingly, the 5 most frequently detected <italic>spa</italic> types in both groups occurred in the largest cluster I, suggesting that the most prevalent MSSA isolates are more closely related to each other. In contrast, the most frequent <italic>spa</italic> type common to both groups of students, t078, occurred in cluster III, farther away from the other frequent <italic>spa</italic> types. Among clinical isolates in Europe, t032, t002, and t008 are frequently detected (Asadollahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>), but they were not recorded in any group of students in this study. It is worth noting that 31 isolates could not be assigned a <italic>spa</italic> type, suggesting the novel or uncharacterized <italic>spa</italic> types not yet recorded in the available database. This highlights the need for continuous surveillance and updating of databases to accommodate emerging strains and ensure accurate identification and characterization of Sa isolates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">In conclusion, this study provides insights into the prevalence and characterization of MSSA and MRSA among medical students. By including data on virulence, resistance, and isolate typing, it addresses critical aspects that are often overlooked in similar research. This could provide a more holistic understanding of the subject matter. We did not find that the medical students in our cohort were significant source of MRSA to their patients and the general population. However, the high prevalence of MSSA, the presence of MRSA, and the diversity of <italic>spa</italic> types observed among the student groups warrant further research to better understand the epidemiology and dynamics of Sa infections in this population. Such knowledge will contribute to the development of targeted interventions to prevent and control the spread of Sa in healthcare environments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12223_2024_1237_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (XLSX 26 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Brod&#x000ed;kov&#x000e1; Krist&#x000fd;na&#x02014;investigation, writing original draft preparation.
