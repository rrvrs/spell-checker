Oral malignancies originate in the oral tissue, including the lip, tongue, gingiva, the floor of the mouth, buccal mucosa, palate, and retromolar trigone [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the common histologic type (90%), followed by adenocarcinoma, whereas, verrucous carcinoma is rare [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Regular exposure to topical carcinogens (alcohol, tobacco, cigarette smoking, etc.) is considered to be a significant factor in maximum oral cancer cases [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Surgery and radiotherapy are the most common treatment modalities in OSCC cases, individually or combined. A single modality (either surgery or radiotherapy) is applicable in stage I/II cancers. In stage III, combined or multimodality treatment (surgery + radiotherapy + chemotherapy&#x000a0;or chemotherapy + radiotherapy) is used while palliative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in stage IV cancers [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By definition, stage I oral cancer refers to a lesion less than 2 cm in size with a depth of 5 mm or less without spreading to surrounding tissue or lymph nodes. In TNM (tumor, node, and metastasis) staging, this is equivalent to T1 N0 M0. Stage 2 oral cancer refers to lesions more than 2 cm but less than 4 cm in size. In staging, it is equivalent to T2 N0 M0.&#x000a0;In the early stages of OSCC, i.e., T1, T2, and N0, the surgical treatment of choice is wide local excision of the primary tumor with selective neck dissection, i.e., supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOHND), which involves removal of level 1, 2, and 3 cervical lymph nodes. Excision of the submandibular gland&#x000a0;(SMG) has traditionally been an integral part of level 1B dissection as it is near lymph nodes and it was believed that sparing SMG would lead&#x000a0;to residual unrestricted lymph nodes.</p><p>Routine excision of the SMG during level 1B dissection causes a significant decrease in saliva production, leading to xerostomia. In SMG excision, 21% of patients were reported postoperatively with xerostomia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, as the SMG does not contain intraglandular lymph nodes, removal of an uninvolved SMG may not always be necessary, particularly in cases of early-stage OSCC. This helps avoid xerostomia particularly if postoperative radiotherapy is also required [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The need for SMG preservation methods during level&#x000a0;Ib lymph node dissection at SOHND arose to avoid xerostomia. It progressed with the ideology of avoiding radical treatment and balancing oncological requirements with the chance of recurrence of cancer. Thus, the present study aims to observe the efficacy of SMG excision vs. preservation during SOHND for early&#x000a0;OSCC&#x000a0;with clinically N0 neck, based on the postoperative outcomes, particularly, the incidence of xerostomia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design and setting</p><p>A prospective, hospital-based, pilot study was conducted at the General Surgery Department, Pradyumna Bal Memorial Hospital, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha to examine the feasibility of new surgical methods in early OSCC&#x000a0;in the period of two years (October&#x000a0;2020 to September 2022).</p><p>Study population</p><p>Early OSCC (T1, T2, and N0) patients and patients with clinically diagnosed node-negative status of cervical lymph nodes were the study population.

Eleven patients opted for the preservation method and were in the test group and the rest nine patients were in the control group.

Intraoperatively, both groups were compared based on blood loss, and time taken for level Ib lymph node dissection. Histopathologically, lymph node yield (level Ib) was also compared between the test and control groups. Postoperative follow-up was done for up to four weeks. At four weeks, a xerostomia assessment was done in both groups using the Xerostomia Inventory score and Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Adjuvant radiotherapy was used in some patients based on lymphovascular invasion (LVI)/perineural invasion (PNI) in the histopathological examination (HPE) report after a thorough discussion in the multidisciplinary tumor board.

The surgery duration was higher in the preservation method than in the routine excision. This is likely because preservation of the SMG requires safeguarding of the facial artery and its branches to the submandibular gland. This dissection is tedious at times when complete lymph node dissection is intended.</p><p>Blood loss during&#x000a0;level Ib lymph node dissection was compared between the two study groups.&#x000a0;Blood loss was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group&#x000a0;(p-value = 0.002). This is likely because the excision of the entire lymph node packet with an SMG and facial artery branches enables dissection in embryological planes where the chance of bleeding is much less as compared to organ-preserving dissection&#x000a0;where lymph nodes are closely associated with the SMG.</p><p>Level Ib lymph node yield in the final histopathology report between the test and control groups was found to be insignificant (p-value = 0.331). This result is consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ebrahim et al. did a retrospective study on SMG involvement in head and neck carcinoma and found only one sample of the gland infiltrated that too with direct extension from the primary in a total of 107 cases [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Another&#x000a0;retrospective study specifically on OSCC patients showed zero involvement of SMG in a total of 115 patients.&#x000a0;They found it&#x000a0;as an oncologically safe procedure to save the SMG during neck dissection [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;Javadi et al. reported one tongue squamous cell carcinoma patient having SMG out of 131 patients [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another retrospective study of 69 OSCC patients showed two patients having SMG with contiguous involvement, proposing SMG preservation in early OSCC patients with preoperative node-negative disease, supporting our study [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. At four-week&#x000a0;and six-month intervals, using subjective questionnaires, i.e., Xerostomia Inventory scale and CODS, a comparison between the test and control groups showed a significant difference, with a slightly higher incidence of xerostomia in the control group than the test group having a p-value = 0.020. However, in the same comparison at six-month intervals, the result was insignificant (p-value = 0.370). Chen et al. assessed postoperative xerostomia between patients who underwent SMG preservation and those who underwent excision during level Ib dissection along with a control group of normal individuals of the same age and reported no difference in the scores of xerostomia between the preservation and excision groups [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is likely because irradiation leads to a decrease or loss of SMG function. As per the USG of the neck, at four-week and six-month follow-up,&#x000a0;no recurrence was seen in both the test and control groups.&#x000a0;Local recurrence was observed in only one patient after eight months. This recurrence could be due to poor disease biology or a second primary lesion. As both methods were observed to be safe and&#x000a0;recurrence was not observed in the preservation method with this low sample size, a larger multicentric study would be recommended to assess the outcomes and other benefits of SMG preservation.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>Low sample size is the major limitation of the study due to which a significant difference could not be established in terms of xerostomia between the test and control group patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy. This study was significantly affected by the COVID-19 period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both SMG preservation and routine SMG excision during SOHND in early OSCC were performed equally. SMG preservation appeared to be safe oncologically as there were no recurrent intraglandular lymph nodes and zero incidence of xerostomia.
