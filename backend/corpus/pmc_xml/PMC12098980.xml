While the availability of telemedical EMS systems increases continuously, there is a gap in research regarding respiratory emergencies in the context of prehospital telemedicine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided in prehospital respiratory emergencies, managed through a tele-EMS system with a specialized EMS physician. Tele-EMS physician missions from 01/01/2019 to 12/31/2021 in Aachen, Germany, were analyzed. Adult patients presenting with dyspnea, peripheral oxygen saturation&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;94%, respiratory rate&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;19/min, or any combination of these factors, were included (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2234). Data were derived from mission protocols recorded by the attending tele-EMS physicians. Significant changes (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) in vital parameters towards physiological ranges were observed. For the most common diagnoses, a significant improvement in patient condition was achieved with the use of appropriate medications. In 14 cases (0.63%), an onsite-EMS physician was requested. These cases were confirmed to involve unstable patients who required intervention of an onsite-EMS physician. The tele-EMS physician effectively bridged the time until arrival of the physician. Overall, the study demonstrated that respiratory emergencies were effectively managed using the tele-EMS physician system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Medical research</kwd><kwd>Preclinical research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>RWTH Aachen University (3131)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par9">Conditions leading to severe respiratory distress are a common cause of death in adults and serve as a frequent trigger for emergency response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Firstly, reasons for this include demographic changes with an aging population and the associated increasing morbidity. In contrast, there is a shortage of qualified staff in emergency medical services (EMS), rising response times in rural areas leading to delayed patient care, and increasing economic pressure. Secondly, this patient group poses a challenge for prehospital emergency teams, as there are numerous differential diagnoses to be considered, leading to diverse&#x02014;sometimes even conflicting&#x02014;therapeutic options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Studies have shown a correlation between misdiagnoses and increased mortality in emergency patients with respiratory problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">All these factors may impact the outcome of the patients to be treated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. To counteract these problems and provide a possible solution, telemedicine is increasingly being integrated into prehospital emergency care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was demonstrated that various technological systems were used in the out-of-hospital care of patients. For example, the benefit of ultrasound performed by nurses on patients at home, with the support of a telemedicine-accessible physician, was shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">The increasing availability of telemedical support for EMS has not yet been researched in the specific context of respiratory emergencies. To address the disparity between a growing number of aging patients with respiratory problems and the shortage of skilled personnel, along with an increased number of emergency calls, it is imperative to investigate prehospital emergency telemedicine in relation to this specific patient group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. There are currently only a few studies that consider telemedicine as one of several pillars of the treatment of patients with respiratory emergencies. For example, one study demonstrated that telemedical respiratory examinations are feasible and reliable in young children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, another study indicates that the use of telemedicine in the management of patients with asthma led to a reduction in exacerbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, there is a lack of data that examines the quality of care for this adult patient group as comprehensively as possible using telemedicine in the prehospital setting.</p><p id="Par13">The main objective of this study focuses on assessing the quality of care provided by a telemedicine emergency medical service (tele-EMS) physician system for patients with respiratory emergencies. The aim is to determine whether the affected patients received adequate treatment and experienced a positive outcome under the administered therapy, until handoff to the hospital. Along with this, the various diagnoses that lead to respiratory distress are being examined in detail, and the respective management by the tele-EMS physician is being analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par14">This retrospective study examines tele-EMS physician missions in Aachen, Germany, from the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The data were made available on 10/30/2022.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Structure and setting of telemedical system in the city of Aachen, Germany</title><p id="Par15">According to the statistical Yearbook 2020&#x02013;2021 of Aachen, in 2019, 258,816 people lived in Aachen, which, with an area of 160.8 square kilometers, resulted in an average population density of 1609 inhabitants per square kilometer. The population decreased only marginally during the study period, by 228 people, to a total of 258,588 inhabitants. In these years, 10,761 tele-EMS interventions were reported. This corresponds to an incidence of 4158 per 100,000 inhabitants.</p><p id="Par16">The German EMS is characterized by the routine involvement of emergency physicians in prehospital care. The tele-EMS physician system in Aachen is based on two pillars: the tele-EMS physician center and the specially equipped ambulances. On one hand, the tele-EMS physician is located in the tele-EMS physician center. This center is staffed 24/7, and the tele-EMS physician on duty is responsible for immediate remote response to consultation requests from the on-scene teams. The workstation is specially equipped and includes multiple monitors, and data linkage providing the tele-EMS physician with access to live-transmitted vital signs, visual material from the scene, the location of the on-site team, documentation software, and full access to all local treatment protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the ambulances are equipped with a communication unit that ensures the transmission of the aforementioned data to the tele-EMS physician center. Additionally, a smartphone can be used for photo transmission, and a high-resolution camera in the ambulance can be remotely accessed for video transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">When considering the personnel involved, two professional groups are regarded as essential components of tele-EMS care. First, the tele-EMS physician: In Germany, the requirements for obtaining tele-EMS physician qualification are regulated. It is required that the physician has completed at least 500 missions as an on-scene EMS physician, has completed a medical specialization in a field relevant to emergency medicine, and holds a course certificate in intensive care transport. Local regulations may require additional qualifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Second, paramedics with a three-year vocational training: Paramedics working with tele-EMS undergo an additional one-day training course on the use and application of the specific tele-EMS system in their EMS district. Paramedics autonomously decide whether to consult a tele-EMS physician or to independently manage the emergency according to local protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par18">The data consists of digital tele-EMS physician protocols. Before including the data in the statistical analysis, plausibility checks were carried out. During this period, the tele-EMS physician was consulted on 10,761 missions. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria.

A saturation below 94% was chosen because it corresponds to current standards, literature, and guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The same applies to the inclusion of patients with a respiratory rate greater than 19 / min to ensure that no patients with respiratory emergencies are overlooked. Subsequently, patients were excluded if they were under 18&#x000a0;years of age, underwent inter-hospital transfers, or were involved in incidents where an on-site EMS physician was simultaneously dispatched. This approach resulted in a study group of 2234 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Examined factors and outcome variables</title><p id="Par20">The following demographic data were included: age, gender, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) score, and diagnosis. The NACA score is a system used to evaluate medical emergencies and is applied in many European countries, ranging from NACA 1 (minor disturbance) to NACA 7 (death) (NACA 2&#x02014;moderate disturbance, NACA 3&#x02014;severe but not life-threatening disorder, NACA 4&#x02014;potentially life-threatening, NACA 5&#x02014;acute risk of death, NACA 6&#x02014;cardiac arrest)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">To assess whether the tele-EMS physician system was able to effectively manage the patients&#x02019; respiratory issues, the primary outcome variables considered were respiratory rate in 1/min, SpO<sub>2</sub> in %, heart rate in 1/min, and systolic blood pressure in mmHg. The initial measured vital signs were compared with the last measurements. In addition, oxygen administration was examined in greater detail, and the correlation between SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;94% and oxygen administration was analyzed.</p><p id="Par22">In order to evaluate which conditions related to respiratory emergencies could be managed effectively by the tele-EMS physician, the diagnoses were categorized into primary cardiovascular, primary respiratory, primary neurological / psychological, primary other focus, and trauma. These diagnostic groups reflect that dyspnea is a common leading symptom of various medical conditions. Diagnoses were assigned accordingly. Diagnoses that could not be clearly classified into one of these groups, were assigned to the primarily respiratory group, as this was the main focus of this study (e.g., anaphylactic reactions with cardiovascular and respiratory manifestations). This resulted in the following clusters: For primarily cardiovascular group, the diagnoses included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hypertensive crisis, arrhythmia, (pre-)syncope, decompensated heart failure, thoracic pain, pulmonary embolism, and anemia. For primarily respiratory group, the diagnoses encompassed respiratory infections and pneumonia, obstructive lung diseases with exacerbation, unspecified dyspnea, allergic reactions, pulmonary edema, aspiration, and pneumothorax. Lastly, for other causes, the diagnoses involved pain syndromes, gastritis, general deterioration of condition, dehydration, intoxications, urinary tract infections, hypo- or hyperglycemia, and palliative care. Additionally, the initial and most recently measured vital parameters (Respiratory rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate, systolic blood pressure) of the individual diagnostic groups are compared.</p><p id="Par23">To enable a more detailed investigation of as many treatments as possible, the two most common diagnoses within the cardiovascular group and the two most common diagnoses within the respiratory group were further analyzed. This approach ensures a detailed examination of the majority of treated patients without compromising clarity. Thus, the following diagnoses were reviewed within the primary cardiovascular group: ACS and hypertensive crisis. For ACS, the administration of heparin, aspirin, and oxygen was examined in greater detail. For patients with hypertensive crises, the administration of urapidil and oxygen was examined, as this is part of the local protocol.</p><p id="Par24">Under the primary respiratory group, respiratory infections / pneumonia and obstructive lung diseases were analyzed. For respiratory infections, the focus was placed on oxygen administration. Due to the variability of infections (e.g. COVID-19, pneumonia) and the corresponding spectrum of treatments, this analysis focused on the evaluation of oxygen administration, as no anti-infective medication is carried in the emergency medical services of the Aachen region. In cases of obstructive lung diseases, the administration of ipratropium bromide, salbutamol, prednisone, and oxygen were evaluated.</p><p id="Par25">Lastly, we analyzed a small number of cases in which an onsite-EMS physician was secondarily dispatched (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14). In these cases, the onsite-EMS physician provided a handwritten intervention protocol, which served as data source. In 4 missions, the onsite-EMS physician was affiliated outside the city of Aachen and these protocols were unavailable for analysis. Consequently, 10 protocols are used as the basis for this subgroup analysis. Demographics, NACA score, diagnostic group, and vital parameters were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par26">The digital records underwent plausibility checks to reduce and correct obvious errors before conducting statistical analyses. These checks were performed by the authors. In the individual analyses, patients with missing and irreproducible relevant data were excluded.

This finding aligns with the current literature, which emphasizes that patients with respiratory emergencies constitute a substantial portion of the prehospital EMS care population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par37">An important question is whether this diverse patient group was adequately managed using the tele-EMS physician system. It is well established that the highest standards of patient safety can be achieved through guideline-adherent practices and structured processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These standards, however, are predominantly based on the physical presence of a physician. Furthermore, in the prehospital setting, decisions are influenced by numerous factors, and the resources available in an in-hospital environment are not readily accessible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Are these multifactorial decisions and processes sustainable when managed by a remotely located EMS physician?</p><p id="Par38">It is important to note that the traditional paternalistic model, where "the doctor knows best," has largely been replaced by guideline-based medicine, which is grounded in evidence or at least expert consensus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Guideline-based medicine is carried out by various professional groups within the medical field. In the context of this study, the focus is on the tele-EMS physician system. However, it is also emphasized that the on-site team is an integral part of the tele-EMS physician system. This team consists of paramedics and, in some cases, on-site EMS physicians. Previous studies have demonstrated that these professional groups, both in combination and independently, are capable of working in accordance with clinical guidelines, thereby contributing to patient outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par39">However, it cannot be determined whether, in the cases examined, the same guideline adherence would have been achieved by the on-site paramedic team alone. On-site paramedics utilize the tele-EMS physician system voluntarily. Consequently, consultation with the tele-EMS physician was typically initiated at the discretion of the paramedics, for instance, in instances of diagnostic ambiguity, when specific patient presentations necessitated physician advice, or when the patient&#x02019;s clinical presentation did not conform to established standard operating procedures. The exclusion of respiratory emergencies managed exclusively by on-scene teams may introduce a potential selection bias. Future studies should address this question, as it would also facilitate the potential transferability of such systems to settings where no on-site EMS physician is present. For example, it could be investigated whether training paramedics in ultrasonography provides added value when combined with the tele-EMS physician system.</p><p id="Par40">Furthermore, the requirements for working as a tele-EMS physician were outlined. Considering the declining number of on-scene deployments, the prerequisite of 500 missions may become increasingly difficult to achieve in the future. However, it should be considered that a considerable number of these 500 deployments do not necessitate technical or invasive measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, suggesting that the declining number of on-scene deployments might not necessarily represent a relevant loss of experience. This could be one reason to reevaluate and potentially adjust the qualification criteria for tele-EMS physicians in order to ensure the long-term recruitment of experienced and qualified personnel.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Vital parameters</title><p id="Par41">The number of prehospital emergency cases involving dispatch categories related to respiratory emergencies remains consistently high in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These patients pose a significant challenge for attending EMS personnel. A wide range of diagnoses is associated with this clinical presentation, necessitating diverse treatment approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In our study, 20.76% (2234/10,761) of all tele-EMS emergency cases were analyzed, representing a substantial proportion of total cases, consistent with current literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Furthermore, previous research has demonstrated that emergency patients with respiratory distress show high rates of in-hospital mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This highlights the importance of thoroughly investigating this patient group and identifying potential deficits in their prehospital care, in line with the principles of an open safety culture and improved patient safety.</p><p id="Par42">When evaluating vital parameters, significant changes were observed in peripheral oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate over the course of tele-EMS consultations. An analysis of these vital signs largely demonstrated a shift toward the respective desired target ranges. Studies conducted in in-hospital settings have demonstrated that vital signs provide valuable insights into the condition of patients. Moreover, when correctly interpreted, they can facilitate accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, maintaining vital signs within target ranges is associated with more stable patient conditions and improved outcomes. In the prehospital setting, it has been demonstrated that patients could be stratified, among other factors, based on their vital parameters, allowing differentiation between low, medium, and high-risk patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. On average, the prehospital tele-EMS physicians together with on-scene paramedics were able to achieve target values in vital signs for their patients through the applied therapies, without a physician being physically present at the scene. This underscores the considerable potential of telemedicine, which has already been broadly demonstrated in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Its application in the management of respiratory emergencies thus represents a promising use case for this system. However, future studies should provide a comparative overview of the skills and resulting outcomes that on-site paramedics can achieve independently, and at which specific points the tele-EMS physician system contributes, as this cannot be fully determined from our data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Diagnostic groups</title><p id="Par43">The two largest diagnostic groups identified are primary cardiovascular causes and primary respiratory causes. This distribution does not differ from other studies in the prehospital setting related to telemedicine, which also report cardiovascular cases as the predominant group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Similarly, cardiovascular emergencies frequently dominate in prehospital emergency medicine without telemedicine systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, this study represents a realistic composition of common emergency scenarios and can serve as a robust basis for further investigations.</p><p id="Par44">When comparing the individual diagnostic groups with each other, it becomes evident that both the respiratory rate and heart rate in the primary respiratory group differ significantly from most other groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). This holds true for both the initial measurements and the last recorded values. Overall, respiratory and heart rates closer to the normal range were achieved in this diagnostic group. Similar observations apply to oxygen saturation in the primary cardiovascular diagnostic group, where significant differences are noted compared to the other groups. However, the results of the last recorded values also demonstrate a marked improvement.</p><p id="Par45">When focusing on cases with a primary cardiovascular diagnostic group, the two dominant conditions identified are ACS and hypertensive emergencies. ACS is one of the most common conditions encountered in prehospital patient care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and therefore, it is particularly important to examine guideline adherence and patient safety in this context. Studies have already demonstrated that prehospital operations utilizing tele-EMS systems exhibit a high level of adherence to guidelines, comparable to operations involving an on-site EMS physician<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The administration of aspirin and heparin was documented and correlated significantly with the diagnosis of ACS (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). In addition, oxygen was administered when SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;94% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). These findings are consistent with the existing literature. Previous studies have shown guideline-compliant administration of aspirin, heparin, morphine, and oxygen using a tele-EMS physician system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par46">The treatment of hypertensive emergencies is discussed second. In our study, we demonstrated that the systolic blood pressure was reduced. The final values were closer to the targeted range, while ensuring they did not fall below 20% of the initial measurement, following local and national protocols. Additionally, the administration of appropriate medications was shown to be significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). One study has shown that for hypertensive crises and emergencies in tele-EMS deployments, adherence to guidelines was comparable to cases managed by an onsite-EMS physician. Both teams&#x02014;one supported by a tele-EMS physician and the other by an onsite-EMS physician&#x02014;achieved successful blood pressure reductions. In the patient group treated via tele-EMS system, there were fewer cases where a blood pressure drop exceeded the recommended threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This finding aligns with the results of our study: only one case reported systolic blood pressure decrease below target values. As this study does not include comparison groups with an onsite-EMS physician, no conclusions can be drawn in this regard. However, the results are consistent with existing literature and support the hypothesis that emergencies in the diagnostic group of hypertensive emergencies can be managed in adherence to guidelines using telemedicine. This conclusion is further supported by another study, which demonstrated that telemedicine-assisted interventions in potentially life-threatening patient conditions led to significant improvements in vital parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Based on these results and in consideration of the current body of literature, it can be concluded that the use of the tele-EMS physician system facilitates high-quality therapy within this diagnostic spectrum.</p><p id="Par47">When analyzing the primary respiratory diagnostic group, respiratory infections / pneumonia and obstructive lung diseases emerged as the most frequent diagnoses among the study group. Respiratory infections are highly variable in presentation and thus require diverse treatment approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Current studies indicate that COVID-19 infections continue to play an important role in prehospital care, alongside pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Since these infections require distinct management strategies, and no anti-infective medication were carried in the local EMS, our study investigated oxygen administration. Measured oxygen saturation was significantly increased over the course of the consultation. Obstructive lung diseases were identified as the second most common diagnosis among primary respiratory conditions. For these diagnoses, the administration of ipratropium bromide, salbutamol, prednisone, and oxygen was analyzed. Significant administration rates for the respective medications were observed (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), representing guideline-adherent treatment. Other studies have shown that such management, in cases involving onsite-EMS physicians or in an in-hospital setting, leads to improved patient outcomes and adheres to current guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. As our findings are consistent with these results, it can be concluded that treatment of chronic obstructive lung disease within the tele-EMS physician system also ensures a high quality of care. For other diagnostic groups (trauma, primary neurological / psychiatric and other conditions), improvements in vital parameters toward target ranges were also observed. It is noteworthy, that respiratory rate was recorded relatively more frequently in trauma patients compared to the other diagnostic groups. Overall, respiratory rate was recorded less frequently across all diagnostic groups compared to other vital parameters. This vital sign is rarely measured in prehospital EMS care, primarily because only a few monitoring devices are capable of capturing it automatically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. As a result, there is a gap in the assessment and management of respiratory emergencies. Moving forward, the routine measurement of respiratory rate should become a standard practice during emergency operations. We assume that respiratory rate was recorded more frequently in trauma patients compared to other diagnostic groups, as its assessment is integrated into the structured ABCDE approach commonly used in trauma care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Incidents with additional alarm of onsite-EMS physician</title><p id="Par48">An onsite-EMS physician was requested for a total of 14 cases. This corresponds to 0.63% (14/2234) of all cases considered in this study and thus represents a small proportion. These patients showed a higher frequency of critical NACA scores (&#x0003e;&#x02009;/&#x02009;=&#x02009;NACA 4) compared to the overall population examined. Accordingly, the patients in this subgroup can be classified as potentially life-threatening (NACA 4) and in acute risk of death (NACA 5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. All data from these missions demonstrate clear indications for requesting an onsite-EMS physician. For example, securing the airway through endotracheal intubation was necessary in two cases. In Aachen, Germany, an on-site EMS physician is required for this procedure due to their specific expertise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, the expertise of the on-site EMS physician was required in situations where the paramedics may have lacked full confidence. Furthermore, the tele-EMS physician system is not intended to substitute for an onsite-EMS physician in life-threatening emergencies. However, studies demonstrated that many potentially life-threatening emergencies could be managed by the tele-EMS physician, provided they did not require invasive interventions that would necessitate an onsite-EMS physician<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the study also highlights that conditions such as myocardial infarctions, cardiac pulmonary edema, and malignant arrhythmias require the presence of an onsite-EMS physician<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This aligns with our findings. It was demonstrated that vital parameters remained stable or improved, and the tele-EMS physician system bridged the time until the arrival of the onsite-EMS physician, thereby reducing the physician-led therapy-free interval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par49">Since this monocentric study examines the tele-EMS system in one location, the results are not generalizable and may not be directly applicable to other regions with different conditions. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of the technical, spatial, and structural conditions of the tele-EMS physician center. For example, whether simultaneous clinical activities (e.g. in an emergency department) might impair the quality and adherence to guideline-based care. Based on the retrospective nature of this study the tele-EMS protocols were not developed exclusively for our analyses. Furthermore, the protocols were completed by the attending tele-EMS physicians directly during and after missions. This may introduce both reporting and recall bias. No arterial blood gas analyses were performed during the consultations. This could have provided further insights for assessing the patient&#x02019;s condition. Another limitation is the preselection performed by the emergency dispatch center, where decisions are made regarding which resources are dispatched to the scene. In our study, we analyzed the protocols of patients managed via telemedicine. However, the protocols of patients with respiratory emergencies who were primarily treated by an on-scene emergency physician or exclusively by an ambulance were not included. This presents notable potential for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par50">Overall, patients with respiratory problems included in the study were successfully treated. The application of the tele-EMS physician system demonstrated significant changes in vital parameters, adjusting them into the desired target range. Despite the various diagnoses that can lead to respiratory symptoms, the tele-EMS physicians were able to provide adequate treatment together with on-site paramedics. Guideline-compliant therapies were prescribed and implemented, resulting in enhanced patient outcomes. An analysis of individual diagnoses allowed for categorization into different groups of respiratory issues. These analyses demonstrated that stabilization of vital parameters could also be achieved within these specific groups. Highlighting the individual clinical pictures further substantiated improved outcomes and adherence to guideline-based therapy.</p><p id="Par51">In the future, the individual diagnoses identified here should be further investigated, for example, through an in-hospital follow-up of patients, which could help identify risk constellations.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACS</term><def><p id="Par2">Acute coronary syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par3">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMS</term><def><p id="Par4">Emergency medical service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NACA</term><def><p id="Par5">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par6">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SpO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p id="Par7">Peripheral oxygen saturation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>tele-EMS</term><def><p id="Par8">Telemedicine emergency medical service</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We extend our gratitude to all EMS staff in the city of Aachen, Germany, for their dedicated daily care of prehospital emergency patients.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>A.B., H.S, and M.F. designed the study.
