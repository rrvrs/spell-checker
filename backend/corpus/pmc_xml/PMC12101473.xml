Initial velocities for the oxidation of soluble ferrous ions by intact cells at 60 &#x000b0;C and pH 1.5 were determined using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted accurate absorbance measurements to quantify the increase in soluble ferric iron in the presence of turbid suspensions of the live organisms. <italic>M. sedula</italic> that was cultured on yeast extract either in the absence or the presence of 20 mM soluble ferrous iron exhibited turnover numbers for soluble iron oxidation of 304 &#x000b1; 26 and 333 &#x000b1; 31 attamoles/cell/min, respectively. These functional data were consistent with the transcriptomic evidence presented by others, that the proteins presumably responsible for aerobic respiration on soluble iron are expressed constitutively in <italic>M. sedula</italic>. Intact cells of <italic>M. sedula</italic> were characterized by electrical impedance, laser light diffraction, and transmission electron microscopic measurements. All three types of measurements were consistent with the surprising observation that cells cultured on yeast extract in the presence of soluble iron bifurcated into approximately equal numbers of coccoidal cells of two sizes, smaller cells with an average diameter of 0.6 &#x003bc;m and larger cells with an average diameter of 1.35 &#x003bc;m. Cells cultured on the same concentration of yeast extract but in the absence of soluble iron comprised a single cell size with an intermediate average diameter of 1.06 &#x003bc;m.

Cells are regular to slightly irregular cocci, about 0.6 to 1.5 &#x003bc;m in diameter (Huber and Stetter, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Growth occurs at 50 to 80&#x000b0;C (optimal 65 to 75&#x000b0;C) and pH 1.0 to 6.5 (optimal 2.5 to 3.5). <italic>M. sedula</italic> is aerobic and facultatively chemolithoautotrophic. Heterotrophic growth occurs on complex organic compounds such as yeast extract, casamino acids, peptone and tryptone. Autotrophic or mixotrophic growth occurs in the presence of reduced sulfur compounds, selected sulfide minerals, and soluble ferrous iron. The <italic>Metallosphaera</italic> genus contains six species that are currently recognized (Fuchs et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Kurosawa, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Peng et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kozubal et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Other genera within the order <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> that harbor archaea that greatly resemble <italic>M. sedula</italic> include <italic>Acidianus</italic> (5 species) (Segerer et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Plumb et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Fuchs et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; He et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Yoshida et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Urbieta et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), <italic>Sulfurisphaera</italic> (3 species) (Kurosawa et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Tsuboi et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), <italic>Sulfuracidiflex</italic> (2 species) (Huber and Stetter, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Itoh et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and <italic>Sulfodiicoccus</italic> (Sakai and Kurosawa, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). All of these thermoacidiphilic archaea are described as lobed or irregular cocci with diameters from 0.5 to 1.8 &#x003bc;m (Liu J. et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Liu L. J. et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Lewis et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>A principal feature of the energy metabolism of these physiologically related <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> is their ability to respire aerobically on soluble reduced iron. Despite the interest in this activity for its contribution to the oxidation and dissolution of minerals within ore bodies, the biomolecules and electron transfer reactions that participate in respiration on soluble iron remain poorly understood. Early studies simply reported the novel spectral properties of presumed electron transfer proteins that were observed in cell-free extracts in archaeal cells that were cultured aerobically on soluble iron (Barr et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Blake et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). A proteomic and transcriptomic study in cell-free extracts of <italic>Sulfuracidiflex</italic> (formerly <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>) <italic>metallicus</italic> first identified proteins and gene products that appeared to be upregulated after the cells were exposed to ferrous iron (Bathe and Norris, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The relevant <italic>fox</italic> genes were subsequently reported from genomic studies to represent terminal heme-copper oxidases whose primary structures were unique to the archaea (Hemp and Gennis, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Sousa et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Others have reported further genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic studies for iron oxidation determinants in the extremely thermoacidophilic archaea (Kozubal et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Auernik and Kelly, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Auernik et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). There is now strong circumstantial evidence that the <italic>fox</italic> gene products, which appear <italic>via</italic> proteomics and transcriptomics to be expressed constitutively in <italic>M. sedula</italic>, are responsible for conducting the electron transfer reactions that comprise aerobic respiration on soluble iron (Counts et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). An ongoing problem, however, is that accompanying functional assays to quantify iron oxidation by intact cells or cell-free extracts have lagged far behind the elegant genomic, metagenomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic studies. Thus a typical functional measurement consists of a single, fixed-time assay where a sample is removed and treated with 1,10-phenanthroline or a similar organic compound that complexes with ferrous iron and changes color for optical quantification. In order to fully understand and appreciate any biochemical event or reaction, one has to actually monitor the event or reaction as it occurs in real time; simply cataloging the participants, no matter how detailed and thorough is the list, isn't sufficient.</p><p>This laboratory has described an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM) that permits accurate absorbance measurements to be conducted in turbid media like suspensions of intact cells (Blake and Griff, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Blake et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Blake and White, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Blake et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Because ferrous and ferric iron absorb light differently, the ICAM can be exploited to monitor soluble iron oxidation spectrophotometrically as a continuous process. The experimental observations presented below were conducted to quantify the rates of iron oxidation by intact cells of <italic>M. sedula</italic>. In particular, we sought to distinguish between two hypotheses: that the respiratory proteins that are responsible for iron oxidation are expressed constitutively; or that they are induced when the cells are exposed to substrate-level concentrations of soluble iron. Organotrophic and mixotrophic growth on yeast extract in the absence and the presence, respectively, of 20 mM ferrous sulfate produced intact cells that had similar specific activities per intact cell for the rate of iron oxidation. In the process of enumerating and characterizing both populations of cells, we made the unexpected observation that cells cultured in the presence of soluble iron assumed one of two sizes that bracketed the one size assumed by cells cultured in the absence of soluble iron. To our knowledge, no one has reported behavior similar to this in any other iron-oxidizing microorganism, or for that matter, any other microorganism in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Cell culture</title><p><italic>M. sedula</italic> strain TH2, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) 5348<sup>T</sup>, was cultured mixotrophically on 20 mM ferrous sulfate plus 0.2% (wt/vol) yeast extract at 60&#x000b0;C. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 1.5 using sulfuric acid; the minimal salts concentrations were those recommended in the DSMZ media guide for the generic <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> medium, number 88. <italic>M. sedula</italic> was cultured heterotrophically in the same medium that omitted the ferrous sulfate. In either case, cells grown to late stationary phase were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.02 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and resuspended in sufficient 0.02 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to achieve a stock suspension of approximately 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> cells/mL. Each stock suspension was stored at 4&#x000b0;C for no longer than a week while electrical impedance, spectroscopic, or proteomic measurements were conducted on aliquots of the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Quantification and characterization of microorganisms</title><p>Absolute numbers of <italic>M. sedula</italic> cells were determined by electrical impedance measurements in a Multisizer 4 particle counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA) fitted with a 30-&#x003bc;m aperture (Blake and Griff, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Blake et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The instrument was programmed to siphon 50 &#x003bc;L of sample that contained Isoton II as the electrolyte. The current applied across the aperture was 600 &#x003bc;A. Voltage pulses attendant with impedance changes as particles passed through the aperture were monitored with an instrument gain of four. Determinations of particle diameters, surface areas, and volumes were accomplished with operating and analysis software provided by Beckman Coulter, Inc.</p><p>Relative numbers of <italic>M. sedula</italic> cells were determined by photon correlation scattering spectroscopy with a DelsaNano C particle size analyzer, also from Beckman Coulter, Inc. Cell densities were adjusted to ~1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL in 0.02 M sulfuric acid to give an attenuator obscuration of between 45 and 50%. Determination of the relative numbers of light scattering species as a function of particle diameter was accomplished by the time domain method with operating and analysis software provided by Beckman Coulter, Inc.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy was conducted on a model HT7700 Transmission Electron Microscope from Hitachi High-Tech America, Inc., Schaumburg, IL. Washed cells of <italic>M. sedula</italic> cultured mixotrophically were mixed with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then air-dried on a Formvar-coated copper grid for whole mounts.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 Initial velocity kinetic measurements</title><p>Initial velocity kinetic measurements on the rate of iron oxidation by intact <italic>M. sedula</italic> were obtained by conducting absorbance measurements on the time-dependent appearance of ferric ions using an OLIS-CLARiTY 1000A spectrophotometer (On Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA) that employed a novel integrating cavity absorption meter (Blake and Griff, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Blake et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In a typical measurement, identical 8.0- and 7.9-mL solutions that contained sulfuric acid (pH 1.5) were added to both the reference and the sample observation cavities, respectively, of the spectrophotometer. The sample cavity contained an additional 20 &#x003bc;L of a stock cell suspension of cells. After a stable baseline was recorded from 296 to 400 nm, 100 &#x003bc;L that contained soluble ferrous sulfate were added to the cell suspension to initiate subsequent oxidation reactions and absorbance changes within the cavity. These liquid handling operations were conducted manually. The single opening to the otherwise enclosed observation cavity was subsequently fitted with a white, refractive Teflon plug, and data acquisition was then initiated. These latter operations were routinely conducted in 0.5 s, which comprised the operational dead time for any oxidation to proceed before data were obtained.</p><p>Raw absorbance spectra, typically 6.2 spectra/s, were collected for appropriate time intervals. Raw absorbance values obtained in the CLARiTY spectrophotometer were converted to equivalent absorbance values/cm using Fry's method (Fry et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) with analysis software provided by OLIS, Inc. Global fits of absorbance changes as a function of both time and wavelength were accomplished by the singular value decomposition method (DeSa and Matheson, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) using analysis software also provided by OLIS, Inc.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Ribosomal RNA sequence analyses</title><p>Sequence analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA were conducted by the Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA. Cells of <italic>M. sedula</italic> that were cultured to stationary phase either heterotrophically or mixotrophically were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with distilled water to remove excess acid and soluble iron, and resuspended and frozen in sufficient distilled water to achieve samples comprised of 200 mg wet-weight cells in 1.8 mL. Briefly, Zymo Research then extracted the DNA from both samples, prepared the DNA for targeted sequencing using the Quick-16S<sup>TM</sup> Primer Set, and sequenced the resulting libraries using an Illumina NextSeq2000<sup>TM</sup> (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Subsequent bioinformatics analyses were conducted using the Dada2 pipeline (Callahan et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) that was supplemented with the sequence information for <italic>M. sedula</italic> DSMZ 5348<sup>T</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analyses</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were conducted by the Drug Discovery and Delivery Core facility at Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA.

These measurements were conducted using two methods, electrical impedance and static light scattering. The results from the two methods agreed that the coccoidal cells comprised a single population with an average diameter of 1.06 &#x003bc;m. It must be noted that each method has strengths and weaknesses. The strength of the electrical impedance measurement is that it supplies absolute numbers for the different cell sizes in the culture; the weakness is that the coccoidal archaea with spherical diameters &#x0003c;0.6 &#x003bc;m were underrepresented by the electrical impedance measurements, by which observations were limited to particles with effective diameters between 2 and 60% of the 30-&#x003bc;m aperture employed in the Multisizer. The strength of the static light diffraction measurements is that they are capable of resolving particles with effective diameters as small as 0.1 nm; the weakness is that the light diffraction method does not yield absolute numbers of cells, only relative numbers of cells in the entire population. However, the two types of measurements, when used in conjunction, serve to complement each other to provide a more complete characterization of the entire cell populations.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Quantification and characterization of intact <italic>M. sedula</italic> cultured heterotrophically on yeast extract <bold>(A)</bold> or mixotrophically on yeast extract plus 20 mM ferrous sulfate <bold>(B)</bold>.

Consequently, the desire was to accurately determine the absolute number of cells to calculate an accurate turnover number per cell in the intact cell-dependent catalytic activity assays. The <italic>inset</italic> in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> shows the standard curve that was developed to quantify the number of cells present in a stock suspension of washed cells that were derived from the heterotrophic culture of <italic>M. sedula</italic> on yeast extract. Different volumes of the stock suspension were removed and added to the electrolyte solution that was employed in the Multisizer. The numbers of the resulting cells that were present in a prescribed volume of the electrolyte-cell mixture were then plotted as a function of the volumes of the aliquots that were removed from the stock suspension. The number of cells in each aliquot was directly proportional to the volume of the aliquot that was withdrawn from the stock suspension. This standard curve provided the means to quantify the number of cells present in any aliquot taken from the stock suspension for use in subsequent kinetic measurements. It is evident from the data in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> that a small number of the total cells in the heterotrophic suspension were not counted due to the sensitivity limitation of the electrical impedance measurements. Fortunately, a close correspondence between the electrical impedance and the light diffraction curves was observed down to a diameter of 0.6 &#x003bc;m, indicating that the two instruments were monitoring the same population of particles. Consequently, the numbers of cells that were actually counted by the electrical impedance measurements were increased by 11% to account for the portion of the light diffraction measurements that fell below the limit of detection of the absolute counting method.</p><p><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> shows the size and quantitative measurements that were conducted on cells of <italic>M. sedula</italic> that were cultured mixotrophically on the same concentration of yeast extract amended with 20 mM ferrous sulfate. In this case, the resulting cells comprised two populations of coccoidal cells with different average diameters of 0.6 and 1.35 &#x003bc;m. Once again, a close correspondence between the electrical impedance and the light diffraction curves was observed down to a diameter of 0.6 &#x003bc;m, indicating that the two instruments were monitoring the same population of particles. The <italic>inset</italic> in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> shows the standard curve that was developed to quantify the numbers and types of cell sizes present in a stock suspension of washed cells that were derived from the mixotrophic culture of <italic>M. sedula</italic>. <italic>Curve c</italic> represents the standard curve for the total number of cells that were quantified in each aliquot. Because the mixotrophic population of cells consisted of two different sizes, a cell diameter of 0.95 &#x003bc;m was arbitrarily chosen as the dividing diameter between the two different cell sizes in the bifurcated mixture. <italic>Curves a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> in the <italic>inset</italic> of <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> thus represent the standard curves for the smaller (0.6 to 0.95 &#x003bc;m cell diameters) and the larger (0.95 to 3.0 &#x003bc;m cell diameters) cells, respectively, within the bifurcated mixture. Although the actual cell counts in the <italic>inset</italic> indicate that the larger cell cohort outnumbered the smaller cell cohort, it is evident that the two curves overlap to a considerable extent. It is also evident in the <italic>main panel</italic> that approximately half of the smaller diameter cells were not quantified by the electrical impedance method. The relative contributions of the two different cell sizes that are evident in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> to the overall number of cells in the bifurcated mixotrophic cultures were estimated by iterative nonlinear regression analyses of the electrical impedance and the light diffraction measurements (calculations not shown). The result of these calculations was that the small and large cell cohorts contributed ~48 and 52 percent, respectively, to the total cell numbers in the mixotrophic culture. That is, the mixotrophic culture consisted of approximately equal numbers of the two cell sizes.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis for the particles that comprise the small sized fraction in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> is that these smaller particles actually represent exosomes that are produced by <italic>M. sedula</italic> when soluble iron is added to the yeast extract medium. Exosomes, or extracellular vesicles, are membrane-bound particles of variable diameter that are excreted into the extracellular milieu by all three domains of life (Liu J. et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Liu L. J. et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). <italic>M. sedula</italic> does produce biogeochemically active archaeal membrane vesicles (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, energy deprivation was evaluated in <italic>M. sedula</italic> and found to stimulate vesicle synthesis, while energy excess repressed vesicle formation. Thus autotrophic culture on low energy-yielding ferrous sulfate supported vesicle synthesis, while the addition of an organic carbon and energy source (in their case, tryptone) prevented vesicle synthesis as indicated by microscopy and protein quantification. Furthermore, the mean diameter of the vesicles that were produced under autotrophic conditions on soluble iron was only 194 &#x000b1; 36 nm. The light diffraction measurements in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref> show no hint of a population of particles in our cultures that were smaller than a population with a mean diameter of 600 nm.

The 16S rRNA macromolecule is an important structural and functional component of both the bacterial and archaeal 30S ribosomal subunits.

Consequently, the kinetic data are consistent with the hypothesis that the ability to respire aerobically on soluble iron is expressed constitutively in <italic>M. sedula</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>4 Discussion</title><p>The original impetus for these studies was to distinguish between two hypotheses: that the respiratory proteins that are responsible for iron oxidation are expressed constitutively; or that the respiratory proteins that are responsible for iron oxidation are induced when the cells are exposed to substrate-level concentrations of soluble iron. The turnover numbers for respiratory iron oxidation that were determined for cells of <italic>M. sedula</italic> that were cultured in the presence or the absence of soluble reduced iron were within experimental error of each other, an observation that is consistent with the hypothesis that the respiratory proteins that are responsible for iron oxidation are expressed constitutively. Determination of these turnover numbers necessarily required that the intact cells that comprised the catalytic units in these studies had to be quantified with as much accuracy as was possible. The efforts to quantify the intact cells led to the unexpected observations regarding cell sizes that comprise the bulk of the studies presented herein.</p><p>Planktonic microorganisms that are cultured from a single clone exhibit a narrow range of sizes and volumes, ranging from smaller, newly-formed &#x0201c;daughter&#x0201d; cells to larger cells that are ready to divide into two daughter cells. This range is typically represented by a log-normal distribution when the cell numbers are plotted as a function of the computed diameter of the cell. That is the behavior that we observed when <italic>M. sedula</italic> was cultured heterotrophically on yeast extract (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). It is generally reported that populations of certain microorganisms can adopt different sizes (Taheri-Araghi et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Westfall and Levin, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and even shapes (Young, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) when they are cultured on different substrates. The average volume of individual cells within a clonal population generally increases in those cells that are exposed to richer nutrients in the environment or decreases if the cells are exposed to fewer nutrients (Harris and Theriot, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Taheri-Araghi et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Westfall and Levin, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, that generality applies to the entire population of cells, not to a subset of the population. When <italic>M. sedula</italic> was cultured mixotrophically on yeast extract plus 20 mM ferrous ions, which represents a richer nutritional environment than just yeast extract alone, a reasonable hypothesis was that the average volume of the <italic>M. sedula</italic> cells might increase somewhat. Instead, the population of cells bifurcated into two sizes, one larger and one smaller than that obtained when the cells were cultured on yeast extract in the absence of soluble iron (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). There is little, if any, precedent in the microbiological literature for this surprising observation.</p><p>One hypothesis that might account for the two cell sizes that appear when <italic>M. sedula</italic> is cultured under a particular set of solution conditions is that the culture of <italic>M. sedula</italic> is actually contaminated with one or more other microorganisms. Over forty years ago, several laboratories reported that selected cultures of mesophilic, iron-oxidizing, acidophilic eubacteria, known collectively as &#x0201c;<italic>Thiobacillus</italic>&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;<italic>Ferrobacillus</italic>&#x0201d; <italic>ferrooxidans</italic>, could be cultured in successive media that alternated between strictly autotrophic soluble ferrous ions and strictly heterotrophic glucose or some related organic substrate (Shafia et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Tabita and Lundgren, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Tuovinen and Nicholas, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). In each case, the origins of these growth characteristics were traced to the presence of acidophilic, heterotrophic microorganisms that contaminated the autotrophic iron-oxidizing cultures (Harrison et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Johnson and Kelso, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Lobos et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). It was postulated that the heterotrophic contaminant could survive on a sparce diet of organic materials that either &#x0201c;leaked&#x0201d; from or were transported out of the chemolithotroph that was fixing carbon dioxide into cellular material. So is that sort of scenario an explanation for the unexpected culture behavior reported herein? Was the culture of <italic>M. sedula</italic> in our laboratory contaminated with a slightly smaller thermoacidophilic, coccoidal microorganism whose numbers increased to rival those of the <italic>M. sedula</italic> under certain culture conditions? That hypothesis was not consistent with the 16S rRNA sequencing studies summarized above.</p><p>Once we accept the premise that clonal <italic>M. sedula</italic> does indeed bifurcate into roughly equal numbers of two cell sizes when soluble ferrous ions are added to complex organic nutrients in the external medium, then the next question becomes, &#x0201c;Why?&#x0201d; Any rationalization for this unexpected behavior is more speculative at this point than hypothesis-driven. The appearance and existence of a large cell size cohort in a culture medium that was amended with additional nutrients (soluble ferrous ions, in this case) is entirely consistent with published observations conducted on numerous other microorganisms in numerous different culture media. The appearance and existence of a small cell size cohort under the same conditions is not. Where would <italic>M. sedula</italic> encounter high concentrations of soluble reduced iron in its natural habitat? Probably in the close proximity of iron-bearing reduced metal-sulfide minerals such as pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, <italic>etc</italic>. Would there be a selective advantage to becoming smaller in the presence of electron-rich solid minerals that could serve as a source of electrons to support aerobic respiration? Perhaps. Unpolished minerals rarely present smooth surfaces at their interfaces with liquid media. Rather, minerals in the rough present irregular surfaces that contain numerous small crevices, cracks, invaginations, and so on. A smaller coccoidal microorganism would enjoy greater access to a larger percentage of the irregular surface area of the uneven mineral than would a larger coccoidal microorganism. The greater the physical contact between the surface of the microorganism and the surface of the rough, semi-conducting mineral solid, the greater is the opportunity for direct electron transfer from one entity to the other. Alternatively, if all of the mineral oxidation occurs <italic>via</italic> an indirect mechanism where the soluble iron serves as the mobile agent to conduct electrons from the surface of the mineral to the plasma membrane of the <italic>M. sedula</italic>, then maximizing the microorganism's proximity to the uneven mineral surface by becoming smaller is still a selective advantage because fewer soluble ferrous ions have the opportunity to diffuse away from the nearby microorganism and be &#x0201c;lost.&#x0201d; So why would only a portion of the entire population of planktonic cells transform into a smaller size when the entire population encountered high levels of soluble iron in the medium?</p><p>The advent over the last 20 years of methods for quantifying gene expression in individual microbial cells has revealed that populations of genetically identical cells derived from a single clone nonetheless exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity where certain genes are expressed in a non-uniform manner within the population (Ackermann, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Lidstrom and Konopka, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Martins and Locke, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Roberfroid et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Consequently, if extracellular environmental conditions change abruptly and unpredictably, at least a small portion of the isogenic population is already pre-adapted and poised to cope with some aspect of the ever-fluctuating environment. On the one hand, this phenotypic heterogeneity may put some or many cells at a disadvantage because they have expressed proteins and capabilities that remain unused and are thus a waste of precious resources at that moment. On the other hand, this practice also means that at least a small portion of the population of cells are in a better position to respond rapidly to the changing conditions and thereby perpetuate the species. &#x0201c;Bistability&#x0201d; is a term that has been used to represent this phenomenon of the bifurcation of an isogenic population of cells into distinct subpopulations (Dubnau and Losick, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that the bifurcation of <italic>M. sedula</italic> into two cell sizes is an example of phenotypic heterogeneity that is triggered by exposure of the cells to higher concentrations of soluble ferrous ions. If higher concentrations of soluble iron are indeed harbingers of impending proximity to a rich source of electrons derived from semi-conducting, iron-bearing mineral sulfides with uneven surfaces, then that prospect represents a selective advantage to promote the adaptation of the cells to a smaller size. Interestingly, we have observed that <italic>Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans</italic>, a Gram-negative, moderately thermophilic eubacterium, also appears to exist in two different sizes when it is cultured mixotrophically on yeast extract and soluble iron (unpublished data). We hypothesize that populations of other iron-oxidizing microorganisms that can grow both mixotrophically and heterotrophically may also exhibit analogous size differences when they are cultured on organic media in the absence and presence of soluble iron. Perhaps such size differences exist in many iron-oxidizing acidophiles, but they have heretofore escaped notice because researchers have not specifically looked for them. It will be interesting to see whether other examples of this unexpected behavior appear in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Abbreviations</title><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>ICAM, integrating cavity absorption meter; DSMZ, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen; PNNL, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; SEM, scanning electron microscopy; EDS, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p>
