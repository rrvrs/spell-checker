During this process, the sympathetic nervous system releases large amounts of catecholamines, which bind to &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors (&#x003b2;-AR) on cell membranes, negatively affecting skin regeneration. Additionally, recurrent bacterial infections make burn wounds difficult to treat, posing significant and ongoing challenges to burn care. To address these challenges, we pioneered the study of locally delivered propranolol for burn wound treatment, revealing its ability to antagonize norepinephrine (NE) and regulate the sympathetic nervous system. In this study, a Cu<sup>2</sup>&#x0207a;-loaded anti-sympathetic hydrogel (copper ion cross-linked propranolol@gelatin/alginate, PNL@GA-Cu) was developed to remodel the challenging neuromodulatory microenvironment and accelerate the repair of the infected burn wound. The hydrogel system releases Cu<sup>2</sup>&#x0207a; and propranolol simultaneously during degradation, synergistically acting on local wound tissue. Cu<sup>2</sup>&#x0207a; exhibits dual effects of antibacterial activity and promoting angiogenesis, effectively killing <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> while enhancing the expression of angiogenesis-related genes (CD31, VEGF). Meanwhile, propranolol can counteract the inhibitory effects of NE simulated chronic stress microenvironment on angiogenesis and mitigate sympathetic nerve innervation during the early stages of wound healing. Finally, the PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel significantly promoted the repair of third-degree full-thickness burns in SD rats. Approaches targeting the neural microenvironment for burn wound treatment has not been previously addressed in the literature. The anti-sympathetic PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel offers a promising strategy for treating infected burn wounds. Remodeling the neuromodulatory microenvironment could be an emerging strategy in tissue engineering.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>Schematic diagram of the process of copper-loaded anti-sympathetic hydrogel (PNL@GA-Cu) promoting the healing of infected burn wounds.<fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Copper ion cross-linked hydrogels exhibit enhanced stability, porosity and mechanical strength.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Propranolol regulates sympathetic nerve activity by affecting tyrosine hydroxylase expression and migration of PC12&#x000a0;cells.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Propranolol released from PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel can reverse the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on angiogenesis.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Cu<sup>2+</sup> released from PNL@GA-Cu hydrogels exhibit dual effects of promoting angiogenesis and antibacterial effects.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel significantly promoted the repair of third-degree full-thickness burns in SD rats.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Burn wound healing</kwd><kwd>Hydrogel</kwd><kwd>Angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>Propranolol</kwd><kwd>Sympathetic nerves</kwd><kwd>Infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0040">Burn injury, typically caused by exposure to flames, hot liquids, hot gases, chemicals, or electricity, is the fourth most common traumatic injury worldwide, affecting 11 million people annually, with 180,000 cases being fatal [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Skin grafting remains the gold standard for treating severe burn wounds in clinics to lower mortality rates and shorten hospital stays [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, challenges such as donor skin scarcity, graft fragility, rough texture, and increased scar contractures restrict the practical application of autologous skin grafting [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, severe burns are difficult to manage due to recurrent bacterial infections and metabolic alterations, leading to hypertrophic scarring, ulceration, and potentially necessitating amputation, posing a significant ongoing challenge in burn care [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These factors make the treatment process for burn patients complex and prolonged. Compared to other types of wounds such as diabetic ulcers, burns exhibit a unique hypermetabolic response which is closely associated with increased catabolism, organ failure, heightened infection risks, and even elevated mortality rates.</p><p id="p0045">Unlike sepsis or trauma, severe burns elicit an immediate systemic and local stress response that does not quickly subside and can persist for several years. Recent studies have shown that soft tissue damage triggers the release of large amounts of catecholamine hormones from sympathetic nerves. These hormones bind to &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors (&#x003b2;-ARs) on cell membranes, adversely affecting skin regeneration [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Nearly fifty years ago, Wilmore et al. ingeniously demonstrated that catecholamines mediate the hypermetabolic response following thermal injury [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. &#x003b2;-blockers, particularly propranolol (PNL), specifically inhibit the activation of &#x003b2;-AR in both acute and chronic skin injuries. This leads to reduced inflammation duration, accelerated keratinocyte migration, enhanced wound contraction and angiogenesis, and inhibition of bacterial virulence, thereby promoting soft tissue wound healing [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, &#x003b2;-blockers have been shown to expedite wound healing in patients with severe thermal injuries by mitigating the hypermetabolic response [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, as a common arrhythmia drug, long-term use may cause adverse reactions in the cardiovascular system. Meanwhile, achieving effective drug concentrations in the wound area can be challenging due to drug metabolism and clearance following systemic administration [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Considering these limitations, localized delivery of propranolol may prove to be more effective for treating burn wounds.</p><p id="p0050">Hydrogels are vital for dermal and epidermal regeneration, as they are capable of donating or absorbing water based on wound needs. Since their debut as wound dressings in 1977, hydrogels have advanced from single-component materials to complex formulations with nanoparticles, peptides, and growth factors [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. Gelatin and alginate have been examined for wound healing, with gelatin enhancing inflammation and healing through macrophage modulation and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences, while sodium alginate supports autolytic debridement [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, burn wounds are particularly susceptible to invasive infections from microorganisms before full epithelial regeneration. Serious infections can give rise to life-threatening complications such as sepsis, underscoring the necessity for immediate antimicrobial intervention [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite the recent development of various types of wound dressings for burns that significantly promote healing, the majority lack strong antibacterial properties to prevent infection in burn wounds and are ineffective against already infected wounds [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>]. From the late 1990s onwards, studies have highlighted the crucial involvement of metal ions like magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), and copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) in tissue regeneration and remodeling processes [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Copper ions, in particular, have garnered considerable interest for their dual roles in skin regeneration and antibacterial activity. As a vital trace element, copper serves multiple physiological functions in human health including angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and matrix remodeling, which are crucial across various wound healing stages [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, copper ions can destroy bacteria by disrupting their central metabolic and biosynthetic processes, exhibiting lower toxicity than silver, and are more viable for clinical use due to their abundance, availability, and cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p id="p0055">In this study, we synthesized a multifunctional hydrogel by combining gelatin with alginate and incorporating the &#x003b2;-blocker propranolol. Copper ions, used as cross-linking agents in the hydrogel, provided sustained antimicrobial effects. This injectable anti-sympathetic hydrogel could reverse the negative effects of norepinephrine (NE) on human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). We also investigated the impact of the hydrogel on PC12&#x000a0;cells simulating the sympathetic nervous system in vitro. In animal experiments, the hydrogel not only exhibited antibacterial properties and promoted angiogenesis but also delayed the early innervation of the sympathetic nerves, successfully treating third-degree burns in SD rats.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Preparation of PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel</title><p id="p0060">At a constant temperature of 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 6&#x000a0;g of gelatin (NeoFroxx, 1042GR100, Type B from Bovine Skin, Einhausen, Germany) and 2&#x000a0;g of sodium alginate (MW&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;198, Solarbio, A9640, Beijing, China) were dissolved in 100&#x000a0;mL of deionized water with stirring 2&#x000a0;h to form a composite solution.

We utilized PC12&#x000a0;cells to study the effects of the hydrogel on sympathetic nerve migration and activity in vitro. The effects of the hydrogels on PC12&#x000a0;cell migration were evaluated using scratch assays and transwell assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). The wound scratch assay revealed that the wound healing rate in the PNL@GA-Cu group (25.40&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.71&#x000a0;%) was significantly slower compared to the control group (40.80&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.60&#x000a0;%), as well as the GA-Ca group (39.97&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.01&#x000a0;%) and the GA-Cu group (39.53&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.07&#x000a0;%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A&#x02013;C). In addition, we also stained the cells with calcein-AM at the beginning of scratching and after migration. We found that PC12&#x000a0;cells on both sides of the scratch not only migrated and exhibited axonal growth after 24&#x000a0;h but also showed proliferative activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). The transwell assay was further used to verify the effect of the hydrogel on cell migration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B&#x02013;D). The findings indicated that the quantity of migrating PC12&#x000a0;cells was notably reduced in the PNL@GA-Cu group compared to the other groups, likely attributable to the release of propranolol. Additionally, PC12&#x000a0;cells were exposed to the hydrogel extracts, followed by live/dead cell staining and CCK8 assays, which indicated that the viability of PC12&#x000a0;cells treated with the samples from each group was comparable (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figs.

Above all, these results indicate that the regulation of sympathetic nerves by hydrogel is mainly through cell migration rather than inhibition of proliferation.</p><p id="p0210">The effects of the sympathetic nerves on their target tissues are mainly mediated by the neurotransmitters they secrete, particularly NE. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the key enzyme in catecholamine synthesis within sympathetic nerves, plays a crucial role in regulating neurotransmitter secretion by these cells [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To investigate TH expression, we employed immunofluorescence staining and ELISA assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E&#x02013;G). Our results indicated that the control group exhibited the lowest relative TH expression. Potassium ion stimulation significantly enhanced TH expression, aligning with previous studies [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Notably, the addition of PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel resulted in a marked downregulation of TH expression. Furthermore, we used FITC-labelled norepinephrine (FITC-NE) to study the effect of the anti-sympathetic hydrogel on target tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F&#x02013;H). Our results showed that in the control group, GA-Ca group, and GA-Cu group, there was strong green fluorescence on the cell membranes of HUVECs, indicating that NE can tightly bind to receptors on the cell membrane (red). However, in the PNL@GA-Cu group, the binding of NE (green) on the cell membrane was significantly reduced. This suggests that propranolol released from the hydrogel can effectively compete with NE in the microenvironment, providing a catecholamine protective effect on target cells such as HUVECs.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><label>3.5</label><title>Anti-sympathetic hydrogel promotes angiogenesis in vitro</title><p id="p0215">The recruitment of endothelial cells is vital for the formation of new blood vessels during skin repair, essential for restoring nutrient transport [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A, the cell scratching assay demonstrated that cell migration was significantly inhibited by NE.

The migratory ability was further analyzed based on the relative wound closure rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C).

Among the cells treated with NE, the release of propranolol in PNL@GA-Cu effectively counteracted the inhibitory effect of sympathetic nerve on the migration of HUVECs, resulting in a significantly higher migration ratio (56.75&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.35&#x000a0;%) compared to the GA-Cu (45.93&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.52&#x000a0;%), GA-Ca (29.68&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.17&#x000a0;%) and control (27.13&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.55&#x000a0;%) groups.

Further quantitative analysis using ImageJ software measured the total segmental length and the number of junctions after 6&#x000a0;h of incubation on Matrigel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>F and G). There was no significant difference between the control group and the GA-Ca group in any of the indicators.

Similarly, Western blotting detection for angiogenic proteins such as VEGF and CD31 showed a similar trend to that of the tube formation assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>H). Moreover, we assessed the CD31 expression levels in HUVECs following various treatments using immunofluorescence staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>I). In the presence of NE, which simulates chronic sympathetic excitation, the expression of CD31 in HUVECs treated with GA-Cu and PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel was elevated, accompanied by stronger fluorescence intensity. Especially in the absence of NE, HUVECs treated with PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel showed the strongest CD31 expression. These results show that propranolol and copper ions released by scaffolds can promote cell migration and the formation of tubular networks under chronic stress-induced sympathetic excitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>Anti-sympathetic hydrogel promotes infected burn wound healing</title><p id="p0225">Burn wounds can be categorized as first-degree, second-degree superficial partial-thickness, second-degree deep partial-thickness, third-degree full-thickness, or fourth-degree full-thickness burns [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A first-degree burn affects only the epidermis and does not cause blistering. Superficial second-degree burns affect the papillary dermis, while deep partial-thickness burns extend into the reticular dermis. Both types typically manifest with blister formation occurring either immediately or within hours after injury [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In deep partial-thickness burns, unlike superficial second-degree burns, both blood vessels and nerve endings are damaged. Similarly, third-degree burns extend through the dermis and subdermal tissues, destroying blood vessels and nerve endings as well. Fourth-degree burns penetrate all skin layers and affect underlying muscles [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, to confirm third-degree full-thickness burns, SD rats were sacrificed at 30&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h post-injury, followed by histological analysis of the burned tissue to assess burn depth (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S7</xref>). The findings indicate that the morphological characteristics observed at both 30&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h post-injury are consistent, affirming the comprehensive impact of the burn on all three skin layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Destruction of all epidermal layers was evident. Furthermore, the dermis, encompassing both the papillary and reticular layers along with their vasculature, nerve endings, and collagen matrix, was entirely compromised. The hypodermis exhibited damaged adipocytes lacking nuclei, confirming the full-thickness nature of the burn injury. However, the underlying muscles, typically affected in fourth-degree burns, remained intact and showed no microscopic alterations.</p><p id="p0230">We evaluated the wound healing process by measuring the wound size and calculating the healing rate.

Pathological changes resulting from &#x003b2;-AR activation can disrupt the wound-healing process.

In this study, we developed copper cross-linked gelatin-alginate hydrogels loaded with propranolol. This innovative scaffold demonstrated excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility in both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in vitro kinetic release assays revealed that the scaffold provided a sustained release of copper ions and propranolol for at least 14 days, suggesting that drug release could be maintained throughout the entire burn wound healing process.</p><p id="p0260">Through the sustained release of copper ions and propranolol, the hydrogel eliminated most bacteria in the wound. Delayed wound healing is closely linked to persistent bacterial colonization and its harmful effects. Chronic wounds provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth, leading to complications such as infection and these bacteria form biofilms to evade host immune defenses [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although antibiotics can be embedded in wound dressings to combat bacteria, their excessive use can lead to a significant increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Biomaterials modified with copper ions present a novel infection prevention strategy, recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an antimicrobial metal in 2008 [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Silicene nanosheets loaded with copper-containing nanoparticles demonstrate triple enzyme mimicry activities and a photothermal effect, aiding in the healing of bacteria-infected wounds [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The literature thoroughly documents the bactericidal mechanisms of copper, typically divided into three main stages: initially, copper ions are released, compromising the bacterial outer cell membrane and causing cytoplasmic leakage; subsequently, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, inflicting additional bacterial damage; and finally, DNA rupture occurs, leading to bacterial death [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Additionally, the bacterial Quorum Sensing (QS) system detects adrenergic signals from the host's physiological state, prompting bacteria to increase motility, alter gene expression, and form biofilms, thereby enhancing their virulence [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Further research has found that activation of &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptors (&#x003b2;2-AR) inhibits endothelial cell mobilization, proliferation, and tube formation [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Additionally, recent studies have indicated that copper ions not only possess antimicrobial properties but also have a positive effect on angiogenesis by upregulating angiogenic genes such as VEGF and bFGF in both in vitro and in vivo settings [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Similarly, our results indicate that the sustained release of propranolol from the hydrogel can counteract the inhibition of angiogenesis by NE and synergize with copper ions, positively impacting early vascular regeneration in burn wounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies showing that local delivery of propranolol helps maintain tissue homeostasis and enhances local angiogenic activity [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p id="p0270">Compared to the other groups, the scaffold containing propranolol delayed early sympathetic innervation. PC12 cells, derived from the adrenal medulla of rats and able to exhibit an adrenergic phenotype following specific differentiation protocol as well as synthesize and store catecholamines, are often used to simulate sympathetic neurons [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In vitro experimental results showed that propranolol released from the hydrogel effectively reduced the migration rate of PC12&#x000a0;cells within 24&#x000a0;h without causing significant proliferation inhibition or cytotoxicity. Moreover, Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the key enzyme in catecholamine neurotransmitter synthesis, and its activity is controlled by various mechanisms crucial for normal physiological functions [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Jia et al. found that Epinephrine elevated the expression of TH in PC12&#x000a0;cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, an effect that was blocked by propranolol but not by phenoxybenzamine [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Long-term injection of propranolol was also found to reduce tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase activities in sympathetic ganglia [<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These results align with our study, which demonstrates that high potassium levels enhance tyrosine hydroxylase expression, while propranolol released from hydrogel scaffolds significantly inhibits potassium-induced TH upregulation, which may reduce NE secretion by PC12&#x000a0;cells [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, the sympathetic nerves activity in newly formed wound tissues in vivo mirrored the in vitro experiments, with propranolol reducing TH expression in local tissues on days 7 and 14. This is consistent with previous findings. Wu et al. found that the local release of propranolol via implanted 3D-printed scaffolds significantly delayed the ingrowth of TH&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;sympathetic nerves into the new bone defect areas over 4 weeks, with this effect becoming more pronounced with increased propranolol loading in the scaffolds [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We speculate that local &#x003b2;-receptor blockade may affect the production of chemotactic signals, such as semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), and inhibit the positive feedback effect of NE secreted by sympathetic nerves on the nerves themselves, thereby reducing sympathetic innervation and function [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p id="p0275">However, this study has certain limitations. In vitro experiments suggest that propranolol scaffolds promote vascular formation during wound healing by competing with norepinephrine, indicating the need to investigate the role of exogenous norepinephrine in wound repair processes in vivo. Furthermore, quantifying the density of &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors and catecholamine levels in the defect zone is essential for understanding the impact of propranolol on the sympathetic system within the scaffolds. Additionally, since the dual effects of propranolol in sympathetic nerve blockade and immune modulation, further research is needed to elucidate the changes occurring in the immune system within tissues treated with propranolol. Finally, given that sympathetic nerve innervation varies among different tissue types and species, additional research in diverse tissues and larger animal models is necessary to corroborate our findings.</p><p id="p0280">In conclusion, this study demonstrates that local adrenergic &#x003b2;-receptor blockade, rather than systemic administration, can effectively enhance burn wound treatment. We anticipate that scaffolds with agents inhibiting sympathetic activation will hold significant promise for tissue engineering applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0285">In summary, we have successfully developed a novel anti-sympathetic PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel to address the sustained stress induced by burns. This hydrogel boasts multifunctional properties, including injectability and antibacterial activity. The gradual release of copper ions throughout the healing process effectively eliminates infections caused by <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. When subjected to NE-mimicking sympathetic nervous system activation, the PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel significantly enhances HUVEC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the sustained release of propranolol in the PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel inhibits PC12&#x000a0;cell migration and tyrosine hydroxylase expression, while also counteracting NE binding to target cells. Additional in vivo studies confirm that the PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel promotes the formation of new blood vessels in treated wounds while delaying the innervation of new sympathetic nerves. Importantly, compared to the Control, GA-Ca, and GA-Cu groups, the newly formed skin treated with PNL@GA-Cu hydrogel exhibits a greater number of skin appendages, rendering it a promising therapeutic approach for healing infected burned wounds.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0290"><bold>Wenzhe Sun:</bold> Writing &#x02013; original draft, Investigation, Formal analysis. <bold>Hongwei Lu:</bold> Methodology, Formal analysis. <bold>Pengqin Zhang:</bold> Investigation. <bold>Lian Zeng:</bold> Investigation. <bold>Bing Ye:</bold> Project administration. <bold>Yi Xu:</bold> Conceptualization. <bold>Jianan Chen:</bold> Conceptualization. <bold>Peiran Xue:</bold> Conceptualization. <bold>Jialin Yu:</bold> Conceptualization. <bold>Kaifang Chen:</bold> Supervision, Funding acquisition. <bold>Bin Wu:</bold> Funding acquisition, Conceptualization. <bold>Xiao Lv:</bold> Supervision, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization. <bold>Xiaodong Guo:</bold> Supervision, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization. <bold>Yanzhen Qu:</bold> Supervision, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Permission to reproduce material from other sources</title><p id="p0295">Figures were all created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BioRender.com" id="intref0015">BioRender.com</ext-link>, and publication licenses were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process</title><p id="p0300">AI was not used during the preparation of this work.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Funding sources</title><p id="p0305">This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs3"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (Grant No. <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs3">82102546</award-id>, <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs3">82102627</award-id>, <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs3">82202715</award-id>, <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs3">82072446</award-id>, <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs3">82272460</award-id>) and the <funding-source id="gs4"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100003819</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (<award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs4">2021CFB277</award-id>, <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs4">2021CFB596</award-id>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0310">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Yanzhen Qu reports financial support was provided by <funding-source id="gs6"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>.
