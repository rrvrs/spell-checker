Within a single month, the disease reached other countries, spreading in a rapid and generalized manner worldwide to cause the COVID-19 pandemic. In Brazil, the number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 38 million. This study was conducted to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and investigate the immunogenic potential of synthetic peptides containing partial sequences of the main proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins). In addition, we evaluated the ability of the antibodies to impair the interaction between the spike S1 protein and human ACE-2 protein, which is the main route of entry of the virus into host cells. By immunizing horses with synthetic peptides, we obtained hyperimmune sera with specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which were fragmented to release the F(ab&#x02019;)2 portion that binds to the different SARS-CoV-2 proteins as a recombinant S1-protein and proteins from a viral lysate. The other F(ab&#x02019;)2 samples also impaired the interaction between S1 protein and ACE-2 proteins, showing high potential to prevent viral spreading.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>immunization</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>F(ab&#x02019;)2</kwd><kwd>viral neutralizing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Brazilian agency Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES)</funding-source><award-id>001</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais</funding-source><award-id>FAPEMIG&#x02014;APQ-00251-21</award-id><award-id>BIP-00058-24</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>We thank the Brazilian agency Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES) for the scholarship (L.C.d.S.L.)&#x02014;Finance Code 001 and Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG&#x02014;APQ-00251-21; BIP-00058-24).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-00165"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by coronaviruses (CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2, which was responsible for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses were first detected in 1937 and later described in 1965; however, SARS-CoV-2, first identified in December 2019 in China, is highly infectious and has created challenges for health professionals. The response to SARS-CoV-2 infection varies broadly, ranging from asymptomatic or mild cold-like reactions to severe and potentially deadly pneumonia [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Transmission occurs through the respiratory tract via secretions resulting from coughing, sneezing, and/or a runny nose [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Aerial transmission, along with its rapid multiplication, has resulted in a rapid spread of the virus, whose reproduction number (R0) is approximately 2.4 but can vary according to the population analyzed [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a result, COVID-19 caused infections worldwide, leading the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 an international emergency on 30 January 2020, only one month after the first recorded case.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA-positive virus belonging to the &#x003b2;-coronavirus group [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with a 30 kb genome, which is much larger than those of other common RNA viruses. This endows the virus with genomic stability and prevents the introduction of catastrophic mutations. This genetic structure gives the virus a &#x0201c;self-correction&#x0201d; capacity via its exoribonuclease activity, ensuring replication of the viral genome and the ability to correct errors occurring during transcription [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The virus produces approximately 29 described proteins, the most relevant of which are the structural glycoprotein spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). The virus has tropism to epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, with the trimeric spike protein as the main factor involved in virus invasion into host cells through its interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and subsequent entry through endosomes or fusion to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other less important mechanisms of host cell invasion include binding of the viral E protein to porphyrins, allowing it to cross the cell membrane. This variability in cell invasion may be associated with its high infection rate [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has two main substructures: a receptor-binding subunit (S1) and a fusion subunit (S2). The S1 fragment includes a receptor-binding domain (RBD), the binding site for the human ACE-2 protein [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In its pre-fusion conformation, the S1 subunit has four domains: an N-terminal domain, an RBD, and two carboxy-terminal domains. These domains surround the S2 subunit, forming a central helical bundle with the heptad repeat 1 domain of the S2 fragment projected towards the membrane [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The binding of S protein to ACE-2, mediated by the RBD, triggers a conformational change in the spike trimer. This alters the RBD structure, priming the S2 subunit for subsequent conformational transitions and release of the fusion machinery, ultimately leading to cell invasion [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Given the critical need to identify neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2, we explored the potential of antibodies to impair the binding of S protein to ACE-2. To achieve high yields, antibodies were generated in horses. This study, as part of a larger research effort, was performed to evaluate the ability of specific regions of key SARS-CoV-2 proteins to stimulate the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies capable of recognizing these viral proteins and impairing their spread.</p><p>Equine sera raised against different antigens were combined to enhance efficacy to enable further therapeutic applications, including rapid detection of viral proteins. F(ab&#x02019;)2 fragments from these antibodies were assayed for their specificity and ability to inhibit the interaction between S-protein and the ACE2 receptor. Our preliminary results show a potential for therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00165"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-17-00165"><title>2.1. Peptides Selection</title><p>Amino acid (aa) sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were retrieved from the GISAID database (Munich, Germany) [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were selected for immunogenic peptide selection. Protein sequences from all available strains were aligned using the Clustal Omega 1.2.4 tool (Hinxton, UK) [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For initial peptide selection, alignments were inspected to prioritize regions with a low variation frequency. The identified regions were analyzed using the BebiPred 2.0 tool (Lyngby, Denmark) [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and peptides of interest, containing 10&#x02013;12 aa, were identified based on their high immunogenicity (Epitope Threshold so that there are 6+ positive residues in BebiPred 2.0).</p><p>In the second peptide selection step, sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were evaluated using the AbDesigner algorithm (Bethesda, MD, USA) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Regions of interest were evaluated based on the Ig-score, uniqueness, and conservation for selecting the peptide sequences with 10&#x02013;12 aa. For peptides without a cysteine (Cys) residue in their N-terminal region, a Cys was added to allow conjugation to the carrier protein. All selected peptides were characterized for specificity against SARS virus sequences (number of residues different from the SARS homologous protein) and specificity (number of different residues vs. proteins from other organisms). Peptides were synthesized by Aminotech Research and Development (Sorocaba, Brazil).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-17-00165"><title>2.2. Antigen Preparation</title><p>The sulfhydryl group of Cys present in the peptides was coupled to activated bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Adrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) obtained through the cross-linker maleimide NHS ester (SMCC) (Sigma-Adrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Activated BSA was obtained by adding 0.1 mL of SMCC dimethylformamide (Sigma-Adrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (4.8 mg/mL) to 1 mL BSA in ultrapure water (Merck Milli-Q, Darmstadt, Germany (10 mg/mL), followed by mild magnetic stirring for 1 h at room temperature (RT) under protection from light. A PD10 desalting column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) was used to separate activated and non-activated BSA. Sequential fractions were collected, and those corresponding to the absorbance peak at 280 nm (reference to BSA-SMCC) were used for subsequent experiments.

Discussion</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 remains an important public health issue deserving attention and continuous research, as it can be considered a model for avoiding or eliminating a new viral pandemic more quickly. Several investigations have been performed to understand viral cell infection mechanisms, demonstrating how to impair viral-cell recognition and overcome infection progress [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Passive immunization can help control viral spread in patients who cannot mount an effective immune response, such as patients who are immunocompromised [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, equine sera have been used in models of immunization against different diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, as well as in studies of antivenom therapies [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, equine-neutralizing antibodies may be cost-effective, scalable, and flexible tools that can complement existing COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Their broad applicability, ease of production, and easy updates make them particularly relevant for pandemic preparedness and response, particularly in underserved regions. Indeed, F(ab&#x02019;)2 has already been tested against other viral infections in animal models, confirming its ability to inhibit viral cell invasion [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, passive immunization is a good alternative for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>In this study, horses were immunized with synthetic peptides designed on conserved protein regions among SARS-CoV-2 variants, demonstrating high levels of antibodies able to react against a recombinant Spike S1 protein and SARS-CoV-2 proteins from which they were derived, as well as their ability to impair binding between the S1 protein and ACE-2 receptor, showing a potential neutralizing effect. Peptide-based vaccines have also been explored for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential, demonstrating their ability to stimulate long-lasting immunogenic effects in mice with high antibody production and T-cell responses [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], horses were immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, resulting in a larger number of neutralizing antibodies, as demonstrated by the ability of F(ab&#x02019;)2 to neutralize viral spread in Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the antibodies neutralized three variants of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, suggesting the efficiency of equine antibodies in cases of COVID-19 infection where patients already have antibodies against the disease, which could enhance therapeutic effects.</p><p>Other investigations have also been conducted using inactivated viruses or entire viral proteins as immunizing agents [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We used short peptides rather than proteins or inactivated viral particles to decrease side effects, considering that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can cross-react with tissue antigens [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as some molecular mimicry between human and viral proteins were reported and are associated with multi-organ injuries [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, the use of selected peptides is an attractive alternative, because it is possible to direct the production of specific antibodies, thereby reducing the risk of undesirable reactions. The sequences of the peptides used in this study did not have any homology with human proteins; thus, they are not expected to cross-react with human proteins.</p><p>Hyperimmune equine plasma has been used as an alternative to convalescent plasma; however, foreign antibodies can stimulate other adverse reactions. Additionally, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) requires further analysis, as it can promote undesirable infection intensification by creating other routes for host-cell invasion. Fc-receptor-dependent ADE results from the presence of cellular Fc receptors that allow the virus to bind to non-neutralizing antibodies and enter cells expressing these receptors [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. ADE has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infections [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and is a major concern in the development of antibody-based therapies.</p><p>An alternative to overcome Fc-receptor-dependent ADE is the fragmentation of antibodies by removing the Fc region to release only the antigen-binding region, F(ab&#x02019;)2. Therefore, we performed enzymatic digestion of the Fc region, using pepsin, which cleaves the Fc portion to remove small peptides from the desirable F(ab&#x02019;)2. Our assays demonstrated that F(ab&#x02019;)2 retained the ability to recognize all antigens, including S1-protein and proteins from the viral lysate. Additionally, these F(ab&#x02019;)2 antibodies impaired the interaction of Spike S1 with human ACE-2, the main route of viral infection, which was very promising. Although this model used is limited and requires further assays to confirm viral neutralization capacity, this blocking ELISA assay offered a good option for preliminary investigation.</p><p>The S1 subunit of Spike protein is most important for viral infection because this region contains the RBD, which is fundamental for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the human protein ACE-2 [<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 shows important changes in the aa residues of its RBD region compared to those of SARS-CoV, enabling its stronger interaction with ACE-2. Thus, the RBD-ACE-2 complex is formed because of its high binding affinity [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; disrupting this interaction may be an important approach to avoiding infections. In this regard, molecules capable of impairing this interaction are good candidates as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, as our synthetic peptide antigens were focused on the Spike S1 region, with peptides containing specific sequences from RBD sites (<xref rid="viruses-17-00165-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, by binding to spike-RBD, F(ab&#x02019;)2 should avoid spike/ACE-2 attachment and ultimately prevent SARS-CoV-2 cell infection.</p><p>Despite the importance of RBD, this region is susceptible to mutations, supporting the importance of specific antibodies in targeting other structural proteins of the virus, such as E, M, and N, which can act synergistically with anti-Spike antibodies. Thus, we used peptides with sequences of other viral proteins. Regardless of the mutations present in the RBD, previous studies demonstrated that equine anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can bind to mutated RBDs, indicating that these essential epitopes do not undergo critical changes [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>The high specificity of monoclonal antibodies can reduce side effects; nevertheless, they can allow viral escape, as previously observed for anti-omicron antibodies [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and are susceptible to misreactivity with antigens in case of a mutation altering the epitope. If they cross-react with human proteins, they can cause severe tissue injuries. Although our antibodies were not manufactured as monoclonal antibodies, they were highly specific because of the short aa sequences selected. To manufacture applicable hyperimmune sera, we combined sera containing different antigens to avoid viral escape, as antibodies targeting multiple sites on the virus should considerably reduce the risk of escape. To avoid antibody site competition, peptide targets from different proteins, specifically M and N proteins, were included.</p><p>Although these proteins are not related to virus and host-cell interactions, multiple targets can prevent viral invasion, as they can prevent viral access to cell receptors or hamper fusion to the host-cell membrane by steric obstruction [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, N protein is related to numerous complicating effects, mainly illicit acute inflammatory processes and the promotion of lung and kidney injuries [<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, antibodies against N proteins confer additional advantages in preventing the aggravated injuries promoted by N proteins. Thus, using combined antibodies may improve the neutralizing capability, as they can act in a complementary or synergistic manner to control primary and secondary disease effects.</p><p>Indeed, the synergic effects of using peptide combinations against SARS-CoV-2 infection were previously described; however, the authors did not use peptides as antigens but explored the ability of three combined peptides to prevent the interaction between the S-protein and ACE-2 receptor, thus impairing viral infection. The peptide cocktail demonstrated excellent inhibitory and synergistic antiviral activities [<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00165" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, immunization of horses with peptides in a controlled manner is an important tool for producing neutralizing antibodies. Horses can be re-immunized quickly with new antigens, enabling the production of new batches of equine anti-bodies tailored to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants by engineering antigens to include conserved viral regions that can potentially neutralize multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, including those resistant to vaccines or monoclonal antibodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-17-00165"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Investigations and the development of neutralizing agents should be encouraged, as they expand the knowledge and arsenal of tools against COVID-19. These efforts ensure preparedness not only for future outbreaks of COVID-19 but also for related viruses that could emerge. Equine antibodies were produced through the immunization of horses with synthetic peptides and the preparation of the F(ab&#x02019;)2 fragment did not affect their ability to recognize the antigens, including viral proteins. These F(ab&#x02019;)2 fragments prevented S1 protein from binding to the ACE-2 receptor, as demonstrated using our developed ELISA, with the advantage of using only the proteins and not the active virus. Thus, this preliminary assay does not require special laboratory biosafety conditions. As a result, inhibition of the S1/ACE-2 interaction demonstrates the high potential of these antibodies to prevent the main route of viral host cell invasion. Further investigations should be conducted to confirm the neutralizing effects of these hyperimmune sera in animal models expressing the ACE-2 receptor. Future studies should focus on optimizing the antibody purification processes to enhance efficacy while reducing dosage requirements. Finally, these peptide sequences also demonstrate great potential for use in updating existing vaccines because they induce an immunogenic response. Therefore, a peptide-based vaccine using these sequences may enhance the effects of traditional vaccines, with fewer undesirable cross-effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Associa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Hospitalar de Prote&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o &#x000e0; Inf&#x000e2;ncia Raul Carneiro&#x02014;Hospital Pequeno Pr&#x000ed;ncipe, for the support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
