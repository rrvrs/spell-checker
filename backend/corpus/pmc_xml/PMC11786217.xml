Automatic segmentation is also more reproducible and not affected by intra- and inter-observer variability. Besides, volumetric measurements are better suited than the longest axial diameters to evaluate the size evolution since most lesions sphericity varies. Various analyses are proposed in this article to investigate these benefits.</p><p>Employing automatic volumetric response assessments can therefore result in a better patient follow-up and personalized treatment, in particular with a more reliable and earlier assessment avoiding unnecessary additional treatments (eg, pseudo-progression mistaken for progressive disease) and, conversely, a fast management of a progressive lesion. Precise response assessment is also key for identifying positive response during Phase II trials with experimental treatments.</p></boxed-text><p>Brain metastases (BM) originate from cancer cells that spread to the brain from primary tumors located in other sites. Research indicates that between 10% and 40% of patients with solid tumors will develop BMs over their clinical course.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref></sup></p><p>This statistic underscores the urgency of developing tailored approaches to address the unique challenges posed by BMs. Notably, cancers with high prevalence rates such as lung, breast, and melanoma cancers exhibit a substantial propensity for developing BMs,<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> further emphasizing the need for focused studies and interventions. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment method that allows precise irradiation of individual lesions with a minimal impact on the surrounding tissue. A frequent follow-up of patients treated by SRS is particularly important to detect the appearance of new lesions and to assess the response of the treated lesions, allowing additional treatment if required.</p><p>The standard response to treatment (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology BMs, RANO-BM<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>) although widely used, has several significant limitations when applied to patients with BM. One of the major issues is the somewhat arbitrary selection of target lesions. Clinicians often struggle to consistently identify which lesions to monitor, especially in patients with multiple metastases. This randomness introduces a degree of subjectivity that can affect the accuracy of treatment response assessment. In addition, the selection of the MRI slice on which these lesions are measured is also somewhat arbitrary. The current RANO criteria rely heavily on measuring the longest diameter of lesions on axial MRI slices. This method can lead to inconsistencies because the measurement can vary depending on the slice selected, which may not represent the true largest dimension of the tumor. This can lead to inaccurate assessments of tumor size and response to treatment. In addition, volumes may better approximate lesion progression than longest diameters measured in the axial plane. Also, the summation of all target lesions for treatment response does not adequately reflect clinical outcomes in patients with high tumor burden. In these cases, there may be dissociated responses where some lesions shrink while others grow or remain stable. This can lead to misleading conclusions about overall treatment efficacy. Developing robust response assessment methods is crucial to (1) improve patient follow-up, where re-treatment decisions are based on reliable local progression assessment, and (2) accurately identify positive response during clinical trials with experimental treatments.</p><p>Volumetric response assessments were shown to better predict overall survival (OS) than unidimensional measures in the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors in lung cancer.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Similarly, several works evaluated the importance of volumetric-based RANO. Gahrmann et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> reported no significant improvement of the volumetric method over the RANO criteria in terms of post-treatment prognostic markers of GlioBlastoma Multiforme tumors. Huang et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> compared 1D, 2D, and volumetric criteria for the assessment of treatment response and meningioma tumor progression. The authors found a moderate inter-observer variability for all 3 methods and a modest stronger association with OS for the volumetric criteria. For BMs, the inclusion of volume measurement as a secondary endpoint is recommended by the RANO-BM guidelines.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Its difference and benefits over unidimensional measurements was studied in multiple works. The increased stability of semiautomated volume measurements over diameter was associated with reduced intra- and inter-observer variability. Ozkara et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> showed that the largest diameter of a lesion may not accurately represent its volume. Oft et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> found that a cutoff of &#x02265;20% of volumetric response at 3 months was predictive for subsequent control.</p><p>As stated in the RANO-BM guidelines,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> volumetric analyses add cost and complexity to the clinical practice. To speed up the assessment, semiautomatic segmentation or size measurements are frequently used in studies and clinically.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The impact of MRI-based semiautomatic size assessment of BMs on the RANO-BM evaluation revealed a lower variance for semiautomatic diameter measurements, and disagreement of response assessments compared with manual measurements for 15% of cases.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Fully automatic segmentation of BMs has also gained attention with recent deep learning (DL) methods,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> showing excellent performance on different modalities including T1 MRIs. This could allow for the full exploitation of volumetric response assessment potential, as evidenced in prior studies, in routine clinical settings. Ozkara et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> used automatic segmentation for correlating diameter and volume measurement.</p><p>Cho et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> trained a DL model for BM segmentation and showed that the agreements with experts were higher for the volumetric RANO-BM than the linear one.</p><p>In this work, we further compare different methods for the evaluation of response to treatment in the follow-up of BMs treated with SRS. Manual and automatic (ie, DL) methods are compared for lesion contouring and response assessment, as well as linear and volumetric assessment methods. The analyses include inter-measurement and inter-assessment agreement, size measurement and response assessment stability to rotation and across time, and predictability of outcomes. Our study aims at revealing (1) situations where methods disagree or (2) lack robustness as well as, (3) which methods are most consistent with long-term or definitive responses at a BM-level.</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s6"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s7"><title>Data</title><p>The dataset originates from a retrospective, single-center, longitudinal study at CHUV<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Swiss legal requirements and the principles of Good Clinical Practice.

To simulate realistic variations in patient positioning, we rotate the 3D contours at all time points by a given range of angles (&#x02013;20&#x000b0; to 20&#x000b0; with a step of 2&#x000b0;, resulting in 21 rotated contours per BM including the nonrotated) around the <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>-axis (and all 3 axes to simulate extreme variations in patient positioning, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We measure the size (volume or longest diameter) for all rotated versions and calculate their coefficient of variation (CoV) across rotations. We take the cubic root of the volumes for the computation of the CoVs in order to ensure fair comparisons with the (unidimensional) diameters. Ideally, a simple rotation, which can happen due to a different orientation of the head, should not impact the size measurement because the lesion remains intrinsically the same. We report distributions of CoVs across all lesions. We also conduct a paired 2-sided Wilcoxon test on the differences of CoVs to compare the variation across the different contours and size measurements. The variability in size measurement due to rotation can result in changes in response assessment with RANO. To assess these variations, we also evaluate how often the rotations result in at least one change of response across the rotated lesions. For simplicity, the lesions are only rotated at the last time point, whereas the baseline and nadir are measured without rotations. We report the rate of change across all lesions and time points and perform 2-sided McNemar tests to compare method pairs.</p><p>Besides the stability to rotation, we also evaluate the stability of the size evolution in time to estimate the repeatability across time. We hypothesize that a standard evolution of size after treatment is monotonic, whereas an alternation of growth and shrinkage in consecutive follow-ups is likely related to an inaccurate size measurement. For all lesions included in this analysis, we compute the absolute Spearman correlation between the time elapsed since treatment and the lesion size. We conduct a 2-sided Wilcoxon test to evaluate the difference between the correlation coefficients of pairs of size measurement methods. Besides the monotonicity of the sizes, we also compute the rate of change of assessed response categories between pairs of consecutive follow-ups, eg, 1 change out of 2 for the baseline and 2 follow-ups [PR, CR, CR], and 2 changes out of 3 for [PR, PR, PD, PR]. We accumulate all occurrences of changes across time and lesions to compute the overall rate. We also perform McNemar tests to evaluate the significance of the rate difference between pairs of response assessment methods.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Predictability of outcomes.&#x02014;</title><p>We investigate how the early response assessments (ie, in the first month following treatment) reflect long-term or definitive lesion outcomes. We consider the 1-year response as a final outcome, ie, first response obtained after 12 months of follow-up (ie, PD, PR, SD, or CR). We then evaluate how much time elapses after treatment until this response is observed within the first year of follow-up. Our hypothesis is that better response assessment methods will be associated with a shorter time and will have more clinical relevance. We report the distributions of times elapsed across lesions for each response assessment method. The minimum duration is the time until the first follow-up, while the maximum one is the time until the first follow-up after 1 year (ie, meaning that the 1-year response is never found in earlier follow-ups).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Results</title><sec id="s18"><title>Comparisons of Size Measurements and Assessments</title><p>The results of the comparison analyses, described in Section &#x0201c;Comparisons: lesion size measurement and response assessment,&#x0201d; are presented in the following.</p><sec id="s19"><title>Systematic bias in size measurement.&#x02014;</title><p>Manually measured diameters (<italic toggle="yes">man-diam</italic>) are significantly smaller than those derived from the automatic and manual contours.

This reflects the fact that the segmentation algorithm is trained to delineate lesions in the same way as the radiologist. This important finding suggests that automatic segmentation can be used to also automate response assessment. An important difference is found, however, between the diameters derived from the contours and the manually measured ones, where the latter were found to be significantly smaller. Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.82 and 0.85 are observed between the <italic toggle="yes">man-diam</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">diam-manseg</italic> as well as <italic toggle="yes">man-diam</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">diam-autoseg</italic>, respectively. Besides, the manual diameters are also significantly smaller than the ones computed from the contours (<italic toggle="yes">diam-manseg</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">diam-autoseg</italic>), also reflected by low CCCs. This disagreement in measurements is echoed by a low agreement (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003ba;</italic> &#x02264; 0.35) between the RANO and manual assessments (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-H</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the diameter-volume correlation is significantly higher with the automatic contours than with the manual ones (<italic toggle="yes">P&#x02005;&#x0003c;&#x02005;</italic>.001). Even though both correlations are high, this difference likely originates from the slice-based approach of the manual contouring resulting in coarser, sawtooth-like contours along the inferior-superior (<italic toggle="yes">z</italic>) axis.</p><p>Volumes are more stable to rotations than diameters, as illustrated by the distributions of CoVs in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. The small variations in volume measurements are due to interpolation. Measures derived from automatic contours are also more stable than those derived from manual contours. While we could not compute the stability to rotation of the manually calculated diameters (<italic toggle="yes">man-diam</italic>) as it would require highly time-consuming additional annotations, similar trends are expected. These differences in measurement stability are also reflected in significant differences in terms of associated changes in response assessments as depicted in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>Similarly to the stability to rotation, the results consistently support volumes as the most stable size measurement method across time. We evaluated the Spearman correlation between time and size, where a high correlation reflects a stable monotonic evolution of the size measurement across time (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). A significant difference is found between volumetric and diameter measurements based on either manual or automatic contours. This difference in stability is also reflected by a lower rate of response change across time of RANO based on volume measurements (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that current clinical practices could be optimized.</p><p>The number of lesions with a follow-up longer than 12 months is small for the analysis of outcome prediction (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02005;=&#x02005;14). As shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, all response assessment methods have a similar average elapsed time for 12-month outcome predictability (&#x0223c;160 days) except for the RANO based on manually calculated diameters (270 days). In particular, the latter is longer than the manual RANO (182 days), which uses the same manually calculated diameters. This may reflect the fact that information additional to the manual diameter was used for the manual assessment (as also shown by the low agreement in the confusion matrix in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The manual assessment seems to better predict the 1-year response, with similar scores to the RANO with automatically calculated sizes.</p><p>Volumetric assessment provides a more objective and comprehensive method for evaluating the response of BM to treatment. By measuring the volume of each lesion, this approach provides a more accurate representation of tumor burden and its changes over time. Volumetric measurements are less susceptible to the variability introduced by the selection of specific MRI slices and the inherent subjectivity of manual diameter measurements. One of the key advantages of volumetric assessment is its ability to account for heterogeneity in response among multiple metastases within the same patient. In patients with high tumor burden, volumetric assessment can differentiate between lesions that respond to treatment and those that do not, providing a more nuanced understanding of the patient&#x02019;s overall response. This is particularly important in the context of modern treatment approaches, where the goal is often curative, and accurate assessment of each lesion is critical for treatment planning and adjustment.</p><p>This study suffers from limitations, including its retrospective nature and the fact that we only include BMs originating from melanoma primary cancers, with a limited sample size and follow-up (225 &#x000b1; 264 days) and heterogeneous systemic treatments. Besides, the automatic contours have FNs and FPs, which are not reflected by most of the analyses presented here since we conduct the experiments (eg, stability to rotation and in time) only on lesions without CR. We also use segmentation predictions of the DL model obtained in the cross-validation. It is worth noting that the goal of the paper is not the full evaluation of the automatic segmentation model, which is reported in Andrearczyk et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The performance of the re-segmentation algorithm remains a potential limitation for clinical adoption. Another limitation is the fact that all size measurements are not available for all lesions since some are only annotated by the manual and automatic contours and not by the manual response assessment because not treated by SRS. For some comparisons, we kept the intersection of annotated lesions to enable a paired comparison. It is also worth noting that we do not define a ground truth for the size measurement and response assessment since we compare different methods without knowing which is best. Despite the absence of ground truth, we aim to reveal the best method in terms of stability and 1-year response prediction.</p><p>Other limitations are specific to individual analyses. The stability to rotation and across time is not as such a proof of the superiority of one measurement or assessment method over another: a random yet constant size measurement or response assessment would result in perfect stability. We also assume monotonicity, of the size evolution which may not always reflect the true lesion evolution (eg, pseudo-progression and pseudo-response). Finally, the small number of lesions with long follow-up (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02005;=&#x02005;14) hinders solid conclusion drawing for the outcome predictability experiment.</p><p>The introduction of automated volumetric evaluation, as proposed in our study, can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of treatment response assessment. Automated segmentation tools powered by DL algorithms can streamline the process and make it feasible for routine clinical use. These tools can consistently delineate lesion boundaries, reduce inter- and intra-observer variability, and ensure that volumetric measurements are accurate and reproducible. The implementation of volumetric evaluation and automatic segmentation has the potential to significantly change patient management. In particular, the following clinical implications are noteworthy: (1) optimized follow-up schedules, (2) improved predictive power, (3) better resource allocation, (4) improved robustness of clinical trial data.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Conclusion</title><p>While the RANO criteria have been instrumental in standardizing response assessment in neuro-oncology, their limitations necessitate the exploration of more robust methods. Volumetric assessment represents a significant advancement, providing a more objective and detailed understanding of treatment response, particularly in patients with complex and heavily burdened metastatic disease. Our study highlights the potential of this approach to improve clinical outcomes by increasing the accuracy and reliability of BM assessment. The implementation of automatic segmentation allows the use of volumetric measurements to assess response in BMs. Although there is a moderate level of agreement between manual assessments and automated RANOs, the latter can provide clinicians with valuable, objective, and consistent information to determine the optimal treatment strategy for BMs and patient follow-up. Volumetric lesion size measurements and their corresponding automatic response assessments were found to be more stable than unidimensional ones. In addition, size measurements from automatic contours and their corresponding response scores were more stable than their counterparts based on manual contours and fully manual measurements and assessments. Similarly, automatic measurements appear to be more suitable for early detection of the final BM response. These findings support the use of (1) automatic lesion segmentation, (2) volumetric measurement, and (3) automatic response assessment to assist radiologists in their daily clinical routine for patient follow-up. In future work, a larger cohort with other primary cancers will allow us to confirm the results and investigate the prediction of future lesion response from single and multiple time points. Volumetric assessment is a significant advance that provides a more objective and detailed understanding of treatment response, particularly in patients with complex and heavily burdened metastatic disease. This approach may lead to improved clinical outcomes by increasing the accuracy and reliability of BM evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>vdae216_suppl_Supplementary_Appendix</label><media xlink:href="vdae216_suppl_supplementary_appendix.pptx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s30"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was partially funded by the Swiss Cancer Research foundation with the project TARGET (KFS-5549-02-2022-R); the Lundin Family Brain Tumour Research Centre at CHUV; the Hasler Foundation with the project MSxplain number 21042; and the Swiss National Science Foundation with the project 205320 219430.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s31"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec id="s32"><title>Authorship statement</title><p>Experimental design (V.A., L.S., J.O.P., M.C., V.D., and A.D.), acquisition (L.S., J.B., A.H., and V.D.), analysis (V.A., L.S., V.D., and A.D.), interpretation (V.A., L.S., J.O.P., M.C., V.D., and A.D.).
