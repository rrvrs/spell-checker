A novel approach to utilize exogenous surfactant preparation as a drug delivery vehicle for corticosteroids, which are the inflammation-reducing agents for lung diseases has not been comprehensively investigated. The direct corticosteroid drugs administered through pulmonary surfactants would impair their surface activity and exacerbate normal breathing cycles. This study was conducted to characterize the physiological interaction between frequently used inhaled corticosteroid, mometasone furoate, and relevant composition of lung surfactants by using the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> methods. The major objective of this work is to elucidate the effects of glucocorticoids on the structural and dynamical characteristics of the lung surfactant as well as the effects of the drug on the ability of the surfactant monolayer to reduce surface tension during mechanical breathing. Our results from the Langmuir experiment and atomic force microscopy imply that mometasone furoate concentrations less than 4.18% w/w might not strongly influence the physicochemical characteristics of the surfactant molecules representing the feasible concentration for pulmonary drug delivery. Beyond this range, mometasone furoate concentrations cause intensified film fluidization that leads the surfactant film to collapse at lower surface pressure, which is also verified by the <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> study. The failure of the drug to permeate into the lipid bilayer is most likely what causes this collapse. On the other hand, for inhalation breathing, the monolayer forms pores induced by the high drug concentrations. Our investigation also reveals that mometasone furoate exhibits different spreading behaviors because of their affinities to the surfactant molecules. This work may have implications for the use of inhaled steroids in the treatment of asthma in addition to its translational significance in the management of chronic lung disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The precise procedure for examining how the corticosteroid drug mometasone furoate interacts with a model lung surfactant monolayer.<graphic xlink:href="d5ra00004a-ga.jpg" id="ga" position="float"/></p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

Such interaction includes essential functions for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug by controlling how quickly drugs spread and accumulate. The binding affinity for human serum albumin (HSA) is one of the crucial variables influencing the allocation of active concentrations of many corticosteroid medicines that are delivered to the lung alveolar surface.<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In contrast to oral and intravenous drug administration, inhalation is the recommended method for administering a corticosteroid because it allows the medicine to be delivered straight to the alveolar airways, and it reduces systemic side effects.<sup><xref rid="cit6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Clinical investigations have demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroids considerably decrease airway hyperresponsiveness, successfully stop acute exacerbations, enhance lung function, and lessen the intensity of symptoms.<sup><xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In addition to their involvement in other physiological processes, corticosteroids also affect the release of inflammatory mediators in the respiratory pathways, including those produced by mast cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages.<sup><xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Freely circulating inhaled corticosteroids have the potential to bind with non-pulmonary glucocorticoid receptors and have negative consequences, such as reducing the activity of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis and impairing growth.<sup><xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is possible to lessen the systemic adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids by the extensive protein binding that helps to inhibit the side effects of the drug. To understand the drug&#x02013;membrane interaction, an in-depth investigation needs to be conducted to observe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics mechanism of the corticosteroid drug. Pontremoli <italic toggle="yes">et. al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> conducted a spectroscopic study to calculate the protein binding affinity of several inhaled drugs including betamethasone, flunisolide, prednisolone, and triamcinolone with HSA to see the pharmacokinetic behaviors of the corticosteroids.</p><p>Recently, much effort has been focused on the delivery of intratracheal corticosteroids utilizing a natural pulmonary surfactant for premature neonates with recurring pulmonary disease. Corticosteroids supplied as the anti-inflammatory drug and the surfactant preparation employed as the drug carrier, as well as their mixing ratios, have not been optimized yet. Pulmonary drug delivery has drawn more attention recently because it is a noninvasive technique that is capable of avoiding systemic side effects.<sup><xref rid="cit10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The huge surface area (&#x0223c;70&#x02013;140 m<sup>2</sup>) of the alveoli in human lungs and the incredibly thin diffusive layer (&#x0003c;0.5 &#x003bc;m) in the peripheral lung alveoli are the significant elements contributing to the viability of respiratory drug administration.<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The lung airways are a good absorptive location for inhaled drugs due to these anatomical characteristics, making them a prospective track for the transport of medicines.<sup><xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Topical application to the lungs avoids first-pass metabolism and reduces the possibility of negative effects brought by high systemic dosage, in addition to facilitating drug transport more easily than intravenous injection.<sup><xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Because of these features, respiratory drug transportation has become a promising drug delivery approach for facilitating the management and treatment of pulmonary conditions including asthma and chronic pulmonary diseases. On top of the regional delivery, the respiratory tract can also be used for the complete administration of medicinal substances, particularly peptide and protein-based medicines.</p><p>Due to the harmful side effects of the systemic administration of corticosteroids, the frequent use of such drugs has been limited<sup><xref rid="cit14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> to treat local inflammation while minimizing harmful systemic consequences effectively.<sup><xref rid="cit15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Clinical trials have been performed on two separate pulmonary delivery techniques. They are intratracheal installation of corticosteroids employing exogenous surfactant as a distribution agent, and very recently, inhalation administration of corticosteroid aerosols.<sup><xref rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr">16,17</xref></sup> Exogenous surfactants can be used as a drug transport agent into the alveoli, as found by <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> biomechanical, biophysical, or biochemical tests.<sup><xref rid="cit18" ref-type="bibr">18,19</xref></sup> The transportation of corticosteroid drugs together with the natural surfactant as the delivery vehicle in the targeted region shows multiple benefits. Firstly, a natural surfactant has excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability since it may either be taken up by the alveolar macrophages or expelled from the alveolar surface by endocytosis back into alveolar type II cells, where the natural lung surfactants are produced.<sup><xref rid="cit20" ref-type="bibr">20,21</xref></sup> Secondly, these hydrophobic corticosteroid drugs become more soluble in water by the combination of natural surfactant and drug molecules through a drug solubilization process.<sup><xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Thirdly, the spontaneous diffusion of natural surfactant relies on the differential surface tension at the alveolar interior layer of the airways, which occurs due to the Marangoni effect.<sup><xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23,24</xref></sup> This enables easy intratracheal delivery of corticosteroids along with natural surfactants to the distal lung.</p><p>Pulmonary surfactants are produced and excreted by pneumocyte type II cells and form an ultrafine layer at the air&#x02013;water interface in the alveoli, which is referred to as the lung surfactant monolayer (LSM).<sup><xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr">25,26</xref></sup> In order to assist the mechanical work of breathing, LSM lowers surface tension by approaching 0 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at the end of exhalation breathing and prevents alveolar collapse.<sup><xref rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr">27,28</xref></sup> In addition to protecting alveoli against various inhaled substances, LSM acts as the first line of defense against potentially inhaled microorganisms and/or particles reaching the respiratory airways. The lung surfactant constituents and the arrangement of the surfactant molecules at the air&#x02013;liquid interface of air sacs are critical to various functions, including the modulation of alveolar space and the pulmonary surfactant deformability.<sup><xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Any imbalance of lung surfactant components (phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins) reduces the effectiveness of lung functioning. Phospholipids comprise around 85% of the weight of mammalian lung surfactant components, making them the most prevalent substance. The zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids are the highest prevalent species of phospholipids, constituting approximately 70% of the total weight. The di-saturated phospholipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<italic toggle="yes">sn-glycero</italic>-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) makes up more than half of the total PC lipids, whereas the residual species of lipids are mono- or di-unsaturated phospholipids such as 1,2-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic toggle="yes">sn-glycero</italic>-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC).<sup><xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30,31</xref></sup> The following key phospholipids are negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (PG) lipids, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic toggle="yes">sn-glycero</italic>-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<italic toggle="yes">sn-glycero</italic>-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG), which is nearly 10% of the total lipids.<sup><xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Along with phospholipids, the LSM also includes roughly 8% weight-based cholesterol (CHOL)<sup><xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and about 8% weight&#x02013;weight surfactant protein<sup><xref rid="cit32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> as well. The surfactant proteins are separated into two groups: hydrophilic surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-D), which are present in the lipid bilayer, and hydrophobic surfactant proteins (SP-B and SP-C) that are embedded in the lipid monolayer as involved in the surface-tension controlling agent of the LSM.<sup><xref rid="cit33" ref-type="bibr">33,34</xref></sup></p><p>Asthma, rhinitis, and a few skin diseases can also be treated with the corticosteroid medication methotrexate (also known as mometasone furoate). Having anti-inflammatory, anti-pulmonary itching, and vasoconstrictive effects, mometasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid.<sup><xref rid="cit35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref></sup> Recent <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> investigations have demonstrated that mometasone shows antiviral activity, which inhibits the replication of COVID-19 and MERS-CoV.<sup><xref rid="cit38" ref-type="bibr">38,39</xref></sup> Understanding the chemical interactions of the drug with LSM, which serve as the primary obstacle for inhaled particles to penetrate the alveoli, is crucial to comprehending the mechanism. By enhancing the drug's adsorption capacity into the pulmonary epithelium and alveolar interface, lung surfactants can be employed to increase drug efficacy and lower systemic toxicity. Hydrophobic drugs can also be dissolved with surfactants. The development of drug delivery mechanisms as well as the adsorption of the drug itself, depend on how drugs interact with the LSM. For instance, Cimato <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> investigated the interaction of beclomethasone, budesonide, and fluticasone with pulmonary surfactant. According to the results from electron resonance spectroscopy, the order of the phospholipids dropped as drug concentrations rose, leading to phospholipids accumulation in the monolayer for all three corticosteroids except cholesterol. In contrast to the three corticosteroids (fluticasone, budesonide, and beclomethasone), cholesterol shows the opposite impact on surface activity. The findings demonstrated that all steroids have lower surface tension (0&#x02013;2 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than cholesterol (6&#x02013;8 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).<sup><xref rid="cit40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> The effects of corticosteroids on compressibility varied from those of cholesterol. The study also showed that there is a threshold dosage for transporting drugs without changing the biophysical behavior of the LSM.<sup><xref rid="cit40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Based on these investigations and others<sup><xref rid="cit41" ref-type="bibr">41,42</xref></sup> on various corticosteroids and lung surfactant preparations, the interactions between corticosteroid and monolayer are complicated and dependent on the surfactant's composition, surface tension, physico&#x02013;chemical characteristics, and drug dose. Davies <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> measured the adhesive force between the micro-sized corticosteroid budesonide and the surfactant monolayer by combining the atomic force microscope and Langmuir&#x02013;Blodgett experiments. According to the study, surface pressure controls the hydrophobic connections between budesonide and the monolayer. They also find that high interfacial pressure (low surface tension) exhibits stronger interactions than low surface pressure (high surface tension). The author also observed that the hydrophobic drug budesonide interacts with the lipidic hydrophobic chain and influences membrane packing at high pressure. These experimental findings demonstrate that corticosteroid activity depends on concentration and is affected by surfactant composition, but the study fails to explain the dynamical surface activity of the drug or surfactant components as well as their bio-physical alternations at the molecular level. Keeping these fundamental concerns in mind, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation can provide data on the behaviour of surfactant components such as lipids, proteins, and other small drug molecules on a molecular scale, which allows us to stipulate molecular level knowledge on the pulmonary surfactant and drug interaction.<sup><xref rid="cit43" ref-type="bibr">43&#x02013;45</xref></sup> By employing <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (grazing incidence X-ray off-specular scattering, GIXOS) and <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> (CG MD simulation) techniques, Souza <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> investigated the interaction of flavonoids (naringin and naringenin) and DPPC containing lung surfactant to elucidate adsorption behaviour. Naringenin possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, oral administration is challenging due to its limited oral absorption.<sup><xref rid="cit47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> As a result, a new delivery method was introduced to transport drugs directly into the alveoli alleviating lung inflammation. However, due to the simplification of the model (it only includes DPPC phospholipid per layer to form the monolayer, neglecting the other surfactant constituents such as POPC, POPG, CHOL), this study is unable to fully capture the lung surfactant properties. For this, it is further necessary to conduct research by incorporating POPC, POPG, CHOL that might mimic more realistic lung surfactant components and different drugs. Lung surfactant may be used as a drug transportation and spreading agent to treat preterm neonates and adults with pneumonia who have lung injury.<sup><xref rid="cit48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> It shows promise as a carrier for antibiotics, potentially improving drug delivery to the lungs and enhancing treatment efficacy for respiratory infections.<sup><xref rid="cit49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> However, the interactions between surfactants and antibiotics must be thoroughly evaluated to ensure the compatibility and effectiveness of the drug. This approach could lead to more efficient and safer treatments for lung infections. Using a combination of the Langmuir experiment, atomistic MD simulation, and PM-IRRAS research, Ortiz-Collazos <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> investigated the molecular interaction of levofloxacin with LSM made up of binary phospholipids (DPPC:POPC). They discovered that amphoteric levofloxacin stabilizes the LSM for a particular levofloxacin concentration of 10% w/w by expanding its area without altering the monolayer elasticity. Recently, we conducted a coarse-grained molecular dynamics study to inspect the impact of mometasone on the LSM consisting of lipids (DPPC&#x02013;POPC&#x02013;POPG), cholesterol and surfactant protein (SP-B and SP-C).<sup><xref rid="cit51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> The findings from this study showed that mometasone changes the monolayer's structure depending on the drug dose and induces LSM destabilization affected by interfacial tension and surfactant protein. At high drug concentrations, the ability of the drug to diffuse within the LSM is constrained, leading to monolayer collapse.</p><p>In the current study, the deformations of the drug-free and drug-containing surfactant monolayers have been investigated using the Langmuir experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics. It also explored how the monolayer alters mechanically under different mometasone furoate concentrations during inhale and exhale breathing. The phase analysis is explored by using the wider ranges of surface tensions outside the normal breathing surface tension. Using fixed APL simulations, monolayer phase behaviour and monolayer-to-multilayer spontaneous alternation at the liquid condense (LC) and liquid expanded (LE) phases have been examined. The underpinning monolayer model utilized in this study is made up of DPPC&#x02013;POPC&#x02013;POPG&#x02013;CHOL (60&#x02009;:&#x02009;20&#x02009;:&#x02009;10&#x02009;:&#x02009;10) to replicate the lipid fraction of mature human lung surfactant in the alveoli.<sup><xref rid="cit52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> This quantity of surfactant fragments within the monolayer (in mol%) corresponds to the number of surfactant molecules (62% DPPC, 21% POPC, 11% POPG, 6% cholesterol (CHOL)) by mass.<sup><xref rid="cit52" ref-type="bibr">52,53</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Experimental procedure for Langmuir monolayer studies</title><sec><label>2.1.1</label><title>Materials and reagents</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The phospholipid DPPC (&#x02265;99%), POPC (&#x02265;99%), and POPG-Na (&#x02265;98%), as well as cholesterol (&#x02265;99%) and mometasone furoate (<italic toggle="yes">European Pharmacopoeia</italic> standard) were collected from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

For this, we first parameterized the corticosteroid drug (Mometasone furoate) by following the process of our previously published paper for mometasone<sup><xref rid="cit51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> by adding two extra beads into the side chain moiety of the steroid ring at the C-17 position (Fig. S3<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>).

The obtained partition coefficient is 10.29 showing the stable coarse-grained structure of the mometasone furoate drug molecule. We have found overestimated the partition coefficient of mometasone furoate (10.29) compared to the log&#x02009;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values from <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>&#x02009;log&#x02009;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> (4.27) and ChemAxon (5.06), which are QSAR tools used to predict log&#x02009;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values. Thus, the free energy of partitioning is too negative for mometasone furoate. However, the relative partition coefficients for mometasone (7.97,<sup><xref rid="cit51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>), prednisolone (5.10,<sup><xref rid="cit58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>) and cholesterol (8.72,<sup><xref rid="cit59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>), which we used as a reference, are correct. If we would correct the parameters of mometasone furoate to match the ones from QSAR tools, it would not be correct relative to mometasone. Therefore, the final optimized configuration (stable coarse-grained structure of the MF) and parameters of the MF were used for the molecular dynamics simulation of the LSM in a concentration-dependent manner. A range of drug concentrations (MF) was then considered for evaluating the effect of drug dosages in experiments and simulations. The monolayer system is designed with the number of drug molecules necessary to achieve the appropriate drug concentrations. The number of lipid molecules in the model and the corresponding molecular weights of all monolayer constituents are used in calculating the drug concentration according to the equation (<xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">eqn (3)</xref>).<disp-formula id="eqn3"><label>3</label><graphic xlink:href="d5ra00004a-t2.jpg" id="ugt2" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>The number of drugs employed in the simulations is approximately the dosage that a meter dose inhaler delivers to the lungs per puff.

In order to show the comparison between isotherm curves from the Langmuir experiment at different drug concentrations, similar &#x003c0;-APL isotherm curves were reproduced from MD simulation (Fig. S7<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>) according to the procedure employed by Baoukina <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="cit76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> It is worth noting that simulations cannot cover the same extensive range of APL as used in Langmuir experiments due to the underestimation of interfacial tension from simulations (Fig. S6 and S7<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). In applied thermal conditions (36.6 &#x000b0;C), the maximal surface pressure obtained by the monolayer of the phospholipid mixture with cholesterol is calculated 42 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. However, it is still feasible to assess the impact of the MF on APL in the range of APL from 47 to 61 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. The results from Langmuir experiments demonstrate that &#x003c0; is decreased by the increase of the MF concentration for the constant APL. This impact is apparent in our computations as well. The results of the experiment further demonstrated that for a fixed APL, the drug reduces the value of &#x003c0; in the monolayer, which may contribute to optimizing the breathing mechanics(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and S6<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). This impact is still apparent in the <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> study, albeit less strongly than in the experiment (Fig. S7<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). From Langmuir experiments, phase transitions cannot be distinguished in the course of isotherm in applied conditions, even though they are typical for the monolayer of DPPC (which dominates the mixture). For systems with various drug content, there is no evident relationship between the drug concentration and monolayer expansion (noted as the <italic toggle="yes">A</italic><sub>lift-off</sub> shifting toward larger values). As shown in the inset in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, the curve with the addition of 0.72% w/w MF is close to the isotherm of the drug-free, but the addition of 2.13% MF shifts the curve towards a lower value of APL. Considering that MF is not included in the average value of the area per lipid molecule, this indicates the reorganization of the monolayer molecules caused by the presence of the drug molecules so that they occupy a smaller space. The curves corresponding to the drug-free system, and systems containing 0.72% and 14.82% MF are indistinguishable for APL &#x0003e; 60 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. It has been found that MF concentration notably affects the isothermal slope. Therefore, the curve slope is more towards the <italic toggle="yes">X</italic>-axis with increasing drug content and collapses at the lower surface area. This phenomenon is reflected in the compressibility modulus (Cs<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The maximal Cs<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> values calculated for all systems fit between 50 and 100 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (an intermediate region between the LE and LC states). At the higher drug content in the mixture, the lower of the maximum Cs<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> value is observed. Mometasone furoate is insoluble in water, and the drug itself does not form a monolayer. This property may provide challenges in pharmaceutical formulations where solubility is essential to the effectiveness and delivery of drugs. However, the changed course of the &#x003c0;-APL isotherms and Cs<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> &#x003c0; curves indicate that MF molecules are present in the vicinity of the interface, not exactly occupying space on the surface but certainly altering the organization of the lipid monolayers. Since the presence of drug molecules lowers the surface pressure when the monolayer collapses in this case, we assessed the effect of MF on monolayer stability <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> relaxations at a constant surface pressure of 30 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In such an experiment, the monolayer is subjected to the stress from barriers sliding to keep the &#x003c0; at the desired level. In this case, it causes loss of the molecules from the surface, illustrated as a relative molecular area decline for each system including the drug-free system as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>. As the amount of the drug increases, the mixed monolayer becomes less stable, and the monolayer disruption rate enhances. The above-presented Langmuir technique results indicate that the addition of the drug in a dose higher than 2.13% w/w causes significant alterations in the characteristics of the lipid monolayer which is also verified by the <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> studies.</p><p>The influence of MF molecules on the mixed monolayers is noticeable since the initial stages of the monolayer formation, so the investigation should be broadened within this region. A surface potential-area per lipid (&#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>-APL) isotherms provide valuable insight into the molecular arrangement and packing when compressing a monolayer. The surface potential of a Langmuir monolayer relies on three primary factors: (i) the dipole moments of the monolayer components, (ii) the way water molecules are positioned towards each other, and (iii) the ionic environment as well as the condition of the head-groups and subphase.<sup><xref rid="cit77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup> However, the crucial factor determining surface potential is the arrangement of charges across the surface. The surface potential arises from constant electric dipoles of the molecules developing monolayers and the reassembly of water molecules. A potential difference is created between the air and the negatively charged aqueous subphase due to the selective alignment of oxygen in the air phase and hydrogen in the aqueous subphase, leading to polarization of the air&#x02013;water interface.<sup><xref rid="cit55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> The surface potential over large areas per molecule is typically zero. As the monolayer is compressed, and due to the domain's formation, reaches a critical area, the &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">V</italic> tends to increase with the reorientation of dipoles. Since this critical area is usually higher than the <italic toggle="yes">A</italic><sub>lift-off</sub> for the increase in surface pressure, the &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>-APL isotherms are considered more suitable for monitoring the monolayer formation in the gaseous phase (when &#x003c0; is below 0 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than the &#x003c0;-APL isotherms.<sup><xref rid="cit55" ref-type="bibr">55,78</xref></sup> The course of &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>-APL isotherm of lipid mixture without MF follows the expected trend (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of the MF molecules entails a notable decrease in the &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">V</italic> value in the expanded molecular state (APL &#x0003e;110 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for 0 and 0.72% MF and &#x0003e;85 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for 2.13&#x02013;14.82% MF). After that, the &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">V</italic> value increases sharply at a critical area almost identical for MF content above 0.72% w/w. Bearing in mind that the system studied here is very complex and no ions have been added to the aqueous subphase for the experiments, there are several possible explanations for such an outcome.

Compression can also cause a reorientation of the molecules within the monolayer. The altered orientation influences the dipole moments and distribution of charges and their exposure to the aqueous phase, thereby affecting the surface potential. Moreover, the decrease in intermolecular distance may lead to a partial neutralization of the charged head groups due to electrostatic screening by adjacent molecules, decreasing the overall surface potential. However, the lack of the &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">V</italic> drop in the initial compression stage for the mixed lipid monolayer and its intensification with increasing MF content proves that the presence of drug molecules in the interfacial region is crucial. As the permittivity of the monolayer (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b5;</italic>) is an unknown value, the changes in the effective dipole moment of the molecules within the monolayer due to compression were also presented as the apparent dipole moment (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003bc;</italic><sub>a</sub>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).

However, the conclusions that could be drawn are insufficient to determine their exact position relative to the monolayer. Thus, monolayers were transferred onto a solid substrate and subjected to AFM studies to obtain topographical data. Fig. S8<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> summarizes AFM topographical images and cross-sections of mixed monolayers at different surface pressure levels to visualize the MF concentration-dependent effect. The cross-sections outline the topography of the characteristic elements. An AFM micrograph of the basic lipid system reveals the nano-domains with an average diameter of 39.88 &#x000b1; 3.28 nm (measured at a picture in higher magnification) and height of 1&#x02013;1.6 nm evenly distributed over the entire sample area.

In the presence of 4.18% MF, there are fewer aggregates, but they are of a larger area and a height of up to 30 nm. However, it has been noted that the topography of the film between the aggregates resembles that of a drug-free lipid monolayer. The relative height differences of the structures from the cross-sections in the areas without aggregates are approx. 0.8, 0.9, and 2.3 nm for samples at 10 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as presented in the first row of Fig. S8a, b and c,<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> respectively. The cross-section comparison is given in Fig. S9,<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> and the roughness values (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>a</sub>) for the film framework area, excluding visible aggregates, are in <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. With the increasing MF content, the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>a</sub> values for the flat framework are higher than for the MF-free film. However, values calculated from the top of the aggregates exceed the values of aggregates-free regions by order of magnitude, reaching 1640 &#x000b1; 752 pm and 1920 &#x000b1; 691 pm for the I-b and I-c samples, respectively (data not shown). Aggregates in systems containing 0.72% w/w of the drug in elevated &#x003c0; are of the same height, but at 20 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, it is more numerous, and at 30 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, they group into structures of a large area. A significant proportion of the drug in the system (column c) contributes to the further increase in the relative height of the aggregates. Until, at 30 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, next to the large-area aggregates there are also lower structures resembling those of the lipid monolayer in &#x003c0;<sub>coll</sub> but of a much greater height. From the experiments that have been undertaken at the air&#x02013;water interface, it is possible to conclude that MF molecules associate with the lipid head group compared to the lipid tail in response to the monolayer compression above the surface pressure of 10 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (transition from the LE phase to the intermediate phase between LE and LC). That is noticeable in the course of isotherms and the Cs<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> modulus. The presence of MF molecules under the monolayer affects its characteristics and decreases stability by altering the orientation of lipid molecules. As the monolayer is further compressed, the MF molecules form aggregates of considerable thickness. Interestingly, the BAM (Brewster angle microscope) images were also performed for the lipid system and one containing significant amounts of MF (data is shown in Table S3<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). In both cases, only foam-like structures characteristic of lipid mixtures were observed for the expanded monolayer. The lack of aggregates may indicate the presence of drug molecules only under the lipid monolayer. Moreover, the basic lipid system was transferred by the LB technique to the mica substrate, which is hydrophilic. However, the transfer of the drug-containing layer to the same substrate has failed. Thus, in the subsequent steps, a successful transfer was made onto a hydrophobized silicon substrate. During the transfer of the monolayers onto the flat solid surface, the aggregates could be emphasized, which is visible in the AFM studies. It has been demonstrated that, as the drug content of the monolayer increases, its compressibility and stability over time decrease. Unfortunately, based on the performed tests, it cannot be stated whether the MF molecules are present on the surface in an expanded monolayer.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Monolayer structural arrangement and dynamical behavior analysis by <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> investigation</title><p>We used computational modeling to determine the properties of the monolayer and the drug diffusion.

The order parameter value ranges from &#x02212;0.5 to 1.0, with &#x02212;0.5 indicating complete anti-alignment along the monolayer normal and 1.0 indicating perfect alignment with the monolayer normal. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> reveals that the lipid tail (chain-1, <italic toggle="yes">sn</italic>-1 and chain-2, <italic toggle="yes">sn</italic>-2) orientation is aligned to the normal of the monolayer surface at highly condensed (47 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) monolayer at increasing drug concentration from 0 to 14.84% w/w.

These dis-similar orientations between saturated and unsaturated lipid chains are because of the C&#x02013;C double bond at D2&#x02013;C3 bead of the lipid chain. It is typically known that at lower molecular area, the lipid chain should be highly ordered, but for unsaturated chains, the order parameter declines compared to saturated chains.

Due to the maximum APL tested, the tails of the lipids are exhibiting low order (&#x0003c;0.6) as shown in Fig. S10.<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> These increasing orders of the lipid tails are noticeable for beads C1&#x02013;C2/D2 and C2/D2&#x02013;C3 for all the lipids, but for the C3&#x02013;C4 bead, there is no significant alteration that occurred. Due to the passive drug diffusion, the accumulation of drug molecules near the lipid head group causes higher order compared to the tails group, which is confirmed by the RDF calculation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and S12<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>).

The lipophilicity or hydrophobicity of the drug molecule induces the construction of nano-accumulation of surfactant molecules on the monolayer. Due to the drug&#x02013;drug adhesive force and drug&#x02013;lipid cohesive force in the system, such aggregation of MF molecules is observed on the monolayer causing monolayer instability at higher drug concentrations at low molecular areas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>To analyze such accumulation or spreading activity of the MF molecules over the monolayer, the radial distribution function or pair correlation function, <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>) was computed by applying the cutoff distance of 1.0 nm. The variations in interaction mechanism between drug&#x02013;lipid head and drug&#x02013;lipid tail have been illustrated as a function of drug concentrations in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> (for compressed monolayer) and Fig. S12<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> (for expanded monolayer). Mometasone furoate molecules prefer to interact with the lipid head compared to the lipid tail which is highly influenced by the higher concentration of the drug molecules. The drug molecules flee away from the hydrophobic layer formed by the lipid tail group and penetrate into the lipid head group region at the time of interaction. Therefore, the drug molecules are influenced to self-aggregate during the monolayer compression and induce the monolayer instability causing the monolayer collapse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The opposite scenario can be noticed during the monolayer expansion (Fig. S11<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>) with proper spreading of the drug molecules over the monolayer surface. This is because of the balancing of the surface tension at inhalation (&#x0223c;20 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as well as exhalation breathing condition (&#x0003c;5 mN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Due to the larger molecular area available for the lung surfactant lipids at breath-in condition, the drug molecules can penetrate into the monolayer easily and contact with the choline group of the lipid head group by cationic&#x02013;&#x003c0; interaction. As a result, the monolayer might be stable and the drug could be homogeneously distributed into the lipid structure, that maintains proper surface tension of the alveolar air&#x02013;water interface. On the other hand, during the exhalation breathing condition, the monolayer components get lower space to move, and the drug molecules can interact with lipid head adjacent water molecules that might cause an increase of interfacial surface pressure. This high surface pressure may induce monolayer collapse at higher drug concentrations. The drug molecules and lipid head groups are then forced out from the monolayer air&#x02013;water interface. This is because of the variations in the lipid head groups' current state on the aqueous surface by reducing the cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>The radial distribution function (RDF) between drug molecules and lipid monolayer (lipid head and lipid tails) at different drug concentrations within a cutoff distance of 1.0 nm during lung compression (APL value of 47 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="d5ra00004a-f6" position="float"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, the Langmuir experiment and MD simulations were employed to examine the dose-dependent impact of the corticosteroid drug mometasone furoate on cholesterol-enriched lung surfactant monolayer. It demonstrates that MF molecules influence the characteristics of DPPC&#x02013;POPC&#x02013;POPG&#x02013;CHOL monolayers as well as the location and distribution of MF molecules in LSM with different surface pressures. Drug molecules can impede the development of liquid-condensed films and reduce the compressibility of mixed lipid monolayers. The cationic&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions between the choline molecule of the lipid head and the benzene ring of the MF molecule, the steric resistance of the lipid head, and the lipophilicity of the MF molecule all have an impact on the location and spreading of MF molecules into the lipid monolayer. There were more intermolecular interactions, changes in molecular orientation, or electrostatic screening effects inside the multicomponent lipid monolayer containing bioactive molecules as a result of the decrease in surface potential difference during monolayer compression. Lower surface pressures allow the cation&#x02013;&#x003c0; interaction to take place, which causes drug molecules to combine with lipid choline molecules and make direct contact with water. Higher surface pressure at lower molecular area causes head groups of lipids to have close contact with water, resulting in the formation of a denser monolayer which is verified by the lipid order parameter from the computational study. To be transported into the aqueous phase, the drug molecules must overcome a stronger barrier. Drug molecules cannot be further transported to the aqueous phase by the stiffer monolayer. In line with this, the drug molecules that were initially connected with the lipid head groups are extracted from the layer. The drug molecules can escape from the lipid head group and tend to self-aggregate by forming bigger species when surface pressure intensifies. Drug molecule aggregation at high concentrations inhibits drug diffusion into the lipid monolayer, leading to the monolayer collapse. This drug-induced collapse of the monolayer is particularly likely to occur during exhalation breathing. Because of their hydrophobicity, these molecules then linger in a more hydrophobic microregion of lipid films. This study not only offers a potential mechanism of interaction between lipid complex monolayers and drug molecules but also brings in additional detailed information to help further understand the process of inhaled administration therapy. The overall findings of this investigation could advance our knowledge of how inhaled corticosteroid drugs interact and control the off-target drug delivery mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are presented in the paper in either figure or tabular form.
