With MTI, single-cell abundance levels and spatial distribution of 10&#x02013;150 proteins and/or 500&#x02013;2000 RNAs can be quantified simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, MTI enables characterization of individual cells as well as tissue organization, and MTI has been used in studies of healthy tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, COVID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, There are many MTI platforms, including cyclic immunofluorescence (CycIF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, CosMx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, Xenium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x000a0;and</sup> multiplex immunohistochemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. MTI has been used to generate large datasets in NIH consortia such as the NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and the NCI Cancer Moonshot Human Tumor Atlas Network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. MTI is also an increasingly common assay in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, where it has proven important for quantifying tumor spatial organization and microenvironment heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and connecting these features to cancer subtypes, prognosis, and therapy response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">However, several key factors limit the usefulness of MTI. Only 10&#x02013;150 proteins and/or several thousand RNAs can be assayed in a single experiment, and hence the information obtained from a single experiment is bounded. Further, MTI assays can suffer from several technical issues that reduce the information obtained, including tissue loss or folding, probe failure, illumination artifacts, or errors in downstream image processing. These limitations greatly impact MTI data quality and substantially reduce the overall utility of MTI. To mitigate these limitations and improve utility of MTI, machine learning and deep learning approaches can be used to computationally increase the numbers of proteins/RNAs available from MTI and mitigate assay failures. Computationally increasing&#x02014;or imputing&#x02014;additional data by filling in missing data with predicted values is already common in other molecular assays, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, bulk genomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and bulk transcriptomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. While imputation has been applied to MTI images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, to the best of our knowledge imputation on MTI single-cell datasets has not been explored. Imputation has been applied to MTI image data (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, being able to reconstruct protein expression in images. However, imputing single-cell data is especially valuable because single-cell datasets require fewer computational resources to process than images and can be readily integrated with other molecular datasets.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we applied machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to impute protein abundance in tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> datasets obtained from breast cancer tissues. Because t-CyCIF is an open and quantitative multiplexed tissue imaging assay, it is ideally suited for imputation. We evaluated the performance of ML and DL methods to predict protein abundance levels in t-CyCIF single-cell datasets that included 20 proteins. Three distinct ML/DL approaches&#x02014;regularized linear regression, gradient-boosted trees, and autoencoders&#x02014;were used to impute single-cell protein abundance values across both patients and timepoints. Spatial information was introduced to improve imputation results. To demonstrate a biological application of imputed single-cell protein abundance, we used imputed data to predict whether single cells were more likely to come from pre-treatment or post-treatment breast cancer biopsies. Overall, our results demonstrate that accurate imputation is possible for many proteins, that spatial information significantly improves imputation results, and that imputed protein values are useful in a biological application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study cohort and analysis overview</title><p id="Par6">The multiplexed tissue imaging single-cell datasets used in this study were generated using a 20-plex t-CyCIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> assay&#x000a0;applied to a cohort of hormone receptor-positive (HR&#x02009;+&#x02009;), HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer biopsies. t-CyCIF is a unique multiplexed tissue imaging assay that has been shown to provide robust and repeatable quantifications of protein concentrations across a range of biological samples. The tissue biopsies and datasets are part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot Human Tumor Atlas Network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and have detailed associated clinical metadata. Our dataset includes a total of eight biopsies derived from four patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) that received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, which is a common combination therapy in metastatic HR+ breast cancer.

Each row in the table is a single cell identified in the image, and the table columns are the protein abundance levels calculated via mean pixel intensity per cell. In total, 475,359 single cells were identified across all biopsies, with an average of 59,400 cells per biopsy. To perform in-patient evaluation, either the pre-treatment or the post-treatment biopsy was used for training a machine learning model while the remaining biopsies were used for testing model performance. Biopsy timing was not used in this study. In total, 16 proteins were shared between all biopsies, including eight proteins for identifying cell types (lineage proteins) and eight proteins for characterizing cellular functional states (functional proteins) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of proteins assayed using t-CyCIF and their use as functional or lineage proteins</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Lineage Protein</th><th>Functional Protein</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CD45</td><td>Ki67</td></tr><tr><td>&#x003b1;SMA</td><td>pERK</td></tr><tr><td>eCadherin</td><td>PR</td></tr><tr><td>CK19</td><td>EGFR</td></tr><tr><td>CK14</td><td>p21</td></tr><tr><td>CK17</td><td>pRB</td></tr><tr><td>CK7</td><td>AR</td></tr><tr><td>Vimentin</td><td>HER2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Lineage proteins are used to identify cell types whereas functional proteins are used to characterize cell function.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par8">The imputation task in this study was to predict protein abundance levels for a withheld protein or set of proteins. Preprocessing was performed to remove all columns from the datasets except protein intensities, followed by a min-max scaling approach, which maps values between zero and one. Thus, model error is in the range [0,1] where lower error represents better performance. For each machine learning experiment, one or more proteins were withheld and used as the target variable(s) for the predictive model, and the remaining protein abundances were used as input features for the model. This task simulates the key application for imputation in MTI: computationally inferring proteins not originally included in an MTI assay or inferring protein levels where the assay failed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Three machine learning methods were used for imputation: elastic-net (EN) regularized linear regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and neural network autoencoders (AE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">These algorithms offer different advantages for addressing the complexities of our dataset and research objectives. Elastic Net (EN) is a linear model that effectively handles high-dimensional data like that in our MTI datasets by using regularization to manage multicollinearity and predict protein&#x000a0;levels. However, EN requires a separate model to predict each protein, and this is time-consuming. Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LGBM) use a non-linear approach for developing predictive models and are amongst the most efficient and best performing methods for tabular data like our MTI datasets. Like EN, LGBM also requires a model for each protein. Autoencoders (AEs) can learn non-linear relationships, reduce dimensionality, and denoise data, allowing a single model to impute multiple proteins at once, although their compression techniques may lead to some loss of precision. Autoencoders were chosen for this study due to their ability to reduce dimensionality and denoise data while preserving essential information. This helps in data imputation and improving data quality before further analysis. EN and LGBM are straightforward to implement and handle linear and non-linear relationships, respectively, while AEs provide efficient preprocessing and multi-protein imputation.</p><p id="Par10">Imputation model training and evaluation were conducted using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In this methodology, each patient was considered a single data point, whereby a model was trained on all biopsies except those from one patient. Subsequently, the model&#x02019;s performance was assessed using the biopsies from the patient excluded during training. This LOOCV approach was chosen to prevent data leakage from biopsies associated with the same patient as the test biopsy, thereby closely approximating real-world application scenarios. Model performance was calculated by averaging the mean absolute error (MAE) scores across all runs of the model on a particular train-test dataset split. Statistical evaluations were carried out using the Mann-Whitney U test, and multiple hypothesis tests were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Protein abundance imputation with elastic net and light gradient-boosting machines</title><p id="Par11">To establish baseline performance of our imputation models, we conducted a test using mean imputation, where values were imputed by using the mean protein abundance value in the training dataset. Using mean values for imputation serves as a null or baseline model to determine if a machine learning model provides genuine improvements over a simple heuristic. The EN model outperformed the null model by an average of 0.078 MAE indicating that the EN model demonstrated superior performance compared to the null model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This performance difference was statistically significant, with an average adjusted p-value less than 0.0001 for all proteins. Proteins CK17 and Ki67 were most accurately imputed with MAE of 0.05. Proteins for which the imputation MAE exceeded 0.2 included CK19, ER, CK14, and PR.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Imputation results for null model and elastic net and Light GBM machine learning models across patients.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Imputation results for all proteins demonstrate improved mean absolute error (MAE) by using Elastic Net (EN) compared to a null model. <bold>b</bold> Imputation results using EN &#x00026; Light GBM (LGBM) show low MAE for imputation for 12 out of 16 available proteins. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Visualization of in situ protein expression, ground-truth single-cell abundance from the image processing pipeline, and imputed single-cell abundance for proteins Vimentin and PR.

Like the EN, LGBM performance for the same 12 of 16 proteins was between 0.05 and 0.20 MAE. LGBM imputation accuracies for CK19 and ER are like the EN and greater than 0.2 MAE. Overall, LGBM displayed more accurate imputation results than EN (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) both in terms of mean and standard deviation. To provide a comprehensive overview of performance, a <italic>mean of all proteins</italic> column is included to show the average imputation accuracy across all proteins for each model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). While using LGBM improved imputation accuracy compared to the EN, some proteins still exhibit a high MAE, such as CK19 and ER. These proteins exhibited high variance (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), presenting a significant challenge for accurate imputation. Supplementary Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows protein abundance distributions of selected proteins with especially high or low variance to illustrate why imputation is difficult for proteins such as CK19 and ER that exhibit high variance. To further evaluate imputation performance, we calculated the single-cell level correlation between ground truth and imputed protein expression. Correlation ranged from 0.4 (CK19, PR) and 0.8 (EGFR) with an average of 0.56 indicating moderate to strong alignment of the imputed data with the ground truth data (Supplementary Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Mean and standard deviation of performance for EN, LGBM and AE</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>EN</th><th>LGBM</th><th>AE Single</th><th>AE Multi</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mean (Std)</td><td>0.11 (0.07)</td><td>0.10 (0.06)</td><td>0.13 (0.09)</td><td>0.13 (0.09)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par13">We also evaluated imputation accuracy within patients by modifying the LOOCV approach described above. The modified within-patients LOOCV approach included one biopsy from each patient in the training dataset and used the remaining biopsy from the same patient for testing. Surprisingly, imputation accuracy in the across-patient LOOCV approach was higher than imputation accuracy in the within patients for some proteins (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We hypothesize that this performance difference may be attributable to the more diverse training dataset in the across-patient approach. This diverse training dataset may enable imputation models to better handle heterogeneity across patients.</p><p id="Par14">We further assessed imputation performance using additional metrics. Side-by-side visualization of in situ imaging from the original assay, the ground truth single-cell protein abundance values calculated via image processing, and the imputed data show the same tissue structural patterns in all three modalities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This visual alignment of tissue structure demonstrates that the imputed data preserves the biological structure present in the raw images and the ground truth single-cell data. The adjusted rand index (ARI) and silhouette scores were also calculated using ground-truth and imputed single-cell protein expression values. ARI measures agreement between two clustering results, with a minimum of zero for no clustering agreement and one for perfect agreement. ARI values between ground truth and imputed data range from 0.6 to 0.77 with an average of 0.69, indicating strong cluster agreement between ground truth and imputed protein expression values (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

To assess the consistency of phenotype predictions based on imputed data, we computed the Jaccard score between predicted phenotypes derived from ground truth data and those obtained using imputed protein values.

The goal of an AE is to perform information-preserving dimensionality reduction of its input to the latent space so that it can then accurately reconstruct the input from the latent representation. AEs have been successfully used for imputation in various biological domains, including single-cell RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, genomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Unlike LGBM and EN models, AEs can impute multiple features simultaneously due to their ability to fully reconstruct the entire input data. Leveraging this capability, we conducted both single-protein and multi-protein imputation experiments based on the order of protein assays during t-CyCIF&#x02019;s multiple imaging rounds. T-CyCIF involves multiple rounds to stain, incubate, and capture images. Proteins were sequentially removed from each round, and the AE was trained and evaluated for each set of proteins. Initially, proteins from the first round were removed, and the AE was trained and evaluated. This process was then repeated for all proteins in the second round, and so on. To maintain simplicity, no other pairings of proteins were made beyond the rounds.</p><p id="Par17">The AE was trained using biopsies from three patients, including both pre- and post-treatment samples, with biopsies from a fourth patient reserved for validation. Aggregating all biopsy data allowed the AE to develop an internal representation focused on minimizing reconstruction error. During the imputation phase, we initially replaced the target protein&#x02019;s values with the mean expression levels across the dataset. The modified dataset was processed through the AE, which performed continuous cycles of encoding and decoding to iteratively refine the imputed values. For each cycle, the AE replaced the ground truth protein values with the decoded data from the previous cycle. This iterative process was repeated 10 times, as each protein required a different number of optimal iterations for accurate imputation. We used the mean expression from iterations five to ten as the final imputed value (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Autoencoder imputation results and performance comparison between machine learning models.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The autoencoder (AE) is trained and then uses an iterative approach to impute single or multiple proteins.

For each iteration, a biopsy was designated as the test set, while the remaining biopsies, excluding those from the same patient, were used for training the models. We then compared classification accuracy using the ground truth protein abundance data, a control dataset with a protein&#x02019;s values removed, and an imputed dataset where a single protein&#x02019;s expression was replaced with imputed values. Imputation was performed using the LGBM model because it was highly accurate in prior analyses. No spatial data was used in the imputation model for simplicity and so that a comparison between ground truth and imputed data was straightforward.</p><p id="Par27">Overall, classification accuracy from models using imputed data met or exceeded accuracy from models using ground truth data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). On average classification accuracy was 8.93% higher using imputed data compared to ground truth data. We hypothesize that improved classification accuracy using imputed data is the result of noise removal in the imputed data compared to the ground truth data. With less noise, the imputed data led to better performance on the prediction task. Reducing noise not only enhances data quality but also complements the potential effects of upsampling via imputation. Upsampling&#x02014;amplification of meaningful patterns in the data&#x02014;has been observed in imputation applications previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Classification accuracy using the control datasets with a protein&#x02019;s values removed were mixed. For ten proteins, removing their values led to equal or reduced accuracy, but accuracy slightly increased when removing six proteins. When removing a protein increases a model&#x02019;s accuracy, this suggests that the protein is introducing noise to the predictions and possibly harming the classifiers&#x02019; ability to accurately classify cells. Accuracy of the control models provides additional evidence that the imputation process may be removing noise from the ground truth data, which in turn may help explain higher classification accuracy with imputed data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">In this study, we utilized machine learning models to accurately impute single-cell protein abundance levels in breast cancer tissue using datasets obtained from the t-CyCIF multiplexed tissue imaging (MTI) assay. Our datasets comprised eight biopsies from a cohort of four metastatic breast cancer patients, facilitating the training and evaluation of these models. Within a range of [0,1], the imputation performance for most proteins exhibited a mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.05 and 0.15. However, proteins with high variance in our cohort, such as CK19 and ER, were more challenging to impute, with MAE ranging from 0.15 to 0.35. Additional evaluation approaches&#x02014;in-situ visualization, adjusted rand index (ARI), and silhouette scores&#x02014;also provide evidence that the imputed values are highly comparable to ground truth data. Further, a single-cell phenotyping analysis showed that phenotypes called via imputed and ground truth data are very similar. These results demonstrate that imputed data maintains key information needed for biological applications.</p><p id="Par29">The LGBM model, a gradient-boosted regression tree approach, showed modestly better accuracy than an Elastic Net (EN) model or a deep learning autoencoder (AE). Incorporating spatial features into the models, represented by neighboring cells&#x02019; protein abundance levels, enhanced their accuracy and reduced the average MAE by 0.02. This improvement was particularly significant for proteins with high variance that were otherwise difficult to impute. This use of spatial information complements recent research indicating that cell communication may vary and requires careful evaluation using multiple cellular neighborhoods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Our results are concordant with this observation as they show a similar pattern of improved protein performance using a diverse set of radii.</p><p id="Par30">While the LGBM shows the overall best performance, there are tradeoffs to consider when choosing a machine learning model for single-cell protein abundance imputation in MTI datasets. Traditional ML models such as LGBM and EN can only impute one protein per model, which requires training and storing a model for each protein to be imputed. Using a single model for each protein is time and cost inefficient. In contrast, an AE can impute multiple proteins at once and even all proteins included in their training data, requiring only a single training session and model. While AEs perform marginally worse than LGBM and EN for protein imputation, their capability for multi-protein imputation offers an advantage in reduced training time and cost. Multi-protein imputation, as opposed to sequential imputation, also models inter-protein relationships, and potentially yields more biologically pertinent relationships to explore.</p><p id="Par31">We have demonstrated robust performance of our imputation methods and biological significance of imputed values. Using an independent MTI dataset from a cohort of 26 breast cancers that included all major subtypes of the disease, our imputation methods showed similar performance to that in our primary cohort. Imputation results across these datasets suggest that our machine learning methods are versatile and can potentially be used in other MTI datasets.</p><p id="Par32">To demonstrate the biological significance of our imputed protein abundance data, classification models were built with the imputed data and used to predict whether individual cells originated from pre-treatment or post-treatment biopsies. Accuracy of these models was high, indicating that single cells can often be classified as associated with a particular disease state. This aligns with previous results that similarly show how single cells can be classified based on disease or treatment state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.&#x000a0;Surprisingly, using imputed data improved classification accuracy compared to using ground truth data. Results from classification models using ground truth data or control data with a protein removed suggest that imputed data may be denoising the ground truth data and leading to improved accuracy. This denoising may reduce errors in the data obtained from the multiplex tissue imaging assay or the primary image analysis workflow used to generate the ground truth data. It is also possible that imputation is enhancing patterns in the ground truth data via upsampling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and this upsampling via imputation is leading to improved classification accuracy using the imputed data.</p><p id="Par33">Limitations of this work include a focus on protein abundance rather than RNA expression, the small number of proteins used for imputation, the cohort composition of metastatic breast cancers, and the small sample size. These analyses demonstrate that it is possible to impute protein abundance in MTI, but imputation of RNA expression has not been explored. This analysis used the sixteen proteins that were shared amongst all biopsies, and it is uncertain if other proteins can be imputed as accurately as these sixteen. This analysis also focused on breast cancer biopsies and diseased tissue, and imputation results may be different in healthy tissue or in other diseases. A study like ours would benefit from using a larger and more diverse cohort and from different MTI assays with more proteins. Different and larger datasets would help establish the robustness and generalizability of our imputation methods.</p><p id="Par34">In summary, this study demonstrates that machine learning can effectively impute biologically meaningful single-cell protein abundance levels using MTI datasets. Our results provide a foundation for future applications of machine-learning imputed data in single-cell MTI datasets. One potential application is imputation of additional single-cell and cellular neighborhood features, which can in turn aid in understanding tissue ecosystems. Another future application is the use of imputed datasets to predict biomedical outcomes such as tissue response to perturbations or, in the case of disease, response to therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethical statement</title><p id="Par35">All biospecimens, data, and consent to use patient samples in research studies were collected under the single-center, observational study Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Evolution and Resistance to Therapy (IRB#16113).
