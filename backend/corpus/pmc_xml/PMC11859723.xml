Regular polygons inscribed in circles model balanced areas of survival of various numbers of new species in one genus. This model maximizes the peripatric survival of descendant species, with populations partly in allopatric habitats and in sympatric areas. It extends the theory advanced with Willis&#x02019;s Age and Area hypothesis. Hollow curves of the areas bounded between a series of inscribed regular polygons and their containing circles show a ranked progression governed by similar power laws of other phenomena, including Zipf&#x02019;s law and a universal meta-law in physics. This model matches best the physics meta-law (law of laws) but is only one of several somewhat different curves generated by somewhat different processes. A rule of four can explain why most genera in vascular plants exhibit a hollow curve of optimally one to five species per genus. It implies a constraint on variation that enhances survival and provides a physics explanation for the monophyletic skeleton of macrogenera. A high-resolution form of ancestor&#x02013;descendant analysis is compared to traditional phylogenetic analysis to best modeling of the demonstrable results of evolutionary processes.

Introduction</title><p>The intent of this study is to investigate the fundamental reason why graphing species per genus and general per family always produce much the same hollow curve (&#x0201c;a power law&#x0201d;). This universal feature is connected with the observation that there are about five species in every minimally monophyletic group of one ancestral species and four immediate descendant species; while, in addition, robust species are generally limited to about four new traits per speciation event, leading to a generalized &#x0201c;rule of four&#x0201d;. This is a new science, and for important possibly unfamiliar terminology, see Glossary.</p><p>There are three methods of generating an evolution-based classification in the context of at least some fossil evidence: (1) <italic toggle="yes">Evolutionary taxonomy</italic>, which is the so-called &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; or standard, classical approach (often deprecated [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). This method works with morphological data (where &#x0201c;morphology&#x0201d; includes all expressed traits) grouping species by overall similarity but emphasizing conservative traits, not neglecting homology assessment, and recognizing gaps between clusters of taxa as important. The product is a multi-chotomously branching cactus-like diagram or a dendrogram hybrid with inferred ancestral taxa at nodes ([<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], p. 97). It generates hierarchic phyletic keys and supra-specific taxa of various sizes. Statistics are little used in practice. (2) <italic toggle="yes">Cladistics</italic> emphasizes &#x0201c;common ancestry&#x0201d;. It is a 50-year-old technology that recognizes groups based on shared trait changes of groups of species in a cluster analysis summarized by a dichotomous tree with all species (as operational taxonomic units) terminal on the branches. The product is commonly a rather large monophyletic supra-specific group of species as pattern clades named with standard classical nomenclature. Taxa in the evolutionary taxonomy sense are not recognized as such. Statistical support of molecular taxonomy is of first-order Markov chains in Bayesian analysis with flat priors. (3) <italic toggle="yes">High-resolution phylogenetics</italic> is a new science (see Glossary), in previous papers under the name macroevolutionary systematics, that preserves the achievements of evolutionary taxonomy (taxa) leveraged with modern methods of numerical taxonomy (Shannon information) and produces monophyletic evolutionary trees, in which ancestral species inferred from both morphology and molecular data match, and is supported by Turing sequential Bayesian analysis with informative conjugate priors. It uses descent with modification for recognizing minimum monophyletic groups as genera of one ancestral species and a few descendants, with ancestral species strung together to form a multichotomous diagram of bursts of speciation as a detailed monophyletic evolutionary skeleton. The method is a superset of cladistic methodology, but multichotomous trees replace cladograms, data come from both morphology and molecular &#x0201c;ancestral signatures&#x0201d;, and cladistically paraphyletic taxa are assigned to the nodes as inferred ancestors.</p><p>The main actor in high-resolution phylogenetics is the minimally monophyletic group, or microgenus, in previous papers, equally descriptive, called a monothetic genus. This is considered to have an essential role in preserving the resilience of a lineage across millions of years [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and characteristically has one ancestor and usually one to four immediate descendant species. Why is four optimal? Willis [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] wrote a challenging analysis of consistency in the skewed distribution of data on the frequency of species in variously sized areas and numbers of species in a genus. The same distribution was evident in a large number of data sets and was a hollow curve with small numbers well-represented and large numbers trailing off asymptotically. He correlated this curve with the apparent age of a taxon and its area of distribution. His conclusions were discussed and to some extent challenged by reviewers of his book. Chamberlain [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], for instance, pointed out that the distributions, with an &#x0201c;enormous preponderance of small genera&#x0201d;, were clearly exponential or power law ([<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], p. 362) in origin (using other terms). Gleason [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] pointed out that simple geographic distribution extensions over time comprised only a partial explanation of the phenomena. Watkins [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] advised that the Yule birth&#x02013;death distribution seems adequate to account for the exponential curves and pointed out that the &#x0201c;ordinary difficulty of the systematist&#x0201d; was where to draw the line between genera. Pearson [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] advanced support for natural selection as a major factor. Ricklefs [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] has summarized the controversy. The present paper offers new science that may better explain the commonality of hollow curves in taxonomy, biogeography, and other fields, combining a geometric model with newly developed rules for species generation.</p><p>Since reading about Vavillov&#x02019;s Rule of Homologous Variation, in which characteristic forms of within-species variability (&#x0201c;remarkable parallel&#x0201d;) may be expected in other species [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], inference of general laws reflecting deeply hidden processes in nature has been a lifelong pursuit. Here, two widely applicable generalities that help regularize apprehension of evolutionary patterns are summarized: the rule of four establishing descendant species that are soap-like partially soluble sympatric to their ancestral species and also partially soluble to new allopatric habitats, and a geometric interpretation of balanced peripatric speciation obeying a Zipf-like [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], ([<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] p. 403) rule of rank progression limiting competition to one to four immediate descendant species. These generate ancestor&#x02013;descendant trees that are strongly supported by calculations with morphological data on a multichotomous second-order Markov chain, using Turing&#x02013;Shannon sequential Bayes as statistical support [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>There have been many attempts to define a genus, classically by its &#x0201c;naturalness&#x0201d; or discontinuities [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The genus is here defined as the minimally monophyletic group (MMG), consisting of one ancestral species and a few (mostly one to four) immediate descendant species, and further characterized by the most recent set of evolved morphological traits being duplicated in each immediate descendant species, and the number of new traits in both ancestor and descendant is also optimally about four. It is somewhat like the phylogenetic species concept, which is the smallest group that shares a distinctive evolutionary history and also differs from other groups [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but the MMG or microgenus has fractal features of self-similarity in numbers of descendants and traits across scales [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>High-resolution phylogenetics is a modern extension of numerical taxonomy (also known as computational systematics, or automatic classification) in using mathematics and statistics to investigate evolutionary relationships. Cladistic parsimony is replaced by maximizing Shannon entropy, i.e., a decrease in uncertainty [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while data sets are reduced to that for minimal monophyly, which minimizes trait convergence across taxa. Evolutionary skeletons are resolvable within larger monophyletic units by linking ancestral to ancestral species of small, minimally monophyletic genera. Second-order Markov chains together with sequential Shannon&#x02013;Turing Bayesian analysis provide strong statistical support. Several recent publications describe and justify this new concept in detail [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This concept lends directly to a definition of species as &#x0201c;any reasonable definition of a species that lends itself to conceptual participation in the evolutionary mechanics of minimally monophyletic groups&#x0201d;.</p><p>Investigation of fractal evolution [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that morphology-based microgenera follow a complexity-related &#x0201c;rule of four&#x0201d; in which there are optimally four descendant species per ancestor and four newly evolved traits per species. Most genera are composed of one to five species, which is demonstrated by the graphs in <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. The term &#x0201c;rule of four&#x0201d; comes from a study in inorganic chemistry [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which found that many compounds were composed of four basic chemical units. Why four? The chemists were puzzled but asserted the reality of this feature.</p><p>The organic evolutionary context is that among ca. 26 microgenera studied [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the optimal number of immediate descendants of any ancestral species is four, and the number of traits in the novon (the new traits of each descendant species) is four (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). There is variation due to extinction and simple chance, but most numbers of descendant species range from four to zero depending on the genus studied. The older the genus, the fewer there are species in the genus [<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], although ancestral species are not particularly more vulnerable to extinction than their descendants.</p><p>A previous morphological study of 26 microgenera [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in the moss families Pottiaceae and Streptotrichaceae found that the average number of new traits in each of the 82 species was 3.44, with a range from 8.00 to 2.00 average per species depending on the genus. The distribution (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) is largely ca. 4 new traits per species, with a few species showing an average of 5 to 8 new traits, and a larger number tapering off to 2, which is the smallest allowed to distinguish a species. This may be interpreted evolutionarily as a few genera experimenting with a large range of species, and the remainder gradually eroding with continuing extinction. The figures also demonstrate that the number of species in a genus (the jagged solid thin line) does not affect the average number of traits per species.</p><p>There is also evidence of a rule of four in molecular systematics data. A study [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] of several published papers by various authors on molecular systematics of the Pottiaceae found 71 entries of molecularly multiracial species including 46 different species. The number of molecular races among the 46 multiracial species was 208. The average number of molecular races for the 46 species (i.e., the number of internal nodes interpreted as signaling different sequences) was 4.5 for both paraphyletic and non-paraphyletic species. The total number of paraphyletic instances (molecular races that are also paraphyletic) among the 71 entries was 29. The number of paraphyletic species was 22 or 0.4 of the 46 multiracial species. The number of different apophyletic species (those distal to a paraphyly) in all sequences was 79. The average number of apophyletic species per paraphyly was 3.6. A total of 133 nodes were maximally distant (on the cladogram) between paraphyletic exemplars. The average number of nodes between most-distant paraphyletic exemplars of the same species was 4.5 (133/29). This suggests that molecular variants of ancestral species together generate 3.6 to 4.5 descendant, apophyletic species (including secondary ancestry).</p><p>A geometric model of radiative evolution might provide an explanation. Area-related explanations for budding evolution have been provided for the peripatric origin and isolation of new species [<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The relevant and instructive new analogy is soap, a surfactant molecule that is soluble in water at one, ionic end, and in oil at the other, non-ionic end. A species consists of about four traits contributed from the new traits of the ancestral species plus about four traits newly evolved from old and perhaps useless traits of the ancestor. The new traits explore survival opportunities allopatrically and the old traits ensure a toehold sympatric with the ancestral species. Here, sympatry is any co-existence in habitat or geographic distribution, not necessarily at the same time. Peripatry is the peripheral area between the occurrence of the generative species and allopatric habitats. Competition has been shown among peripatric species of insects [<xref rid="B27-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and mammals [<xref rid="B28-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The question is as follows: How many descendant species can this peripatry hold, given mutualism and competition?</p><p>Paraphyly means ancestral, and paraphyly is essential information for investigating descent with modification. Paraphyly does not mean &#x0201c;not monophyletic&#x0201d; contra Nordal and Stedje [<xref rid="B29-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; it in fact is good evidence for descent with modification. What is descending? The apophyletic taxon of the same rank (species, genus, family). Previous work in NK analysis with a random Boolean model [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that the fractal nature of species studied (26 bryophyte genera in two families) increased the tolerance of species to competitive interactions, particularly between descendants. It was found that about half the species studied were easily modeled as direct ancestors of other species. Reiseberg and Brouillet [<xref rid="B30-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] estimated that at least 50% of all plant species are generated through local geographic speciation and are therefore paraphyletic. Funk and Omland [<xref rid="B31-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found undeniable species-level paraphyly or polyphyly in 23% of more than 2000 species sampled. According to Aldous et al. ([<xref rid="B32-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], p. 322), about 63% of extant species have still living ancestors. Frey [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] suggested that paraphyletic scenarios are common or even the rule, while Gurushidze [<xref rid="B34-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] supported the idea that pseudoextinction (disappearance of a progenitor taxon after generation of daughter taxa) is rare.</p><p>In the previous morphological study of 26 microgenera, each of the optimally four immediate descendant species was given the ca. four newest traits of their ancestral species, while developing optimally four new traits as modifications of older, apparently less useful ancestral traits. The model of five total species resulting from one ancestral species generating four additional species could be described with the fractal dimension of 1.16, or log 5/log 4, matching the Pareto distribution of 80:20, or 80% of the total generated by 20% of the source. Because descendant species were partly composed, probably by natural selection, of a modicum of the newest traits of the ancestor, it was suggested [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that competition when entering new habitats was much lessened in the new species, a conclusion supported by NK/random Boolean modeling. This paper examines a possible geometric causal explanation for this instance of an evolutionary rule of four.</p><p>Geometric modeling offers a possible method for the retention of successful adaptive traits by botanical genera and families across the 66 million years of modern flora as suggested by Zander [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-00530"><title>2.

Model 1</title><p>Zander [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied 26 genera each consisting of one ancestral species and a few immediate descendants, with occasional secondary ancestry (a descendant generating another descendant). These were termed microgenera, being minimally monophyletic units comprising larger monophyletic groups, and taxonomically treated at the genus level. The 26 microgenera were ordered in numbers of species and of newly evolved traits (the set called the novon) and graphed (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, there is a step-wise fall-off of numbers of species, with three genera having more than five species (one ancestor and four descendants), but the remainder reflecting a possible effect of gradual extinction. Compressing the graphs of graphs laterally would produce a vaguely hollow curve, but the numbers of species and traits are so few as to disguise this. A horizontal line across the y-axis demonstrates that most microgenera have five or fewer species. Genera with fewer than five species may be due to extinction (the older species) or relative recency (the younger species), but the latter is less probable given an apparent burst style of speciation.</p><p><xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B graphs the average number of newly evolved traits (the set is the novon) per species per microgenus in the same 26 microgenera. The traits are ranked in descendant numbers. Some microgenera have many average traits per species, while the majority have four or fewer average traits per species per genus. The graph slopes off gradually, such that the average number of traits per species is probably random but simply largely limited to four or fewer. The x-axis has a different order of microgenera than in <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, and the dotted line demonstrates that the size of the microgenera in a number of species is not correlated with the average number of traits per species.</p><p>The dashed lines in <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A,B are trendline regression curves fitted with the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

Model 2</title><p>The results of Model 1 were compared to previous graphing of the numbers of species per genus in larger groups of organisms. These groups were of classical taxonomic generation, and were not devised as microgenera, but clearly show a large mass of genera with only one to five species; thus, most genera are potentially minimally monophyletic groups. The graph of vascular plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) from Stevens [<xref rid="B36-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] shows a distinctive hollow curve, artificially cut off at 30 species, while that of the angiosperm genera (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) is more recent [<xref rid="B37-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the log x-axis shows an asymptotic weight of very large genera that are surely not microgenera and are caused in part by cladistic lumping of minimally monophyletic genera into much larger genera. The graph of the reptiles (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C) from Fran&#x000e7;ois [<xref rid="B38-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] shows a hollow curve identical to that of the vascular plants. It is clear that further analysis of minimally monophyletic groups has the potential for clarifying internal features of ancestor&#x02013;descent and trait evolution and for potentially reducing the size of massive macrogenera represented in <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-14-00530"><title>2.3. Model 3</title><p>Peripatric speciation was modeled with regular polygons (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) inscribed in circles (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), with the area outside the polygon modeling, by analogy, newly evolved species with minimum conflict between each other. The peripatric descendant genera survive through partial adaptation to allopatric habitats while retaining adaptions to sympatric ancestral areas. This is theoretically due to retaining the most recent morphological traits of the ancestral species to balance about equal numbers of new traits.

Speciation is modeled over time such that crowding through competition and/or the predictable decoherence of a system starved of energy by saturation leads to allopatric dispersal at about the four-sided model. The system is an evolutionary entity at a taxonomic rank higher than the species whose functionality arises from the mutuality of the ancestor&#x02013;descendant relationship acting as a robust, flexible competitive agent through time. In the generation of one descendant (D1), the model assumes rapid advance to two descendants, then to three and four. This model punctuates equilibrium in extant species and focuses on immediate descendant species. Each descendant species may eventually have one or more further descendants after establishment allopatrically. The definition of a genus as a minimally monophyletic group consisting of one ancestral species and a few descendant species sharing the same newest ancestral traits is an exact definition but constituents vary with extinction and secondary ancestry. Of course, there are immediate descendant species with species of their own, and these may be assigned a different genus name if the fundamental feature of evolution, the elements involved in sharing the ancestral novon with the descendant species, is clearly changed, and there are indications of extant punctuated equilibrium (multiple descendants).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-plants-14-00530"><title>2.5.

Hamming Code error correction commonly requires 1/7 of the total bits to be redundant. The redundancy of fractal microgenera is massive, with every immediate descendant carrying the most recently gained traits of the ancestral species. The error correction is most likely natural selection, through balancing selection plus extinction and replacement. For descendant species established allopatrically, redundancy becomes mutualism as novon traits of species sharing an environmental niche mesh ([<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], pp. 118 and 121) to form another redundancy-supported group, the realized niche.

Numbers with many numerals, including decimal fractions like pi or the square root of two, are unique and associated with particular processes in nature. As noted above in the discussion of balancing radiation, small whole numbers appear to be generated by a number of hidden processes that entail crowding or isolation.

The plausible evolutionary clustering of taxa on a cladogram is because evolution is such a powerful force that cluster analysis by any reasonable criterion results in plausible and apparently informative groupings. It is the fact that an enforced dichotomous tree cannot exhibit the distinctive patterns of taxa that the classification principle of holophyly is used to synonymize otherwise distinctive taxa into massive groups that are monophyletic in toto.

This model of balancing radiation provides a causal explanation for the fractal nature of evolution, where four products are added to the generator to obtain the ratio 5:4, or a fractal dimension of 1.16 (log 5 divided by log 4), equivalent to the well-known Pareto distribution of 80:20.</p><p>This is the model with balanced distribution around a circle, but what about the periphery of a sphere? Externally, only two regular polygons can completely cover a sphere, viz. triangles and squares. Any genus then may generate very few descendant species that balance each other in mutualism and competition. The above formulae do not involve squares (or cubes) and seem sufficient, however, to describe the effects of evolutionary processes in nature. Pentagons and regular polygons of more sides require additional, different polygons to completely cover a sphere. Penrose tilings can cover a sphere in an approximate manner, but the areas of the two main tiles continue to approach the Golden Ratio of 1.618; that is, they remain unequal.</p><p>One might note that the soap analogy (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) of new species in a balance of about half sympatric and half allopatric might apply to the realized niche, that is, the actual species in the somewhat slippery concept of a niche. The first colonizing species determines the nature of the survival traits and subsequent colonizers of different species match up their newly evolved traits while competing peripherally with geometric limitations on the competition for size of survival areas. This assumes all species involved are about as similar as the descendant species of one ancestral species; that is, a shrub is not part of a geometrically affected realized niche of several mosses. No data are as yet available for this analogic hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-plants-14-00530"><title>3.5. Sheaves of Hollow Curves</title><p>Numbers associated with statistics can be confusing. For an unimodal binary distribution (a bell-shaped curve), 30 samples are commonly considered sufficient to characterize that curve at 0.95 probability. This is because 95/100 is equivalent to 19/20, and information about the 1/19 of the distribution may be had with confidence if the numbers of samples were increased half-again from 20 to 30. This gives confidence in the known variability of the species.</p><p>A Shannon information bit represents halving the uncertainty. Each decision of which direction a trait has changed in evolution (i.e., as information about which species is ancestor and which is descendant) is assigned one Shannon informational bit.

The upshot is that four descendant species, each with four new traits, have an excellent chance of efficiently addressing most of the contiguous allopatric habitat with adaptive traits. More descendant species and more new traits per speciation event may be superfluous and a burden on available survival-critical biomass and energy. Speculative? No. Empirical evidence for this explanation is present in the hollow curves of species per genus (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) that are theoretically due to natural selection, while the worked-out evolutionary skeletons are solidly articulated at the nodes. More work at this level is, of course, called for.</p><p>The empirical distribution of the evolutionary rule of four (four new descendants, four new traits) may be interpreted as the dispersal of information. For a point source or stationary circle, measures of increases in information will involve unitary or fractional exponents. When a radius is increased, the circle enlarges and creates new information as a numeric square. The circumference of a circle inscribed or generated on a spherical surface increases with the radius halfway around, then decreases to a point on the other side. A saddle-shaped surface with frilly edges has the circumference increasing more rapidly as the radius increases. Areas associated with the periphery of the circumference increase with the square. Additional factors that affect the rate and interspersal of peripatric generation and competition of descendant species include fragmentation by continents and islands, differential extinction, and serial compression by global glaciations. The devil is in the biasing context as we create information on geometric models as practical data sets relevant to the analysis of natural processes. The rule of four signal seems to come through, however, both in the small (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and in the large (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Using trendlines in MS Excel allowed the characterization of the curves in <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The curve for Zipf&#x02019;s law is clearly a power rule, matching the Excel trendline for power. The other hollow curves are exponential for higher values on the <italic toggle="yes">y</italic>-axis with values near one but follow a power law in the tail, which together is apparently common in empirically derived curves found by &#x0201c;best fit&#x0201d;.</p><p>The close association of the hollow curves in <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> may be interpreted in different ways. The curves could be each an approximation of a single basic curve that rules them all, or they could be each valid and accurate descriptions of the results of several closely related processes in nature. The second explanation is attractive and fits the modern recognition that there may be different but equally valid explanations for similar natural phenomena. This is why one searches for a best-fitting curve rather than some obvious single solution. The hollow curves are integrated summaries of how the rule of four has constrained minimally monophyletic units over 88 million years of biogeographical modification of the modern flora. Certainly, there are different rules for observed features of the quantum microcosm, Newtonian mesocosm, and Einsteinian macrocosm, while wave and particle observations are problematically explained as a single process, and the Theory of Everything remains obdurately hidden.</p><p>It is suggested that if there is a single formula that explains evolutionary information adequately, it will involve wrinkles in informational space-time. By this, the author means that the informational context affects the description of the results of the process in nature. Just as inscribing a circle on a sphere or on a negatively curved surface (a saddle) must modify the exponent (assuming no change in the constant &#x003c0;), the geometric models may suffer from the confounding effects of inconstant reality. For this reason, it is suggested that the sheaf of curves in <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> reflects a conclusion that evolution is quasi-Zipfian and describable only with Zipf-similar formulae, including the meta-law formula of Constantin et al. [<xref rid="B42-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Power law and exponential descriptions of the results of processes in nature may be traced to one feature, the dispersal of created information with increasing radius from the center. Speciation is a perfect example of the creation of information around the periphery of an originating source, with increasing information, to get an exponent of minus one if information increases with no increase in radius, 2 if area, 3 if volume, 4 if an additional dimension is considered. All variables that are needed to give the best fit to the data reflect the different contexts in nature or wrinkles in informational space-time. The several hollow curves, both exponential and power law (depending on Excel trendline matches), are the informational bones of the skeleton of evolution, and all explain or at least reflect, variously, the rule of four in speciation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-plants-14-00530"><title>3.6.

Methods of Evolutionary Analysis and Classification</title><p>Critiques of scientific methods are generally ineffective unless an alternative, better method is offered. Such an alternative, macroevolutionary systematics, has been described in detail in several previous publications. It is a new science but, like traditional cladistics, is based on numerical taxonomy. Essentially, it is high-resolution phylogenetics. Phylogenetics may be defined as studying the evolutionary relationships of organisms with numerical techniques, particularly of statistical support for dendrogram branches, reflecting its origin in computational systematics. Cladistics is the classification of organisms by shared derived traits, implying common ancestry of clusters. Phylogenetics is commonly identified with cladistics; however, there are other methods of inferring evolutionary relationships in a computational context. High-resolution phylogenetics infers relationships of organisms by ancestor&#x02013;descendant trait changes between species, emphasizing descent with modification and focusing on connections between minimally monophyletic groups.</p><p>The protocol, in short, is as follows: Morpho-species are segregated into small, closely related groups using any standard hierarchical method, limiting the relative data sets so as to minimize the effect of convergent traits. Genera are identified as (1) minimally monophyletic groups with one ancestral species that is most similar to the outgroup and also least generalist among the ingroup; (2) the newest traits of the ancestral species are found reproduced in each of the descendant species; (3) there are usually up to four immediate descendant species in each genus and about four new traits in each species; and (4) a maximally parsimonious (maximum informational entropy) dendrogram is produced, which is a multichotomous tree with extant or inferred ancestral species at the nodes (a caulogram). Statistical support is through Turing&#x02013;Shannon sequential Bayes using one bit per new trait on a second-order Markov chain.</p><p>The branching concatenation of ancestral species provides a monophyletic evolutionary skeleton to larger monophyletic groups. Confirmation of the morphological skeleton is presently by identification of paraphyletic species on molecular cladograms, which are presumed to be ancestral to other species. This has been proven true in a study of the moss clade <italic toggle="yes">Chiololoma</italic> [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (Zander 2024e). One may hope that future molecular analysis using caulograms will provide more information. Mapping of morphological traits to molecular cladograms is now unnecessary.</p><p>This recasting is a major fix for the traditional methods of cladistic systematics, which is a 50-year-old technology. Originally, a cladogram was described as simply a branching network of ancestor&#x02013;descendant relationships ([<xref rid="B61-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], p. 28). Cladistics presently focuses only on the estimated order of branching not the order of taxa, and the former supposedly identifies common ancestry. It rejects ancestor&#x02013;descendant analysis by suppressing information from any paraphyly, morphological or molecular. H&#x000f6;randl [<xref rid="B62-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] has pointed out that commonly used sequence markers are limited to grouping evolutionarily, while expressed morphological traits that contribute to structure and function are deeply involved in selection, adaptation, and co-evolution and, thus, may be the proper bases for evolutionary grouping in classification. The classical morphological taxonomic method is based on hard-won informal genetic algorithms resulting in well-tested heuristics commonly known as expertise [<xref rid="B63-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>It is uncomfortable to suggest that cladistics is fundamentally anti-evolution [<xref rid="B57-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The PhyloCode [<xref rid="B65-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] glossary defines &#x0201c;phylogenetic&#x0201d; as of or pertaining to the history of ancestry and descent. Abundant evidence in cladistic publications, however, suggests that cladism suppresses any suggestion of descent with modification, that is, of ancestor&#x02013;descendant transitions between extant species, although lip service is paid to &#x0201c;common ancestry&#x0201d;. The fact is that evolution, either gradual or by short jumps of a few traits per speciation event, has so powerful an effect for grouping by similarity that any cluster analysis by any reasonable criteria will generate evolutionarily somewhat coherent groups. Without close analysis of ancestor&#x02013;descendant changes at the species level, both morphological and molecular, cladistic study results in poor resolution of monophyly and large genera as clades bloated with holophyletic synonymy.

Traditional cladistic methodology is, however, inaccurate and destructive. Both ancestral and descendant species are clustered by molecular or morphological traits or both, on dichotomous trees or cladograms, which is a constraint that does not reflect a process in nature. Cladograms summarize steps in cluster analysis by advanced traits or maximum probabilities of DNA base transitions and are not evolutionary trees. They are essentially visual aids for understanding the relationships of clustered taxon names that are often deeply nested in sets of parentheses as Venn diagrams (see <xref rid="plants-14-00530-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Cladistic analysis stuffs data on a naturally multichotomous tree of evolution into a dichotomous dendrogram. The result is that natural taxa are stripped of distinctive patterns. Because genera and species have no characteristic patterns possible on a fully resolved dichotomous tree, these taxa can have no cladistic presence. To make up for this, the concept of a clade was introduced, being simply a set of all organisms descendant from one ancestor, which led to the principle of holophyly&#x02014;somewhat paradoxically that descendant taxa cannot be named at the same rank as that of the ancestral taxon, e.g., no species can descend (in name at least) from a species, ditto for genus, and for family. The idea of descent with modification, then, given the inadequacies of the dichotomous tree, was abandoned in favor of common ancestry.</p><p>Actual molecular evidence of ancestry is the nesting of one taxon in another of the same rank, commonly dismissed as paraphyly. The nested taxon is apophyletic, and the nesting taxon is made paraphyletic by the apophyletic taxon because the paraphyletic taxon does not entirely share the same shared cladistic ancestor. In traditional cladistic phylogenetics, if genera are nested, then they are synonymized; if species, then ditto; if specimens, then the nesting specimens may be named as new cryptic species or all specimens renamed as the same species (<xref rid="plants-14-00530-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Multichotomies in a cladogram are commonly dismissed as &#x0201c;unresolved&#x0201d;, with little information in them because represent two equally probable trees. The solution is clear, to use a multichotomous tree with putative ancestral species at the nodes, and abandon cluster analysis in favor of ancestor&#x02013;descendant analysis. Essentially, clades are artifacts of the low resolution of dichotomous trees with unnamed nodes. High-resolution phylogenetics can with facility replace clades with taxa. The requirement, of course, is the expertise of classical systematics.</p><p>A species that has a molecular variant as a sister group and another variant of that same species as the nearest neighbor is also vulnerable to non-acceptance as a named entity. This practice is thankfully not yet prevalent. It is surprising, for example, that <italic toggle="yes">Chionoloma dubium</italic> (Th&#x000e9;r) M. Alonso, M. J. Cano, and J. A. Jim&#x000e9;nez is not synonymized with <italic toggle="yes">C. angustata</italic> (Mitt.) M. Menzel, inasmuch as the former is clearly apophyletic with three sets of nearest-neighbor clades of the latter, molecularly paraphyletic species [<xref rid="B69-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]; these species are quite distinct morphologically, which may account for the authors&#x02019; reserve. Remember that for every four immediate descendant species, there is, possibly extant, a cladistically confounding molecular variant of the ancestral species with the same molecular signature as its descendant species.</p><p>Paraphyly is valuable evidence of the descent of the apophyletic taxon with modification. All paraphyly on a molecular cladogram is an ancestral signature, but because of inaccurate clustering on a dichotomous tree, such information to be effectively used must be corroborated by morphological or molecular ancestor&#x02013;descendant analysis on a multichotomous second-order Markov chain, which, if molecular, should use informative priors with evolution tracked probabilistically by DNA sequences relatively unaffected by natural selection (i.e., by convergence).</p><p>The adoption of morphology-based macroevolutionary systematics is here advocated because it is better science than either cladistic morphological or molecular phylogenetics. It is better science because (1) genera are empirically defined; (2) the multichotomous tree patterns match the inferred generation of descendant species; (3) there is a clear evolutionary path between genus ancestors that stitches together minimally monophyletic groups of one ancestral species and a few descendant species; (4) statistical support by Shannon&#x02013;Turing sequential Bayes involves true Bayesian priors and conjugate priors and guides tree-building; (5) the Markov chain generates more information in being second order and multichotomous; (6) the model demonstrates an internal, fully monophyletic skeleton within a larger monophyletic assemblage; and (7) the model allows description and prediction of resilience of large groups over vast time frames.</p><p>In addition, morphology deals with just a few straight-forward expressed traits that facilitate evolution per speciation event, while molecular studies introduce uncertainties including alignment, wrong gap costs, differential lineage sorting, hybridization, polyploidy, recombination, non-clocklike behavior, rates other than gamma distributed, differences between the results of &#x0201c;total evidence&#x0201d; and evaluations based on separate gene studies, possible strong selection pressure on non-coding promoter sequences, persistent pseudogenes, too few exemplars, endogenous retroviruses, gene conversion, self-correction of flawed DNA, paralogy, codon bias, chloroplast capture and other horizontal gene flow, novel clades, saturation, third codon bias, wrong identifications, long-branch attraction, and model insufficiency; among others, even rare cases of molecular convergence between unrelated taxa [<xref rid="B71-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>The supreme result of taxonomic experience over the past 250 years is the generation of a large, predictive model of the evolution of biodiversity, and it is being dismantled one synonymized genus at a time through ad hoc principles associated with short-cuts to science. The tools of phylogenetics are blind to the internal skeleton of minimally monophyletic genera in large taxonomic groups. The central, supportive structure of concatenated minimally monophyletic genera, however, through fractal trait redundancy controls and potentiates survival of the supra-generic group through the 66 million years of existence of the modern flora [<xref rid="B35-plants-14-00530" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Evidence is thus available that evolution, as descent with modification, may act in massive survival force at the genus level, while the present literature on species competition is akin to local skirmishing. This is new science.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-plants-14-00530"><title>6. Summary</title><p>There has been an unacknowledged battle going on since the early 1970s, of numerical taxonomy against classical taxonomy, which is now deprecated as &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;intuitive&#x0201d; analysis. Essentially, this fight is of cladistic common ancestry versus evolutionary descent with modification. Although both can reveal evolutionary information, the former is gradually eroding the field of taxonomy by suppressing information about descent with modification (deprecated as &#x0201c;paraphyly&#x0201d;) and taxa as products of evolutionary processes (because distinctive taxon patterns cannot be shown on an enforced-dichotomous cladogram). Common ancestry is shown by character state changes from cluster to cluster, not a model of evolution, while descent with modification is demonstrated by character state changes from ancestral species to descendant species, which fits evolutionary theory. Herbaria have begun to organize their collections by clades labeled with &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; names, but clades and taxa are different sets, one fitting a cladogram, the other fitting evolutionary theory. Apophyletic species are also vulnerable to epistemic extinction. Molecular phylogenetic systematics and its associated classification principle of holophyly are gradually eroding taxonomy to create an evolution-free and taxon-free knowledge tree structured on a cladogram. Dealing with the biodiversity crisis will suffer without modeling evolution as descent with modification or having taxa as conceptual handles of processes in nature. The author has proposed a scientifically and statistically rigorous protocol for modeling and classifying biodiversity evolution with high-resolution analysis of monophyly, that is, explication of structural monophyly of large monophyletic groups through identifying their included minimally monophyletic groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The author appreciates the comments of three anonymous reviewers and the continued support of the Missouri Botanical Garden for innovative research in evolutionary systematics.

(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetics uses cluster analysis to estimate common ancestry and requires that by the Phylogenetic Classification Principle of Holophyly, all species in a cluster be of the same genus (or the same other rank). For a species to be a member of some phylogenetic genus, it must share the same ancestor as all the other species, that is, given the assumption that cladistically clustered species share the same ancestor, then to share an evolutionarily based name, they must share the same cluster. The poor solution ensuring overall monophyly is to either rename the unclusterable species to the same genus or to name all species as different genera. (<bold>B</bold>) High-resolution phylogenetics uses ancestor&#x02013;descendant analysis to discover, among a larger monophyletic group, the internal branching train of minimally monophyletic genera. The key feature is the inheriting, to the descendant species, of the entire set of recent advanced morphological traits (novon 2) of the genus ancestor. This theoretically enables descendant survival peripatrically by species able to survive in two environments, a surfactant metaphorically labeled &#x0201c;soap&#x0201d;. The outgroup is species A1, the ancestor is A2, and the descendant species D1 through D4. For each descendant, &#x0201c;novon 2&#x0201d; is the set of new traits of the ancestor given to each descendant as a redundancy, and &#x0201c;novon 3&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;novon 4&#x0201d;, etc. are the new traits of each descendant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="plants-14-00530-g007" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" id="plants-14-00530-f008"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Example of the fractal surfactant in the moss family Streptotrichaceae, with estimates of age of origin.

The dotted lines reflect evolutionary changes of the immediate ancestron between genera. Names of genera are given. One extinct genus is inserted based on a large (11 bits) evolutionary distance between two genera.
