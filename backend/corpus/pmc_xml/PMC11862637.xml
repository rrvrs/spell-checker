Spielberger, R. D&#x000ed;az Guerrero et al. (1966) checklist was applied; To review the relationship between advertising with neuromarketing, anxiety and compulsive purchases, a Likert-type scale instrument was designed and validated with the Alpha Cronbach Coefficient. Analysis of Covariance ANOVA, inferential statistics and SPSS were performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec9121"><title>Results</title><p>
57% of the women meet the criteria for the IDARE clinic. The analysis of the questionnaire showed a goodness of fit of R&#x000b2; = 0.697. The result indicates that the more hours women spend on the internet with access to ads focused on neuromarketing, the more they feel the need to buy, and this generates anxiety processes.</p></sec><sec id="sec9122"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The mental triggers used by neuromarketing accelerate the need in women to buy the solutions that they sell and the same need to buy is evident in the signs of anxiety that is reflected in the women under study. Training that educates women to spend less time connected to the Internet is recommended, but it is also essential that they understand that advertising and marketing exert pressure that increases their anxiety and need to purchase, so it is recommended the implementation of training in personal management and control.</p></sec><sec id="sec9123"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
