Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), an autologous concentrate of growth factors, has gained attention for its potential to enhance bone regeneration and soft-tissue healing. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of PRP application in extraction sockets after impacted mandibular third molar surgery.</p><p>Materials and methods: Forty patients who underwent impacted mandibular third molar extraction were divided into two groups according to clinical decision-making in conjunction with patient preference: the PRP group, in which PRP was applied in the extraction socket, and the non-PRP group, which received standard post-extraction care. Clinical parameters, including probing depth and wound closure, and radiographic assessments of alveolar bone level and bone density were recorded at baseline, one month, three months, and six months postoperatively.</p><p>Results: The application of PRP resulted in significant improvements in alveolar bone preservation and periodontal health, with a notable reduction in probing depth compared to the non-PRP group. Although PRP did not show a significant difference in bone density between the groups, a sustained increase over time suggested a positive effect on bone remodeling. PRP also accelerated wound healing, with initial dehiscence observed, but improved closure by day seven, indicating a biphasic influence on tissue repair.</p><p>Conclusion: PRP demonstrated potential benefits in enhancing soft and hard tissue healing after mandibular third molar extraction. Its ability to promote periodontal stability and wound closure suggests its clinical utility for oral surgical procedures. However, larger randomized controlled trials with extended follow-up are needed to establish standardized protocols and confirm their long-term efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>extraction</kwd><kwd>platelet rich plasma</kwd><kwd>sockets</kwd><kwd>third molars</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Surgical extraction of impacted third molars, commonly referred to as wisdom teeth, is one of the most frequently performed procedures in oral and maxillofacial surgery [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While this intervention is often necessary to address pathologies such as pericoronitis, caries, or crowding, it is not without complications. The most prevalent postoperative concerns are delayed wound healing, pain, alveolar osteitis (dry socket), and development of periodontal defects, particularly on the distal aspect of the adjacent second molars [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Regeneration of soft and hard tissues at the surgical site plays a crucial role in mitigating these complications and achieving optimal clinical outcomes.</p><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to enhance wound healing and bone regeneration following oral surgical procedures [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PRP is a biologically active autologous concentrate derived from the patient&#x02019;s own blood and contains a platelet concentration several times higher than that found in the baseline plasma. It was prepared by centrifugation to isolate the platelet-rich buffy coat layer. This layer is rich in a variety of growth factors that are key mediators of the tissue repair and regeneration processes [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Growth factors released from the alpha granules of activated platelets, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), orchestrate complex cellular events such as chemotaxis, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix synthesis [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These events are fundamental to the healing cascade of the soft and hard tissues. Specifically, PDGF stimulates the proliferation of mesenchymal cells, whereas TGF-&#x003b2; regulates bone matrix formation and remodeling [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The application of PRP has gained significant traction in various medical disciplines, including cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, and, more recently, oral and maxillofacial surgery [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In oral surgery, PRP has been used as an adjunct to bone grafts, in sinus lift procedures, and in the management of periapical lesions and osseous defects around dental implants [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Its benefits include accelerated soft tissue healing, enhanced bone regeneration, and reduced postoperative complications, such as infection and delayed healing.</p><p>The role of PRP in enhancing extraction socket healing remains controversial owing to inconsistent clinical findings across studies. Some studies have reported improved early soft tissue healing, reduced postoperative pain, and enhanced bone regeneration with PRP application in extraction sockets [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Conversely, studies by G&#x000fc;rb&#x000fc;zer et al. [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Arenaz-B&#x000fa;a et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found no statistically significant difference in bone density or healing outcomes when comparing PRP-treated sites to controls. These discrepancies are largely attributed to the variability in PRP preparation protocols, differences in platelet concentration, inconsistent use of activators such as thrombin or calcium chloride, and diverse clinical endpoints used to assess healing (clinical, radiographic, and histological parameters). Additionally, factors such as patient-specific variables (age, systemic health, and smoking) and limited sample sizes in some studies further complicate the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Hence, despite its promising biological potential, the clinical efficacy of PRP in extraction socket healing remains inconclusive, warranting further standardized, large-scale, randomized controlled trials.</p><p>Given the need for more definitive evidence, the present study was undertaken to assess the clinical and radiographic efficacy of autologous PRP gel in promoting bone regeneration and soft tissue healing following the surgical extraction of mandibular third molars&#x000a0;over a six-month period. This study aimed to provide valuable insights into the role of PRP as a regenerative adjunct in routine oral surgery, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes and minimizing postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design and setting</p><p>This prospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Maharaja Ganga Singh Dental College and Research Centre, Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. A total of 40 patients were enrolled from August 2023 to August 2024. The patients were allocated into two cohorts, PRP and non-PRP, based on clinical evaluation, operator preference, and patient consent rather than random assignment. As a cohort study, the focus was on observing outcomes following naturally occurring group allocation rather than controlled randomization. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (MGSDC/SY/23/2) and followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before starting the study.</p><p>Patient eligibility</p><p>Healthy individuals between the ages of 18 and 50 years, of either sex, who required surgical removal of the impacted mandibular third molars, were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included the presence of systemic conditions contraindicating extractions, such as uncontrolled diabetes or bleeding disorders; pregnant or lactating females; those who were taking&#x000a0;medications that could impair wound healing; and those with a history of head and neck radiotherapy.&#x000a0;The types of mandibular third molar impactions were evaluated preoperatively using the Pederson Difficulty Index [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which considers three variables: spatial relationship (angulation of the tooth), depth of impaction relative to the occlusal plane, and ramus relationship (space available vs. space required). Each parameter is scored, and the total score classifies the surgical difficulty as minimal (3-4), moderate (5-7), or difficult (8-10).&#x000a0;For the purpose of this study, only cases with minimal difficulty (total score 3-4) were included to ensure surgical standardization across both cohorts. Most impactions were mesioangular or vertical and positioned at a superficial level, with adequate space in the mandibular ramus to allow relatively uncomplicated surgical access. This selection was intended to minimize variability in healing outcomes due to procedural complexity.</p><p>Sample size estimation</p><p>G*Power software (Heinrich-Heine-Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany) was used for sample size estimation. A minimum of 40 total samples was estimated considering an effect size of 0.80 for the mean difference in bone density (101.05) with a pooled standard deviation of 126.02 percent between the PRP and non-PRP groups [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The power of the study was 80% with an alpha error of 5%.</p><p>Cohort allocation</p><p>Forty eligible patients were prospectively enrolled and assigned to one of two cohorts. The allocation was determined by clinical decision-making in conjunction with patient preference. No randomization process was used. Patients who agreed to the additional venous blood draw required for PRP preparation, and when PRP preparation resources were available, were included in the PRP cohort. Conversely, patients who declined blood draw or when PRP facilities were unavailable were assigned to the non-PRP cohort. This allocation method ensured that the treatment choices mirrored those in everyday clinical settings. Patients in the PRP cohort (n = 20) received PRP gel application to the extraction socket following third molar removal, whereas patients in the non-PRP cohort (n = 20) underwent standard surgical extraction without PRP gel placement.</p><p>PRP gel preparation</p><p>For PRP gel preparation, 8 mL of venous blood was drawn from patients in the PRP cohort under aseptic conditions and transferred to vacutainers containing acid citrate dextrose (ACD) as an anticoagulant. Blood samples were processed using a REMI R-8C Laboratory Centrifuge (REMI Elektrotechnik Ltd., Mumbai, India). The first centrifugation was performed at 1000 rpm for 10 min to separate the plasma, buffy coat, and blood cells (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The plasma and buffy coat layer, along with the upper 1-2 mm layer of red blood cells, were transferred to a fresh sterile vacutainer (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and subjected to a second centrifugation at 1000 rpm for another 10 min (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The upper layer of the supernatant was discarded, and the remaining concentrate was thoroughly mixed to yield approximately 4 mL of concentrated PRP (cPRP) (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Activation of PRP was achieved by mixing 2 mL of cPRP with 0.06 mL of 10% calcium chloride (CaCl&#x02082;), using either a sterile syringe or a dropper (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). The remaining 2 mL of cPRP was added to this activated solution, and the mixture was incubated in a dry bath incubator (Eurocon Instruments Pvt. Ltd., Chennai, Tamil Nadu) at 750&#x000b0;C&#x000a0;for 15 min to form a PRP gel (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel preparation.</title><p>A: whole venous blood at first centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min with formation of supernatant containing PRP; B: PRP, buffy coat, and the upper 1&#x02013;2 mm layer of red blood cells transferred into a fresh tube; C: at second centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min; D: the upper layer was discarded and the remaining lower layer mixed thoroughly to obtain concentrated PRP (cPRP); E: cPRP added with 10% calcium chloride for activation; F: formation of PRP gel.&#x000a0;</p><p>This figure illustrates the preparation of PRP&#x000a0;gel from venous blood drawn from a patient in the PRP cohort (arrows marking the stages), with the patient&#x02019;s informed consent for its use.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082891-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Surgical procedure</p><p>All procedures were performed under local anesthesia using 2% lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised to access the impacted mandibular third molar, with the incision extending from the retromolar area to the distal surface of the second molar (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), followed by a sulcular and release incision (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Bone removal and tooth sectioning were performed using a Lindemann carbide bur and a diamond bur (EdgeEndo, New Mexico, USA) under continuous saline irrigation. After extraction (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), PRP gel was placed into the sockets of patients in the PRP cohort (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), whereas no PRP was applied in the non-PRP cohort. The surgical sites were sutured using 3-0 silk sutures (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>), which were removed on the seventh postoperative day (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Postoperative care, including antibiotics (amoxicillin with clavulanic acid), analgesics (ibuprofen 800 mg daily for five days), and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash, was standardized across both cohorts.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Surgical removal of mandibular third molar with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel placement in the PRP cohort.</title><p>A: crestal incision; B: crestal with sulcular incision to raise the flap; C: removal of mandibular left third molar; D: placement of PRP gel; E: flap closure with sutures; F: postoperative healing.</p><p>This figure illustrates surgical removal with the placement of PRP gel into the extraction socket of a patient in the PRP cohort (arrows marking the stages), with the patient&#x02019;s informed consent for its use.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082891-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Outcome assessment</p><p>Clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed both preoperatively and during follow-up over six months at standardized intervals (one week, one month, three months, and six months). The probing depth distal to the second molar was measured using a UNC-15 periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, Illinois, USA) with mm markings, ensuring that the probe was placed parallel to the long axis of the second molar to maintain consistency. Each measurement was recorded to the nearest mm by the same calibrated examiner to minimize inter-examiner variability. Wound dehiscence was evaluated by visual inspection and classified as present or absent using a predefined clinical checklist during the postoperative follow-up.</p><p>For radiographic evaluation, standardized intraoral periapical radiographs were obtained using a long-cone paralleling technique with customized bite blocks to ensure the reproducibility of the radiographs at each follow-up. The alveolar bone level (ABL) was assessed from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the second molar to the alveolar crest distal to the second molar using digital calipers with radiographic software (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) (Figures <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Bone density was measured using grayscale analysis within the same software, standardizing contrast and brightness settings across all images to avoid discrepancies (Figures <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Assessment of alveolar bone level (ABL) and bone density (BD) in grayscale values in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) cohort </title><p>A: ABL at three months; B: BD at three months; C: ABL at six months; D: BD at six months.</p><p>This figure illustrates the intraoral periapical radiographic assessment of ABL and BD of a patient in the PRP cohort, with the patient&#x02019;s informed consent for its use.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082891-i03" position="float"/></fig><p>To enhance the reliability of radiographic measurements, intra-examiner reliability testing was performed.

The normality of the data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the data was found to be normally distributed. The chi-square test evaluated wound healing dehiscence between groups, while repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared bone density, ABL, and probing depth in the socket across time points. A post-hoc analysis was performed using the Tukey test. Intergroup comparisons were performed using independent t-tests. Significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results showed high intra-examiner reliability (r) with an ICC value of 0.83. Both groups consisted of eight (40%) males and 12 (60%) females with a mean age of 29.54 &#x000b1; 4.36 years. The comparison of bone density between the groups at different time intervals showed no statistically significant differences preoperatively (p = 0.731), at three months postoperatively (p = 0.773), or at six months postoperatively (p = 0.803). However, within-group analysis using repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant increase in bone density over time in both groups (p = 0.001). These results indicated that while the intervention did not lead to a significant difference between the groups, both groups experienced significant bone density improvements over time. This suggests a potential positive effect of natural healing or treatment interventions within each group, warranting further investigation of long-term outcomes (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Intragroup and intergroup comparison of bone density (grayscale values) for different time intervals. </title><p>*p-value &#x0003c; 0.05: significant, PRP: platelet-rich plasma gel; ANOVA: analysis of variance.</p><p>Data is presented in the form of mean and standard deviation (SD).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">&#x000a0;Grayscale value &#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cohort without PRP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cohort with PRP</td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">t value</td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">p-value using an independent t-test</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preoperative</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.67 &#x000b1; 15.68</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">78.95 &#x000b1; 15.76</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.35</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.731</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Postoperative at 3-month</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.54 &#x000b1; 15.63</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.11 &#x000b1; 15.48</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.29</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.773</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Postoperative at 6-month</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">82.52 &#x000b1; 15.53</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.30 &#x000b1; 15.21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.803</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F value</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.89</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="2">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value using repeated ANOVA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001*</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The post-hoc pairwise comparison of bone density within the groups showed significant differences across time points.

The results indicated that, while PRP did not lead to statistically significant differences in bone density between the groups, it did contribute to a more sustained increase in bone density over time. Furthermore, PRP was associated with a significantly greater improvement in ABL and probing depth as well as improved wound healing outcomes over the six-month postoperative period.</p><p>Our findings align with previous studies indicating that PRP promotes bone regeneration by releasing growth factors such as PDGF, TGF-&#x003b2;, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which facilitate osteogenesis and angiogenesis [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PRP is the autologous concentration of platelets within a diminutive volume of plasma. It is classified as a first-generation concentrate that employs calcium glutamate/thrombin to induce coagulation and an anticoagulant solution comprising citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Following activation via thrombin or calcium chloride, platelets contained within PRP secrete a variety of crucial growth factors that have been documented to be synthesized by platelets [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These growth factors encompass three isomers of PDGF (PDGF&#x003b1;&#x003b1;, PDGF&#x003b2;&#x003b2;, and PDGF&#x003b1;&#x003b2;), two distinct TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms (TGF&#x003b2;1 and TGF&#x003b2;2), as well as epithelial growth factor and VEGF [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When applied locally, platelet concentrates enhance the generation of osteoprogenitor cells, initiate osteoblast activity, expedite epithelialization of the gingiva, facilitate cellular recruitment to the surgical site, and promote angiogenesis.</p><p>Although natural healing processes can account for the observed increase in bone density in both groups, the sustained improvement in the PRP cohort suggests a prolonged effect on osteoblastic activity. This finding supports the hypothesis that PRP enhances the osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties of bone grafts or surgical interventions, although its effects may be more evident in long-term follow-ups [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Future studies with extended follow-up periods are warranted to determine if the observed benefits persist beyond six months.</p><p>The study found a significant improvement in ABL over time in both groups. At three and six months postoperatively, ABL was significantly greater in the PRP cohort than in the control cohort, indicating a more substantial preservation of the alveolar bone. These findings align with those of previous research highlighting PRP&#x02019;s role in reducing bone resorption and enhancing bone remodeling by stimulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and promoting mineralization [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, the progressive improvement in ABL between three and six months in the PRP cohort suggests that PRP may help sustain bone volume over time, which is crucial for preventing postoperative complications [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The results showed significant reductions in probing depth at different sites (distal, distobuccal, and distolingual) postoperatively in both groups, with greater improvement in the PRP cohort. This finding suggests that PRP may accelerate periodontal healing by enhancing soft tissue regeneration and reducing inflammation, which aligns with previous studies [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The observed improvement in probing depth is consistent with previous studies reporting that PRP contributes to improved periodontal attachment and reduced probing depth, likely owing to its ability to enhance fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, the sustained improvement in the PRP cohort may be attributed to PRP&#x02019;s anti-inflammatory properties, which help maintain a favorable periodontal environment postoperatively [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>This study found no significant difference in wound dehiscence between the groups on day one. However, by day two, a significantly higher proportion of the PRP cohort had wound dehiscence. Interestingly, by day seven, the trend reversed, with fewer PRP patients exhibiting dehiscence than the control group, indicating enhanced wound closure. The initial delay in healing in the PRP cohort may be attributed to the early inflammatory response stimulated by PRP, which can increase vascular permeability and transiently exacerbate tissue edema [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, PRP promotes accelerated soft tissue healing through the sustained release of growth factors that enhance epithelialization, collagen deposition, and neovascularization [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>These findings support the clinical utility of PRP in improving long-term wound healing outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients with compromised healing potential (such as those with diabetes, smokers, or those with osteoporosis) [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Future studies should explore the molecular mechanisms underlying PRP&#x02019;s biphasic effect on wound healing to optimize its application in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that PRP enhanced alveolar bone remodeling, periodontal healing, and wound closure following the surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. While PRP did not significantly alter bone density between the groups, its sustained improvement over time suggests a potential role in promoting long-term osteogenesis. The significant reduction in probing depth and superior alveolar bone preservation in the PRP cohort highlight its ability to enhance periodontal stability and minimize postoperative bone resorption. Additionally, PRP accelerated wound healing, with a higher initial incidence of dehiscence, followed by superior closure by day seven, indicating its biphasic effect on tissue repair. These findings support the clinical utility of PRP as an adjunct in oral and maxillofacial surgeries to improve surgical outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>ChatGPT (OpenAI, version 4) and Paperpal were employed to improve the clarity and language of the manuscript.
