Symptoms of depression further maintain disconnection by decreasing individuals&#x02019; motivation to engage with novel positive stimuli, favoring negative information (<xref rid="bibr86-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Winer and Salem, 2016</xref>). Recent research suggests hyperconnectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as an underlying neurobiological factor of rigid functioning and negativity bias (<xref rid="bibr10-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Chou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Guha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr94-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Decreased openness for novel stimuli poses a significant challenge for therapeutic change processes, particularly in treating depression. About 30% of those diagnosed with depression fulfill the criteria of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), leading to disproportionately high healthcare costs and significant mental distress, highlighting the great need for novel treatment approaches (<xref rid="bibr93-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Zhdanava et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Classic psychedelics such as psilocybin have been used by humans for thousands of years in indigenous medicine traditions (<xref rid="bibr42-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et al., 2021</xref>). In the 1960s, researchers enthusiastically investigated the use of psychedelics in treating several mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and alcohol addiction (<xref rid="bibr59-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Passie et al., 2002</xref>). After psilocybin was listed as a Schedule I drug by the United Nations in 1971, all research came to an end despite promising early findings of significant antidepressant effects (<xref rid="bibr42-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et al., 2021</xref>).

Its active metabolite psilocin can cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and exerts an agonistic effect on serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bibr44-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">MacCallum et al., 2022</xref>). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are a key component of the serotonergic system, which is associated with a wide range of functions including emotion and mood regulation, complex cognitive processing, perception, and learning (<xref rid="bibr77-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">&#x00160;vob &#x00160;trac et al., 2016</xref>). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are most densely expressed in the prefrontal cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, and claustrum (<xref rid="bibr31-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Hensler, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr77-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">&#x00160;vob &#x00160;trac et al., 2016</xref>). Psilocybin induces various subjective effects including changes in self-referential cognition, emotional states, and sensory experiences (<xref rid="bibr76-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Studerus et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, the effects are known to acutely alter individuals&#x02019; sense of consciousness, inducing phenomena described as <italic toggle="yes">oceanic boundlessness, ego dissolution</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">visionary restructuralization</italic>, among others (<xref rid="bibr75-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Studerus et al., 2010</xref>). Other subjective effects commonly referred to as <italic toggle="yes">mystical-type experiences</italic> encompass profound feelings of unity, noetic quality, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and ineffability, among others (<xref rid="bibr45-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have placed particular emphasis on feelings of unity and connectedness with oneself, others, and the world (<xref rid="bibr82-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>At the neural level, psilocybin is believed to promote neuroplasticity and change functional connectivity (FC) by reducing within-network FC and increasing between-network FC, including in the DMN (<xref rid="bibr21-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gattuso et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Ly et al., 2018</xref>). These changes in FC are linked to alterations in brain modularity, a measure of how distinctly brain regions or networks interact (<xref rid="bibr71-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Sporns and Betzel, 2016</xref>). Higher brain modularity reflects more segregated, specialized network activity, which may enhance specific cognitive functions (<xref rid="bibr9-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2020</xref>). However, excessive modularity can lead to rigid functioning, whereas reduced modularity supports increased network integration and flexibility (<xref rid="bibr21-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gattuso et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr71-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Sporns and Betzel, 2016</xref>). Together, psilocybin&#x02019;s impact on brain dynamics may thus foster more flexible and less rigid brain functioning.</p><p>The effects vary greatly depending on the individual, dosage, and the psychological, emotional, and environmental context, collectively known as <italic toggle="yes">set and setting</italic> (<xref rid="bibr30-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Hartogsohn, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">MacCallum et al., 2022</xref>). It is crucial to understand that increased sensitivity to context opens the door for both functional and dysfunctional change, depending on the context&#x02019;s nature. In a hostile environment, increased context receptivity is likely to promote anxiety and increase the risk of adverse events, whereas in a supportive setting, it may help to overcome rigid depressive states previously limiting treatment efficacy (<xref rid="bibr28-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;nder et al., 2024b</xref>).</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that psilocybin-assisted therapy exerts its antidepressant effects through mechanisms of change known from psychotherapeutic processes (<xref rid="bibr26-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Greenway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;nder et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref rid="bibr53-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Nayak and Johnson, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr89-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2024</xref>). The so-called <italic toggle="yes">common factors</italic> are well-researched and offer a helpful framework for understanding the therapeutic effects of psychedelics.

However, the findings of early trials face methodological challenges concerning blinding and pre-treatment expectancy and must therefore be interpreted with caution (<xref rid="bibr50-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2022</xref>). Despite challenges, the growing evidence indicates psilocybin might serve as an attractive alternative to traditional drugs for depression (<xref rid="bibr80-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watford and Masood, 2024</xref>). However, to inform new treatment approaches, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect is necessary. While various theoretical articles focus on distinct mechanisms of psilocybin, a comprehensive review including recent empirical data on both neurobiological and psychological antidepressant effects is lacking.</p><p>This systematic review primarily aims to address this knowledge gap by providing a holistic overview, integrating both the neurobiological and psychological effects of psilocybin previously associated with antidepressant mechanisms.</p><p>Other levels of explanation, such as molecular and cellular mechanisms, may be crucial as well and have been discussed extensively in previous reviews (e.g., <xref rid="bibr34-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Jaster and Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Maeso, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, this review also acknowledges the ongoing debate over whether psilocybin operates solely through direct pharmacological means, a notion which is already questioned for classic drugs for depression (<xref rid="bibr64-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Rief et al., 2016</xref>), or if its effects are complemented by subjective experiences, thereby catalyzing common factors of change in psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr24-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;nder et al., 2024</xref>b; <xref rid="bibr47-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mander et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr51-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr55-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Norcross and Lambert, 2018</xref>).

In addition, four studies used samples of healthy probands, aligning with depression-orientated study aims. One study included two trials with samples of MDD and TRD, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="section24-02698811241312866"><title>Study design</title><p>Five studies were single-arm open-label designs with pre&#x02013;post measures. Among these, one study utilized qualitative methods, while the remaining four employed quantitative methods. Ten studies used RCT and one study used data from a non-randomized, but controlled trial (NRCT). One study included both, an open-label trial and an RCT.

Eight studies employed brain dynamic measures including FC, cerebral blood flow, or blood oxygenation level-dependent via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or neural plasticity via electroencephalography (EEG). All 15 included studies employed psychological measures. The type of measure was diverse, ranging from depression severity to assessments of personality, creativity, emotion regulation, acute psychedelic effect, therapeutic relationship, connectedness, anxiety, rumination, empathy, and measures of moral decision-making.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section28-02698811241312866"><title>Outcomes</title><p><xref rid="table2-02698811241312866" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> contains a narrative synthesis of outcomes grouped by potential mechanisms of action investigated.

Second, patients were more open, non-judgmental, and accepting toward challenging or distressing emotions and sensations, demonstrating less experiential avoidance.</p><sec id="section35-02698811241312866"><title>Altered connectivity of limbic regions</title><p>Two studies investigated altered brain dynamics following psilocybin during exposure to emotional stimuli including emotional faces and emotional music (<xref rid="bibr51-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr67-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Shukuroglou et al., 2023</xref>).

Alterations in FC include key neural circuits such as the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) and cortico-claustro-cortical (CCC) pathways that are previously found to play crucial roles in mood regulation, cognitive flexibility, and consciousness (<xref rid="bibr18-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Doss et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr79-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Vollenweider and Preller, 2020</xref>).

Recent reviews link depression with elevated FC within the DMN and with reduced FC of DMN to other brain networks, promoting greater brain modularity (<xref rid="bibr91-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr94-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). This shift appears to promote rigid brain functioning, associated with depressive self-referential thinking (<xref rid="bibr94-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). This aligns with other symptoms of depression, such as anhedonia and decreased sensitivity to sensory and emotional information. Previous research found that the CSTC circuit&#x02019;s dysregulation has been implicated in promoting such rigidity, contributing to persistent negative thought patterns and compulsive behaviors characteristic of depression (<xref rid="bibr56-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Onofrj et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In this review, psilocybin consistently changed the DMN connectivity with numerous clinical improvements. Psilocybin&#x02019;s modulation of the CSTC circuit may facilitate these changes, as it can reduce overactivity in this loop, thereby decreasing rigid thought patterns and enhancing cognitive flexibility. Less within-DMN connectivity and reduced global brain modularity correlated with greater feelings of unity, connectedness, and improvements in depression severity (<xref rid="bibr16-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Daws et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr70-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Smigielski et al., 2019b</xref>).

However, the connectivity of the DMN to other brain regions was not increased universally. One study found decreased connectivity between the PFC, a key hub of the DMN, and the PH at rest, correlating with reduced depression severity (<xref rid="bibr8-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr51-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2020</xref>). This aligns with previous findings of elevated PFC-PH RSFC in depression (<xref rid="bibr36-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>). Another study of this review found decreases in PFC-amygdala FC during emotional face processing, correlating with reduced rumination (<xref rid="bibr51-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon may also involve the CCC circuit, where psilocybin alters the CCC interactions, leading to changes in sensory integration and emotional processing, thereby enhancing bottom-up sensory input during emotional experiences. This clinical improvement challenges the common notion that reduced PFC-amygdala FC is usually linked to depression (<xref rid="bibr36-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We interpret the reduced prefrontal coactivation as indications for decreased inhibitory top-down input from the PFC to the amygdala, consequently resulting in heightened amygdala responsiveness (<xref rid="bibr51-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2020</xref>). A recent study by <xref rid="bibr74-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Stoliker et al.

In addition, <xref rid="bibr51-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al.

The CCC circuit&#x02019;s involvement might contribute to these enhanced sensory and emotional experiences, as psilocybin&#x02019;s action on the claustrum through 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors could lead to altered states of consciousness and increased integration of sensory information, contributing to the feelings of unity and connectedness reported by patients.</p><p>The findings by <xref rid="bibr68-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Skosnik et al.

In brief, the Entropic Brain theory proposes that the entropy (randomness) of spontaneous brain activity reflects the informational richness of conscious experiences within certain lower and upper limits (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris, 2018</xref>). Too little entropy can lead to rigid and inflexible functioning, while excessively high entropy might result in chaotic and unstructured states. Along with this review, recent studies indicate that psilocybin appears to elevate brain entropy by altering connectivity patterns and inducing neural plasticity (<xref rid="bibr21-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gattuso et al., 2023</xref>). Higher entropy is hypothesized to be associated with greater sensitivity to changes and intrinsic and extrinsic influences (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris, 2018</xref>). It is crucial to understand that heightened entropy promotes a state of disruption and reorganization, which is vulnerable and does not per se imply a specific direction of change. Negative or hostile settings or absence of therapeutic guidance may promote dysfunctional external influences and adverse events. But, within a supportive context, heightened entropy may provide a powerful opportunity for novel and more adaptive perspectives and behaviors. This indicates that a supportive psychotherapeutic context serves a function beyond ensuring patient safety (<xref rid="bibr28-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;nder et al., 2024b</xref>). More essentially, it may serve to utilize common factors of therapy, such as motivational clarification, resource activation, alliance bond and mastery experiences during the receptive and open state induced by psilocybin (<xref rid="bibr26-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Greenway et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="bibr28-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;nder et al.

It suggests that processing of consciousness is organized hierarchically with stable, abstract beliefs at the top and basal sensory input at the bottom (<xref rid="bibr7-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>). The model suggests that under the influence of psilocybin, humans may experience a relaxation of rigid top-down beliefs and increased openness for bottom-up information flow. These effects may be mediated by alterations in CTSC and CCC networks through direct pharmacological effects of psilocybin on 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in these networks in complementary interaction with the wider context. The revision of pathologically overweighted beliefs is hypothesized to reinforce more flexible brain functioning and self-referential processing (<xref rid="bibr33-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2020</xref>). This process can be understood through the lens of resource activation, which enhances the brain&#x02019;s ability to engage existing strengths and positive experiences, thereby promoting cognitive flexibility.</p><p>Decreased connectivity within the DMN, lower brain modularity, along with reduced FC between the DMN and the NAc during music listening and DMN-amygdala during emotional face processing, as demonstrated in this review, may support the theory of relaxed top-down beliefs and less inhibitory input on bottom-up information. Simultaneous increases in FC between the amygdala and visual cortices, as well as between the DMN and visual cortices, may serve as neural correlates for increased openness to bottom-up flow of sensory information. These changes can also be interpreted as the brain clarifying and reorganizing its motivational frameworks, aligning new sensory and emotional inputs with personal goals and values&#x02014;a process known as motivational clarification.</p><p>The clinical improvements associated with changes in DMN connectivity, reported in this review, for example, decreased rumination and depression severity, less perseverative cognitive errors as well as enhanced pleasure ratings during music listening align with the predictions of the REBUS model which incorporates findings concerning alterations in CTSC and CCC networks.

Patients reported avoiding intense emotions due to cultural or social norms, or because they perceived their internal resources as insufficient. During the dosing session, patients were wearing eye shades and were gently encouraged to direct their attention inward and explore and feel, rather than avoid, emerging feelings and bodily sensations. The patients experienced a wide range of intense pleasant and unpleasant feelings. Some patients described the intensity of emotions as terrifying and overwhelming and that it was hard to &#x0201c;give in to what you&#x02019;re experiencing&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr81-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2017: 538</xref>).</p><p>These experiences highlight the impact of proper set and setting, as well as therapeutic guidance during the session. The therapeutic alliance bond, characterized by trust and collaboration between patient and therapist, may play a crucial role in supporting individuals to maintain an inward focus and an open state of mind during challenging experiences. The absence of such support could reduce the motivation to let go and accept difficult emotions, potentially resulting in a less pronounced antidepressant effect and increasing the risk of adverse events. This is particularly significant when traumatic memories and associated emotions are activated. The absence of these essential characteristics, that is, a therapeutic alliance that supports in confronting with difficult emotions, distinguishes recreational from therapeutic psilocybin use and illustrates why antidepressant effects observed in clinical studies cannot be transferred to other contexts.</p><p>In the qualitative study, therapeutic guidance together with psilocybin&#x02019;s effects may supported patients in accepting and releasing intense emotions like deep sadness, grief, or anger (<xref rid="bibr81-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2017</xref>). While this process was often described as challenging, it also led to a sense of relief afterward. This was also evident in the embodied response of patients. About half of the patients responded with intense crying during the session, with many expressing that they had not cried for a very long time, either due to emotional numbness or societal expectations. In addition, the experience of successfully navigating intense emotions can be viewed as a form of mastery by emotion regulation. Patients developed a greater sense of control and competence in managing their emotional states, contributing to long-term mental health benefits.</p><p>Although the qualitative study&#x02019;s findings were preliminary and exploratory by study design, the results of the RCT-based study by <xref rid="bibr92-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Zeifman et al.

Recent research debates whether this blunting is a residual symptom of depression or an adverse effect of the medication (<xref rid="bibr11-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Jawad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr61-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2022</xref>). However, there is also research pointing out the importance of helpful social and physical environmental stimulation for positive drug effects also in classical drugs for depression (<xref rid="bibr64-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Rief et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This review, along with previous articles including (<xref rid="bibr88-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>), suggests that psilocybin, when combined with proper therapeutic guidance, may intensify emotional experiences and thereby facilitate the confrontation of underlying issues. Through the lens of resource activation, motivational clarification, alliance bond experiences, and mastery by emotion regulation (<xref rid="bibr47-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mander et al., 2013</xref>), these processes illustrate the multifaceted therapeutic potential of psilocybin-assisted therapy.</p></sec><sec id="section50-02698811241312866"><title>Cognition &#x00026; self-referential processing</title><p>Psilocybin induced varied changes toward a more open and resilient personality, hence less prone to depression. Furthermore, psilocybin improved mindfulness psychosocial behavior and attitudes of probands. Neural and cognitive flexibility were significantly affected by both increases and decreases in functioning, indicating a nuanced relationship between psilocybin, neural, and cognitive flexibility.</p><p>In a large meta-analysis by <xref rid="bibr40-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Kotov et al. (2010)</xref>, depression has been associated with high neuroticism, introversion or low extraversion, high impulsivity, and low conscientiousness. In this review, psilocybin significantly impacted all depression-linked personality domains toward a more resilient, less psychopathology-associated personality profile (<xref rid="bibr83-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et al., 2023</xref>). The decreasing effects on Neuroticism remained stable for 6 months after receiving psilocybin, indicating lasting effects. The results replicate the findings of a prior uncontrolled open-label trial (<xref rid="bibr19-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Erritzoe et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Both neuroticism and hyperactivity within the DMN are associated with rigid self-referential processing and rumination (<xref rid="bibr10-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Chou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr94-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Reductions in neuroticism could therefore be accompanied by reduced connectivity within the DMN, as suggested by previous findings of this review. This idea gains support from a recent study by <xref rid="bibr10-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Chou et al. (2023)</xref>, reporting increased activity within the DMN among healthy individuals with higher neuroticism compared to those with lower scores. The direction of causality remains unclear, though. These results may grant further insight into the underlying connections between the neurological and psychological antidepressant mechanisms of psilocybin.</p><p>In addition, psilocybin significantly increased trait openness and absorption (<xref rid="bibr83-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et al., 2023</xref>). Absorption refers to an individual&#x02019;s ability to get deeply immersed in sensory or mystical experiences (<xref rid="bibr87-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Witth&#x000f6;ft et al., 2008</xref>). It includes immersion in internal mental landscapes and heightened awareness of external stimuli, such as finding meaning in nature or music (<xref rid="bibr41-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Lifshitz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr85-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 1995</xref>). High absorption is linked to paranormal beliefs and vivid spiritual and affective experiences. Notably, extreme levels of absorption have been, although weakly, linked with psychotic disorders (<xref rid="bibr22-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Glicksohn and Barrett, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr41-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Lifshitz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Rosen et al., 2017</xref>). Findings on increased absorption align with another study in this review observing enhanced trait mindfulness, deeper meditation experience, and increases in oceanic boundlessness following psilocybin (<xref rid="bibr70-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Smigielski et al., 2019b</xref>). However, it is important to note that trait mindfulness may constitute a long-term outcome, whereas oceanic boundlessness is an acute effect of psilocybin.</p><p>Similar to the previously discussed enhanced emotional expression and experience, elevated absorption embodies a vulnerable state that may hold potent and ambiguous implications for psilocybin-assisted therapy and mental health. On one side, heightened absorption could foster therapeutic change processes by promoting intense engagement with therapeutic stimuli as well as sensory and affective experiences. On the other side, in dysfunctional environments, it may bear the risk of adverse events including psychosis. Similar considerations apply to increased trait openness. Once again, this underscores the critical importance of a supportive set, setting, and therapeutic guidance, characterized by empathy and positive regard, in realizing the potential benefits of psilocybin-induced effects. Hereby, it adds to the growing evidence and discussion suggesting that the antidepressant effect of psilocybin may not solely be attributed to the substance itself but also largely to the therapeutic context it is administered in (<xref rid="bibr28-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;nder et al., 2024b</xref>).</p><p>Notably, within the study by <xref rid="bibr83-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et al. (2023)</xref>, apart from elevated levels of absorption, there were no group differences in personality effects compared to the escitalopram control group at first sight. However, exploratory analysis revealed that pre-treatment expectancy mediated the changes in neuroticism and conscientiousness in the escitalopram group. If escitalopram expectancy was set to zero in a counterfactual model, these changes lost significance in the escitalopram condition. On the other hand, expectancy, often attributed to the effects of psilocybin therapy, did not moderate any outcomes in the psilocybin condition.</p><p>In this review, psilocybin showed mixed effects on cognitive functioning. While both divergent and convergent thinking were initially impaired, divergent thinking improved compared to baseline 1 week post-treatment (<xref rid="bibr49-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, participants made fewer perseverative errors following psilocybin, indicating better cognitive flexibility (<xref rid="bibr17-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Doss et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, exploratory analysis revealed that high levels of between-network connectivity impaired cognitive functioning including convergent thinking and cognitive flexibility, while moderate levels showed a beneficial effect, suggesting a nuanced, inverted U-shaped relationship. This effectively illustrates a potential synergistic interplay between the Entropic Brain theory&#x02019;s assumptions and the common factors of psychotherapy. It indicates that moderate brain entropy can help break from rigidity, inducing resource activation, motivational clarification, and mastery by self-management, whereas high entropy may lead to chaotic and less functional states.</p></sec><sec id="section51-02698811241312866"><title>Connectedness</title><p>Across qualitative and quantitative studies of this review, psilocybin reinforced a sense of connectedness to the self, others, and the world (<xref rid="bibr81-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bibr82-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). This change was associated with antidepressant responses and other therapeutic mechanisms, such as reduced experiential avoidance. In addition, psilocybin increased interpersonal functioning in terms of therapeutic alliance and emotional empathy compared to escitalopram and placebo.</p><p>In this review, depression has previously been described as a state of disconnection, as noted by <xref rid="bibr57-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Osler (2022)</xref>. Patients&#x02019; accounts of their experiences before treatment with psilocybin align with that notion (<xref rid="bibr81-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2017</xref>). They described their depression as being disconnected from their senses, self, others, and the world. In interviews 6 months after the treatment, the most common theme among patients was a process from initial disconnection toward reconnection with these qualities. An RCT-based follow-up study included in this review confirmed that psilocybin induced persistent and significant increases in connectedness scores compared to an escitalopram control group (<xref rid="bibr82-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2022</xref>). While connectedness scores were increased for responders in both groups, they increased significantly more following psilocybin. The differences between groups may further indicate distinct antidepressant mechanisms of psilocybin compared to escitalopram. Moreover, the follow-up study confirmed the three-factor model of connectedness (self, others, and the world) identified in the qualitative reports, using exploratory and confirmatory factorial analyses (<xref rid="bibr82-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Taking a closer look at these dimensions of connectedness helps to unravel potential antidepressant mechanisms and their interconnections. One aspect was patients&#x02019; reconnection with their <italic toggle="yes">self</italic>, namely with their sensory, bodily, and emotional experiences (<xref rid="bibr81-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bibr82-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Several patients reported engaging with their perception of self and discovering new less judgmental perspectives (<xref rid="bibr81-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2017</xref>). This more accepting state of mind reportedly enabled them to reappraise old, critical self-concepts, uncovering more tender and compassionate views of themselves.</p><p>Reappraisal has been associated with potential mental health benefits (<xref rid="bibr1-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Aldao et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, antidepressant effects seem to depend on the success of reappraisal strategies, suggesting that attempting reappraisal creates a vulnerable state with possible outcomes in varied directions (<xref rid="bibr20-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Ford et al., 2017</xref>). This is consistent with the REBUS model and mechanisms proposed in CTSC and CCC models of psilocybin promoting a state of mind that is sensitive to positive change yet also vulnerable. This patient&#x02019;s experience may help to understand the mechanism between reconnecting to self and employing adaptive emotion regulation strategies. It can be hypothesized that connectedness and less experiential avoidance facilitate mental space for the reappraisal of beliefs and emotions. Supporting this notion, <xref rid="bibr92-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Zeifman et al. (2023)</xref> found that psilocybin-induced decreases in experiential avoidance were significantly serially mediated through increases in connectedness. This effect was absent in the escitalopram control group, further highlighting the distinct therapeutic mechanism of psilocybin. It is important to consider that improvements as reported by the patients, occurred within a highly supportive context and under therapeutic guidance. Hence, the significant importance of empathy and positive regard by the therapist/setting and the possibility for emotional expression and experience also applies here.</p><p>Another domain in which patients found reconnection was in their relationship with <italic toggle="yes">others</italic>. Many patients reported a lasting sense of interconnectedness with their social groups but also strangers on the street (<xref rid="bibr81-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al., 2017</xref>). Some mentally revisited painful or traumatic relationships of their past and managed to reappraise them. They reported discovering new perspectives by feeling compassion for those who had harmed them. Many described this process as emotionally releasing, as they found new explanations for why and how these traumatic events occurred, enabling new bond experiences as well as motivational clarification.</p><p>These patients&#x02019; experiences illustrate how psilocybin may promote improvements in connectedness to others via increased motivation to confront difficult emotions and perform reappraisal strategies. It further connects to other findings of this review, suggesting improved empathy as well as therapeutic alliance and rapport following psilocybin (<xref rid="bibr52-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr62-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Pokorny et al., 2017</xref>). Empathy is widely considered a key component of interpersonal functioning (<xref rid="bibr46-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Main et al., 2017</xref>). The patients&#x02019; experiences may also demonstrate how heightened empathy induced by psilocybin supported them in adopting alternative perspectives and sharing the emotional state of others, thereby gaining a better understanding of their motivations.</p><p>Psilocybin&#x02019;s potential to enhance private and therapeutic relationships, as indicated by the study of <xref rid="bibr52-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al. (2022)</xref>, could significantly advance our understanding of its mechanisms and inform its application in therapy. The therapeutic relationship is universally recognized as the most fundamental factor and mediator of change in psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr2-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Baier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr55-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Norcross and Lambert, 2018</xref>). A safe and stable therapeutic relationship also appears to be an essential element in psilocybin-assisted therapy, given the heightened openness and potential vulnerability demonstrated in this review. Moreover, lasting psilocybin-induced improvements in therapeutic alliance may foster positive change in regular psychotherapy. Future studies investigating the long-term effects of psilocybin on therapeutic alliance are needed to validate this hypothesis, though.</p><p>Lastly, the studies reported a reconnection with the <italic toggle="yes">world.</italic> As conceptualized by <xref rid="bibr82-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Watts et al. (2022)</xref>, this includes various qualities such as humanity, universal love, or nature. It can be hypothesized that experiencing profound feelings of connectedness with the world counteracts rigid disconnected states of depression.

However, it is important to note that, at this stage of research, no directional causality can be claimed, and it is likely that unknown additional factors have been overlooked by recent studies.</p><p>Hence, the findings appear to expand upon and complement the notion proposed by <xref rid="bibr24-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al.

The findings highlight the need for an integrative approach that reflects multiple perspectives on psilocybin&#x02019;s antidepressant mechanisms, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig2-02698811241312866" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Future studies are encouraged to expand upon this concept with additional data as more qualified trials become available and are invited to embrace multiple perspectives (e.g., pharmacological, molecular, epigenetic, psychological, and systemic) rather than focusing solely on reductionist approaches.</p><p>In addition, changes in self-referential processing, emotion regulation, connectedness, and interpersonal functioning can be viewed through the lens of personality functioning as defined by criterion A of the alternative model for personality disorders in the DSM-5 which includes self-functioning (identity and self-direction) and interpersonal functioning (empathy and intimacy) (<xref rid="bibr66-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Sharp and Wall, 2021</xref>).

To begin with the strengths, it offers an overview of psilocybin&#x02019;s potential antidepressant mechanisms across diverse domains, contributing to a holistic understanding of its effects and underlying interconnections. Moreover, integrating the findings of this review into existing frameworks beyond psilocybin-related research, such as common factors of psychotherapy and transdiagnostic factors for psychopathology such as personality functioning helps connect new findings with established knowledge. However, as this field of research just emerges after decades of stagnation, the quality of studies is very heterogeneous. While 11 studies were based on RCTs or NRCTs, 5 studies relied on single-arm open-label trials, due to the lack of alternatives. The results stemming from uncontrolled studies must therefore be cautiously interpreted as preliminary. Despite the explorative character, the results may still inform hypotheses for future confirming research. The broad range of mechanisms examined may unveil interconnections but also pose comparability challenges. Several included studies were novel or unique in their field, lacking comparable counterparts. The four domains that this review introduces for clarity are not meant to be exhaustive and need to be validated with factorial analysis.</p><p>Also, it is fundamental to declare that, at this stage of the research, claims to causality are minimal or non-existent. The mechanisms of change presented in this review should be viewed as potential preliminary candidates. While direct correlations and mediation analysis with the antidepressant effects provide hints of possible causality, the reported effects across all four domains may well be byproducts of the actual, possibly unknown or overlooked, mechanisms.</p><p>The nature of psilocybin&#x02019;s effects demonstrated in this review highlights the importance of a supportive therapeutic context. However, many studies insufficiently report how they employed set, setting, and therapeutic guidance. Future studies should put more emphasis on the details of the therapeutic concept of preparation, dosing, and integration sessions, given its essential role.</p><p>A central methodological limitation among all included studies are potential problems with blinding and pre-treatment expectancy. These have been widely discussed as a source of potential bias for novel treatment approaches including psilocybin (<xref rid="bibr27-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;nder et al., 2024a</xref>). Although RCTs are double-blinded per design, the strong effects of psilocybin often break the blinding to practitioners and participants creating various sources of bias, including both placebo and nocebo effects (<xref rid="bibr50-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2022</xref>). The disappointment in expectancy within control groups may negatively influence treatment outcomes and create false effects. However, a recent study found that despite higher initial expectancy for psilocybin, its association with treatment outcomes was only significant in the escitalopram control group (<xref rid="bibr78-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Szigeti et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Moving forward, studies should consistently address these challenges by controlling for pre-treatment expectancy like <xref rid="bibr83-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et al. (2023)</xref> or offering a potentially effective dose to control group participants post-primary study endpoints to reduce nocebo effects, as proposed by <xref rid="bibr50-02698811241312866" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al.

These effects proved to be interconnected and associated with clinical improvements. Evidence suggests that psilocybin promotes a state of consciousness characterized by heightened openness, flexibility, and greater ability and acceptance of emotional experiences. Moreover, a renewed sense of connectedness to the self, others, and the world emerged as a key experience of treatment with psilocybin. Consistent reports indicate significant alterations in underlying brain dynamics, marked by reduced global and DMN modularity and increasing connectivity between networks. The findings align with the assumptions of the Entropic Brain theory as well as REBUS, CTSC, and CCC models.</p><p>Collectively, these effects indicate parallels to adaptive emotion regulation strategies and common factors of effectiveness in psychotherapy, such as alliance bond experiences, perceived empathy, positive regard from the therapist or setting, opportunities for emotional expression and experience, activation of resources, motivational clarification, and mastery through self-management and emotion regulation.</p><p>Together, these changes may create a fertile yet vulnerable window for change processes, strongly emphasizing the essential importance of supportive set, setting and therapeutic guidance in fostering the benefits of psilocybin.
