Introduction</title><p>Norovirus is one of the leading causes of acute viral gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide, accounting for over 200,000 deaths and 685 million infections in children under the age of 5 [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several host innate factors have been associated with an individual&#x02019;s susceptibility to norovirus infection [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent studies have also indicated the involvement of commensal bacteria in successful norovirus infections. For instance, norovirus was unable to infect mice treated with antibiotics compared to their untreated counterpart [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several hypotheses that explain how gut bacteria influence enteric viral infection exist, including the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharides [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), expressed by mostly Gram-negative bacteria, have been shown to promote enteric viral infections [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Binding of the viral particle to bacterial LPS increases its thermostability and resistance to inactivation from chemicals [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This subsequently enhances the chance for the virus to infect the target cells, possibly by affording the virus time to reach its target cells. Bacterial LPS also facilitate the attachment of the viral particles to the target cells as the binding of enteric viruses, such as poliovirus to specific receptors, was reported to improve in the presence of bacterial LPS, suggesting that the LPS is directly involved in the attachment of enteric viruses to target cells [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The viral binding is not limited to bacterial LPS as studies have shown that the viruses also bind to other bacterial components including N-acetylglucosamine-containing surface polysaccharides that are longer than six monosaccharides [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. N-acelylglucosamine is a main component of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan that is made up of a sugar backbone consisting of alternating residues of &#x003b2;-(1,4) linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When combined with uridine diphosphate (UDP), N-acetylglucosamine is also a precursor for the synthesis of the lipid A of LPS, which is a major part of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial LPS is a tripartite structure consisting of the lipid A that docks the LPS to the outer membrane; core oligosaccharide, which maintain the integrity of the outer membrane; and O antigen polysaccharide or O antigen, which is connected to the core and made up of a polymer of repetitive oligosaccharide units exposed to and interacting with the external environment [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While the genes that code for common polysaccharide are conserved, there is little homology in different set of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the O-specific antigen in different bacteria, making it impossible to target a single gene to quantify the O antigen of the LPS.</p><p>Several intestinal Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruguinosa</italic>, and others are reported to be rich in LPS and other N acetylglucosamine-containing surface polysaccharides [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, despite their significance, little is known about the role of the abundance of LPS-rich bacteria and other N acetylglucosamine-containing surface polysaccharides in pediatric norovirus infection. Here, we report that harbouring increased levels of LPS-rich bacteria and other N acetylglucosamine-containing surface polysaccharides can be a risk factor for pediatric norovirus diarrhea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-viruses-17-00278"><title>2.

Study Design, Population, and Sampling</title><p>This is a case&#x02013;control study that used stool samples collected from infants attending Oukasie Healthcare Clinic, north of Pretoria for a routine vaccination programme and diarrhea between 2018 and 2020. Diarrhea was defined as having episodes of at least three loose, watery stools within 24 h, along with at least one of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or high fever [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Stool samples were collected from infants of similar age (3.5 and 9 months) after written and informed consent from the parents. The study cases were limited to these specific months as the study controls were enrolled at a vaccination clinic for rotavirus immunization at 3.5 and 9.0 months of age. Study participants were divided into four groups: diarrheic norovirus-positive (DNP), asymptomatic norovirus-positive (ANP), non-diarrheic norovirus-negative (NDNN), and diarrheic norovirus-negative infants (DNN). Infants on antibiotic therapy or treated with antibiotics 4 weeks prior to recruitment were excluded from the study. Ethical clearance was approved by the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University Research and Ethics Committee, SMUREC/M199/2020: PG.</p><p>Stool samples were collected from the infants&#x02019; diapers into sterile plastic bottles.

Discussion</title><p>The study found significantly higher levels of bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and selected LPS-rich bacteria in DNP children compared to their NDNN counterparts. Lack of homology between LPS genes in different bacteria rendered designing of primers to target all bacterial LPS in stool samples impossible; as such the study used the three selected bacteria as representative of LPS-rich bacteria. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that elevated levels of bacterial LPS may play a role in norovirus infection and diarrhea. In fact, logistical regression analysis of bacterial counts and norovirus diarrhea indicated an association between the level of fecal bacterial LPS and the disease. Elevated levels of LPS-rich bacteria mean more noroviruses will be able to bind to LPS, survive harsh intestinal conditions and become facilitated to attach and infect the target cells (affording the virus more time to reach its target) [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and cause diarrhea. The mechanism through which bacterial LPS stabilizes norovirus is not fully explained but it is thought the negative charge of the LPS (due to phosphate group) interacts with the charged region of norovirus capsid, thereby preventing viral conformational change essential for viral inactivation and providing viral stability. Nevertheless, our findings are the first to show association between abundance of LPS and norovirus infection. However, a recent similar study observed that the accumulation of LPS secreted by enriched Gram-negative bacteria was a risk factor for rotavirus colonization in young adults [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The abundance of LPS-rich bacteria was assayed using qPCR, which gives an estimate of genome copy numbers but not viable counts of the bacteria. To estimate the level of viable bacteria, the study assayed the expression of gene coding for LPS genes of the selected bacteria between DNP and NDNN infants. Consistent with the abundance of the bacterial LPS gene targets, the average expression of all selected LPS genes were 7-fold higher in DNP than in NDNN. In contrast, the expression of the gene coding for N-acetylglucosamine was much less in DNP infants compared to NDNN infants, suggesting that N-acetylglucosamine from non-viable cells constituted much of total bacterial N-acetylglucosamine assayed. Nonetheless, studies have shown that enhancement of enteric viral infectivity does not require viable bacteria as lipopolysaccharides alone have been shown to directly bind to enteric viruses and promote infection [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The mean levels of selected LPS gene targets were high regardless of whether the infection was symptomatic or asymptomatic. It is not known whether the asymptomatic norovirus-positive infants were truly asymptomatic as human studies have indicated [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or were merely recovering from norovirus diarrhea at the time of sampling that may indicate the continuing fecal norovirus shedding from past infection. Nevertheless, the observation suggests that elevated levels of bacterial LPS could be a susceptibility factor for both norovirus diarrhea and asymptomatic norovirus infection.</p><p>The expression of TLR4 gene in the current study corresponded with abundance or expression of selected bacterial LPS. This is consistent with studies in mice, which have shown that LPS activation of the TLR4 gene proceeds in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Immune signalling of LPS occurs via TLR4 and its increase in expression in stool samples of DNP children observed in the current study suggest that LPS may have a role in norovirus infection. The induction of TLR4 can lead to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6 and 8) that have been associated with norovirus infections [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is possible that an increase in expression of TLR4 in DRP as the result of higher abundance of LPS resulted in increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8 that created a conducive environment for norovirus infection and diarrhea.</p><p>Composition of the gut bacteria can temporarily change due to several physiological conditions including diarrhea. Diarrhea destabilizes the gut environment by increasing bowel movement and fluid secretion that can lead to gut microbiome dysbiosis [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The significant differences in abundance of selected bacteria LPS gene targets between DNP and DNN infants observed in the current study suggest that diarrhea could not be the cause of elevated levels of the selected LPS-rich bacteria in DNP infants since both study groups had diarrhea.</p><p>When age was stratified, the study observed that differences in levels of fecal bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and LPS-rich <italic toggle="yes">S. marcescens</italic> in diarrheic norovirus-positive and non-diarrheic norovirus-negative infants were notable in 9-month-old infants compared to their 3.5-month old counterparts. The levels of <italic toggle="yes">K. pneumoniae</italic>, on the other hand, were more significant in 3.5-month-old infants than 9-month-olds. During the first two years of life, the composition of gut bacteria is dynamic [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the observation in the current study suggests that at any particular time, elevated levels of these LPS-rich bacteria or bacterial N-acetylglucosamine could predispose infants to norovirus diarrhea.</p><p>The study also observed that sex, mode of delivery, and feeding type did not contribute significantly in predicting the levels of bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and selected LPS-rich bacteria among the study infants. There have been conflicting reports about differences in gut bacterial abundance between males and females, with some suggesting there is a difference between the two [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while others suggest none [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The observation in the current study is in agreement with the latter and could be one of the reasons why both genders are equally affected by norovirus [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As the levels and diversity of intestinal bacteria during the first year of life is dynamic and unsteady [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00278" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it is not surprising that the abundance of bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and the selected LPS-rich bacteria in infants&#x02019; fecal samples could be not predicted according the three confounding factors.</p><p>The study had limitations, the first being the small number of samples used to evaluate the differences in levels of bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and selected LPS-rich bacteria between the two study groups. Further studies, with a large sample size, are warranted to validate the current study observations. Secondly, the study population comprised only black South African infants, and since there are reported differences in diversity and composition of bacterial species and strains among different ethnic populations, it would be intriguing to find out the levels of bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and selected LPS-rich bacteria in other ethnic or racial groups. Thirdly, due to little homology of gene coding for the synthesis of LPS, quantification of LPS was only performed for selected LPS-rich bacteria and future studies involving quantification of overall bacterial LPS, possibly through chromatography, is required. Lastly, stool samples are not true indicators of the abundance of bacteria in the intestines where norovirus are suspected to primarily infect. However, they are frequently used as proxies for gut bacteria as they can be collected naturally and non-invasively.</p><p>In summary, the study has shown that diarrheic norovirus-positive infants contained significantly high levels of bacterial N-acetylglucosamine and selected LPS-rich bacteria compared to their non-diarrheic norovirus-negative counters. In addition, the expression of LPS signalling molecules increased 2.5-fold in infants with norovirus diarrhea compared to the controls. Infants possessing elevated levels of selected LPS-rich bacteria were more likely to have norovirus diarrhea. The results suggest the possible role of the abundance of bacterial LPS in norovirus infection.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
