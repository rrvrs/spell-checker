In recent years, arbapenem-resistant <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (CRE) and carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (CRAB) have been designated as critical priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (WHO), while carbapenem-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (CRPA) has been categorized in the high priority group (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Kaminski et al., 2020</xref>). These classifications underscore the urgent public health threat posed by these multidrug-resistant organisms, particularly given the severely limited therapeutic options currently available for managing infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. It is concerning that even the antibiotics considered the last line of defense, namely tigecycline and polymyxin, have demonstrated emerging resistance (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Shields et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, novel synthetic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as imipenem/relebactam and meropenem/vaborbactam, which were demonstrated efficacy against several multidrug resistance (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, have been reported to exhibit reduced susceptibility towards certain carbapenem-resistant strains (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Maraki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>). Cefiderocol (CFD) represents a novel siderophore cephalosporin with potent activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria that can improve the clinical treatment of CR bacterial infections and was approved for marketing in the United States in 2019 (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Parsels et al., 2021</xref>). Despite most isolates demonstrating susceptibility to CFD in the CREDIBLE-CR trial, a higher mortality rate was observed in the treatment of serious infections caused by CR Gram-negative pathogens accompanied by the emergence of heteroresistance (HR) (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bassetti et al., 2021</xref>). The HR phenotype represents a form of bacterial resistance, where subpopulations originating from the same monoclonal source exhibit inconsistent susceptibility to the same antimicrobial agent. This occurs as cells revert back to a decreased antibiotic-sensitive state when the antibiotic pressure diminishes (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Dewachter et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of an HR subpopulation of bacteria can result in rapid replication in the presence of an antibiotic, while other susceptible bacteria cells are eliminated, may lead to failure of antibiotic treatment and even induce bacterial resistance to drugs. Although epidemiological data have suggested that CFD-HR bacteria might be associated with treatment failure, experimental verification has been lacking (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Choby et al., 2021</xref>). In China, the prevalence of CR Gram-negative bacteria is becoming an increasingly significant public health issue (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Reports of HR to antibiotics are on the rise, (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Li Y. et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Li Y. T. et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Stracquadanio et al., 2022</xref>) highlighting the critical need for the development or introduction of new antibiotics to effectively combat these resistant strains. At present, CFD has not been incorporated into clinical practice in China, leading to a scarcity of data on the prevalence of HR to CFD. To address this gap, our study focused on CR and extended-spectrum <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-lactamase (ESBL) producing strains from two major hospitals, identifying instances of CFD-HR and thereby contributing valuable data to the limited existing dataset on CFD-HR prevalence in China. The clinical implications of CFD-HR, especially concerning treatment failure, are still a matter of debate, with findings that remain inconclusive. Since CFD has not yet been officially integrated into clinical protocols in China, our study proposes to use mice models to further investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment outcomes associated with CFD. Moreover, we conducted adaptive cost experiments and employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to preliminarily explore the underlying mechanisms of CFD-HR. These efforts are aimed at providing a foundational understanding of the genetic and phenotypic factors that contribute to CFD-HR, thereby laying the groundwork for future research and potential clinical interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Bacterial strains, growth conditions and plasmids</title><p>A total of 407 clinical isolates collected between 2018 and 2022 were included in this study.

These traditional cephalosporins are widely used in clinical practice in China, and therefore, the observed prevalence of CFD-HR may be influenced by the cross-HR with traditional cephalosporins (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Russo et al., 2022</xref>), which highlights the significance of monitoring and understanding the potential impact of cross-resistance on the effectiveness of CFD treatment in clinical settings.</p><p>In phase III clinical trials of CFD, there were suggestions of a possible relationship between treatment failure and HR, but direct evidence from systematic trials remained lacking (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Choby et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Timsit et al., 2022</xref>). In this present study, we found that although all isolates used in TKA were sensitive bacteria, dynamic observation of the bactericidal curve showed that only 33.3% (2/6) of HR bacteria could be killed without regrowth by 4 mg/L of CFD (breakpoint of susceptible). Most HR bacteria (66.7%, 4 out of 6) required higher minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) levels, ranging from 8 mg/L to 16 mg/L, compared to non-HR bacteria. Notably, TKA demonstrated that the CFD killing activity was considerably reduced in the presence of HR bacteria. The findings were consistent with previous reports on the subject (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Mezcord et al., 2023</xref>). It has long been established that HR can lead to treatment failure <italic>in vitro</italic> settings. However, the potential for HR to cause treatment failure <italic>in vivo</italic> has remained a subject of considerable debate (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Karakonstantis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Shields et al., 2024</xref>). In China, CFD had not yet been commercialized, and as a result, the clinical outcomes of these strains could not be directly observed. To elucidate the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of HR strains, we conducted animal experiments using mice. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments demonstrated that mice infected with HR bacteria treated with CFD had significantly lower survival rates than those in the NHR group. Thus, these findings demonstrate that while HR is not an absolute determinant of treatment failure, it constitutes an important risk factor for suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence exploring the link between HR and treatment failure of CFD.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Nicoloff et al., 2019</xref>) our results confirmed the transient and unstable resistant level of the HR subpopulation. Genetic analysis of the subpopulation, parental, and recovered strains revealed various gene alterations affecting multiple functions, such as porin, iron uptake, and bacterial secretion systems. Some of these gene mutations have been previously associated with resistance to specific antibiotics. Recent studies have indicated that the deletion of the <italic>vgrG</italic> gene led to increased antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam but decreased resistance to chloramphenicol (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). To date, few studies have been reported specifically focusing on this particular gene within the context of research involving CFD-HR. In our present study, we identified subpopulations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that exhibited a common SNP mutation in the <italic>vgrG</italic> gene. Further experiments demonstrated that overexpression of the <italic>vgrG</italic> gene resulted in reduced resistance to CFD. This suggests that mutations and recovery of the <italic>vgrG</italic> gene may contribute to the instability of HR and the presence of subpopulations in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. As previously discussed, the emergence of subpopulations is a critical determinant in the reduced antibiotic susceptibility observed in HR strains. In this context, the findings of the present study elucidating the role of the <italic>vgrG</italic> gene in HR provided valuable supportive evidence that may aid in deciphering the underlying mechanisms of CFD-HR. In both <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains (HR-<italic>A. baumannii-</italic>1, HR-<italic>A. baumannii-</italic>2), mutations in the genes HKO16_RS09735 and HKO16_RS17970 related to <italic>oprD</italic> were observed only in the subpopulation, not in the parental or recovery strains. Similar genetic changes, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertional elements in <italic>oprD</italic>, have been frequently found in MDR <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains, and down regulation of <italic>oprD</italic> was observed in MDR and pan-drug-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> clinical strains (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Zhanel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Stracquadanio et al., 2024</xref>). More importantly, resistance against CFD was found to be increased in the <italic>oprD</italic>-deficient strains indicating that the mutation of <italic>oprD</italic> in the subpopulation and its recovery in the recovered strain in our study could be involved in the unstable HR of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</p><p>It has been previously reported that a high prevalence of antibiotic HR in pathogenic bacteria is primarily caused by gene amplification. In our study, we observed the duplication of <italic>sitABCD</italic> genes in the subpopulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> (HR-<italic>E. coli</italic>-1 and HR- <italic>E. coli</italic>-2), which was distinct from the parental and recovered strains. <italic>sitABCD</italic> is a TonB-independent transporter responsible for the uptake of ferrous iron. The involvement of the <italic>sitABCD</italic> gene in the potential mechanism of HR is related to the uptake of soluble Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Specifically, the <italic>sitABCD</italic>-facilitated uptake of Fe<sup>2+</sup> may lead to the downregulation of TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs), resulting in decreased susceptibility to CFD (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter and Payne, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Luscher et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, the reversible amplification and loss of <italic>sitABCD</italic> may contribute to the unstable HR of <italic>E. coli</italic> and impact the effectiveness of CFD treatment. Nonetheless, while our current findings provide valuable insights, additional confirmatory experiments are warranted in the future to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and validate the observed phenomena. This will be essential to strengthen the conclusions drawn from our study and to pave the way for further advancements in this area of research.</p><p>Most resistance mutations in bacteria carry a fitness cost. As many antibiotics target important cellular processes, resistance to them may disrupt those processes or impose a large energetic burden that reduces the competitive power of the susceptible strain, leading to a change in fitness costs that manifests as a reduction (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Melnyk et al., 2015</xref>). Our study showed that only one <italic>E. coli</italic> (HR- <italic>E.coli</italic>-2) and one <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (HR- <italic>A. baumannii-</italic>2) among the six isolates exhibited an increase in the fitness of the subpopulation compared to that of the parent bacteria. However, this increased fitness was reverted to the level of the parental strain after 10 passages, coinciding with the loss of gene <italic>sitABCD</italic> duplication or the frequent mutation of gene <italic>oprD</italic>. In contrast, no significant growth variability was observed in the subpopulations of the other four HR strains. Nonetheless, the fitness of certain subpopulations was observed to increase, albeit in an unstable manner. This instability may contribute to the poor correlation between clinical treatment outcomes and the detection of HR. Therefore, further multidimensional experiments are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of HR instability.</p><p>The findings of our study reveal that CFD-HR bacteria are prevalent in clinical settings, even in regions where CFD has not yet been implemented. This observation underscores the potential for HR to emerge and persist independently of direct CFD exposure, highlighting the importance of proactive surveillance and targeted interventions to mitigate the spread of such resistant strains. It is worth noting that although our study demonstrates that CFD-HR is widespread among clinical carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative strains. However, there may be some limitations in the generalizability of the study because our prevalence survey population included only two hospitals. Evidence from <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments strongly suggests that HR bacteria, even if classified as susceptible, can lead to the failure of CFD treatment due to the presence of an enhanced resistant subpopulation. However, this enhanced resistance in the HR subpopulation is unstable and may be associated with a fitness cost. The instability of resistance and the associated fitness costs within subpopulations may contribute to the observed variability in clinical outcomes. The underlying genetic mechanisms driving these phenomena may involve genetic duplication or the frequent mutation. In our study, WGS analyses identified several genes that appear to be related to HR. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential genetic determinants of resistance instability. However, it is important to note that the identification of these genes through WGS is only the first step in unraveling the complete picture. Further validation studies are essential to confirm the functional roles of these genes in HR and to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which they contribute to resistance instability. In order to further explore the specific mechanisms of bacterial heterogeneous resistance, we are still working on genes other than <italic>vgrG</italic> that may affect bacterial heterogeneous resistance, which is very important for the treatment of clinically resistant bacteria.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to Cha Chen (Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China) for generously providing the strains and the plasmid.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec20"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
