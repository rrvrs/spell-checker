It was filled out by medical workers from January 2021 to November 2022.</p><p>The sample consisted of 314 medical workers (57 men and 255 women), whose average age was 36.97&#x000b1;11.93. According to the level of education, the sample included specialists with secondary general education (4.14%), with secondary special education (19.4%), with incomplete higher education (11.46%), with higher education (59.87%) and PhD (5.1%). 35 people (11%) of the surveyed medical workers worked in the red zone.</p></sec><sec id="sec5499"><title>Results</title><p>Working in the red zone is significantly associated with Emotional Exhaustion (p=0.002) and Depersonalization (p=0.002), but not with a Reduction in Professionalism.</p><p>
The working conditions of medical workers who were significantly associated simultaneously with Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization and Reduction of professionalism (respectively): (1) Lack of confidence in support from the health system and the state in case of illness (r=0.170, p=0.002; r=0.202, p=0.000; r=-0.171, 0. 002); (2) Inability to meet the usual personal needs (daily routine, nutrition, communication with loved ones) as employment increases at work (r=0.200, p=0.000; r=0.154, p=0.006; r=-0.186, 0. 001); (3) Lack of confidence in their own professional competence in the fight against COVID-19 due to lack of knowledge about COVID-19 (r=0.202, p=0.000; r=0.148, p=0.009; r=-0.211, 0. 000); (4) Lack of confidence in their own effectiveness in the fight against COVID-19 due to the increase in the volume of work and the expansion of the scope of professional responsibilities (r=0.234, p=0.000; r=0.152, p=0.007; r=-0.177, 0. 002); (5) Lack of access to up-to-date information about COVID-19 (r=0.190, p=0.001; r=0.158, p=0.005; r=-0.140, 0. 013).</p><p>The Emotional Exhaustion scale is also associated with the fear of getting infected and getting sick with COVID-19 (r=0.125; p=0.026), as well as the lack of quick access to testing when COVID-19 symptoms appear (r=0.169; p=0.003).</p></sec><sec id="sec5500"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thus, not only work in the red zone, but also many specific working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic can become a provocateur factor for the deterioration of the emotional state of medical workers.</p><p>Disclosure: Research is supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project No. 21-18-00624.</p></sec><sec id="sec5501"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
