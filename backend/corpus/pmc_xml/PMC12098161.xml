A novel mitophagy inducer, TJ0113, was used for treatment during ALF pathogenesis. In this study, we used a novel mitophagy inducer, TJ0113, to investigate the effects and mechanisms of TAA-induced ALF mice. The results showed that TJ0113 could enhance mitophagy through Parkin/PINK1 and ATG5 pathways, which in turn attenuated mitochondrial damage, hepatocyte apoptosis, nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B/NLRP3 signaling activation and inflammatory responses after TAA. Metabolomics results showed that TJ0113 mainly regulated lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism in the livers of ALF mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis yielded that TJ0113 was involved in the development of ALF by regulating the P13K/AKT signaling pathway. The key highlight of this work is the use of an aberration-free line-scanning confocal Raman imager (AFLSCRI) to study the molecular changes in blood, liver tissue, gastrocnemius muscle, and mitochondrial extracts in ALF mice after TJ0113 treatment. Compared to the measurement with conventional assays, Raman microspectroscopy (micro-Raman) offers the benefits of being rapid, non-invasive, label-free and real-time. Our results found good agreement between Raman signals and histopathologic findings. The system has good performance with a spatial resolution of 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, a spectral resolution of 4&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and a fast detection speed improved by 2 orders. Innovations in this test contribute to clinical diagnosis of disease, personalized treatment, effective intraoperative guidance and accurate prognosis. The data may help in the development of a non-invasive clinical device for mitochondrial damage using bedside micro-Raman.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><bold>Study on the workflow and mechanism of mitophagy induced by TJ0113 based on mirco-Raman.

Drug-induced liver injury has become a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF) and transplantation [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ALF is a medical emergency, and fulminant functional hepatic insufficiency leads to rapid clinical deterioration and high mortality [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, liver transplantation is limited by the rapid progression of ALF, the high cost of surgery, and the shortage of donor livers. In addition to thioacetamide (TAA) [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], established mouse models utilizing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/<sc>d</sc>-galactosamine (D-GaIN), acetaminophen (APAP) [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) are also commonly used in modeling ALF [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Regardless of the etiology, severe hepatocellular mitochondrial dysfunction and a persistent hepatic inflammatory response are the main features of ALF [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. Therefore, enhancing mitophagy and modulating hepatic inflammation is a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of ALF [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">Mitochondria are central players in cellular energy metabolism. They participate in necrotic cell death and programmed apoptosis, and are crucial for cell metabolism and survival [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent studies have found that mitochondria are key drivers of cell death-associated inflammation, and that damaged mitochondria can activate NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles and initiate pro-apoptotic mechanisms, leading to apoptosis [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mitophagy prevents the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the initiation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by selectively removing damaged and excess mitochondria [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In ALF caused by heat stroke, Huang et al. found that overexpression of P53 and silencing of Parkin could inhibit mitophagy to aggravate ALF [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mitochondria play a central role in regulating cell death and ALF induced by various drugs. Timely clearance of damaged mitochondria is critical for the progression of ALF, whether the ALF is induced by acetaminophen, alcohol or other etiologic causes [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there is a lack of effective mitophagy inducers, and it is unclear whether pharmacologic activation of mitophagy can inhibit ALF.</p><p id="p0045">UMI-77 was originally recognized as a Mcl-1 inhibitor that inhibits cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mcl-1 is a recently discovered mitophagy receptor that interacts with LC3A on the mitochondrial surface to initiate mitophagy [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It was demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease mice, sepsis, lupus nephritis, and renal fibrosis mice that UMI-77 slowed down disease progression by activating mitophagy. UMI-77 showed the potential to induce mitophagy, suggesting that Mcl-1 may mediate mitophagy activation [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. Most known mitophagy inducers, such as CCCP, were found in previous studies to force cells to undergo mitophagy mainly by damaging mitochondria. Cen et al. found that UMI-77 did not damage mitochondria, instead, UMI-77 could cause selective degradation of damaged mitochondria [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. TJ0113 is a derivative of UMI-77. TJ0113 has better drug-forming properties and stronger selective autophagy induction than UMI-77 [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">Current methods of assaying mitochondrial function require isolation and purification of mitochondria or the use of fluorescent probes, which may interfere with normal mitochondrial function [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Raman microspectroscopy (micro-Raman) is a label-free, non-invasive detection technique with sharp, well-defined spectral peaks that can identify molecules by their unique vibrational fingerprints, making it more suitable for quantitative studies [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Micro-Raman is an attractive alternative to <italic>in vivo</italic> spectroscopic studies, offering high lateral and spectral resolution, as well as sensitivity and specificity more than 90&#x000a0;% [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Compared to traditional assays, micro-Raman is not only noninvasive but also allows for real-time detection of mitochondrial changes. Many recent studies have found that micro-Raman (often combined with surface-enhanced chips to improve the Raman signals) can be used to assay mitochondrial function in isolated cells, tissues and blood [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) micro-Raman (without invasive surface-enhanced chips) measurement of mitophagy is a promising approach to quantify the alteration of mitophagy during drug therapy for ALF.</p><p id="p0055">In this study, we used two Raman imaging systems, a conventional point-scan Raman imaging system and an aberration-free line-scanning confocal Raman imager (AFLSCRI) developed by us. The AFLSCRI system has good performance with a spatial resolution of 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, a spectral resolution of 4&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and a detection speed which is 2 orders of magnitude faster than the conventional system. AFLSCRI was developed in our previous study to identify various types and sizes of microplastics [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Here, we used our AFLSCRI of high SNR (without the assistance of any invasive surface-enhanced chip) to assess the mitophagy status in the blood and tissues of ALF mice and further investigated the ameliorative effects of TJ0113 treatment on mitochondrial function, organ damage, hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Raman microspectroscopy (micro-Raman)</title><sec id="sec2.1.1"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Blood sample testing system setup</title><p id="p0060">Under 532&#x000a0;nm excitation, cytochrome (cyt) c and cyt <italic>b</italic> can be selectively enhanced through resonance enhancement effects, and are clearly visible through Raman spectroscopy.

The system includes a single-mode fiber-coupled 532&#x000a0;nm laser (FC-D-532-400mW, Changchun) and a fiber-optic Raman spectrometer (QE Pro-Raman, Ocean Insight), connected to the excitation and collection fibers of a Raman fiber probe (RPB-532, Ocean China). The laser output power and spectrometer integration time were adjusted to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. The probe tip was placed close to or in contact with the sample surface, maintaining a certain working distance to avoid damaging the probe or the sample. The laser and spectrometer were then activated to collect, observe, and record Raman scattering signals. If measurements were taken at different samples, the above steps were repeated until all measurements were completed. Ten Raman spectra were measured for each sample under 532&#x000a0;nm excitation, averaged over a collection time of 15&#x000a0;s, with a laser power of 25&#x000a0;mW.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.2"><label>2.1.2</label><title>System setup for <italic>in vivo</italic> testing gastrocnemius muscle</title><p id="p0070">In this experiment, we used the AFLSCRI from our previous paper, based on the experimental results, under the current configuration and sample conditions, the spectral resolution of the AFLSCRI system is 4 cm-1, and after calibration, the system achieves a spatial resolution of 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, the high-sensitivity confocal architecture inherently provides a tomographic effect. By applying displacement along the depth dimension, signals from different depths can be captured slice by slice, resulting in a valid imaging depth up to 50&#x02013;100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m [70,71]. This device has been optimized to meet the high sensitivity and accuracy requirements for <italic>in vivo</italic> gastrocnemius muscle detection. This not only validates the device's reliability and applicability but also ensures the comparability of experimental data.</p><p id="p0075">The system comprises three core components: the laser line generation unit, a custom-designed aberration-corrected spectrometer, and a confocal scanning microscope. The spatial resolution can reach 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, and the spectral resolution can reach 0.2&#x000a0;nm. Shorter-wavelength excitation light can produce higher Raman signals but is more likely to induce strong fluorescence signals, which can damage biological samples. Longer wavelengths are better to avoid fluorescence phenomena and biological tissue damage, but the Raman signal is weaker, which might lead to ineffective signal detection. Considering the trade-offs between fluorescence, Raman signal-to-noise ratio, and biological damage, we ultimately chose 671&#x000a0;nm instead of 532&#x000a0;nm (used in blood sample detection) as the excitation wavelength.</p><p id="p0080">Raman spectra of the gastrocnemius muscle of each mouse were measured along five lines under 671&#x000a0;nm excitation, with an exposure time of 15&#x000a0;s.

Double-membrane vesicles containing mitochondria (mitochondrial autophagosomes) were visible in hepatocytes under TEM microscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). In addition, the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion is closely coordinated with mitochondrial morphology and function. ALF leads to an upregulation of the fission-related protein Drp1, while the fusion-related markers OPA1 and Mfn2 are reduced, indicating an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B&#x02013;E). TJ0113 partially undoes the changes in the mitochondrial dynamics markers. Furthermore, the IHC of the specific oxidative DNA damage marker (8-OHdG) was significantly enhanced after ALF treatment and significantly reduced after TJ0113 treatment, indicating reduced ROS generation and improved oxidative damage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>F&#x02013;G).<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>TJ0113 enhanced mitophagy and ameliorated mitochondrial damage in ALF mouse he<bold>patocytes.</bold> (A) Representative images of different groups of ALF mice immune-fluorescently double-labeled with TOM20 (green) and LAMP1 (red), magnified (1000&#x000d7;).

Mcl-1 is a newly discovered mitophagy receptor [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mcl-1 dissociates from the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.

TJ0113 has better drug-forming properties and stronger selective autophagy induction than UMI -77, and TJ0113 has been approved by the FDA to enter clinical studies. We used TJ0113 to treat TAA-induced ALF mice and found that mitophagy markers (LC3A/B, Mcl-1, and LAMP1) were elevated while TOM20 was decreased. Subsequently, we examined the expression of molecules related to the classical and non-classical pathways of mitophagy. The results show that TJ0113 can induce mitophagy through PINK1/Parkin and ATG5 signaling. In addition, we found increased 8-OHDG expression in ALF mice, indicating severe oxidative DNA damage. Electron microscopy experiments showed that mitochondria exhibited irregular swelling, length shortening and cristae breakage after TAA treatment.

The assay results revealed that the Raman signals of ALF mice were significantly different from those of the control and TJ0113 treatment groups. Similarly, we extracted mitochondria from liver tissue for Raman detection and obtained results consistent with the Raman signal of liver tissue. In addition to Raman testing, we used traditional biochemical and histopathological tests to validate our Raman signal results.</p><p id="p0265">In this study, we chose to use AFLSCRI instead of nonlinear Raman techniques such as Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) or Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS). Although SRS and CARS have advantages in imaging speed and tissue penetration depth, AFLSCRI can provide complete Raman spectroscopic information at each measurement point, allowing us to conduct comprehensive analysis of multiple biochemical components simultaneously. In addition, the equipment required for AFLSCRI is simpler and easier to obtain, and operates at lower laser power, reducing the risk of light damage to the sample and maintaining cell integrity. Based on the above factors, AFLSCRI is more suitable for our research objectives and helps to accurately evaluate mitochondrial function under experimental conditions. We continuously detected the mitochondrial functional changes after pretreatment with TJ0113. After TJ01113 was given to induce mitophagy 1&#x000a0;h before TAA modeling, the blood of the tail vein of the mice was continuously monitored. The results in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> showed that the Raman signal was relatively stable in the 1128&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> peak in the control group, whereas it decreased rapidly in the TAA group, and the damage was most serious at the 24&#x000a0;h after modeling (and the mice were dead), which indicated that TAA induced the redox dysfunction of mitochondria, and the content of cytochromes decreased. The Raman signals of the TJ0113-treated groups showed a tendency to increase and then decrease, and reached the peak value at 24&#x000a0;h after the treatment, higher than the control group, and reached the peak value at 30&#x000a0;h after the treatment, which was lower than the control group. These results suggest that TJ0113 can induce mitophagy to reduce mitochondrial damage and thus improve ALF, and similar results have been obtained in the blood of type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p id="p0270">Sepsis combined with multi-organ failure and cerebral edema remains the leading cause of death in patients with ALF, and early detection and appropriate management can alter the course of ALF [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Mitochondrial function, which represents the redox state, has been found to be severely impaired in skeletal and leg muscles in patients with sepsis [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Raman spectrum measurement was found to be more effective in monitoring gastrocnemius muscle mitochondrial redox status, which can help in early recognition of sepsis severity and prognosis [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, Raman signal detection of mitochondrial redox status in the gastrocnemius muscle may allow early identification and prediction of ALF outcome. We used Raman signaling to continuously monitor the mitochondria of mouse gastrocnemius muscle to assess the therapeutic effect. By evaluating the mitochondrial Raman signals in mouse gastrocnemius muscle after TAA administration 1&#x000a0;h before modeling, 4&#x000a0;h after modeling, and 12&#x000a0;h after modeling, we found that TJ0113 pretreatment and early ALF administration had a therapeutic effect on the progression of ALF. TJ0113 given at 12&#x000a0;h of modeling induced mitophagy with little effect in ALF mice. Raman microscopy has the benefit of being faster, label-free, and portable compared to conventional biochemical tests.</p><p id="p0275">Raman microscopy is increasingly used for a wide range of clinical applications, including term clinical diagnosis, effective intraoperative guidance, and accurate prognosis [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The technology is being explored in depth in cancer diagnosis and prediction, providing a new direction for early cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Compared with traditional clinical methods, micro-Raman has faster and more reliable clinical detection, treatment and monitoring methods to enhance its clinical applications [<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>].</p><p id="p0280">Our study also faces the following limitations: 1) There are various models of ALF, and our study only used one, which imposes certain limitations; 2) We did not perform tests on ALF patients, so future research could consider including this aspect; 3) The skin acts as a barrier to Raman signals from mitochondrial damage in the gastrocnemius muscle. In the future, devices capable of penetrating the skin or topical agents may be developed, but as these have not yet been tested on humans, they present certain limitations. Additionally, spectral overlap among different molecules is an issue that requires attention in Raman spectroscopy analysis [<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Especially within the complex environment of biological systems, multiple molecules may coexist and generate similar spectral features. In our study, we selected the Raman peak at 1128&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (associated to cytochrome <italic>c</italic>) as an indicator of mitochondrial redox status, mainly due to its clean region with little interference with other mitochondrial molecules. For example, the Gauche C&#x02013;C stretching (dominant in fluid-phase membranes or unsaturated lipids) vibrations of disordered acyl chains in phospholipids (e.g., mitochondrial membrane lipids) exhibit Raman peaks in the range of 1080&#x02013;1100&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is close to but can be distinguished from our targeted Raman signals 1128&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; valine has its primary Raman peak at 935&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (the closest secondary peak to 1128&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is 1122&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, but still minor interference). Advanced technologies such as SERS (surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy), polarized Raman spectroscopy (to differentiate ordered (trans) vs. disordered (gauche) lipid phases) and low-temperature Raman (to reduces thermal broadening) can be utilized to reduce potential interference with other mitochondrial molecules. Under the experimental conditions of our study, the Raman peak at 1128&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is shown to be a reliable indicator of mitochondrial redox status for acute liver failure. Finally, while we primarily focused on monitoring cytochrome <italic>c</italic> via Raman spectroscopy to assess mitophagy in ALF, we recognize that incorporating additional biomarkers&#x02014;such as NADH (with characteristic peaks at 480, 710, and 1600&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and lipid peroxidation products (evidenced by a C<private-char name="E00C" description="bond, double bond"><!-- PBM data was replaced with SVG by xgml2pxml:

However, challenges such as spectral overlap and inherently weak signals may require improved Raman methods such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) or resonance Raman, or Polarized Raman spectroscopy and further advanced deconvolution approaches (e.g., PCA or PLSR) to improve sensitivity [<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In future work, we plan to integrate these biomarkers to provide a holistic view of the biochemical changes during ALF, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="p0285">There are three main innovations presented in this study. First, our use of Raman spectroscopy enables real&#x02010;time, label&#x02010;free detection of mitochondrial damage in blood. Second, we demonstrate the rapid, non-invasive <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring of acute liver failure (ALF) progression using Raman imaging. Third, continuous Raman monitoring of the mouse gastrocnemius muscle provides valuable insights that guide drug therapy. Together, these innovations open a new avenue for early clinical diagnosis, therapeutic management, and prognostic evaluation of ALF patients&#x02014;and may also be applicable to other diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction. Future studies will be essential to further validate and expand the clinical utility of this Raman approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0290"><bold>Chunlian Huang:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation. <bold>Jiaqi Liao:</bold> Writing &#x02013; original draft, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data curation. <bold>Xufeng Cen:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Resources. <bold>Changwei Jiao:</bold> Resources. <bold>Sijia Chen:</bold> Data curation. <bold>Dong Liu:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing. <bold>Hang-Shuai Qu:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing. <bold>Jiansheng Zhu:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Funding acquisition. <bold>Sailing He:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Supervision, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec6"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0295">Data supporting the results of this study are available in the original manuscript and its Supplementary Information.
