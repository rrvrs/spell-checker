Relapse is often associated with the disruptive re-hospitalization of patients. Importantly, relapse history is a strong predictor of subsequent relapses and poorer outcomes. Therefore, relapse prevention in the beginning of the disorder is especially important. Cariprazine, a novel D<sub>3</sub>-D<sub>2</sub> partial agonist, has been effective in preventing relapse compared to placebo in stabilized patients with schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2805"><title>Objectives</title><p>To present the efficacy of cariprazine in preventing relapse in patients with early-stage schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2806"><title>Methods</title><p>Post-hoc analysis of data from a &#x002dc;96 weeks, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adults with schizophrenia. The study was composed of two parts: a 20-week open-label treatment phase and a double-blind treatment phase up to 72 weeks. During the open-label phase, patients were stabilized with cariprazine 3.0-9.0 mg/day. Then, they were randomized to continue cariprazine (fixed dosing: 3.0, 6.0, or 9.0 mg/day) or receive placebo. Relapse was defined as a deterioration of symptom scores as measured by the Positive Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), admission to a psychiatric hospital, exhibiting aggressive behaviour, or risk of suicide. In the present analysis, patients with a schizophrenia diagnosis history of 0-5 years were defined as early-stage patients. Baseline characteristics, and risk ratios (after the double-blind phase) with number-needed-to-treat (NNT) were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2807"><title>Results</title><p>Of 200 patients, 71 (35.5%) met the early-stage criteria: 32 patients in the cariprazine (CAR) and 39 in the placebo (PBO) arm. The mean age was 31.6 years in both groups with an average illness duration of 2.51+/-1.03 years in the CAR and 2.75+/-1.24 years in the PBO arm. 47% of patients in the CAR arm and 77% in the PBO arm were men. The average number of previous hospitalisations was comparable in the two groups (CAR: 2.3; PBO: 2.6), as was the severity of illness: mean PANSS Total score: 89.2 (CAR), 90.4 (PBO). Patients in both groups were highly compliant (pill-count: CAR: 98.2%; PBO: 99.5%). The main reported adverse effects were headache (CAR: 11.3%, PBO: 7.0%), insomnia (CAR: 5.6%, PBO: 4.2%), and increased triglycerides (CAR: 5.6%, PBO: 1.4%), discontinuation due to adverse event was 3.1% in the CAR and 2.6% in the PBO group. Altogether, 9.4% of patients relapsed in the cariprazine group compared to 48.7% on placebo (risk ratio=0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.3-59.2%, p=0.0041;NNT: 2.5 (95%CI: 1.7-5.1).</p></sec><sec id="sec2808"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this post-hoc analysis of patients within the first five years of schizophrenia, the relative risk of relapse was 81% reduced with cariprazine with prevention of one additional relapse after each third patient exposed to cariprazine vs placebo. Cariprazine seems to be a good treatment option for early-stage patients for preventing relapse.</p></sec><sec id="sec2809"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>C.
