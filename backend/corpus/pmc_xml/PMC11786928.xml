</p><sec id="erv3152-sec-0020"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (AAN) was introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM&#x02010;5; American Psychiatric Association [APA], <xref rid="erv3152-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) to categorise individuals with significant eating disorder pathology and restriction of intake, but without the resulting low body weight needed for an Anorexia Nervosa (AN) diagnosis. To be diagnosed with AAN, all criteria for AN need to be met (restriction of intake, intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, undue influence of body weight or shape on self&#x02010;evaluation) but &#x0201c;despite significant weight loss, the individual's weight remains within or above the normal range&#x0201d; (APA&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, the DSM&#x02010;5 lacks precise guidance on what constitutes &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019;, when the loss had to occur, and at what rate. Such an imprecise definition of AAN has led to various operationalisations of &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019; in research settings, with some researchers overlooking the weight loss criterion altogether (e.g., Beard and Waller&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Harrop et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Walsh, Hagan, and Lockwood&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). This ambiguity is likely to result in inconsistent research findings, which ultimately has a clinical impact on patients (e.g., risk of missed diagnoses, inappropriate treatment).</p><p>There have been several research efforts to better define AAN, particularly the &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019; criterion. For example, Sawyer et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) propose significant weight loss should be more than 10% of pre&#x02010;morbid body weight, while the individual does not become significantly underweight (&#x02265; 90% of median body mass index (mBMI) for age and gender). On the other hand, Forney et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and Herb Neff et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>) found that even just 5% weight loss is associated with significant eating disorder pathology. Such inconsistencies have implications for aspects such as identification and prevalence rates. For example, Wade and O'Shea&#x000a0;(<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) identified an overall prevalence rate of 1.9% for AAN when operationalising significant weight loss as a reduction of 1.3&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in BMI. However, when removing this weight loss criterion, an additional 4.7% could be identified. Importantly, those individuals without weight loss demonstrated similar levels of impairment to those with weight loss, as well as compared to individuals with full threshold eating disorder diagnoses (Wade &#x00026; O'Shea&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Similarly, evidence shows that those with AAN have equal or higher levels of eating disorder pathology compared to those with AN or other full threshold eating disorders (Sawyer et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Walsh, Hagan, and Lockwood&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Thus, appropriate identification is imperative to ensure that suitable treatment and level of care are provided in a timely manner (Manwaring et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p><p>Despite a growing body of research into AAN, there remains ambiguity in terms of how eating disorder clinicians perceive the utility of the AAN diagnosis in clinical settings. A key issue in facilitating uptake by clinicians of any such diagnostic criteria is understanding their perspective on what would be important to consider in defining AAN. As clinicians play a pivotal role in the identification of possible AAN, it is important to understand how they use the DSM&#x02010;5 diagnosis in practice, and to explore their perspectives on how it could be better defined. Understanding clinicians' perspectives on the AAN diagnosis is crucial, as it can ultimately inform improvements that have a direct impact on patient identification and treatment.</p><p>The current study reports on the qualitative element of a larger mixed methods experimental study using an online survey to investigate how clinicians diagnose AAN (Beard, Wade, and Waller&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Clinicians were asked to respond to two open&#x02010;ended questions: &#x0201c;What changes are required to the DSM&#x02010;5 definition of AAN?&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;How do you think significant weight loss should be defined?&#x0201d;, which were analysed using content analysis. Thus, the aim of the current study is to understand how AAN could be better defined, from clinicians' perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0030"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="erv3152-sec-0040"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>This study is part of a mixed methods experimental study investigating clinician confidence in diagnosing AAN. The quantitative element of the study has been reported elsewhere (Beard, Wade, and Waller&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). The current study describes the qualitative element, where participants completed an online survey and were asked to answer two open&#x02010;ended questions relating to possible refinement of the DSM&#x02010;5 AAN definition. The study was approved by the University of Sheffield Ethics Committee (Ref. 051548) and was pre&#x02010;registered (<ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/ht53c/" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/ht53c/</ext-link>). The current study has one deviation from the pre&#x02010;registration, as content analysis was used to analyse text responses, rather than thematic analysis. This approach was seen as more appropriate, given the limited number of questions asked of the participants.</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0050"><label>2.2</label><title>Participants</title><p>An opportunity sample of 47 clinicians working with eating disorders were recruited through professional contacts and through advertisements to professional organisations and societies. Potential participants were given a link in the recruitment advertisement to an online information sheet and consent form. Those who chose to take part in the study continued to the online Qualtrics questionnaire, which they completed anonymously.</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0060"><label>2.3</label><title>Measure and Procedure</title><p>This study describes the qualitative element of a wider study investigating clinician confidence in diagnosing AAN (Beard, Wade, and Waller&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Participants completed an online Qualtrics questionnaire requiring them to read twelve short case vignettes based on fictitious patients who varied in their level of weight loss (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%) and end weight (high, normal, borderline low weight/BMI). Participants were asked to rate how confident that each patient would be diagnosed with AAN, or another diagnosis (e.g., AN, Bulimia Nervosa etc.). Following this quantitative element of the study, participants were asked to read the DSM&#x02010;5 definition of AAN, then to answer the following two questions: &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">What changes do you think are required to the DSM&#x02010;5 Atypical Anorexia Nervosa diagnosis, if any</italic>?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">How do you think significant weight loss should be defined?&#x0201d;.</italic>
</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0070"><label>2.4</label><title>Data Analysis</title><p>This study used descriptive qualitative methodology to examine textual responses to the two open&#x02010;ended questions. This method aims to &#x02018;stay close&#x02019; to the data by describing the perspective of participants rather than explain or interpret them (Sandelowski&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Content analysis, guided by the steps outlined in Elo and Kyng&#x000e4;s&#x000a0;(<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), was utilised to identify patterns, themes and frequencies within the data. We did not have specific hypotheses about what the data would demonstrate about clinicians' reasoning and opinions about the changes needed to DSM&#x02010;5 or the level of weight change that would be significant. Therefore, rather than a deductive approach, an inductive approach was used to explore the data with no preconceived themes or categories in order to discover any unexpected insights. Responses were copied from Qualtrics into a Word document, and one author (JB) became familiar with the responses. [JB] initially created open codes, which formed the basis of the coding sheets. Both authors (JB and GW) then independently used the coding sheet to code the responses to each question. Any discrepancies between the two authors were discussed in order to reach an agreement. Codes were grouped under main categories, generic categories, and subcategories. The authors who coded the responses include a research assistant (JB) who delivers brief cognitive&#x02010;behavioural therapy for non&#x02010;underweight eating disorders (including AAN), and an experienced eating disorder researcher and clinical supervisor who co&#x02010;developed CBT&#x02010;T for non&#x02010;underweight eating disorders (GW).</p><sec id="erv3152-sec-0080"><label>2.4.1</label><title>Inter&#x02010;Rater Agreement on Coding for Content Analysis</title><p>Each author independently analysed the data. Overall percentage agreement was high. Agreement on codes within the &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">changes suggested to the DSM criteria&#x0201d;</italic> category was 76.3% (Cohen's kappa&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.749), indicating substantial agreement. Similarly, agreement on codes within the &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">how &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019; should be defined&#x0201d;</italic> category was 85.3% (Cohen's kappa&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.841). Disagreements and discrepancies (e.g., where one rater identified a code and the other did not) were resolved through discussion until consensus (100% agreement) was achieved.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0090"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="erv3152-sec-0100"><label>3.1</label><title>Clinician Demographics</title><p>Forty&#x02010;seven clinicians took part in the study.

Four clinicians agreed that the rate of weight loss should be quick or over a short period, but again, no clear definition of this rate was suggested.

It is possible that these clinicians are alluding to the problem identified in the first question, which states there is currently no guidance on how to distinguish someone with AAN versus someone without an eating disorder who might be dieting to lose weight. These clinicians highlighted the need to specify that the restriction is extreme or out of balance, for example: &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">Losing a significant percentage of body weight in a comparatively short amount of time through severely restrictive eating (&#x0003c; 75%&#x02013;50% of BMR)</italic>&#x0201d;.

Thus, although a quarter of clinicians agreed that there is not a one&#x02010;size&#x02010;fits&#x02010;all approach to defining significant weight loss, the results suggest a lack of consensus among clinicians on what individual differences do need to be taken into consideration.</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0230"><label>3.3.5</label><title>Health Related Qualifiers</title><p>Similar to the &#x02018;individualised criteria&#x02019; category, 16 clinicians stated that the &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019; definition needs to include an indicator of impact on physical and/or mental/cognitive health, which understandably will vary on an individual basis. For example, assessment of whether weight loss has been &#x02018;significant&#x02019; can be ascertained by whether there has been a resulting medical instability (e.g., bradycardia, orthostatic blood pressure) or whether menstrual function has been impacted.</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0240"><label>3.3.6</label><title>No Changes Needed</title><p>Only one clinician believed the current DSM&#x02010;5 definition of &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019; is sufficient, stating &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">definition is already given in the first criteria (impact on physical health)</italic>&#x0201d;.

Content analysis was used to analyse 47 clinicians' responses to two open&#x02010;ended questions: &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">What changes do you think are required to the DSM&#x02010;5 Atypical Anorexia Nervosa diagnosis, if any</italic>?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">How do you think significant weight loss should be defined?&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><p>Clinicians overwhelmingly favoured revising the current DSM&#x02010;5 definition of AAN. Only five clinicians (10.6%) stated no change is needed, highlighting a strong consensus that the definition is inadequate. The most frequent concern, echoing previous qualitative research (Dimitropoulos et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), was how to operationalise &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019;. This suggests that clinicians believe weight loss remains a relevant criterion for diagnosing AAN, and that they wish to have clear guidance on how to define it in the absence of the low body weight criterion typically associated with AN.</p><p>Over a quarter of clinicians (27.7%) believed that significant weight loss should be defined clearly as a specific rate (i.e., a specified amount over a specified period). In addition, clinicians reported needing clearer identifiers and qualifiers of AAN beyond just the weight criterion. For example, they were seeking definitions relating to the presence of eating disorder behaviours and cognitions (e.g., bingeing, purging, fear of weight gain) and medical markers of impact (e.g., bradycardia, amenorrhea). This search for clarity is important, as previous research has found that even just 5% weight loss is associated with elevated eating disorder pathology and distress, but only when combined with cognitive concerns (Forney et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Notably, Forney et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) found that this definition effectively distinguishes AAN from weight loss in the absence of cognitive concerns. They highlight that this distinction avoids the over&#x02010;pathologising of weight loss more generally, which was a concern raised by clinicians in the current study. It can thus be summarised that clinicians would like clear guidelines on what constitutes &#x02018;significant weight loss&#x02019;, and the accompanying characteristics that would need to be present in order to differentiate AAN from other eating disorder diagnoses, or from healthy weight loss in general.</p><p>On the other hand, 13 clinicians (27.7%) disagree with clarifying or amending the AAN definition, proposing its removal instead. Their primary suggestion was to combine AN and AAN into one restrictive eating disorder diagnosis. This suggestion aligns with evidence that AN and AAN demonstrate similar levels of physical impairment and psychopathology (e.g., Sawyer et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Wade &#x00026; O'Shea&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), suggesting that these clinicians do not believe a weight&#x02010;based distinction (which was supported by a larger number of eating disorder clinicians here) has clinical value. Furthermore, this group suggested that merging the diagnoses could help reduce weight stigma, which has been associated with delayed care, prolonged eating disorder behaviours, suboptimal treatment environments, and weight discrimination (Harrop et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>Evidently, there is disagreement among clinicians regarding the value of a weight loss criterion for AAN and of a weight&#x02010;based distinction between AN and AAN. Further research is needed to investigate the clinical utility of a distinct AAN diagnosis, considering the possibility of combining AN and AAN into one restrictive eating disorder diagnosis. Nonetheless, the issue of identifying individuals who will fall into such a category will likely remain. To address this, future iterations of the DSM should provide clear guidance on characteristics associated with this group (beyond any weight&#x02010;based criterion), regardless of whether a separate or combined diagnosis exists. Previous research has already highlighted characteristics typically associated with AAN, including eating behaviours (e.g., Jablonski et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), psychopathology (e.g., Davenport et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Johnson&#x02010;Munguia et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), and medical complications (e.g., Nagata et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Sawyer et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3152-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Delphi studies could be a valuable approach to achieve consensus on which characteristics need to be considered as key in the DSM. Not only could this approach provide guidance on which criteria an individual needs to meet to reach a diagnosis, but it could also offer clinician&#x02010;driven indices of severity that could aid treatment decision&#x02010;making in clinical practice.</p><p>It is important to consider the limitations of this study. Opportunity sampling was used to recruit clinicians, with recruitment primarily being advertised in professional organisations. This sample therefore might not be representative of the broader clinician population who diagnose eating disorders. Furthermore, this study focused only on clinicians' perspectives of the AAN definition. Further qualitative research including patient experiences could provide a more complete understanding of the challenges of diagnosing AAN under the current DSM&#x02010;5 definition. Future research could also carry out more detailed verbal interviews with participants to allow for more in&#x02010;depth questioning of this topic via other qualitative approaches (e.g., thematic analysis based on more diverse questions), as the current study only analysed text&#x02010;based responses to two questions. Finally, we acknowledge that only having one author create the initial codes for this study could increase the risk of bias, although there was high inter&#x02010;rater agreement between authors when coding the responses.</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0260"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>To summarise, there is substantial diversity of opinion among clinicians regarding the utility of the DSM&#x02010;5 definition of AAN. Many clinicians emphasised the need for a more nuanced and comprehensive approach, extending beyond the current weight&#x02010;based distinction between AN and AAN. Further qualitative and quantitative research is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the perspectives of clinicians, patients, and other key stakeholders. This research could inform future AAN definitions in DSM, ensuring that it accurately reflects the complexities of this condition and enhances clinical understanding and interventions.</p></sec><sec id="erv3152-sec-0270"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Both authors conceptualised the paper and contributed to writing the final manuscript and approved the submitted version.
