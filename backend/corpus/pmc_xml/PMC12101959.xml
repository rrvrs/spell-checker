Incident CKD stage 4 was defined as the presence of 2 eGFR values&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] 2009 equation<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> assuming non-Black race) separated by a minimum of 90 days during the study period. A patient was considered a &#x0201c;prevalent metformin user&#x0201d; if they were prescribed metformin for more than 80% of the year before the index date (calculation of the medication possession ratio assuming a daily dose of 1,500&#x000a0;mg of metformin). Metformin discontinuation was defined as a gap of 90 days or more in metformin prescription records.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Treatment Strategies</title><p id="p0050">In this emulated target trial, we compared the following 2 treatment strategies:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0055">Stop metformin within 6 months of reaching CKD stage&#x000a0;4.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0060">Continue metformin for at least 6 months after reaching CKD stage&#x000a0;4.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0065">Each study participant was duplicated (ie, virtually cloned), with each replicate assigned to 1 of the above-mentioned treatment strategies (1 assigned to stopping, the other to continuing), thereby making both study arms perfectly identical at baseline. At monthly intervals, we determined whether clones were adherent to their assigned treatment strategies. Those who deviated were artificially censored. Replicates assigned to the first strategy (&#x0201c;stop metformin within 6 months&#x0201d;) were censored at the end of the grace period had they not stopped metformin by that time.</p><p id="p0070">Replicates assigned to the second strategy (&#x0201c;continue metformin for at least 6 months&#x0201d;) were censored if they stopped metformin before the end of the 6-month grace period, at the time they stopped taking their treatment. Artificial censoring due to deviation from the assigned treatment strategy is likely to be informative, thereby introducing selection bias, which is addressed by the use of inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting (IPCW). This differs from administrative censoring or censoring due to loss of follow-up where IPCW does not apply. Of note, an event only contributes to the arm in which the patient is still uncensored at the time of event, thereby controlling for immortal time bias. For instance, individuals who die within the grace period without stopping metformin have their replicates contributing follow-up time and a death event to both arms.</p><p id="p0075">The choice of a 6-month grace period aimed to enable sufficient time for physicians to make the decision to stop metformin in a prevalent user. The number of individuals discontinuing metformin regularly decreased with time from the index date with an important drop around 6-7&#x000a0;months, explaining the choice for this cutoff point (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig&#x000a0;S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5"><title>Start and End of Follow-up</title><p id="p0080">For each patient included in the cohort, the start of follow-up (time zero) was the date of the serum creatinine test corresponding to the second eGFR below 30&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>. Follow-up continued until occurrence of an outcome of&#x000a0;interest, loss to follow-up, administrative censoring (April&#x000a0;30, 2019), or 3 years, whichever came first.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.6"><title>Study Outcomes</title><p id="p0085">The primary outcome was all-cause mortality ascertained by NRS death records.

Categorical variables were presented as percentages.</p><p id="p0100">Metformin use after the index date was inferred from pharmacy dispensation claims, assuming a daily dose of 1,000 mg. This was derived from the subgroup of patients for whom strength, number of pills, and directions were available (about 38% of the cohort). This enabled calculating the number of days of supply and defining when (if ever) treatment was discontinued (gap of 180 days or more).</p><p id="p0105">Data were analyzed using the clone-censor-weight (CCW) method.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The CCW method is implemented in 3 successive steps (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig S3</xref>): first, each participant is cloned (duplicated) and assigned to a different strategy; then replicates are censored if and when they deviate from their assigned strategy; and finally, IPCW is used to adjust for the selection bias introduced by the censoring. Individual probabilities of remaining uncensored at each monthly interval were predicted using a pooled regression model with being uncensored as the outcome with time-fixed independent variables (age, sex, deprivation level, smoking status) and time-varying confounders including exposure to medications, comorbidities (cancer, heart diseases, etc), laboratory measurements (eGFR, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> [HbA<sub>1c</sub>]), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure), number of hospitalizations, as well as number of eGFR and HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements in the past year and diabetes duration. A separate model was fitted in each arm to capture potential treatment&#x02013;covariates interactions. The weights are the inverse of these probabilities.</p><p id="p0110">In the control arm (continue metformin), we cumulated probabilities over time while in the stopping arm there was only 1 possible time of event (censoring at 6 months if metformin has not been stopped by the end of the grace period); therefore, only 1 censoring probability was computed. Because individuals are present in both treatment strategies (due to the cloning step), there is no possible confounding at baseline. The covariate balance between the 2 arms was evaluated at the end of the grace period using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and plotted on a Love plot. Weighted cumulative incidence curves were estimated using a Kaplan-Meier estimator.</p><p id="p0115">Outcome models included an indicator for time (integers representing the monthly intervals), treatment strategy, an interaction between them, and the weights estimated in the weight model. Additional statistical details are provided in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Item S2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.8"><title>Sensitivity Analyses</title><p id="p0120">In the sensitivity analyses, marginal structural models were fitted using stabilized weights to estimate the effect of time-varying metformin use on outcomes in the presence of time-dependent confounding. IPTW was used to adjust for time-varying confounding with the numerator and denominator built through separate pooled logistic regression models. These models include discontinuation as a dependent variable, and the numerator model includes an indicator for time and all time-fixed confounders as independent variables. The denominator model additionally includes time-varying confounders among the independent variables. The denominator aims to adjust for time-varying confounding while the numerator is added to stabilize the weights, thereby preventing them from becoming increasingly large.</p><p id="p0125">Discontinuation was also defined as a period of 90 days or more free from metformin dispensation claims, and an assumption was made than once the treatment stopped it was not restarted (binary variable for discontinuation going from 0 to 1), thereby modeling time to discontinuation. This was permitted by the selection of a relatively long lag period for discontinuation after the estimated last day of supply and only a small proportion of patients restarting their treatment after stopping for 3 months or more.</p><p id="p0130">Finally, the outcome model estimating the effect of metformin discontinuation is a weighted pooled logistic regression model that includes a binary time-dependent treatment variable for discontinuation, an indicator for time, and interactions between time and all time-fixed covariates. The outcome model was then used to estimate the adjusted cumulative incidence curves.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.9"><title>Interpretation of Estimates</title><p id="p0135">Marginal structural models aim to estimate the average causal effect of treatment discontinuation on outcomes in the original study population, provided the assumptions of exchangeability, positivity, consistency, and no model misspecification are met. This is complementary to but also contrasts with the CCW approach, which aims to estimate the average causal effect of treatment discontinuation during the first 6 months after reaching CKD stage 4 compared with a sustained treatment strategy for at least 6 months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p id="p0140">Out of 371,742 Scottish residents with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes before April 30, 2019, 4.5% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16,569) reached CKD stage 4 during the study period.

It is possible that in these patients the etiology of CKD may be multifactorial with a nontraditional risk factor profile, which is less amenable to the benefits of metformin treatment. Another hypothesis is that individuals included in our study may already be at particularly high cardiovascular risk, with 38% of our cohort experiencing prior ischemic heart disease, 83% and 88% receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blocker and lipid-lowering agents, respectively, and 72% being treated with anticoagulants. Post hoc analyses of the SAVOR-TIMI 53 Trial, which included patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, suggested that exposure to metformin had no impact on mortality or cardiovascular events in the subgroup of participants with GFR less than 45&#x000a0;mL/min/m<sup>3</sup>.

Consistent with this finding, a propensity-matched cohort of around 50,000 individuals with type 2 diabetes revealed that metformin users had lower rates of bacterial pneumonia (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.84-0.94]), invasive mechanical ventilation (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73-0.82]), and respiratory-related death (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.56-0.74]).

The cohort was created using a national diabetes registry capturing over 99% of individuals with a diabetes diagnosis in Scotland. Compared with prescription data, the access to pharmacy dispensation claims reduced the risk of misclassification bias with regards to metformin exposure. Furthermore, our use of a target trial emulation design limits the risk of prevalent user and immortal time bias that is common to many traditional observational studies.</p><p id="p0215">Limitations include the potential for residual confounding, which cannot be excluded despite the application of the target trial framework, which only promotes good practices in designing observational studies. Similarly, the CCW method removes all confounding at baseline only and further adjusts for measured confounding through IPCW, but it does have the ability to account for unmeasured confounding. Misclassification bias may have occurred in relation to the ascertainment of CKD stage 4 and determination of an index date referred to as the date of &#x0201c;reaching CKD stage 4.&#x0201d; The latter was based on a second eGFR reading below 30 within the study period (separated by at least 90 days from the first one), which may have been inaccurate in some cases if resulting from 2 successive episodes of acute kidney injury. Nevertheless, this algorithm has been validated previously for CKD stage 3 or more with sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 99%, 99%, and 98%, respectively.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p id="p0220">Our cohort is likely to be representative of the UK population with diabetes but may not be generalizable to populations of different ethnicities or in countries without universal health coverage. Furthermore, the metformin prescribing data were obtained from pharmacy dispensation, so we are unable to ascertain adherence. In addition, determination of the daily dose of metformin prescribed (1,500&#x000a0;mg before the index date, 1,000 mg after) relies on an assumption inferred from the average calculated in the subgroup of the cohort for whom directions were available and does not account for different dosage regimen among patients.</p><p id="p0225">In summary, we demonstrated that continuing metformin for at least 6 months following a confirmed eGFR drop below 30&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> was associated with a small but significant decrease in all-cause mortality that did not appear to be mediated by cardioprotective effects. Further studies, including RCTs, are warranted to confirm those results and establish which mechanism could explain the reduction in all-cause mortality associated with exposure to metformin in this population.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Colhoun</surname><given-names>H.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>McKnight</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Diabetes in Scotland: a rising tide</article-title><source>Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol</source><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><year>2020</year><fpage>375</fpage><lpage>376</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32333874</pub-id>
