Exosomes are extracellular vesicles, which are involved in multiple stages of tumor progression. The role of macrophage-derived exosomes in angiogenesis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where macrophages are crucial components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), remains to be explored. The M2 macrophages and microvessels in OSCC were stained by immunohistochemistry.

Fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to observe the uptake of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). CCK-8 proliferation assay, TRANSWELL migration assay and tube formation assay were used to detect the effects of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes on the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs. Immunohistochemical study showed that M2 macrophage infiltration was positively correlated with microvessel density in OSCC.

The cellular internalization of fluorescence-labeled exosomes by HUVECs was dynamically monitored via laser scanning confocal microscopy. The M2 macrophage-derived exosomes promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube-forming ability of HUVECs.

According to statistics, in 2020, there were 377,000 new patients with oral cancer and about 177,000 new deaths due to oral cancer worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. OSCC is a malignant tumor originating from the epithelium, accounting for about 90% of oral cancer cases, and it is characterised by high recurrence and mortality rates, with lymphatic and haematogenous metastasis being its main modes of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In 1971, Judah Folkman firstly proposed that angiogenesis plays a supportive role in the growth of tumors, and that the nutrients and oxygen required for tumor growth come from the blood vessels, and angiogenesis is closely related to tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. In OSCC, Sasahira et al. found a positive correlation between microvessel density and T stage, clinical stage, local recurrence and distant metastasis of the tumor, suggesting that angiogenesis plays a contributory role in the progression of OSCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Tumor cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and the extracellular matrix surrounding or infiltrating the tumor form the TME, which is involved in tumor angiogenesis by secreting cytokines and growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Macrophages are one of the major immune cells in the TME and have attracted research interest due to their different roles at different stages of tumor progression. Macrophages in the TME are derived from bone marrow-derived monocytes and, in the early stages of tumor progression, differentiate predominantly into M1 macrophages, which exert anti-tumor effects. As the tumor progresses, influenced by cytokines secreted by malignant cells, macrophages polarise towards the M2 type, which promotes tumor progression by facilitating proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Current research indicates that the infiltration of M2 macrophages is positively correlated with the poor prognosis of various tumors, including OSCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. M2 macrophages exhibit secretory functions for pro-angiogenic cytokines and inflammatory mediators, including VEGF, PIGF and IL-1&#x003b2;. These molecular effectors drive tumor neovascularization through dual mechanisms of endothelial cell proliferation potentiation and apoptosis suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Anti-angiogenic therapeutics have emerged as a strategically significant modality in oncology. Contemporary research paradigms extend beyond VEGF pathway inhibition to encompass combinatorial approaches integrating anti-angiogenic agents with immunotherapeutic strategies. However, therapeutic limitations persist, predominantly attributable to intrinsic or adaptive drug resistance mechanisms. Microenvironmental plasticity constitutes a critical resistance determinant, mediated through TME remodeling, cancer stem cell (CSC) populations, and immunosuppressive niche formation. Notably, genomic profiling reveals that angiogenic pathway dysregulation occurs preferentially in tumor stromal compartments rather than malignant epithelial cells, suggesting stromal-targeted interventions may enhance therapeutic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, more tumor angiogenesis mechanisms need to be explored in order to provide new therapeutic targets or avoid drug resistance to anti-angiogenesis therapy. Although it has been shown that M2 macrophage infiltration in OSCC correlates with the microvessel density of the tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, however, the specific mechanisms regarding the promotion of angiogenesis by M2 macrophages in OSCC remain unelucidated.</p><p id="Par9">Exosomes are nanoscale extracellular vesicles (with diameters of approximately 30&#x02013;150 nanometers) derived from endosome structures. They achieve information exchange and material transfer between cells by delivering various bioactive components including functional proteins, genetic material, and lipid molecules to target cells.These vesicular entities exhibit particular significance in oncogenesis and malignant progression, functioning as molecular conduits that coordinate TME remodeling, metastatic niche formation, and therapeutic resistance development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Tumor cell derived exosomes can promote tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and at the same time, tumor cell derived exosomes can act on macrophages in the TME, promoting their polarisation towards M2 macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.Previous studies have shown that endothelial cells are able to take up tumor cell-derived exosomes via endocytosis, initiating the tumor angiogenic signalling pathway and promoting tumor angiogenesis, and similar reports have been made in the field of OSCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Other cells in the TME also have the ability to generate exosomes, and these nanoscale carriers are involved in the pathological process of tumor development through multiple molecular mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that infiltration of M2 macrophages is positively correlated with the microvessel density of the tumor, and the same is seen in OSCC; however, the role of their secreted exosomes in OSCC angiogenesis has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the present study focused on investigating the effects of M2 macrophage exosomes on endothelial cells, aiming to lay the foundation for the effects of M2 macrophage exosomes on angiogenesis in OSCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>M2 macrophage infiltration positively correlates with microvessel density in OSCC</title><p id="Par11">Microscopically, CD163-positive and CD31-positive cells are seen to exhibit yellow or brownish-yellow granules(Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<bold>A&#x00026;B</bold>). For microscopic counting of M2 macrophages, three areas of positive expression were randomly selected under low magnification and subsequently counted under high magnification, and the average of the three fields of view was the count of M2 macrophages.

Exclusion criteria encompassed (1) vasculature within peritumoral stromal interface zones and sclerotic tumor regions, (2) muscularized vasculature (arterioles/venules), and (3) conduits exhibiting luminal diameters exceeding 8 endothelial cell units).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">Most previous studies on exosomes and tumor angiogenesis have focused on exosomes derived from tumor cells. The innovation point of this study lies in focusing on the role of exosomes derived from M2 macrophages in angiogenesis in the TME. Firstly, the positive correlation between M2 macrophage infiltration and MVD was verified in OSCC clinical samples. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments revealed that M2 macrophage exosomes could be taken up by HUVECs, thereby significantly promoting the proliferation, migration and tube formation ability of HUVECs. It has been clarified that M2 macrophage exosomes are key mediators promoting angiogenesis in the TME, providing new ideas for analyzing the angiogenesis mechanism of OSCC and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Such as specifically blocking the internalization of M2 macrophage exosomes in endothelial cells of the TME, or taking advantage of the natural targeting property of M2 macrophage exosomes to load chemotherapy drugs to target endothelial cells, etc., thereby specifically inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, in the hope of finding new anti-angiogenic therapies.</p><p id="Par20">With the increasing understanding of the TME, it has been realised that tumors are not just islands of tumor cells alone, but complex microenvironments composed of multiple cells. Macrophages are one of the major infiltrating cells in the TME and are classified into M1 and M2 according to their different states at different stages of the tumor, where M2 macrophages are usually considered as tumor associated macrophages. In solid tumors, infiltration of M2 macrophages is mostly positively associated with poor prognosis due to its ability to promote tumor proliferation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Similarly, in OSCC, as the malignancy of the tumor increases, the proportion of M2 macrophage infiltration becomes correspondingly higher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In tumors such as breast and ovarian cancers, evidence has confirmed that M2 macrophage infiltration is positively correlated with the microvessel density of tumors, while blocking macrophage recruitment in the TME or polarising macrophages towards M1 can attenuate the angiogenic capacity of tumors, suggesting that M2 macrophages are associated with tumor angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The present study confirmed a significant positive correlation between M2 macrophages infiltrated in OSCC and the microvessel density of the tumor, which, in combination with the study of Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, suggests a potential role of M2 macrophages in promoting angiogenesis in oral squamous carcinoma.</p><p id="Par21">In the TME, the polarization of macrophages is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms. Cytokines in the TME, such as IL-4 and IL-13, can promote the polarization of M2 macrophages by activating the STAT6 signaling pathway. At the same time, hypoxic microenvironment of tumor can also promote the polarization of M2 macrophages by up-regulating the expression of VEGF and IL-4R through HIF-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, IL-4 was used to induce macrophage polarization. After IL-4 induction, the marker (CD163) of M2 macrophages increased significantly.</p><p id="Par22">Tumor angiogenesis is a complex biological process involving a variety of cytokines and signalling pathways. Tumors less than 2&#x000a0;mm in diameter can absorb nutrients from surrounding capillaries to sustain their growth. When a tumor is larger than 2&#x000a0;mm in diameter, neovascularisation is necessary to provide oxygen and nutrient support for growth, so malignant transformation of a tumor is usually accompanied by the onset of a tumor angiogenic switch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Tumor cells initiate tumor angiogenesis by secreting VEGF, which interacts with endothelial cells in the TME and activates the angiogenic signalling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Other cells in the TME participate in the angiogenic process of the tumor by interacting with each other through the release of biologically active substances and activation of signalling pathways. Numerous studies have demonstrated that M2 macrophages are pivotal in tumor angiogenesis. M2 macrophages can secrete VEGF, EGF and other angiogenic factors to directly stimulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. At the same time, M2 macrophages are able to secrete matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix to reshape the angiogenic microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Chaudhari et al. showed that M2 macrophages can secrete CCL2, IL-10, IL-13 and VEGF to promote OSCC growth and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Exosomes mediate intercellular communication by delivering biologically active substances such as genetic material, proteins and lipids from the parental cell to the recipient cell. Exosomes are involved in almost all biological processes, and research on their role in tumor progression has progressed by leaps and bounds in recent years. In terms of tumor angiogenesis, exosomes derived from tumor cells directly activate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells through the delivery of pro-angiogenic proteins. In addition, miRNAs in tumor exosomes regulate angiogenesis by targeting endothelial cell genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Exosomes are widely found in blood, urine and various body fluids, but their complex extraction methods and lower yields are the main reasons limiting their application. Despite the development of various exosome extraction methods relying on size-based separation, immunoaffinity capture, and precipitation techniques, however, the gold standard for exosome isolation is still considered to be differential centrifugation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. By filtration and differential centrifugation, larger cellular debris, particles and larger extracellular vesicles and apoptotic vesicles can be removed from the cell supernatant, eventually yielding a more purified exosome. By referring to previous studies, M2 macrophage exosomes were finally extracted by differential centrifugation in the present study.Although the extraction of exosomes has been continuously optimised, it is still difficult to completely separate exosomes from other extracellular vesicles and macromolecular protein complexes, so various methods are used to identify the extracted exosomes. Currently, the identification of exosomes mainly relies on morphological features, nanotracer technology to analyse the particle size and immunoprotein blotting technology to analyse the surface marker proteins of exosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The guidelines for the identification of exosomes issued by the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles state that only two ways are needed to complete the identification of exosomes, and in this study we used transmission electron microscopy, NTA and WB to prove that we had successfully extracted the exosomes. The cellular internalization of exosomes occurs through heterogeneous endocytic pathways, though the precise molecular choreography governing vesicle-cell interface dynamics remains incompletely resolved. Emerging evidence indicates that exosomal uptake efficiency is principally determined by recipient cell membrane proteome profiles rather than canonical exosome surface markers. Mechanistic studies implicate clathrin-mediated endocytosis and lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis as predominant routes, with biochemical analyses demonstrating essential roles for tetraspanin superfamily members and integrins in mediating vesicle docking and cytoskeletal remodeling during internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.Endothelial cells promote tumor angiogenesis by taking up exosomes and activating angiogenic signalling pathways in response to cargoes carried by the exosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that endothelial cells take up tumor cell-derived exosomes by endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>; therefore, in this study, we used PKH67 to label M2 macrophage-derived exosomes and traced them under fluorescence confocal microscopy. After co-culturing the labelled exosomes with endothelial cells, green fluorescent exosomes were seen to appear around the nuclei of HUVECs under fluorescence confocal microscopy, indicating that HUVECs were able to uptake M2 macrophage exosomes by endocytosis.</p><p id="Par24">Endothelial cells are essential in tumor angiogenesis, and proliferation, activation and migration of endothelial cells are necessary steps in angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that M2 macrophages promote angiogenesis mainly through the interaction of secreted cytokines and growth factors with endothelial cells. M2 macrophages secrete VEGF, PIGF, IL-6, and TNF, and their ability to promote angiogenesis has been demonstrated in other studies. However, compared with the M2 CM +&#x02009;GW4869 group, HUVECs proliferation, migration, and proliferation were significantly enhanced in the M2 CM and M2 exo groups, while the proliferation, migration, and tube-forming capacity of HUVEC in the M2 CM group was significantly lower than that in the M2 exo group. All results showed that M2 macrophage-derived exosomes were able to promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube-forming capacity<italic> in vitro</italic>, suggesting that they may be potential pro-angiogenic factors.</p><p id="Par25">In the hypoxic state of the TME, exosomes can be abundantly released, mediating dynamic communication between tumor cells and neighboring cells while promoting tumor malignant transformation. Tumor cell-derived exosomes have been shown to play an important role in tumor progression by promoting tumor angiogenesis. The ability of tumor cell-derived exosomes to promote tumor angiogenesis has been demonstrated in tumors such as breast, lung and ovarian cancer, and similar studies have been reported in OSCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Ozel Capik et al. demonstrated that in the OSCC microenvironment, tumor cell-derived exosomes promote angiogenesis via the miR-1825/TSC2/mTOR axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In addition to tumor cell exosomes, studies have shown that M2 macrophage exosomes can promote tumor proliferation, migration and invasion. Therefore, compared with the study of Ozel Capik et al., we mainly focused on the role of M2 macrophage exosomes in OSCC angiogenesis, in order to further explore the role of M2 macrophage exosomes in tumor progression.</p><p id="Par27">Exosomes promote tumor angiogenesis by releasing a variety of angiogenesis-promoting cargoes to endothelial cells,&#x000a0;such as microRNAs,&#x000a0;miRNAs and proteins. Exosomes derived from tumor cells facilitate breast cancer angiogenesis by transferring miR-210 to endothelial cells, which suppresses the expression of Ephrin A3 and PTP1B while enhancing VEGF levels and promoting new vascular structure formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In ovarian cancer, Millimaggi et al. showed that CD147 is overexpressed in tumor cell-derived exosomes and plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Exosomes are natural carriers of coding and non-coding RNAs, so they can be used as carriers for tumor-targeting drugs. Exosomes are non-immunogenic and have a natural structure and properties, as well as being nanoscale and carrying a variety of molecules on their surfaces that are able to pass through a variety of biological barriers. Liu et al. demonstrated that the use of exosomal transport of antisense RNA targeting miR-150, which promotes the expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF, significantly reduces VEGF expression and blocks tumor angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. HGF is known to have pro-angiogenic effects, and Zhang et al. showed that HGF siRNA contained in exosomes could be transferred to gastric cancer cells, thereby inhibiting HGF expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The above studies indicate that exosomes not only play an important role in tumor progression, but also have great potential for application in tumor therapy. Macrophage-derived exosomes can similarly promote tumor angiogenesis by delivering substances such as nucleic acids to endothelial cells.</p><p id="Par28">In the present study, we demonstrated that M2 macrophage-derived exosomes can promote the proliferation and migration of HUVECs and tube formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the specific mechanism still needs to be further investigated, and the above findings point out the direction for our next research.
