The median age of children who tested positive for RSV was 3&#x000b7;0 months (IQR 1&#x000b7;0&#x02013;8&#x000b7;0), with a median hospital stay of 5 days (IQR 4&#x02013;8); 24 (1&#x000b7;9%) of 1261 died in hospital. 8274 (5&#x000b7;5%) of 151&#x02008;110 bed days were for children who were positive for RSV. Additionally, of 9169 children denied admission, outcomes were tracked for 3928 and compared with 2845 admitted. The hazard ratio for death was 1&#x000b7;56 (95% CI 1&#x000b7;34 to 1&#x000b7;81) for children denied versus admitted, being highest for neonates at 2&#x000b7;27 (1&#x000b7;87 to 2&#x000b7;75).

<bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
</p><p id="para60">On May 5, 2024, we conducted a literature review on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospital admissions in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) using PubMed. We used MeSH terms such as &#x0201c;respiratory syncytial virus&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;children&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;disease burden&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;incidence&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;LMICs&#x0201d; without restricting the search by publication date. Only articles in English were considered. Our search primarily identified studies from south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Among these, fewer than 100 articles provided primary data on hospital RSV burden, detecting RSV in 13&#x02013;45% of hospitalised children with respiratory symptoms. A population-based study (Aetiology of Neonatal Infections in South Asia) estimated the incidence of RSV in south Asia to be 6&#x000b7;3 episodes per 1000 livebirths, with 7&#x000b7;32 episodes per 1000 livebirths specifically in Bangladesh. A hospital-based study (Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health) estimated that RSV was the cause of 32&#x000b7;2% of hospitalisations due to severe pneumonia in Bangladesh. The reported hospital case fatality rates associated with RSV ranged from 1&#x02013;2%, with estimated annual management costs of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infections between &#x020ac;3&#x000b7;47&#x02013;&#x020ac;7&#x000b7;93 billion. Existing literature, however, does not discuss the indirect effects of RSV infections on health systems, such as the contribution of hospitalisations due to RSV infections to competition for limited hospital beds.</p><p id="para70">
<bold>Added value of this study</bold>
</p><p id="para80">This study uniquely quantifies the effect of RSV on hospital admissions and child mortality at Bangladesh's largest tertiary-level paediatric hospital, which frequently faces bed shortages, akin to other resource-limited settings. RSV accounted for 8274 of the total 151&#x02008;110 observed bed days. Of the 1261 RSV-positive cases recorded, 24 (1&#x000b7;9%) patients died in the hospital. 36 deaths were recorded, including 12 post-discharge deaths, among 205 children who tested positive for RSV and who were followed up for 90 days, with common comorbidities being pneumonia, sepsis, congenital heart disease, and failure to thrive. During the study, 9169 (18&#x000b7;4%) of 49&#x02008;833 children requiring hospitalisation (for all causes) were not admitted due to insufficient bed capacity. We followed up about 6000 children for 90 days post-hospital visit, including those admitted and those denied admission due to bed shortages. The hazard ratio for death was 1&#x000b7;6 for denied versus admitted children, highest within babies in their first month of life at 2&#x000b7;3. Our analysis suggests that the introduction of licensed preventive interventions such as RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab could have reduced hospital denials by 677 and 1289, respectively, averting 130 and 258 deaths during the study year.</p><p id="para90">
<bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
</p><p id="para100">Integrating our findings with the existing literature underscores the crucial role of maternal RSV vaccination and monoclonal antibodies in reducing health system burdens in LMICs. By potentially lowering hospital admissions for RSV, such interventions could enable more efficient resource management, allowing increased admissions and improved survival rates for children needing care for conditions other than RSV, especially neonates. These findings support RSV immunisations as a strategic public health measure. Furthermore, our data show the direct effect of hospital bed shortages on children's health. Given the high burden of RSV and the limited number of hospital beds relative to population sizes in many countries, our findings highlight the potential applicability of this research in other settings. This approach can be extended to understand the indirect effects of disease prevention measures and direct effects of increasing hospital beds in settings in which hospitals operate at or over capacity.</p></boxed-text>

If the child was alive during the 2-week follow-up, a second follow-up call was made 3 months after denial of admission.

These findings align with those of the PERCH study, which reported that 31&#x000b7;2% of children hospitalised with respiratory infections in Bangladesh tested positive for RSV.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p id="para320">The in-hospital case fatality for RSV-positive cases was 1&#x000b7;9%. Among 205 randomly selected children with RSV followed up for up to 90 days post-hospitalisation, 18 deaths were recorded. However, these children had notable comorbidities, and this study was not designed to attribute these deaths solely to RSV infection. The median age of all recorded RSV-associated deaths was 116 days (or 3&#x000b7;8 months). In the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) study, a community-based study not limited to in-hospital deaths, RSV was found in 5&#x000b7;5% of all deaths, with variability across countries: 9&#x000b7;7% in Mali, 10&#x000b7;7% in Ethiopia, and 2% in Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Half of the RSV-associated deaths in the CHAMPS study occurred in infants younger than 6 months, highlighting the vulnerability of young infants to severe RSV outcomes.</p><p id="para330">Beyond the direct effect of RSV infections, our findings also show the considerable burden of infections on the health-care system. For at least 3 months during the study year, children with RSV occupied more than 20% of the beds under observation. The median hospital stay for children with RSV was 5 days&#x02014;longer than the overall median length of stay of 4 days for all admitted patients. In 2019, RSV cases accounted for 8274 of the total 151&#x02008;110 bed days observed. Despite being the largest paediatric tertiary hospital with 653 beds, Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute faces bed shortages, often forcing clinicians to deny admission to sick children.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We followed more than 5000 admitted and denied children for up to 90 days to determine the difference in health outcomes and the wider effects of high-burden infections such as RSV on the health-care system. The cumulative mortality proportion for children denied admission was 19&#x000b7;5%, substantially higher than the 12&#x000b7;6% among those admitted. The survival probability at the end of follow-up was 0&#x000b7;874 among those admitted, and 0&#x000b7;805 among those denied admission.</p><p id="para340">The HR for death was 1&#x000b7;56 among children denied admission compared with those admitted, adjusted for age, diagnosis, and sex. The highest mortality risk was observed in neonates requiring hospitalisation within their first month of life, with a HR of 2&#x000b7;27. This disparity highlights the essential role of timely health-care access in determining child survival outcomes. Monte Carlo simulations of a queueing model helped us characterise hypothetical scenarios with different bed capacities and numbers of patients requiring admission. Using a RSVpreF is estimated to have led to 130 fewer deaths and using a nirsevimab monoclonal antibody is estimated to have led to 258 fewer deaths during the study year among patients requiring admission to the hospital. Although the variability of these estimates was large and overlapping, the differences in admission denial rates between scenarios were substantial.</p><p id="para350">Bed shortages are a pressing issue across many LMICs. According to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.worldbank.org" id="interrefs11">World Bank Open Data</ext-link>, in Bangladesh, the bed rate of 0&#x000b7;8 per 1000 population is notably lower than in high-income countries, such as 2&#x000b7;9 in the USA and 2&#x000b7;5 in the UK. With limited infrastructure, preventive strategies are essential. Although vaccine introductions and health system improvements since 2000 have reduced mortality in children younger than 5 years in Bangladesh (as shown by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sdg.gov.bd/" id="interrefs12">Sustainable Development Goals tracker</ext-link>), the rate remains high at 33 deaths per 1000 livebirths, highlighting the need for more robust disease prevention. Given the substantial proportion of beds occupied by children with RSV during peak periods, an RSV maternal vaccine could substantially improve bed availability for critically ill infants. Additionally, administration of monoclonal antibodies, such as nirsevimab,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> in neonates and infants can also be effective, particularly given high preterm birth rates in Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> However, cost and logistical challenges complicate the adoption of monoclonal antibody treatments in LMICs such as Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p id="para360">Global data from various countries have shown shifts in RSV outbreak patterns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> While this study was conducted in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, reports from 2022 and 2023 from Bangladesh suggest that RSV cases have returned to pre-pandemic levels. A report from the Government of Bangladesh highlights a peak in RSV cases among children younger than 5 years from October, 2022, to March, 2023, with an average positivity rate of 49% in severe acute respiratory infection cases during that period.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Another study examining RSV-associated deaths from August, 2009, to March, 2022, found no significant difference in RSV detection rates among deaths before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p><p id="para370">This study has certain limitations. It was conducted in a single hospital, potentially limiting generalisability. MultiFsite research could offer a more comprehensive view of the RSV burden across Bangladesh and south Asia. However, as the largest provider of tertiary paediatric care in the country, this hospital's data are still highly informative. In addition, data collection was limited to 1 year, meaning that the simulation could only account for RSV's 2019 seasonal outbreak pattern. Unlike countries in temperate regions, with well defined RSV seasons, equatorial countries such as Bangladesh experience varied RSV peaks&#x02014;sometimes in winter, summer, or even twice a year&#x02014;making multi-year data crucial for modelling seasonal variability.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Additionally, RSV peaks can overlap with other endemic diseases, such as dengue<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and typhoid,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> which have unpredictable seasonal patterns, complicating generalisable pattern identification even with extended data. The study also did not assess concurrent infections with RSV or confirm deaths directly attributed to RSV. Furthermore, sample attrition and assumptions in the simulation models could introduce bias. Although we achieved an approximately 67% follow-up rate for both admitted and denied cases, those lost to follow-up could differ in important ways. During sampling, nasopharyngeal swabs were not collected from children on extensive support, such as high-flow oxygen, possibly underestimating the most severe RSV cases with adverse outcomes. In our simulations, we assumed non-study wards had similar seasonal admission patterns and that overnight denials, not included, were similar to daytime ones. However, children presenting at night, when research assistants were unavailable, might represent a sicker cohort, as emergencies often occur during these hours. This could result in an underestimation of mortality risks associated with hospital denials. As we did not assess care seeking after denial from Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute, we cannot disentangle the effect of treatment delay or of an inability to access hospital care. Finally, human factors, such as rationing admission decisions based on clinicians&#x02019; understanding of disease severity, could have influenced their admission decisions during times of bed scarcity even though such decisions should theoretically be unaffected by such constraints.</p><p id="para380">Despite the limitations, the global health implications of this study are substantial. This study underscores the crucial role of RSV preventive interventions, such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, in reducing the disease burden in resource-limited settings. By preventing RSV-related hospitalisations, vaccination programmes could alleviate seasonal surges in bed occupancy, providing much-needed relief to overstretched health-care systems. Additionally, our findings highlight the broader issue of hospital bed shortages, which remains a major barrier to effective care in many LMICs. Our results support the prioritisation of RSV prevention programmes and expansion of hospital infrastructure to address persistent capacity challenges, improve health-care access, and enhance child health outcomes in low-resource settings.</p><sec id="cesec110"><title>Contributors</title></sec><sec id="cesec120"><title>Equitable partnership declaration</title></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="cesec130"><title>Data sharing</title><p id="para410">The study's de-identified dataset is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="conflict-of-interest"><title>Declaration of interests</title><p id="para420">We declare no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Blau</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Global, regional, and national disease burden estimates of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in children younger than 5 years in 2019: a systematic analysis</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>399</volume><year>2022</year><fpage>2047</fpage><lpage>2064</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">35598608</pub-id>
