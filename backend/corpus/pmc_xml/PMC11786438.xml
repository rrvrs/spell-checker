Previous studies have reported that <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG is caused by autosomal recessive inheritance. However, in this study, we propose that <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG can be pathogenic through autosomal dominant inheritance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The variant was identified via trio whole-exome sequencing. We constructed wild-type and variant plasmids, transfected them into HEK293T cells and detected the expression levels of the STT3A protein.

Heterozygous knockdown zebrafish exhibit phenotypes similar to those of patients, including craniofacial dysmorphology (increased eye distance, increased Basihyal&#x02019;s length, increased Ceratohyal&#x02019;s angle), skeletal abnormalities (reduced number of mineralized bones), developmental delay (reduced adaptability under light&#x02012;dark stimuli suggesting abnormal locomotion, orientation, and social behavior), and electrophysiological abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">We report a proband with a dominant congenital glycosylation disorder caused by heterozygous pathogenic <italic>STT3A</italic> variation, which is a new inheritance pattern of <italic>STT3A</italic>.

CGD typically results in a wide range of multisystem clinical manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. With the advancement of genetic testing technologies, an increasing number of pathogenic genes related to CDG have been discovered. CDGs that impact the biosynthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the transfer of N-glycan to recipient precursor glycoproteins are termed type I CDGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The proper functioning of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex is crucial for ensuring the correct glycosylation of proteins, as it is involved in transferring oligosaccharide chains onto proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. OST is a polymeric protein complex consisting of STT3A (OST-A complex) or STT3B (OST-B complex) as catalytic subunits and a series of auxiliary proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. OST-A catalyzes cotranslational N-linked glycosylation for most proteins upon entry into the ER, whereas OST-B performs posttranslational glycosylation at sites missed by OST-A, such as those located at the C-terminus of glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Recently, pathogenic variants in various OST subunits have been demonstrated to cause autosomal-recessive or X-linked type I CDGs, such as <italic>TUSC3</italic>-CDG (MIM: 611,093) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], <italic>MAGT1</italic>-CDG (MIM: 301,031) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG (MIM: 615,596), and <italic>STT3B</italic>-CDG (MIM: 615,597) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. CDG caused by mutations in <italic>STT3A</italic>, also known as <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG, was first reported in a Pakistani family in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this family, two affected siblings primarily presented with microcephaly, developmental delay, epileptic seizures, and hypotonia, both of whom carried the homozygous variant c.1877C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;T. In 2017, Arunabha Ghosh et al. reported five independent individuals with CDGs carrying the same homozygous variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, to date, <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG is still widely considered to be autosomal recessive in inheritance.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we assessed the clinical and genetic characteristics of the first Asian case of dominantly inherited <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG, and we established heterozygous knockdown zebrafish for in vivo experiments to verify the potential of <italic>STT3A</italic> heterozygous variants causing dominant inherited pathogenicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient</title><p id="Par8">The patient was registered at the Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (CHCMU), the largest pediatric medical center in Southwest China.

Newborn screening did not reveal any abnormalities. There were no perinatal risk factors, such as birth asphyxia, intrauterine growth retardation, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, or placental abruption. She has a brother and a sister, both of whom are currently healthy with no developmental abnormalities or distinctive facial features. Her parents are nonconsanguineous, and there is no history of similar presentations in the family.</p><p id="Par23">Since early childhood, the patient has experienced significant delays in gross motor development. At 5&#x000a0;months, she could hold her neck up; at 11&#x000a0;months, she could sit independently; and at 2&#x000a0;years, she started walking independently. Currently (5&#x000a0;years and 7&#x000a0;months), she can run up and down the stairs but cannot hop on one foot. In addition to motor development, there are delays in her intellectual development.

Sanger sequencing of this variant is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E.

Additionally, our patient did not experience optic atrophy or seizures, although she had abnormal discharges. Our patient exhibited phenotypic similarities to those reported by Matthew P. Wilson et al., with development delay, distinctive facial features, and short stature. However, unlike that study, where half of the patients (predominantly adults) presented with skeletal dysplasia and muscle spasms, our patient did not present this phenotype. We speculate that this difference may be attributed to our patient being in childhood, or it could be due to phenotypic heterogeneity. However, longer-term follow-up is warranted to elucidate this further.</p><p id="Par32">In the analysis of the trio-WES results of this patient, several factors constitute compelling evidence for identifying the heterozygous variant in <italic>STT3A</italic>. First, the variant was de novo in the patient and was not detected in the normal population. Second, the amino acid affected by this variant is highly conserved across multiple species, and several deleterious prediction software tools have predicted it to be damaged. Additionally, the significant reduction in NK cell CD107a in the patient's peripheral blood, which requires OST-A catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], further prompts consideration of the pathogenicity of the heterozygous variant in <italic>STT3A</italic>. Finally, our cellular experiments revealed a significant decrease in protein expression caused by the heterozygous variant, suggesting a potential loss of OST-A function. The homozygous missense variants previously identified in <italic>STT3A</italic> (p.Val626Ala and p.Tyr360Ser) are located away from the catalytic site, and their pathogenicity is believed to cause protein instability, leading to reduced protein levels rather than complete loss of catalytic subunit function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, Matthew P. Wilson suggested that in cases of dominant <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG, although the mutated protein is stable, those variants are located at the active site of STT3A and are thus likely inactive. Interestingly, the heterozygous missense variant we report here also resides within the catalytic region of STT3A and is near known variants that can affect direct interaction with LLO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that the pathogenic mechanism of this variant may be multifactorial, including unstable protein expression, decreased catalytic activity, and impaired binding to LLO.</p><p id="Par33">To further validate whether heterozygous variants in <italic>STT3A,</italic> which are considered to contribute to the loss of OST-A function, can contribute to the phenotype observed in patients, we constructed a heterozygous knockdown zebrafish model for <italic>stt3a</italic>. We observed phenotypes in the <italic>stt3a</italic> crispant group of zebrafish that resembled those observed in dominantly inherited <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG patients, including craniofacial dysmorphology (increased eye distance, increased basal length, increased Ceratohyal angle), skeletal abnormalities (reduced number of mineralized bones), ID (reduced adaptability under light&#x02012;dark stimuli suggesting abnormal locomotion, orientation, and social behavior), and abnormal charges. Therefore, <italic>stt3a</italic> heterozygously knocked down zebrafish exhibit phenotypes similar to those of patients, providing further clarification that <italic>STT3A</italic> can cause CDG through dominant inheritance.</p><p id="Par34">As mentioned earlier, it was previously believed that pathogenic variants of <italic>STT3A</italic> cause CDG through autosomal recessive inheritance. This may lead clinical physicians to focus more on patients with homozygous variants while overlooking those with heterozygous variants. The new finding that heterozygous pathogenic <italic>STT3A</italic> variation may lead to dominant CDG is highly important for genetic counseling. For the proband we reported in this study, the identification of the pathogenic gene and clinical diagnosis allows the clinical physician to develop further diagnostic and therapeutic plans, as well as prognostic assessments. In the future, if the gene targeted therapies become available, precise targeted treatment can be administered. For the proband's family and the general population, understanding the new genetic pattern aids in developing targeted genetic testing strategies, enabling early identification of individuals carrying pathogenic variants for appropriate medical monitoring and intervention. Additionally, this knowledge helps families make informed decisions regarding reproductive planning, including whether to pursue embryo screening or consider pregnancy termination. Notably, recessive <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG has been identified in only two families, involving only two distinct pathogenic variants. Dominant <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDGs have also been reported only by Matthew P. Wilson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and this study; thus, identifying more affected individuals may expand the phenotypic spectrum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">In this study, we expanded the phenotype of the dominant <italic>STT3A</italic>-CDG, including developmental delay, distinctive facial features, short stature, and abnormal discharges.

Furthermore, we provided in vivo validation through the establishment of a heterozygous knockdown zebrafish model for <italic>stt3a</italic>, further strengthening the compelling evidence for dominant <italic>STT3A</italic>-related pathogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank this patient and her parents for their generous contribution and cooperation.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study's conception and design.
