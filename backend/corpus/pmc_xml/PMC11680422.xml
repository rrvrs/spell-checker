Currently, only live attenuated vaccines are commercially available, but their use is limited to endemic areas. There is a need for safer vaccines, especially in LSD-free countries. This research aims to develop and test a safe and efficacious inactivated vaccine. Moreover, in this study, we used keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a positive marker to distinguish infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). <bold>Methods:</bold> Lumpy skin disease virus was propagated on primary lamb testis cells and Madin&#x02013;Darby bovine kidney cells (PLT and MDBK, respectively), and four inactivated vaccines were produced. The vaccines differed from each other with the addition or not of KLH and in cells used for virus propagation. To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity, the vaccines and two placebos were administered to six groups comprising six male calves each, and antibody response was investigated using both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a serum neutralization (SN) test. In addition, the LSD/&#x003b3;-interferon test and KLH (IgM-IgG) ELISA were performed on the collected samples. Furthermore, the use of KLH allowed us to distinguish vaccinated animals in the ELISA results, without any interference on the strength of the immune response against the LSDV. Finally, the efficacy of one of four vaccines was investigated through a challenge, in which one group of vaccinated animals and one animal control group were infected with a live field strain of LSDV. <bold>Results:</bold> Four out of the six control animals showed severe clinical signs suggestive of LSD, and, therefore, were euthanized for overcoming the predetermined limit of clinical score.

Introduction</title><p>Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral disease that naturally affects cattle, especially the young and cows in the peak of lactation [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The aetiological agent of LSD, called lumpy skin disease virus, belongs to the <italic toggle="yes">Poxviridae</italic> family and <italic toggle="yes">Capripoxvirus</italic> genus, and it is primarily transmitted through hematophagous biting midges [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which act as mechanical vectors rather than biological ones [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lumpy skin disease is usually characterized by a low mortality rate (up to 10%), and different clinical signs have been reported. The signs may vary from mild, subclinical forms to more severe symptoms, such as ocular and nasal discharge, high fever, and multiple nodular skin lesions with subsequent poor skin quality. In addition, abortion, temporary or permanent infertility, and a strong failure in milk production [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have also been recorded. These latter symptoms are the most important causes of the huge economic losses related to this viral disease in the cattle industry [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lumpy skin disease appeared for the first time in 1929 in Zambia and rapidly became endemic in most African countries [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since 2012, many LSD outbreaks have been reported in the Middle East, until the first LSD incursion occurred in Southeastern Europe (Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and Montenegro) during 2015&#x02013;2016 [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To contain LSD in Europe, authorities have carried out different countermeasures: culling all infected animals, prohibiting animal movement, and requiring vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective strategy not only to limit LSD spread but also to eradicate the disease [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Currently, the commercially available vaccines against LSD are live attenuated ones. The use of these vaccines is suggested and limited to endemic countries. Their limited use is related to adverse reactions [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the risk of vaccine virus shedding from skin lesions and milk [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, the potential risk of viral reversion and recombination between the wild field strain and the attenuated virus of the vaccine contributes to limiting the use of these types of vaccines [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for advancement in the production of safer vaccines, like inactivated ones, to be specifically used in LSD-free countries to counter the spread of the disease. In the last decade, different efforts have been made in order to produce safe inactivated vaccines against LSDV [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but it should be highlighted that none of them enables discrimination between vaccinated from naturally infected animals, which is the principle of the DIVA strategy [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The application of this strategy in the vaccinology field represents an innovative helpful instrument to contrast, control, and eradicate a disease, and it is carried out by means of two tools: (i) a vaccine that contains a positive or negative marker, or both, and (ii) a validated diagnostic test. In the past, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), from a giant gastropod <italic toggle="yes">Megatura crenulata</italic>, was used as a positive marker in a DIVA bacterial vaccine [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Together with the marker properties, KLH has immunostimulatory properties, activating both humoral and cellular immune responses [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]<bold>,</bold> and has therefore been used as a protein carrier and adjuvant in vaccines [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The aim of our research was to develop a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious inactivated vaccine useful for identifying vaccinated animals by KLH employed as an exogenous protein marker, providing a tool for countering the spread of LSD in both endemic and non-endemic countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01302"><title>2.

Animals</title><p>The experiment was carried out on 36 healthy male Holstein&#x02013;Friesian calves, purchased from different farms in the Abruzzo Region (Italy). <italic toggle="yes">Bos taurus</italic> was chosen since it is the most sensitive species to LSD [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]<bold>,</bold> and no sex differences are reported on susceptibility to disease. As recommended by Regulation (EU) 2019/6 [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the experiment was performed on young animals (4&#x02013;8 months old), which represent the age category most susceptible to LSD [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The animals were kept in free-stall conventional housing with straw as bedding, feed, and water provided ad libitum; species-specific environmental enrichment was available (contact with conspecific and human, cow brush, salt blocks, and blue balls). They were divided into 6 groups (A&#x02013;F) of 6 animals each, using computer-generated numbers (Microsoft Excel 2013, 15.0.5475.1000, Windows 11) (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01302-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The challenge procedure was carried out on 12 animals (6 vaccinated animals and 6 animals in the placebo group), inside the BSL3 facility, where the values of temperature (16&#x02013;28 &#x000b0;C), pressure (&#x02212;10 Pa), and humidity percentage (30&#x02013;70%) were systematically assured. A system of internal video cameras with remote connection by phone allowed for the 24/24 h observation of hospitalized animals without the need to enter the housing premises. Traps with attractive lamps were installed in each box to verify the absence of flying insects. Clinical score sheets were used in daily animal management to assess the severity and progression of the induced disease, ensuring improvement in animal welfare. The observations were structured on the following four high-level categories: appearance (body condition, coat and skin condition, and discharge from eyes and mouth), body functions (respiration, food/water intake, and temperature), environment (enclosure environment, including any litter, material, and enrichment items), and behaviors (social interaction; undesirable behaviors; posture and mobility; tremors; seizures/convulsions/spasms; and vocalization, spontaneous or invoked). Moreover, through the implementation of the humane endpoint, set at the value of 13, animal pain and distress were relieved while still meeting experimental objectives.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-12-01302"><title>2.3.

The sample was collected during an outbreak that occurred in Albania in 2017 and was kindly provided by Dr. Ledi Pite and Dr. Liljana Cara from the Food Safety and Veterinary Institute (FSVI) in Tirana. Briefly, the biopsy sample was weighed, ground in a mortar, and suspended 1:10 (<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2, supplemented with 10,000 IU/mL penicillin (Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA), 5000 IU/mL nystatin, 10 g/L streptomycin sulfate salt (Sigma, Cat# S9137), and 125 mg/L gentamycin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# G1397).

In particular, the viral suspensions were obtained by infecting both MDBK and PLT cells with 0.1 MOI of a viral suspension produced starting from the freeze-dried working seed virus previously produced and checked. Briefly, the virus was suspended in a minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA Cat# 11095080) at a final concentration of 0.1 MOI and was adsorbed for 2 h on the monolayers of the two cell lines with monolayer at 80% of growth. After adsorption, a volume of 40 mL of MEM was added to each 175 cm<sup>2</sup> flask. Then, the flasks were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and observed daily at the inverted microscope (20&#x000d7;&#x02013;40&#x000d7;). The viral suspensions were harvested when the CPE was estimated to be equal to 90&#x02013;100% and centrifuged at 3000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 30 min at 4 &#x000b0;C, and the supernatants obtained were stored at 4 &#x000b0;C until use. At the same time, the pellet obtained was suspended in a volume of PBS, pH 7.2, equal to 1/10 of the starting volume, and underwent the freeze&#x02013;thaw process at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C three times. Next, the viral suspension obtained from the pellet was centrifuged at 2000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 30 min at 4 &#x000b0;C and was combined with the previously harvested supernatants. The two viral suspensions were checked in terms of their titer; identity; purity; and sterility for bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma, as prescribed by the European Pharmacopoeia [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]<bold>,</bold> and stored at 4 &#x000b0;C until use. The viral suspensions obtained from the two cell lines were subjected to concentration/purification using ultrafiltration cassettes with a nominal cut-off of 300 kDa (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA, Cat# P2C300V01) using the Cogent M1 TMP System instrument (Millipore). The virus was concentrated 10&#x000d7; and used for the production of four different inactivated vaccine formulations, as described by Luciani et al. [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, a solution of 100 mM binary ethylenimine (BEI) was prepared according to Bahnemann [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and used at a final concentration of 5 mM in order to inactivate the viral suspensions, incubating them at 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. Then, 20 mM sodium thiosulphate (Sigma, Cat# 563188) was added, and the suspensions were stored at 4 &#x000b0;C until use. The inactivation control was performed inoculating OA3.Ts cells, grown in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks, with samples of inactivated suspensions. Once verified the inactivation, the viral suspensions, previously concentrated, were emulsified with 10% (<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>) Montanide Gel 01 PR (gently provided from Seppic, Paris, France) and supplemented with 0.03 mg/mL saponin (Sigma, Cat# SAE0073). Finally, 20 &#x000b5;L/mL of KLH (Sigma, Cat# H8283) was added in two out of the four vaccines obtained and in one out of the two placebos in order to obtain a KLH concentration equal to 130 &#x000b5;g/mL. In conclusion, the vaccines differed from each other in the cell line used (PLT or MDBK) and the presence or absence of KLH, used as an exogenous marker protein. Two placebos containing PBS, Montanide Gel, saponin with or without KLH, were also produced (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01302-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

The immune response elicited against LSDV was analyzed by an ELISA, SN test, and in vitro interferon-&#x003b3; test, as described below. The immunogenicity study for KLH was performed by analyzing the samples of the animal groups inoculated with the formulations containing KLH (groups A, C, and F) throughout an ad hoc ELISA.

To detect the neutralizing antibodies, the SN tests were carried out following the method described in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organization for Animal Health [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For this purpose, serum samples were inactivated at 56 &#x000b0;C for 30 min and diluted serially 2-fold, from 1:5 to 1:640, in serum-free MEM in duplicate, using a 96-well microtiter plate. Each well contained 50 &#x000b5;L of serum dilutions, which were titrated against the LSDV Neethling strain (50 &#x000b5;L) with a fixed titer of 100 TCID<sub>50</sub>.

The virus was administered through two routes, namely 0.5 mL of virus suspension was used for four intradermal injections in the neck region, and 5 mL was used for one intravenous injection through the jugular vein. Rectal temperatures, local reactions, and clinical examination results were recorded daily throughout the challenge experimental period. In the meantime, blood samples were collected every three days until the end of the experiment from the jugular vein, using a vacutainer holder and a blood collection tube with (lithium-heparin for interferon-&#x003b3; and EDTA for real-time PCR) and without anticoagulant. The antibody responses against LSDV and KLH, and interferon-&#x003b3; concentration during the challenge were investigated using the same methods described in the immunogenicity study. In addition, blood samples; swabs from the eyes, nares, and mouth; and skin biopsies, if nodules on the skin were present, were analyzed via PCR to determine viremia. The real-time PCR was performed to detect LSD viruses.

Discussion</title><p>Inactivated vaccines, due to their safe profile, represent a preferred choice for fighting diseases in LSD-free countries. Furthermore, vaccination is the most useful tool against lumpy skin disease spread in European countries. So far, only live attenuated vaccines have been commercially available. Even if, compared to these last, inactivated vaccines seem to be less immunogenic, they are still being studied because of their safety, and promising results on their immunogenicity against Capripoxviruses have been published [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Our work aimed to develop and evaluate four different formulations of inactivated vaccines against lumpy skin disease. The vaccines produced were tested for safety and immunogenicity in four calf groups over 385 days, except for one formulation, whose efficacy was evaluated 68 days post-vaccination. The formulations produced differed from each other in terms of the cells used (continuous cells or primary cells) and the inclusion or not of an exogenous protein (KLH). Specifically, KLH was used as a positive marker to identify the vaccinated animals through an ad hoc ELISA.</p><p>After administrating the vaccines and placebos, some spikes of fever were recorded in a few animals belonging to all groups. Our results are similar to safety studies conducted by other researchers who tested inactivated vaccines against LSD. In particular, temperatures higher than 39.5 &#x000b0;C post-vaccination were found by several authors such as Haegeman [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Hamdi [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and Wolff [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In our study, the presence of spikes also in the control groups suggests that fever should be not directly attributable to the presence of viral antigen in the vaccines. Indeed, statistical analysis did not reveal any differences between the temperatures of the vaccinated and control groups E and F, which were inoculated with the placebo with and without KLH. To summarize, fever may be linked to the stress of handling animals during sampling or to the adjuvant used, which was also present in the two placebos. However, the safety profile of Montanide Gel reported by Matsiela [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and also documented in our previous studies [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] suggests excluding Montanide Gel as a cause of fever and considering the constriction during sampling as a likely cause of fever spikes. In addition, our vaccines do not produce any local reaction, in contrast to what has been reported by some authors; for instance, the authors of [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] recorded reactions probably linked to the adjuvant used, which, in the case of Hamdi, was a water-in-oil emulsion. As in previous works, our vaccines confirm the knowledge regarding the safety profile of inactivated vaccines that, in the case of LSD, is a very important characteristic considering the adverse reactions resulting from the use of live attenuated vaccines against LSD.</p><p>The immunogenicity studies we conducted show the ability of our vaccines to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which were recorded until day 385. Moreover, our results show the need to administer a booster dose to elicit an immune response detectable by SN. Our data seem to be similar to the results of Matsiela [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] regarding an inactivated vaccine tested on rabbits, containing an antigen dose equal to 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL, and to the data of Wolff [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] regarding two vaccines with diluted antigen (10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL before inactivation). By contrast, our data differ from those obtained in other previous studies [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], where the percentage of SN-positive animals nevertheless increased with the first vaccination. These different performances could hypothetically be due to, on the one hand, the different production methods used by researchers, and on the other, the type of adjuvants used in the vaccines. Regarding vaccine titers, our data show that differences less than 1 log in antigen concentration, as in the case of our vaccines produced in MDBK cells with respect to the vaccine produced in primary cells, are not involved in statistically significant differences in antibody response, according to what was previously found by Wolff [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In addition, concurrently with the humoral response, our vaccines seem to stimulate a rapid activation of cell-mediated immunity in the vaccinated groups. These results confirm what has been found not only by Hamdi [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], who observed a cellular-mediated response in an inactivated vaccine against LSDV, but also the results of some previous studies performed on vaccines against other viruses, such as porcine circovirus and those causing bovine respiratory disease [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], suggesting an effective cell-mediated immune response, which is usually reported for live attenuated vaccines. Our results are partially contrary to what was found by Haegeman [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], who revealed that the inactivated LSD vaccine elicited a transient cellular-mediated immune response in only 67% of the vaccinated animals.</p><p>Moreover, along with the immunogenicity elicited by the viral antigen, we demonstrated that the positive marker KLH allowed us to distinguish the vaccinated animals. As previously described, the antibody response against KLH increased early (day 7), and immunity against KLH was recorded until the end of the experiment. Although the KLH concentration in the MDBKv-KLH, PTLv-KLH, and placebo&#x02013;KLH vaccines was equal, lower values of O.D. IgM and, in particular, IgG were found in some cases. The latter findings could likely be ascribed to the competition in the vaccines between viral proteins and KLH in stimulating the antibody response. Interestingly, during the challenge, the vaccinated animals remained identifiable through the ELISA for KLH by both IgM and IgG. These data meet the requirement of including a positive marker in a vaccine, as also documented by Ray [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], for the application of the DIVA strategy. In contrast with Ray, who documented an adjuvant property of KLH, in our study, the addition of such protein to two vaccine formulations did not enhance the strength of the antibody response or the cellular immune response against the viral antigen, when compared with the formulations without KLH. The absence of adjuvant effects from KLH in our vaccines could be linked to the presence of whole viruses and not haptens or small recombinant proteins, which can take advantage of the carrier activities of KLH.</p><p>The efficacy study proved the incapability of the formulation administered to group C in reducing the shedding of the virus, as evidenced by the positivity of ocular, nasal, and oral swabs in PCR results. In the meantime, the efficacy study demonstrated the properties of the vaccine produced and tested to reduce the clinical signs and viremia, as confirmed by the statistical analysis performed (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In this case, the early rise in the antibody response of vaccinated animals after infection (day 3 in SN and day 7 in ELISA) plays a crucial role in viremia reduction, unlike what occurred in the infected control animals, in which the first positive animals in SN were found on days 9 and 24 in ELISA, respectively. The delay of ELISA to detect positivity in infected animals with respect to the SN test is also described by the producer in the validation report. That finding could pose some doubt in the application of this test as a method for monitoring the disease in LSD-free countries. In addition, differences were also observed in the PCR results of ocular, nasal, and oral swabs. However, these findings were not statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), probably because of the small size of the groups. In particular, the percentage of positivity in the ocular, nasal, and oral swabs was higher in the control animals than in the vaccinated ones. Furthermore, the CT % values recorded in ocular, nasal, and oral swabs were lower in the control animals than in the vaccinated ones, indicating a reduction in virus replication in the vaccinated group after the challenge. The data regarding virus dissemination in the vaccinated animals after challenge confirm what was reported by Wolff [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for one of the two inactivated vaccines adjuvanted with adjuvant B, where blood samples were found positive in PCR; however, our findings are in contrast with those of some authors such as Hamdi [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], who found only DNA traces on the skin biopsies of vaccinated animals, and Wolff [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-12-01302" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] who developed some vaccines inducing complete sterilizing immunity. These differences could be due to the different production procedures used, as well as the challenge models employed. In our challenge protocol, the total amount of virus inoculated intravenously (10<sup>7.3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) diluted in 5 mL was higher than the viral quantities used by Wolff for challenges (10<sup>7.0</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> and 10<sup>6</sup>/mL, 10<sup>6.9</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL). A unique validated model for the challenge and a unique strain to be used in all vaccine efficacy studies could help researchers in the development of safer and more efficacious vaccine formulations than ever. Consequently, further studies will be carried out in order to analyze the genome of the virus strain used and present the data obtained.</p><p>As a future direction, it could be interesting to increase the sample size in order to optimize the precision of some observed effects and underline some of the subtle differences found in our study, which were not statistically significant. In fact, the number of animals selected for this study allows us to demonstrate differences of only 80% between the groups under comparison.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-12-01302"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>To summarize, our work contributes to existing research by demonstrating the feasibility of a safe, immunogenic, and effective inactivated vaccine to prevent the spread of LSD in disease-free countries, avoiding the negative consequences related to live attenuated ones. Furthermore, we successfully applied for the first time a positive marker-based DIVA for LSD vaccine production, in order to fulfill one of the requirements set for a disease-free European country. Additional studies in lactating cows will provide further insights into the LSD vaccine safety contributing to the use of inactivated vaccines against LSD over attenuated ones.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Koos Coetzer for their invaluable help in the paper&#x02019;s critical review, and Nikolay Petrovsky for suggesting KLH as a positive marker.
