Depression has been described as compromising reflective functioning in female samples, whereas other studies have not detected differences in RF between depressed and non-depressed mothers.</p></sec><sec id="sec1045"><title>Objectives</title><p>We aim to study whether a group intervention focused on postpartum depression, which we have already observed to cause significant changes in the mother-child bond and the severity of depressive, also improves parental reflective functioning.</p></sec><sec id="sec1046"><title>Methods</title><p>To that end, we analyzed pre-post data from two different groups (N=12), composed of mothers who had been clinically diagnosed with postpartum depression. They received the 6-week Mothers &#x00026; Babies Program&#x000a9; and completed the Parental Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ) before and after group therapy. Pre-post data from the PRFQ were analyzed using the repeated measures t-test. The correlation between changes in the three questionnaires was also analyzed using Pearson&#x02019;s correlation test.</p></sec><sec id="sec1047"><title>Results</title><p>Significant changes were observed in the Pre-Mentalization Modes (pre=2.37&#x000b1;.457, post=2.03&#x000b1;.520, t=2.0206, p=0.027) and Certainty About Mental States (pre=2.87&#x000b1;1.141, post=3.68&#x000b1;.908, t=-2.814, p=0.010) subscales of the PRFQ, with no significant changes in the Interest and Curiosity subscale (t=-.516, p=0.309). A significant correlation was also observed between pre-post change in EPDS scores and pre-post change in the Certainty About Mental States subscale of the PRFQ (r=-.640, p&#x0003c;.05), while no significant correlations were observed with the rest of the PRFQ subscales, nor with the PBQ.</p></sec><sec id="sec1048"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A brief cognitive-behavioral group therapy developed specifically to treat postpartum depression improves pre-post scores on the Pre-Mentalization (lower post- than pre- score) and Certainty About Mental States (higher post- than pre- score) subscales of the PRFQ. Although a control group is needed to determine the actual effect of the intervention, as time could also play a role in the observed changes, this is an encouraging result. Moreover, the improvement obtained in Certainty About Mental States is inversely correlated with the pre-post changes observed in the EPDS, meaning that the greater the improvement in depression, the greater the improvement in the aforementioned subscale of the PRFQ. A larger sample is needed to assess a hypothetical mediating effect of depression in the observed change.</p></sec><sec id="sec1049"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
