There is increasing research focused on targeted prostate cancer screening, using genetic testing to guide screening by identifying those at highest risk, but this could only be considered if people of all ethnicities would accept this approach.

Facilitators were family and community support, the sharing of experiences, good communication with doctors, raised prostate cancer awareness, genetic risk assessment to guide the need for screening and facilitate early diagnosis, improving future outcomes for prostate cancer in the Black community through engaging with genetic research and assurance that there are regulations in place to protect genetic and personal data with guidance around when genetic results must be disclosed.</p></sec><sec id="hex70282-sec-0040"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Understanding barriers and facilitators can guide recommendations for health services to improve access and uptake within the Black community and improve representation in genetic research.

Our genetic risk assessment service provides genetic testing and prostate cancer screening within a research setting to individuals who are at elevated risk of prostate cancer, including those with Black African and Black Caribbean ancestry. We have low representation in participants from this demographic, despite nationwide recruitment through GPs and outreach initiatives. Therefore, we wanted to find out why Black men were under&#x02010;represented in our research service. Our aim was to better understand Black men's views and perceptions about prostate cancer, genetics and screening and to identify any potential barriers to engagement with a prostate cancer genetic risk research service. This knowledge is important to inform the design and delivery of our health services, information materials and research, to make them more accessible and inclusive to this underserved group.</p><p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and people born with male reproductive organs in the United Kingdom. It can be slow growing and relatively harmless (indolent), or it can spread around the body to be life&#x02010;limiting (advanced or aggressive) [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, approximately 55,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year (144 per day), and there are 490,000 men living with/having had the disease [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and incidence is rising [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Detecting prostate cancer in the early stages is important because it is curable when retained inside the prostate at diagnosis (i.e., has not spread to other areas in the body). Later diagnosis, when the cancer has spread outside of the prostate, leads to worse outcomes, with only half of men surviving for 5 years.</p><p>The ambition of the NHS long&#x02010;term cancer plan is that by 2028, 75% of people with cancer will be diagnosed at an early stage (Stage 1 or 2). There is no established national screening programme for prostate cancer in the United Kingdom, and the existing method of testing in NHS primary care is a blood test for prostate&#x02010;specific antigen (PSA) [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PSA testing is offered to men who have symptoms suggestive of prostate cancer or who request a test, after a discussion with their GP about the pros and cons of using it as a risk assessment tool.</p><p>In the United Kingdom and the United States, a prostate cancer risk discussion in primary care usually involves a medical and family history, a digital rectal exam and a serum PSA test [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. If these indicate the possibility of prostate disease, imaging such as an MRI scan will guide who should receive a prostate biopsy [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using serum PSA for prostate cancer screening in asymptomatic individuals is a controversial topic with no international consensus [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In advanced prostate cancer (high Gleason scores), PSA sensitivity is 80%&#x02013;90% [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There are large datasets which report that PSA screening in the general population reduces mortality by approximately 20% [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, screening with a PSA test alone cannot distinguish between clinically significant or indolent prostate cancer, which can result in unnecessary prostate biopsies, overtreatment (with potentially life&#x02010;changing side effects of incontinence and erectile dysfunction) and psychological burden [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some argue these harms outweigh the benefit of mortality reduction. To reduce the overdiagnosis of indolent prostate cancer, there is research focused on targeting PSA testing to men who are at increased risk of the disease. Prostate cancer is the most heritable cancer, and research is evaluating whether genetic testing can be used to estimate an individual's lifetime risk of developing the disease and therefore guide which individuals would benefit from a future prostate cancer screening programme.</p><p>Established risk factors for prostate cancer include age, ethnicity and having a family history of the disease [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ancestry is a known risk factor for prostate cancer, and those of Black African and Black Caribbean ancestry (whom we will refer to as &#x02018;Black men&#x02019;) have a higher risk than those of White European ancestry (whom we will refer to as &#x02018;White men&#x02019;). The risk for Black men is 1 in 4, compared with 1 in 8 in White men by age 80. Black men are also more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age. A 2023 study showed that Black men have the same prostate cancer risk at age 66 that White men have at age 85 [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, Prostate Cancer UK (PCUK) recommend that all Black men should be offered a PSA test if they request one from age 45 and above [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, there has been little genetic research in Black African and Black Caribbean populations, which meant we did not know for certain whether genetic variation could explain this higher rate of diagnosis (incidence) and death from prostate cancer (mortality). This knowledge gap is shrinking, and our understanding of the genetic contribution to the risk of prostate cancer is improving [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In 2009, 96% of participants in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) were of European ancestry, with less than 1% accounting for those of African ancestry [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By 2016, the representation of those with African ancestry had risen to 3% [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This small proportion is not representative of the Black population worldwide; however, there are limited data stating the percentage of the world population that is Black. In the United Kingdom, 4% of the population of England and Wales has Black African or Black Caribbean ancestry, and within London, where our clinic is based, this is 13.5% [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Genetic variants have been identified that increase the risk of prostate cancer, and some of these have a different incidence in Black men compared with other ethnic groups and may provide some of the answer as to why Black men are more likely to get the disease and be diagnosed at a younger age than White men [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We have ongoing research studies that are using genetic testing to identify men at higher risk of prostate cancer for targeted prostate cancer screening. Black men are under&#x02010;represented in this study. It is important to encourage more Black men to take part in prostate cancer genetic research so that we can continue to collect data, which can improve our understanding of risk and promote better prostate cancer outcomes for this community in the future.</p><p>Whilst some of the risk is thought to be due to genetic differences, the impact of health behaviours and interactions with health services also contribute to how and when people are diagnosed with prostate cancer, and health inequalities exacerbate this problem. Much of the existing literature describing the barriers that Black men face when accessing a prostate cancer risk discussion (which includes a medical and family history, digital rectal exam and serum PSA test) comes from the United States. Healthcare accessibility and health insurance coverage can impact this group's access to screening [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The literature also describes a lack of awareness of prostate cancer risk amongst Black men and a reluctance to engage with healthcare services in the absence of a health problem [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies also reported a lack of conversation within the community about health and cancer [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Black people with a significant family history of cancer are less likely to access clinical genetics services. Barriers could include cultural inhibitions around discussing family history, the need to complete a complex family history questionnaire [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], discussing how relatives died or whether it was disclosed that a relative had cancer, with some expressing views that cancer is a &#x02018;new condition&#x02019; and an issue only affecting White people [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Finally, trust in healthcare systems has been highlighted in the literature as a barrier to Black men accessing advice about prostate cancer. Studies have reported examples of poor communication [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], lack of GP knowledge about increased prostate cancer risk among Black men and instances of inconsistent information being given regarding PSA testing.</p><p>To summarise, our study is the first to our knowledge to describe attitudes within the Black community to the incorporation of genetic risk assessment in cancer risk prediction and screening. There is a lack of evidence from the United Kingdom describing the barriers and facilitators faced by Black people when seeking advice about prostate cancer. There is also a lack of representation of Black people in cancer genetic services and genetic databases [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our particular focus is on the United Kingdom and on understanding views about using genetic testing within a prostate cancer risk assessment, and we are building on previous work in this space to establish trusted relationships between our genetic risk service and Black communities around London and further afield. We hope these partnerships will educate us about the needs of Black people in accessing cancer screening and advice. In return, we hope to develop the trust of communities and share information around personal health, cancer risk and accessibility to screening and risk advice.</p><p>The aims of this co&#x02010;design work were to work in partnership with men of Black African or Black Caribbean descent to better understand barriers to engagement with the prostate cancer genetic risk research service and explore information requirements and ways of working, which could increase their participation in prostate cancer and genetic research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="hex70282-sec-0070"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="hex70282-sec-0080"><label>2.1</label><title>Data Collection&#x02014;Discussion Groups and Interviews</title><p>We attended fundraising, awareness and social events to become familiar with the prostate cancer awareness groups within the Black community, and as a result of this, we met the community champions who invited us to their support groups, where we held our discussion groups. These two discussion groups were facilitated by the community champions (one of whom is a co&#x02010;author on this paper) and were attended by Black men and their families. They occurred in community centres in two separate Boroughs in South London. By visiting the men in their own environment, surrounded by friends and family, we hoped to empower them to share their opinions and lived experience.</p><p>The composition of these groups was as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Each was attended by between 30 and 35 men and women (a ratio of approximately 70% men and 30% women) from the Black community.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The majority of attendees had a lived experience of prostate cancer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Attendees were multigenerational, and ages ranged from 18 years old and above, though the majority were aged 50 and above.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Both focus groups were distinct, with separate organisers and attendees.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Most attendees were of Black Caribbean ancestry, rather than Black African ancestry (this is anecdotal information from the organisers of the events).</p></list-item><list-item><p>We did not keep any personal and demographic data regarding the individuals who attended, as we were concerned that this could be a barrier and deemed it unnecessary.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In the spirit of reciprocity, we provided a presentation at each group, followed by a question&#x02010;and&#x02010;answer session to raise awareness about prostate cancer and allow attendees to ask questions that were of concern to them. After the presentation, we used a topic guide consisting of a few open questions, which were put to the group to prompt discussion about their views and understanding of genetics, research and prostate cancer risk more generally. They were asked to think about potential barriers to engagement and consider what kind of messages might help Black men overcome any of these barriers (see topic guide Additional File 1). Both our presentation and topic&#x02010;guide questions were reviewed, approved and finalised by the community champion who organised the first session and is also a co&#x02010;author of this paper.</p><p>Members of the group bounced off one another, endorsing or disagreeing with statements made. The conversation was always flowing, and the whole group were united in one conversation at one time, and we steered the discussion back on track if it digressed. We gained approximately 2.5&#x02009;h of audio per discussion, and there was significant overlap and recurrent themes in both groups. We did not note any contrasting themes from the groups. We made a donation to the organisers of the community groups, and we continue to nurture long&#x02010;term and two&#x02010;way relationships with them.</p><p>We conducted one&#x02010;to&#x02010;one interviews with three Black community champions via video call. With interviewee consent, we gained an hour of audio from each interview, and the themes echo those from the discussion groups. One of these community champions is the founder of the organisation that accommodated our first discussion group, and the other two we met as attendees to our second discussion group. All three community champions were renumerated for their time, and we continue to foster long&#x02010;term and two&#x02010;way relationships with them. Two of the community champions are female, and they both have a family history of prostate cancer in their close relatives. All three of these champions either run or assist in the organisation of prostate cancer awareness events in the Black community.</p><p>This project was approved as a service evaluation (CCR SE1284). With verbal consent, we audio&#x02010;recorded 3 h of discussion in total from the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="hex70282-sec-0090"><label>2.2</label><title>Guided by Principles of Co&#x02010;Production</title><p>For this study we use co&#x02010;production to describe an approach based around a set of key principles.

</p><p>A few men expressed concerns about any potential insurance implications.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;It won't be too long before insurance companies begin to ask about genetic testing. If you say you have been tested, then that opens the door for them to say ok what were the results? And if you don't want to share it, they will think there must be something there&#x02019;.</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>This suggests the Black community are positive about participating in genetic research for prostate cancer, provided they are given information about the aims and purpose of the study and how their data are used and protected. The importance of counselling alongside genetic results to clarify their meaning in terms of health prospects for them and their families would be essential, with long&#x02010;term access to support and advice.</p><p>The participants also want clear guidance around insurance implications and how a genetic test result that identifies a pathogenic variant will affect the ability to get health, travel and life insurance. Some individuals were concerned that carrying a pathogenic variant in a cancer gene may affect their ability to get a mortgage. As of early 2025, predictive genetic test results through research do not need to be declared to third parties. According to the Code on Genetic Testing and Insurance, which is a long&#x02010;standing voluntary agreement between the UK government and Association of British Insurers, insurers will only consider the result of a predictive genetic test for a very small minority of cases (to date, only that for Huntington's disease in life insurance applications for a financial limit greater than a total of &#x000a3;500,000) [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, it is possible that this will change in the future.</p><p>There was also concern around safe storage of genetic data and potential implications should these data be stolen and used for unregulated or unintended purposes. Those who expressed these concerns referenced the Henrietta Lacks case as an example of human tissue being used for purposes out of the scope of the patient's consent.</p></sec><sec id="hex70282-sec-0170"><label>3.5</label><title>Better Communication Around Prostate Genetic Risk</title><p>We asked the participants for their advice on how we can improve our research service and make it more accessible and acceptable to the Black community. Several participants stressed the importance of being proactive and taking the information, and if possible, the research, out to the community.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;You need to go to the Black man but also his family and friends. Barber shops, clubs and churches, where they congregate&#x02019;</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Many were in favour of messaging that involved the sharing of real people's stories, as this was thought to be more impactful:<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;You need a lived experience, it's alive, it's not made up. It's not something like reading in a book, I've lived this&#x02019;</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>It is important to the Black community that their health outcomes are improved now and for future generations; therefore, it should be emphasised that there is a lack of genetic data from the Black community. The individuals we worked with felt that if this was communicated to them and circulated within the community, it would incentivise people to participate in research to provide greater representation of those with Black African or Black Caribbean ancestry.</p><p>The above themes demonstrate the thoughts and priorities around communicating about prostate cancer risk and genetic screening in the Black communities with which we collaborated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="hex70282-sec-0180"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings around the barriers faced by the Black community in accessing advice about prostate cancer risk align with many of those described within the wider literature. We will focus our discussion on views and understandings relating to prostate cancer and genetics.</p><p>Historical and generational trauma based on past and present health and research injustices has resulted in the Black community having a general mistrust in healthcare and research, which spans the United Kingdom and the United States. Scandals in the United States, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis study and the Henrietta Lacks case, detail the exploitation of Black people by medical research within the last 100 years, creating the belief that in recent history Black people have been used as &#x02018;guinea&#x02010;pigs&#x02019; by scientists [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We were also told about recent experiences of miscommunication between Black men and their GPs around prostate cancer risk and PSA&#x02010;testing eligibility, which may exacerbate pre&#x02010;existing mistrust. This is a challenging area as there is no clear national guidance for GPs to follow, and the recommendation is for shared decision&#x02010;making about the appropriateness of PSA testing, including discussion around the pros and cons of screening.</p><p>Our findings agree with studies that describe cultural beliefs among the Black community in the United Kingdom and the United States around prostate cancer management being a threat to masculinity [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with a stigma that this diagnosis affects virility and sexual function [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is a belief that undergoing a rectal examination is a traumatic and humiliating invasion of privacy, with some believing it might cause a change in sexual orientation [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This stigma deters men from sharing their diagnosis with their families and community.</p><p>We also echo the evidence that the fear of receiving a cancer diagnosis is enough to deter some men from seeking screening [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is a fear of seeing a doctor [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It was discussed that there are ideas around a cancer diagnosis being equivalent to a death sentence [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with a gap in understanding around treatability and even curability if diagnosed in early stages. Studies describe feelings of shame and embarrassment associated with receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Both a perceived threat to masculinity and fear of a cancer diagnosis may be barriers to men seeking genetic screening to assess their own risk of prostate cancer.</p><p>This paper is the first to describe the barriers and facilitators faced by men in the Black community when accessing genetic testing as part of research into prostate cancer risk. Most of the men who worked with us had no awareness that this was possible, and they were open to the idea of anything that optimised their opportunity of catching the disease early and reducing harm from the disease for their generation and future generations. This would require long&#x02010;term support for those who receive a genetic test result showing that they carry a cancer&#x02010;predisposition variant. First, we need to provide accessible and acceptable educational materials to describe what is involved in the genetic research, the benefits to the individual and why it is important to increase representation of those with Black African and Black Caribbean ancestry in genetic research. The materials should also explain what data protection regulations are in place to protect their genetic data, with reference to insurance and mortgage implications. We are using the barriers and facilitators described above to co&#x02010;design and co&#x02010;produce these materials with the community champions who continue to work with us.</p><p>Despite these barriers, this study has highlighted ways to ensure that future collaborative work has the potential to improve communication about prostate cancer risk. Community champions sharing their story with their communities normalise talking about cancer and can address myths and fears around cancer screening [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is especially effective when young people in the community witness this behaviour as culturally accepted among seniors [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An African American study stated Black men are more likely to trust health advice from their community than from healthcare professionals [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The NHS is working with these champions to find ways to make their services more accessible. Face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face communication with trusted healthcare professionals to discuss risk and prevention promotes engagement [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An effective example of this is the Newham Prostate Health Drop&#x02010;in clinic in London, which is based at Newham African&#x02010;Caribbean Resource Centre [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The aim of the clinic is to be accessible to men who feel excluded by the healthcare system and is facilitated by a self&#x02010;referral service and flexible opening hours [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Those who attended the clinic felt satisfied with the service, which made a number of new diagnoses of early prostate cancer [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>It is described that Black men are motivated to see the doctor by encouragement from family members (especially spouses) and the need to be well to care and provide for their family [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Support from families and communities is essential to the prostate cancer treatment journey and recovery, with churches also being highly valued [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="hex70282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is widely accepted that the most effective way to raise awareness about prostate cancer and research in the Black community is through sustained community&#x02010;based projects [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], of which there are now many in the United Kingdom (see Prostate Cancer UK online database for a full list of these [<xref rid="hex70282-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). These provide peer support for those going through cancer and spread awareness with signposting to screening services.</p><p>Two of the community champion interviewees from our project form a public patient involvement (PPI) panel who are co&#x02010;producing educational web materials with us. They have planned what information should be included in the materials, and once complete, these materials will be disseminated by them within their community networks, to raise awareness of prostate cancer risk and genetic risk.</p><p>Outcomes for prostate cancer in Black men can be improved with better communication from healthcare professionals and community initiatives to raise awareness about prostate cancer risk and symptoms. Our findings suggest that people from the Black community are open to participating in research and genetic testing for prostate cancer, provided they are given information detailing how their data are used and protected. They also want clear guidance around declaring genetic risk to insurers and mortgage companies. It is important to many of the people that we worked with that health outcomes for future Black generations are better and equitable, and we believe that open communication around risk factors, including genetics, will help to achieve this.</p><sec id="hex70282-sec-0190"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>Limitations of this study include our discussion groups occurring only in London. We attended community groups within two separate Boroughs in South London to collect the data. We have since engaged with community groups across the country, where we continue to deliver awareness talks and are building collaborative relationships. The discussion group attendees were a large sample size (a total of approximately 60 Black men), with a high majority of these participants sharing their ideas in group discussion. The large majority were of Black Caribbean ancestry; however, we did not assess ethnic sub&#x02010;groups or collect other demographic data. It is possible that these 60 Black men from around London do not represent the breadth of diversity in lived experience in the Black communities across the United Kingdom.</p><p>The two interviewers have no Black African or Black Caribbean ancestry themselves, and we are undertaking this study with the intention to improve prostate cancer awareness, screening and outcomes in this population. We acknowledge that it would be ideal if those who conduct this study were of Black ethnicity. Consequently, we have worked hard to prove long&#x02010;term commitment to engagement with these community groups and to listen to them, to develop a trusting and two&#x02010;way relationship. We have worked closely with the community champions to guide us in making culturally appropriate use of language and ideas and show us how best to serve their community.</p><p>The knowledge that we have gained from this study will change our practice forever, by educating us around the history of Black people in medicine and research and awarding us a cultural understanding of the barriers and facilitators faced by the community when accessing healthcare services. We aim to use this understanding to break down these barriers in our clinical work, and we have delivered presentations to our colleagues to share ways individuals can change their practice to make a positive difference to accessibility for the Black community at our institution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="hex70282-sec-0200"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first example of work describing attitudes towards genetic testing as part of future cancer screening within the Black community. It includes learning about what information should be provided to promote engagement. Our findings have supported those from previous studies in the United Kingdom and the United States regarding barriers to Black men accessing prostate cancer risk advice, but also provide new information about their perspectives on genetics in risk measurement.</p><p>We identified trust in the healthcare system, prostate cancer risk awareness and cultural inhibitions around talking about prostate cancer and family history as barriers, as well as fear and taboo around the rectal examination. Facilitators included community&#x02010;based initiatives to raise awareness of risk and sharing the lived experience of prostate cancer from within the Black community.</p><p>People from the Black communities we engaged with are open to the future incorporation of genetic testing to guide who should receive prostate cancer screening, provided sufficient information around data use and protection and insurance implications are stipulated. There is recognition of the need to improve prostate cancer outcomes within their community, and they welcome community engagement by healthcare services to facilitate this.</p></sec><sec id="hex70282-sec-0210"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
