In 2023, Ireland was reported to have one of the highest alcohol consumption rates per capita among OECD countries, with an average consumption of 9.9 L per person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Data from the Health Research Board have identified heavy episodic drinking as a particular concern in Ireland, ranking eighth in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such high levels of alcohol consumption have profound implications for public health and the healthcare system. Excessive alcohol consumption is particularly concerning as it correlates with various health and social issues, including increased emergency department (ED) presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Alcohol-related ED presentations place a considerable burden on hospitals and ambulance services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A review of EDs in Ireland performed in 2015/16 revealed that approximately 6% of all presentations were alcohol-related, a figure that can surge to 29% during peak times, such as Sunday mornings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nearly 60% of these alcohol-related presentations were conveyed by ambulance, highlighting the strain on emergency medical services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Another review of ED presentations in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin in 2021 and 2022 found that alcohol was a factor in one-fifth of ED presentations and one-sixth of hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The primary reasons for these presentations include injuries directly associated with alcohol use, severe intoxication, medical conditions resulting from chronic alcohol abuse, and mental health crises exacerbated by alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Given the already significant burden on Ireland&#x02019;s healthcare system, particularly in the context of severely overcrowded EDs, addressing avoidable alcohol-related presentations is crucial. Reducing these avoidable cases would not only alleviate pressure on emergency services but also improve patient outcomes and overall public health. This study aims to contribute to this goal by providing a detailed analysis of alcohol-related presentations at the Mercy University Hospital (MUH) in Cork.</p><p id="Par9">As an inner-city hospital, MUH faces unique challenges related to alcohol consumption due to its geographical and demographic context. With approximately 220 inpatient beds and an annual ED attendance of 32,000 presentations, optimising the use of hospital resources is essential. In response to a significant number of patients with alcohol-related presentations, the hospital is planning to implement a new service aimed at safer management of alcohol detoxification. To inform this initiative, it is essential to understand recent trends in alcohol-related presentations, the demographic profile of affected patients, associated injuries, and the outcomes of these cases.</p><p id="Par10">Moreover, this descriptive, prevalence study, as part of a wider service evaluation, aims to highlight the broader implications of alcohol policy changes in Ireland. The proposed Sale of Alcohol Bill (2022) by the Irish government, which aims to extend licensing hours and increase the availability of alcohol, poses potential risks. Drawing on evidence from other countries, which links extended alcohol trading hours to increased alcohol-related crime, traffic collisions, and hospital admissions, this study underscores the need for careful consideration of such policy changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">By providing a detailed examination of alcohol-related ED presentations and the potential impact of increased alcohol availability, this article aims to inform public health strategies and policy decisions. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the burden of alcohol-related cases on emergency services and improve public health outcomes in Ireland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par12">This descriptive, prevalence study was conducted at the MUH in Cork. Data relating to ED presentations in 2022 and 2023 were analysed in May 2024.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data source</title><p id="Par13">Data were extracted from the Integrated Patient Management Information System (IPMS), which records details of ED presentations, admissions and discharges. This system includes fields for documenting presenting complaints as determined at the time of triage. For this study, all patients recorded under the category &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d; were included. This categorisation is one of approximately 70 triage codes available and is used when patients present either clearly intoxicated or with problems likely resulting from alcohol use.</p><p id="Par14">Data collected included demographic information (age, gender, and housing status), details of associated injuries or complaints (e.g., head injuries, falls, assaults, and mental health issues), and additional details including mode of arrival, admission status, and discharge status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par15">The inclusion criteria encompassed all patients who presented to the ED in 2022 and 2023 and were coded as &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d; in the IPMS system. This study focused on patients tagged with this specific triage code, acknowledging that the usage and interpretation of this code might vary between triage personnel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par16">Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data, using Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 26. Categorical data were presented as counts and percentages and were compared using the Chi-square test. Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Comparisons between two groups with continuous data were performed using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and comparisons between three groups used the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test. A <italic>p</italic>-value of less than or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p id="Par17">The number of &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d; presentations was calculated as a percentage of total ED presentations. Yearly trends were examined by comparing the number of cases from 2022 to 2023 and analysing quarterly data within 2023. Demographic data were analysed to identify the most affected age and gender groups. The proportion of presentations involving people experiencing homelessness was calculated and repeat presentations by the same individuals were noted. For associated injuries, the study calculated the percentage of patients with each type of injury or complaint. Those with a head injury noted at triage were further examined to identify if advanced imaging (i.e., CT brain) was used and if the patient had an intracranial injury. The mode of arrival and outcome of presentations were also analysed to understand the burden on ambulance services and the disposition of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par18">Ethical approval was not sought for this study as this analysis was conducted as part of a health service evaluation.

There was an overall increase of 18% in &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d; ED presentations from 2022 to 2023, with a total of 1662 presentations (by 1109 unique patients) in the 2-year period. This represents 3% of the total number of presentations to ED. The majority of the patients were male (72%), with a median age of 39&#x000a0;years. The table also shows that the proportion of patients experiencing homelessness increased by 42% from 2022 to 2023, reaching 25% of the total presentations in 2023. The table also reveals that most of the patients were conveyed by ambulance (82%) and during the night (00:00&#x02013;05:59 and 18:00&#x02013;23:59). More patients were admitted to the hospital in 2023 (32, 4%) than in 2022 (19, 3%), with a significant <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.003. The table also indicates that the triage urgency of the patients increased in 2023, with more patients classified as immediate, very urgent or urgent (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002).

The findings revealed that 1662 presentations, representing 3% of all ED visits over the 2-year period, were categorised as &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d;. This 18% increase from 2022 to 2023 indicates a growing trend that necessitates immediate attention. The majority of these patients were male, with distinct age groups being more affected: males aged 30&#x02013;39&#x000a0;years and females aged 20&#x02013;29&#x000a0;years. This demographic trend aligns with existing literature suggesting that young adults and middle-aged individuals are particularly vulnerable to alcohol.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Implications of findings</title><p id="Par30">The data revealed that 23% of these presentations were from people experiencing homelessness, highlighting a significant intersection between alcohol and housing instability. Frequent presentations by people experiencing homelessness underscore the need for integrated health and social services to address the underlying issues contributing to repeated ED visits. This intersectionality suggests a broader social problem of multiple disadvantages where homelessness and substance abuse are mutually reinforcing issues that require comprehensive and coordinated intervention strategies. Limitations in accessing primary care and other health and social services may also contribute to these ED presentations.</p><p id="Par31">Moreover, there were notable differences in the proportions of people experiencing homelessness, patients with immediate triage urgency, and admitted patients between 2022 and 2023. This suggests a possible increase in the severity and complexity of alcohol-related ED presentations, further straining hospital resources. Part of this observed difference may also be a result of changes in social behaviour and access to or use of alcohol related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Associated injuries and concurrent issues</title><p id="Par32">The spectrum of alcohol-related harm is extensive. The data showed that 7% of patients presented with head injuries, 6% with injuries from falls or collapses, 5% had concurrent mental health issues, and 4% reported assaults.</p><p id="Par33">These injuries not only affect the individuals but also place additional burdens on the healthcare system, requiring specialised care and resources. The high prevalence of injuries and mental health issues among these patients calls for targeted interventions that address both physical and mental health needs.</p><p id="Par34">For those with head injuries, 3% are known to have had an intracranial haemorrhage. The majority (82%) of the patients with head injuries were managed clinically and did not require advanced imaging. This places a significant responsibility on the clinicians to ensure they do not expose patients to radiation, unless absolutely necessary. Almost one in five (18%) patients with a head injury noted at triage did have advanced imaging performed. This part of the service evaluation adds to our knowledge of the complexity involved in assessing and managing this challenging cohort of patients. This also has implications for how we may improve our service and the amount of advanced imaging that is required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Ambulance utilisation and ED resource burden</title><p id="Par35">The high percentage (81%) of patients conveyed by ambulance underscores the significant strain on emergency medical services. On average, two ambulances per day were dedicated to transporting patients categorised as &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d;, diverting resources from other critical emergencies. This utilisation pattern suggests that alcohol-related incidents are not only a hospital burden but also a substantial operational challenge for emergency medical services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Policy implications and future directions</title><p id="Par36">Policies like the Public Health Alcohol Act of 2018, which introduced minimum unit pricing, advertising restrictions and forthcoming health warning labels, represent positive steps towards mitigating alcohol-related harm. However, the study&#x02019;s findings are particularly pertinent in light of the proposed Sale of Alcohol Bill (2022), which aims to extend alcohol trading hours and increase the availability of alcohol outlets.</p><p id="Par37">International evidence suggests that extended trading hours are associated with increased alcohol-related harm, including higher rates of crime, traffic collisions, domestic violence, and other injuries requiring hospital treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, the opposite is true with reductions in alcohol trading hours resulting in less alcohol-related violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Rural communities may be particularly affected as Norwegian data suggests that extending bar closing hours increases the number of traffic collisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The potential exacerbation of alcohol-related ED presentations due to increased alcohol availability presents a significant public health risk. Policymakers must weigh the potential benefits of economic gains from extended trading hours against the likely increase in public health and safety risks.</p><p id="Par39">A possible policy intervention that could reduce alcohol-related harm and violence is the introduction of the Cardiff Model, a data monitoring system between hospitals and the police [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The Cardiff Model involves the anonymous and routine collection of data on the location, time, and weapon used in violent incidents from patients presenting to the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These data are then shared with the police and local authorities to inform crime prevention strategies and target high-risk areas. The Cardiff Model has been shown to reduce violence-related hospital admissions by 35% and serious violence reported by the police by 42% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This is particularly relevant to our study because of the location of MUH in the city centre and the relatively high number of assaults and injuries among our patients. Implementing the Cardiff Model could help reduce the burden of alcohol-related violence on the ED and the community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Comparison to other literature</title><p id="Par40">This study reports a comparatively smaller proportion of patients presenting to the ED with an alcohol-related issue compared to other recent Irish literature. McNicholl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] reported 5.9% of presentations to all EDs in Ireland, and Maharaj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] reported that 19.4% of presentations to Beaumont ED were alcohol-related. However, when comparing the findings of these studies to this study, it should be noted that the time period is not comparable. McNicholl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] studied four different 6-h periods selected in December 2015 and January 2016. Maharaj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] conducted their study over four 1-week periods between 4&#x000a0;pm and 4 am during the 8th to 15th of November, 28th of November to 4th of December 2021, 28th of February to 7th of March, and 3rd to 9th of April 2022. In addition, that study only included patients willing to participate in the survey and had a response rate of 73% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In contrast, this study included all ED presentations to MUH over a 2-year period. As alcohol-related presentations are less frequent during weekdays and during the day, this may partially explain the lower proportion of alcohol-related ED presentations. On the other hand, the data presented may underestimate the true rate of alcohol-related presentations in MUH as the data source used was not designed for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par41">Several limitations were acknowledged:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par42">Data reliability: The reliance on routinely collected data, not originally intended for service improvement analysis, may introduce inaccuracies or missing data.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Underreporting of alcohol-related presentations: Not all alcohol-related presentations may be captured under the &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d; code, possibly leading to an underestimation of the true burden of alcohol-related cases.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Variability in triage coding: As the triage code &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d; is applied based on the subjective assessment of triage personnel, its use and interpretation may vary, leading to potential inconsistencies. For example, some patients categorised as &#x0201c;Apparently Drunk&#x0201d; may not be intoxicated at the time of presentation, but this code was applied because the injuries sustained were deemed to be a result of alcohol. Intoxication with other drugs/substances also cannot be excluded. Additionally, associated injuries or co-presenting complaints may not be recorded consistently as only one presenting complaint is required by IPMS, and therefore, it is possible that not all presenting complaints are captured.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par45">
