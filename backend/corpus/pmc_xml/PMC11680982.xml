Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether HER2 signaling affects the effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitor administered in combination with endocrine therapy for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer and suitable intervention measures. This study revealed poor efficacy for CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer in vitro and in vivo models. Secondly, suppression of HER2 gene expression in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer cells resulted in significantly improved efficacy for CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy. Furthermore, the anti-HER inhibitor neratinib was administered to enhance the effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer by inhibiting the HER2 pathway and lowering HER2 mRNA expression. Strikingly, neratinib reversed the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy by reducing HER2 mRNA stability in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer through the interaction of HER2 3&#x02019;-UTR region with hsa-miR-23a-5p. Even after reducing neratinib dosage to the standard 1/2 dose (20&#x000a0;mg/kg), it remained highly effective and well-tolerated. This study provides a viable and well-tolerated triple combination therapy for clinical HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-82137-9.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Neratinib</kwd><kwd>HER2 mRNA stability</kwd><kwd>HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low</kwd><kwd>CDK4/6 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Endocrine therapy</kwd><kwd>Hsa-miR-23a-5p</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Science and Technology Innovation Medical Development Foundation of Beijing</institution></funding-source><award-id>KC2022-ZZ-0091-1</award-id><award-id>KC2021-ZZ-0010-9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Liushan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022A1515110859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82274513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Project supported by the Incubation Program for the Science and Technology Development of Chinese Medicine Guangdong Laboratory</institution></funding-source><award-id>HQL2024PZ023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive(+)/Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative(-) breast cancer represents an important clinical challenge, for which the combination of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors with endocrine therapy has emerged as the standard conventional option for both first-line and second-line treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

This implies a potential effect of HER2-low status on the response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2- breast cancer, possibly associated with resistance mechanisms. Nevertheless, another study reported contradictory results, demonstrating enhanced efficacy for aromatase inhibitors in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors in the HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low subgroup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Subsequent retrospective analyses also proposed that CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy may not show reduced efficacy in all HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer cases, and it is likely that HER2 expression may be a contributing factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Despite these insights, experimental validation and elucidation of the underpinning biological mechanisms have not been performed, and interventions governing the impact of HER2-low expression on the response to CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer remain elusive.</p><p id="Par5">While molecular targeted agents such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab have shown limited efficacy in HER2-low breast cancer subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are promising in individuals with HER2 mutations within the advanced HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subgroup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

Specifically, several groups were established, including a normal saline control group; a group administered CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy; a triple therapy group administered a medium-dose of neratinib (20&#x000a0;mg/kg), CDK4/6 inhibitor, and endocrine therapy; a low-dose neratinib triple therapy group (10&#x000a0;mg/kg); and a separate group administered a medium-dose of neratinib (20&#x000a0;mg/kg) alone. Remarkably, mouse experiments unambiguously revealed that the medium dose of neratinib not only retained its potential to enhance the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer but also had good tolerability (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

This research further confirmed the decreased effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy in the HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low subgroup. Strikingly, this investigation also demonstrated that neratinib reversed the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy by reducing HER2 mRNA stability in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer via the interaction of HER2&#x02019;s 3&#x02019;-UTR region with hsa-miR-23a-5p, and discovered that even when reducing neratinib dosage to the standard half dose (20&#x000a0;mg/kg), it remained highly effective and well-tolerated. Notably, the administered neratinib dose considerably deviated from current clinical standards, providing an innovative perspective on a potent, well-tolerated, and enhanced treatment strategy for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer, extending beyond CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy.</p><p id="Par38">Previous reports have demonstrated the variable responsiveness of HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer to the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy. Another study revealed a favorable outcome when utilizing an aromatase inhibitor combined with palbociclib within the HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low subtype. In contrast, discrepant data emanated from the Elizabeth Hospital of Hong Kong, where the median progression-free survival (mPFS) of fulvestrant combined with palbociclib in the HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low subtype had a notably decreased duration, accompanied by a corresponding reduction in efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Totally 11.7&#x02013;14.8% of HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low cases had HER2-enrich phenotypes, according to a retrospective analysis of the MONALEESA study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently, the clinical data may be affected if the fraction of HER2 varies. In summary, we studied the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low and HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-0 breast cancer cell subtypes both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="Par39">Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have unequivocally revealed the significant growth-inhibitory effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-0 and HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer cell subtypes. However, the efficacy of this regimen is remarkably hampered in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer compared with the HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-0 subtype. Addressing this enigma, our innovative approach included knocking down HER2 in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer cells, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the inhibitory effects exerted by the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, including activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, FAT1 deletion, FGFR1 activation, MDM2 dysregulation, mTOR activation, and regulated signaling pathways such as WEE1 and CDK7 overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. These mechanisms may impair the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors by disrupting the Cyclin D1-CDK4/6-Rb pathway, which regulates cell cycle progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This study examined the expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4, key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, revealing that knocking down HER2 in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cells cancer blocked the G1 phase and downregulated Cyclin D1 and CDK4. This suggests that HER2 is an important mediator in the transition of tumor cells from G1 to the S phase and represents an upstream pathway affecting the Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 pathway in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The current findings support previous studies highlighting the significance of low HER2 expression in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Overall, this study indicates an imperative role for the HER2 pathway in determining the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer. Furthermore, even with attenuated HER2 expression in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer, the intricate interplay of HER2-associated pathways requires thorough consideration while investigating the mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy, thereby unveiling the complex landscape of treatment response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par40">Pertinently, mTOR pathway activation has an adverse association with the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This intriguing finding prompted the TRINITI-1 trial, where a composite regimen encompassing a CDK4/6 inhibitor, an mTOR inhibitor, and an aromatase inhibitor was meticulously examined. Unfortunately, this approach yielded unsatisfactory outcomes, with a meager ORR of merely 8.4%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In stark contrast, the noteworthy DESTINY-Breast 04 study unveiled an impressive ORR of 52.6% using the innovative ADC agent T-DXd in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer. The T-DXd treatment cohort exhibited remarkably enhanced PFS and OS versus the chemotherapy arm, thereby highlighting T-DXd&#x02019;s profound potential as a pioneering targeted intervention for HER2-low breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the efficacy spectrum is broadened by other ADC agents, corroborating their potency against HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, this study centered on CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. However, it left uncharted the unexplored field of combined therapy involving T-DXd, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and endocrine therapy. This study revealed that the triad combination of neratinib, CDK4/6 inhibitor, and endocrine therapy exerted superior suppression of HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer growth. Nonetheless, an intriguing observation emerged as the standard neratinib dose (40&#x000a0;mg/kg) showed suboptimal tolerability in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. In a captivating twist, halving of neratinib dose (20&#x000a0;mg/kg, medium dose) not only retained its efficacy but also improved tolerability (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Intriguingly, further dose reduction to one-fourth (10&#x000a0;mg/kg, low dose) resulted in attenuated efficacy (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). This dynamic interplay suggests that the required dosage of neratinib may be extraneous for HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low patients, particularly informed by HER2-positive breast cancer studies. These findings collectively lay a robust experimental foundation, substantiating the clinical viability of a novel regimen comprising medium-dose neratinib, CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy, offering an important avenue for optimizing treatment in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer.</p><p id="Par41">To determine the reason behind the efficacy difference between the two-drug regimen of CDK 4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy and the three-drug regimen comprising CDK 4/6 inhibitor, endocrine therapy combined with neratinib in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer, we also analyzed HER2 mRNA levels. We knocked down HER2 in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer cells and found no difference in the inhibitory effects of the three-agent regimen including CDK 4/6 inhibitor, endocrine therapy combined with neratinib on cell proliferation. These findings suggest that HER2 mRNA expression in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer correlates with the efficacy of CDK 4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy. Intriguingly, this finding aligns seamlessly with the retrospective MONALEESA study, where PAM50 analysis revealed that the clinical efficacy of CDK 4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy is not universally compromised in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancers, and subsets such as luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basic-like phenotypes had notably lower efficacy compared with the luminal A subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This nuanced understanding partially untangles the web of discrepant findings in clinical trials, potentially explained by varying levels of HER2 mRNA expression in the enrolled cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par42">Furthermore, this study revealed a notable reduction in HER2 mRNA stability in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer patients administered CDK 4/6 inhibitors, endocrine therapy, and neratinib three-agent regimens in comparison with CDK 4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy. This was achieved by HER2&#x02019;s 3&#x02019;-UTR region interacting with hsa-miR-23a-5p. This phenomenon supports the notion that the effect of the small molecule neratinib on augmenting treatment efficacy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer transcends the confines of the conventional HER2 pathway. Intriguingly, such augmentation might extend beyond HER2 protein regulation, encapsulating transcriptional regulation and miRNA hsa-miR-23a-5p modulation, an unknown mechanism in small molecule neratinib studies. Contextually, parallel insights emerged from the realm of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies. De Haas et al. revealed substantial reductions in HER2 mRNA after treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. However, further investigation is required to examine whether anti-HER2 macromolecular monoclonal antibodies also enhance the efficacy of CDK 4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer.</p><p id="Par43">This study had limitations. First, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy separately on the HER2 pathway in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer were not examined. Therefore, our data do not address whether the ultimate improvement in the efficacy of neratinib combined with CDK4/6 inhibitor rely on the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitor, endocrine therapy, or both. This study also lacked dose adjustments for palbociclib and fulvestrant, which prevents the determination of the optimal combination of the three drugs. Additionally, the cell lines used were identified as HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low according to public databases, and these limitations may affect the current findings and conclusions.</p><p id="Par44">The current investigation demonstrated a significant relationship between hsa-miR-23a-5p expression in low HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer and neratinib, affecting CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. However, a critical aspect remains untapped, i.e., the determination of the precise threshold of hsa-miR-23a-5p expression that substantively affects the efficacy of CDK 4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy. This uncharted field warrants further investigation to illuminate the future clinical translation prospects of the &#x0201c;medium-dose Ner&#x02009;+&#x02009;ET&#x02009;+&#x02009;CDK4/6i&#x0201d; triple combination therapy. We need to clarify this in future studies based on clinical samples. In addition, we advocate the systematic inclusion of HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid models in future studies, which represents a promising avenue to unravel this intricate aspect. At the time, it is important to note that in vitro and mouse studies may lack direct clinical relevance in predicting the effectiveness or tolerability of triple combinations in clinical setting. Additionally, it should be acknowledged that T-DXd is currently established as the standard of care for patients with advanced, pretreated, HER2-low breast cancer based on current literature and clinical guidelines. Therefore, it is necessary to further validate the findings of this study in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">This study newly found that the HER2 pathway is crucial in modulating the response to CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2-low breast cancer.
