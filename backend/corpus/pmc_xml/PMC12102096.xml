The lack of effective treatment for OA creates a need for the development of new therapeutic approaches that may rely on stem cells including mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their derivatives such as extracellular vesicles (EVs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of MSCs derived from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) and umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and their EVs on cartilage-bone injury in vivo, to identify the specimen with the highest regenerative potential for further clinical applications in patients with OA. Humanized pigs underwent cartilage-bone injuries followed by intraarticular administration of products containing AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs or UC-MSC-EVs mixed with hyaluronic acid (HA) or HA alone (for comparison). After 6-m follow-up, almost-fully-healed cartilage-bone defects were observed in the AT-MSC- and UC-MSC-treated pigs, and the defects were filled primarily with hyaline cartilage. In AT-MSC-EV- and UC-MSC-EV-treated pigs, a partial cartilage-bone tissue repair was observed, and the defects were filled primarily with fibrocartilage. The control pigs demonstrated limited regeneration capacity. The microcomputed tomography parameters of the subchondral bone indicated the ongoing progression of OA in controls, whereas in the MSC- and MSC-EV-treated pigs, the parameters indicated the cessation of OA progression. Moreover, no serious side effects were observed after the administration of products containing MSCs or MSC-EVs. The results indicate the safety and regenerative activity of MSCs on injured tissues, which favors not only the healing and improvement of bone structure but also the formation of hyaline cartilage. Superior tissue repair was observed after the administration of products containing AT-MSCs. The treatment of OA with MSC-EVs needs further standardization.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2">

One such condition, osteoarthritis (OA), is a degenerative joint condition that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness, affecting the ability of a person to move freely. OA affects the entire joint, including the articular cartilage, resulting in a narrowing of the joint space and an increase in direct loading of the underlying bone, which may cause loss of joint mobility. Progressive cartilage erosion is accompanied by structural changes in the underlying subchondral bone, low-grade inflammation, and synovitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As OA is more prevalent in people older than 55 y (mostly women), the global prevalence is expected to increase with increasing population age. The typical onset of OA is in the late 40s to mid-50s, although OA may also affect younger people, including athletes and people who sustain joint injury or trauma or suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, gout, diabetes, or obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. OA is most common in the knees, hips, spine, and hands. According to the WHO report, it is predicted that by 2050, OA will affect 130&#x000a0;million people worldwide, of which approximately 40&#x000a0;million will be severely disabled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">It is well known that there is no cure for OA that is able to recreate the degraded articular cartilage to eliminate the primary symptoms. However, according to the OA guidelines and a systematic review of the OA literature, worldwide experts from relevant medical disciplines have recommended treatment modalities for patients suffering from knee OA. After pain is managed, the subsequent core interventions for patients with OA, with or without comorbidities, include biomechanical interventions, intraarticular corticosteroids, exercise, self-management and education, strength training and weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It has been shown that intraarticular injections of corticosteroids improve function in patients with OA but provide only short-term pain relief (1&#x02013;2 weeks in randomized controlled trials). Moreover, intraarticular injections administered more frequently than once every four months may result in additional cartilage and joint damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In recent years, the injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) has become a more popular treatment option for OA because of its high tolerability, improved joint lubrication and ability to delay the need for prosthetic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A similar beneficial effect was observed following the injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which effectively decreased pain and stiffness and improved functional joint motion in patients with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Injection of PRP provides continued pain relief for up to 1 y after injection, whereas the administration of corticosteroids and HA have good efficacy and are suitable for many patients but lack this longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The most common surgical intervention for end-stage knee OA is total knee arthroplasty, an invasive procedure that is often associated with the risk of complications and should be performed as a last resort after exhausting all other therapeutic options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Due to the lack of an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of OA, which could effectively eliminate not only symptoms but also their underlying causes, new innovative therapeutic approaches, including those that use stem cells, are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), a specific type of adult stem cells, possess high potential in tissue engineering and regenerative therapy due to their capacity for self-renewal and great differentiation potential. Their wide availability, multipotent characteristics, and low immunogenicity have made them a promising treatment alternative in the field of regenerative medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MSCs are able to efficiently downregulate immune inflammatory processes, making them promising candidates for inhibiting the influx of immune cells characteristic of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the precise mechanism through which MSCs promote joint repair is not yet known, it is postulated that implanted MSCs differentiate into chondrocytes and may also secrete bioactive derivatives (such as extracellular vesicles (EVs)) that encourage the proliferation and anabolism of articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to compare the safety and pro-regenerative potential of MSCs derived from two independent source tissues, human adipose tissue (AT) and human umbilical cord (UC), and their EV derivatives to select the most optimal biologically active substance for the development of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) for further clinical trials in humans. In this study, we meticulously evaluated the condition of the articular cartilage, subchondral bone plate, and trabecular bone and identified the types of newly formed tissues in cartilage-bone defects after intraarticular injection of investigational products. Preclinical tests of investigational medicinal products in in vivo models are required in order to obtain approval to conduct clinical trials in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Isolation and Culture of AT-MSCs</title><p id="Par6">Human adipose tissue (AT) was collected from healthy donors via liposuction with the approval of the Bioethics Committee of the Regional Medical Chamber in Krakow, Poland (Opinion No. 122.6120.13.2017). The collected lipoaspirate was washed with PBS solution without Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> (HyClone, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) supplemented with 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to prevent accidental microbial/fungal contamination and remove red blood cells. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were isolated via the enzymatic digestion of AT with 0.2 PZ U/mg Collagenase NB 6 GMP Grade (Nordmark) for 40&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

The cytotoxic effect on porcine endothelial cells, leading to their lysis, is also caused by the binding of the porcine ULBP1 antigen to NKG2D receptors and the previously unidentified NKp44 antigen. Surface antigens present on the surface of cells other than endothelial cells may also be involved in NK cell activation. Nevertheless, the elimination of ULBP1 from the surface of endothelial cells and the expression of human HLA-E may be effective in preventing NK-cell-mediated xenograft rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

Both the enzyme and the sugar residue are absent in humans and Old World monkeys. In humans, however, xenoreactive antibodies against the porcine Gal antigen are present; these antibodies recognize the Gal epitope on the surface of porcine endothelial cells, among others, and activate the enzymatic complement cascade in the recipient, which results in rapid rejection of the xenograft. In the cells of transgenic animals with an inactivated GGTA1 gene, no enzyme is present; thus, no Gal epitope is formed. The organs of such animals are characterized by reduced immunogenicity.

To confirm their trilineage differentiation potential and simultaneously determine their biological potential to transdifferentiate into cells that build body tissues (such as cartilage and bone), which is one of the possible mechanisms of MSC action in injured tissues, AT-derived cells were differentiated into chondroblasts, osteoblasts or adipocytes over a period of 14, 21, or 11 d (using tissue-specific differentiation media), respectively.

Thus, transgenic pigs underwent surgical procedures to induce mechanical cartilage-bone injuries of the femoral bone in the knee (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A-F), followed by injection of investigational products containing AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs or UC-MSC-EVs (as an active substance) resuspended in carrier solution and further mixed with high-molecular-weight HA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G, H). Carrier solution mixed with high-molecular-weight HA was injected for comparison (group: HA). Pigs in these groups were compared with untreated pigs (cartilage-bone defects were left for self-healing; group: Control). The viability of both AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs was &#x02265;&#x02009;97.0% before the preparation of the cell-based products but was &#x02265;&#x02009;96.0% after mixing the cell suspensions with high-molecular-weight HA (Supplementary File 1: Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

Importantly, cartilage and bone defects were almost never observed in pigs in the AT-MSCs group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, Supplementary File 1: Tables S1 and S2), i.e., their volumes were 0.23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.47 mm<sup>3</sup> for the cartilage defects and 0.81&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.62 mm<sup>3</sup> for the bone defects. The volumes of cartilage and bone defects were also low in pigs in the UC-MSCs group (2.45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.01 mm<sup>3</sup> for cartilage defects and 10.10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.57 mm<sup>3</sup> for bone defects; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Interestingly, pigs in the HA group demonstrated limited regeneration capacity, i.e., tissue defects were still detected on the surface of the joints; moreover, the volume of cartilage defects was comparable to that of the defects in pigs in the Control group (9.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.73 mm<sup>3</sup> in the HA group vs. 10.26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.93 mm<sup>3</sup> in the Control group), whereas the volume of bone defects was smaller than that in pigs in the Control group (23.72&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;31.46 mm<sup>3</sup> in the HA group vs. 43.92 mm<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;29.98 mm<sup>3</sup> in the Control group), suggesting that treatment without biologically active MSCs or EVs was not sufficient to repair the defects and regenerate damaged tissues.

The greatest cartilage thickness above a bone defect was observed in pigs in the AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs groups.

</p><p id="Par41">In the present study, in addition to the articular cartilage condition, we also analyzed selected parameters of the subchondral bone, which was separated into two distinct anatomic entities: the subchondral bone plate (SBP) and the trabecular bone. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the SBP was slightly greater in pigs in the Control and HA groups than in pigs in the other groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B; Supplementary File 1: Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Interestingly, patients with OA have been shown to have a 15% higher bone density than healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The other parameter analyzed, SBP thickness, was also significantly greater in pigs in the Control and HA groups than in pigs in the other groups and in their healthy unoperated joints. Importantly, the thickness of the SBP in healthy unoperated joints was close to that measured in the operated joints of pigs in the AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs, and UC-MSC-EVs groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B), which may indicate the cessation of OA progression and continued tissue regeneration. In early OA, when the cartilage is still intact, the thickness of the subchondral cortical (bone) plate decreases due to an elevated rate of bone remodeling, whereas in late OA, when degenerative changes are evident in the articular cartilage, the thickness of the subchondral plate increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which is consistent with the observations of our study.</p><p id="Par42">With respect to the BMD of the trabecular bone, we observed slightly greater values in pigs in the Control and HA groups than in pigs in the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups. Interestingly, the BMD values of the SBP and trabecular bone in healthy unoperated joint were close to the values obtained for the pigs in the Control and HA groups, which may have been caused by unloading of the operated limbs and shifting the body weight to the healthy leg. Moreover, degenerative changes in the articular cartilage of unoperated limbs were observed (data not shown). However, the other parameter, the ratio of bone volume to total sample volume (BV/TV) measured close to the site of the bone defect, was significantly greater in pigs in the Control and HA groups than in the unoperated joints and in pigs in the other groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C; Supplementary File 1: Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>), which may indicate increased bone remodeling and formation around the defect. Patients with OA have been shown to have a 30% increase in bone volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Notably, histological analysis revealed thickening of the bone trabeculae in the subchondral layer in pigs in every group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), suggesting an ongoing postinjury bone remodeling process. However, the percentage of pigs that showed thickening of the bone trabeculae was the highest among pigs in the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups (&#x0003e;&#x02009;83% of the pigs), indicating a superior regeneration process.

</p><p id="Par44">Importantly, after a 6-m follow-up period, in 63.7 and 60.0% of pigs in the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups, respectively, we observed almost-fully-healed defects with newly formed hyaline cartilage, as shown by histological analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, B). We also detected the formation of fibrocartilage in 27.3 and 30.0% of pigs in the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups, respectively. In pigs in the Control group, the defects were filled with hyaline cartilage (33.3% of pigs), fibrocartilage (16.7% of pigs), or fat bodies (16.7% of pigs) or were unfilled (33.3% of pigs), whereas in pigs in the HA group, the defects were filled with hyaline cartilage (28.5% of pigs), fibrocartilage (42.9% of pigs), or fat bodies (14.3% of pigs) or were unfilled (14.3% of pigs). The percentage of unfilled defects was visibly greater in pigs in the Control group.

No neoplasms or other potential side effects related to the administered products were observed in any pigs in the AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, and HA groups, confirming the safety of both MSC populations and the control product (HA). No neoplasms were detected in pigs in the AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs groups. However, in two pigs in each of these groups, a supposed overgrowth of cartilage was observed, indicating that MSC-EVs represent biologically active particles but that the intraarticular site of administration or the dose used in this study may not be optimal for the induction of proper tissue regeneration.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">The purpose of the present study was to preclinically evaluate the regenerative potential of AT- and UC-derived MSCs and their derivatives (such as MSC-EVs) for the treatment of cartilage-bone injury compared with the commonly used orthopedic hyaluronic acid (HA) in a transgenic pig model to identify safe and effective products for further clinical trials in humans.</p><p id="Par50">In the first stage of the study, we established optimized protocols (meeting GMP requirements) for the isolation and culture of MSCs derived from adult tissues such as AT and tissues associated with neonatal birth, such as UC, which are the main sources of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The identities of both AT-derived cells and UC-derived cells isolated as MSCs were successfully confirmed according to ISCT recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Notably, AT collection through liposuction is relatively noninvasive for patients, and AT represents often medical waste from various surgical/esthetic medicine procedures. In addition, UC also represents post-delivery medical waste. In adult recipients, AT-derived MSCs can be used in autologous or allogenic clinical applications, whereas UC-MSCs are used mainly in allogenic transplants. It should always be considered that, depending on the desired use of MSCs (or even MSC-EVs) in distinct tissue injury treatments, protocols for the isolation and culture of MSCs need to be set up and specifically optimized to obtain cells with the most optimal biological properties and therapeutic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Importantly, the capacity of the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs to differentiate into chondroblasts/chondrocytes as well as osteoblasts/osteocytes, along with their potential to secrete MSC-EVs, as major mechanisms of MSC action in injured tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], confirmed the rationale of this study aiming bone/ cartilage repair in OA.</p><p id="Par51">MSC-EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation using a protocol optimized in our laboratory in accordance with the recommendations of the ISEV, which allowed us to isolate a heterogenous population of small and medium/large EVs from both populations of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Subsequently, we found that isolates of both AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs represented heterogeneous populations of particles with sizes ranging from approximately 80&#x02013;430&#x000a0;nm, carrying parental cell-specific antigens (i.e., CD73, CD90, and CD105) and tetraspanins (i.e., CD63 and CD81) and not possessing hematopoietic cell markers (i.e., CD34 and CD45) on their surface, confirming their MSC-EV identity. The particle size distributions and antigenic profiles of both MSC-EVs were similar to the ones we observed in our other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The safety and biological potential of cell-based (containing AT-MSCs or UC-MSCs as active substances) or cell-free (containing AT-MSC-EVs or UC-MSC-EVs as active substances) products were evaluated by intraarticular injection in a large preclinical pig model of cartilage-bone injury in vivo. In the present study, genetically modified pigs were used to eliminate the risk of acute (or chronic) cellular rejection. These animals can also be used as organ donors for xenotransplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, in a pig model of cartilage-bone defect, the proportions of cartilage-bone defects are closer to the dimensions of human defects than are those in other animal models in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">After 6-m of follow-up, we observed almost-fully-healed cartilage-bone defects mainly in two groups of pigs: the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups, when compared to pigs in the other groups. Importantly, cartilage and bone defects were almost never observed in pigs in the AT-MSCs group, indicating superior tissue regeneration. The volumes of cartilage and bone defects were also low in pigs in the UC-MSCs groups, suggesting effective tissue healing. Pigs in the HA group presented a limited regeneration capacity; i.e., tissue defects were still detected on the surface of the joints. Moreover, the volume of cartilage defects in HA group was comparable to the control untreated group, whereas the volume of bone defects was smaller than that in pigs in the Control group, suggesting that the treatment only with HA - without biologically active MSCs or EVs, was not sufficient to repair the defects and regenerate damaged tissues. Furthermore, we observed a lower degree of cartilage-bone tissue regeneration in the pigs in the AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs groups.</p><p id="Par54">Importantly, in pigs in the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups, approximately 60.0% of the observed almost-fully-healed tissue defects were filled with newly formed hyaline cartilage, while only approximately 30.0% were filled with fibrocartilage. On the other hand, fibrocartilage formation was promoted in the AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs groups (in 50.0 and 60.0% of pigs, respectively). In pigs in the untreated Control group, the defects were unhealed in about 30% of animals or filled with hyaline cartilage (30%), fibrocartilage (17%) or fat bodies, whereas in pigs in the HA group, only about 15% of pigs was unhealed or the defects were filled with hyaline cartilage (30% of pigs), fibrocartilage (40%) or fat bodies, suggesting that HA administration (without biologically active MSCs or MSC-EVs) may promote the formation of fibrocartilage. The greatest cartilage thickness above the bone defects was observed in pigs in the AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs groups, indicating that the treatment of cartilage-bone injury with MSC-based products (especially cell-based medicinal products) seems to be crucial for induction of tissue repair.</p><p id="Par55">Thus, data from experiments in pigs indicate the regenerative activity of both populations of MSCs in cartilage tissue, which favors not only the healing process but also the formation of hyaline cartilage, which represents a normal type of cartilage tissue on a joint bone surface. No currently available repair therapy (such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, microfracture, drilling, mosaicplasty, and allograft transplantation) recreates native hyaline cartilage and provides long-term restoration due to mainly the formation of fibrocartilage and/or poor matrix properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This highlights the need to develop a new therapy that promotes the formation of hyaline cartilage at the site of tissue damage, which was undertaken in this study. Attempts to create such solutions using MSCs have been made by several research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In patients with knee OA, bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs embedded in collagen gel were transplanted into the articular cartilage defect in the medial femoral condyle and covered with autologous periosteum, improving the arthroscopic and histological grading scores compared with those of the cell-free control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, in a canine model of mechanically induced cartilage defects, BM-MSCs in combination with HA injected into the knee joint cavity, regenerated more cartilage-like tissue than did HA alone or saline (significant improvement in cartilage defect regeneration was observed after BM-MSC treatment). The cartilage-bone defects were filled with neocartilage (of an unspecified kind) along with the formation of chondrocytes, whereas in HA-treated animals, some tissue similar to cartilage and fibrous tissue was observed. However, in untreated animals, the formation of neocartilage was rarely observed at the defect site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, Lin et al. compared the pro-regenerative potential of human AT-MSCs and pig UC-MSCs in a porcine articular cartilage defect model and revealed that the human AT-MSCs were more effective in repairing cartilage than pig UC-MSCs, suggesting that MSC-based treatments (especially with cells derived from AT) hold promise as options for cartilage repair, which could aid in the treatment of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This is consistent with results from the current study where MSCs isolated from AT and UC were used.</p><p id="Par56">Although AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs have been shown to exhibit a similar chondrogenic potential, UC-MSCs showed a lower osteogenic differentiation capacity when compared to AT-MSCs in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, after 6-m of follow up, we still observed slightly larger remnant bone defects in UC-MSC group when compared to AT-MSC group, which may be the result of lower osteogenic potential of UC-MSCs. It should be taken into account that MSCs are alive cells, and their mechanisms of action may be based on their direct differentiation into bone and cartilage cells, along with their paracrine activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a rat model of OA, Ju et al. have demonstrated that both AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs inhibited OA progression after the intraarticular cell injection as well as significantly protected chondrocytes against apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In other in vitro and in vivo studies, EVs released by MSC and representing non-viable objects, have been shown to increase chondrocyte proliferation and migration, inhibit apoptosis and stimulate chondrogenic differentiation of endogenous progenitor/stem cells, suggesting their paracrine mode of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, EVs have been reported to increase the expression of hyaline cartilage components such as aggrecan and type II collagen at both the gene and protein levels, while reducing the expression and secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ADAMTS5 in chondrocytes in vitro and in knee tissues in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the precise mechanism of EV action during cartilage and bone regeneration is still not well investigated. Moreover, the numerous parameters of EV-based medicinal products still need to be optimized (including e.g. source of EVs, their isolation method, dosage) prior clinical translation of EVs to achieve high outcome in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">The cartilage degeneration process in OA may be evaluated and graded based on a modified G0&#x02013;G3 Outerbridge classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], where a higher grade corresponds to more extensive cartilage surface disruption (i.e., G0 represents pristine cartilage with no visible breaks in the surface, whereas G3 is characterized by marked softness to touch and deep and relatively wide disruption of the cartilage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It has been experimentally shown that the thickness of the SBP is significantly elevated in patients with G2 and G3 of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In our study, we observed a significant increase in the thickness of the SBP only in pigs in the Control and HA groups (compared with pigs in the MSC- and EV- treated groups), which may suggest further degenerative changes in cartilage and bone tissue in untreated or HA- treated animals, along with the cessation of OA progression in MSC- and MSC-EV-treated pigs. Furthermore, the BMD of the SBP and trabecular bone was slightly elevated in pigs in the Control and HA groups compared with those in the other groups, which corresponds to adverse progression in OA. Interestingly, the elevated BMD values of the SBP and the trabecular bone were also observed in healthy unoperated joints (and were similar to those for the operated joints of pigs in the Control and HA groups), which may be caused by the relieve of the injured limb and overweighting the healthy leg by the injured animal. Moreover, in pigs in these groups, the other parameter - the ratio of bone volume to total sample volume (BV/TV), was significantly higher than that in the unoperated joints and in pigs in the MSC and MSC-EV groups, indicating also ongoing degenerative changes in cartilage-bone tissues. It has been shown that patients with OA exhibit a 15% higher bone density and a 30% higher bone volume than healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which is consistent with our observations in the pig model. In contrast, in pigs in the AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs groups, the thickness of the SBP fell within the normal range for these animals. The current study confirmed the beneficial effect of MSCs and MSC-EVs on SBP and trabecular bone indicating their positive impact on regeneration process. Moreover, in our study, the percentage of pigs that showed thickening of the bone trabeculae was the highest among the animals in the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups, indicating a superior regeneration process of subchondral bone in these groups of animals. It should be taken into consideration that subchondral bone may impact on cartilage regeneration: the subchondral bone not only nourishes the cartilage, but also stabilizes it and supplies endogenous MSCs and the growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that changes in the metabolism of the subchondral bone are an integral part of the OA development and progression. Thus, there is a strong rationale for developing therapeutic approaches that behind articular cartilage may also target subchondral bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Although we did not observe a high degree of regeneration of cartilage-bone defects after intraarticular injection of products containing both types of MSC-EVs, the pro-regenerative potential of human MSC-derived exosomes (the fraction of smaller MSC-EVs) in the treatment of osteochondral defects was presented by Wong et al., who reported that tissue defects were filled with newly repaired tissues composed mainly of hyaline cartilage along with improvement in the mechanical properties of regenerated cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This finding indicates that the MSC-EVs tested in the present study may be used to treat tissue injury in the future, but their application requires additional extensive research and optimization, including determining the effective dose, route of administration and type of carrier in the selected intended treatment, which steps are required by the European Medicines Agency when designing advanced therapy medical products (ATMPs) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ema.europa.eu">https://www.ema.europa.eu</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par59">With respect to safety, we did not observe the formation of neoplasms or other side effects related to the injected products in pigs in the AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs groups. The meta-analysis conducted by Wang et al. covered 62 randomized clinical trials using MSCs in various indications and clearly confirmed that MSC administration was safe in patients when compared with other placebo modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. MSC-EVs are also known for their confirmed safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], which was also observed in our study. However, in two pigs (each in the AT-MSC-EVs and UC-MSC-EVs groups), a supposed overgrowth of cartilage was observed, indicating that MSC-EVs represent biologically active particles stimulating cartilage growth, but that the intraarticular site of administration or the dose used in this study may not be optimal for the induction of proper tissue formation and requires further investigations.</p><p id="Par60">In summary, our in vivo data indicate the safety and pro-regenerative activity on cartilage tissue of AT-MSCs and UC-MSCs, favoring not only the healing process but also the formation of hyaline cartilage, which represents the normal type of cartilage tissue on the joint bone surface. A superior pro-regenerative capacity was observed for AT-MSCs, which were subsequently chosen as an active substance for an ATMP product for clinical trials using patients with OA. The use of MSC-EVs for the treatment of cartilage-bone defects needs further evaluation. MSCs and MSC-EVs may also exert beneficial effects on the SBP and trabecular bone, which should also be considered as a target for effective OA therapy. To conclude, the treatment of cartilage-bone defects with products containing MSCs as an active substance favors the healing process of injured tissues along with the formation of hyaline cartilage, which represents the normal type of cartilage tissue on a joint bone surface. MSCs represent promising candidates for effective and safe biologically active substances that may be used in the development of ATMPs for use in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
