It is well-known that the use of vocabularies in these publications is often inconsistent. While natural language processing and machine learning techniques are capable of extracting phenotypic information from the literature [e.g. <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], due to the significant variability in vocabulary usages [e.g. <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and their lack of clear definitions, the extracted characters and character states do not have the interoperability and reusability for broader biological research [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Further, translating extracted raw character data into ontological expressions is also extremely challenging. Not only computerized methods underperformed human data curators in conversion accuracy, the variation among human curators themselves was also remarkable, sometimes exceeding 40% [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Inter-curator variation is widely reported by other projects in biology and other domains [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;11</xref>]. This variability is influenced by factors such as the curators&#x02019; academic background, the original descriptions&#x02019; clarity, issues with ontology usability, and the inherent creativity of human intelligence. Additionally, the studies done by the Phenoscape project revealed that even the consensus reached by multiple curators does not always align with the original authors&#x02019; intentions, highlighting the complexities in post-publication phenotypic data curation [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>These findings suggest that neither machine learning, including large language models used by Generative AI, nor professional curation [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] stands as sustainable solutions for FAIR phenotype data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) production. Interoperability and reusability in FAIR depend on well-defined data that can be computationally and reliably compared across projects/domains. However, current publications often include unstandardized descriptors&#x02014;&#x0201d;maroon&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;red brown,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;lanceolate&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;linear,&#x0201d; and differing measurements such as &#x0201c;3mm&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;5mm,&#x0201d; which cannot be reliably compared without knowing the landmarks used for the measurements. While these may be clear to an individual researcher or within a project, once published, the connections to these local definitions are often lost. Such ambiguity in published phenotypic characters has frustrated data producers and data consumers alike, as revealed by a recent survey [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among the respondents, 73% were frustrated with the ambiguity, and 85% were willing to adopt a new authoring workflow to produce FAIR phenotypic data for publication.</p><p>Authors hold sole authority over the data they produce [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the &#x0201c;Authors in the Driver&#x02019;s Seat&#x0201d; project, we developed a prototype software system to explore the integration of ontologies into the taxonomic data authoring workflow. This proof-of-concept system allows for characters and character states to be defined using ontologies, enabling the harvesting of the taxon-by-character matrix as both knowledge graphs (e.g. RDF, Resource Description Framework) for computer agents and text narratives for human readers.</p><p>The prototype system consists of three main components, Character Recorder, Ontology Backend, and Conflict Resolver (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The web-based Character Recorder provides an interface for creating character matrices with ontology terms and communicates with the Ontology Backend. The Ontology Backend (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/biosemantics/charaparser-web" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/biosemantics/charaparser-web</ext-link>) is a customized Java Webservice employing Java Owl API. It loads Carex Ontology, and therefore holds all characters, character states, and the necessary concepts for their definitions and for Character Recorder semantic functionality. The Ontology Backend receives new terms from Character Recorder users and monitors ontologies for potential issues, which are then forwarded to the mobile app, Conflict Resolver. This app allows domain experts to address and resolve ontological issues, and these resolutions are fed back to the Ontology Backend. Users of the Character Recorder are notified of ontology updates via its matrix and ontology updates interfaces. This workflow enables users to: (i) immediately add and utilize new terms when needed, (ii) remain informed about updates to their primary domain ontologies, and (iii) contribute to the ontologies&#x02019; development to ensure they align with their cognitive framework. As a case study, we used the plant genus <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> and created the Carex Ontology with relevant semantic constructs needed to support Character Recorder. While the Ontology Backend can load any OWL ontologies, the Carex Ontology provides the specific annotations and relations needed to support the semantic features of the Character Recorder.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>System diagram for the author-driven computable phenotypic data and ontology development platform.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f1" position="float"/></fig><p>In this article, we describe the construction of Carex Ontology and report two usability studies of Character Recorder, which is the primary interface authors would interact with. These studies of Character Recorder involved undergraduate biology students and professional taxonomists. We examined the effectiveness and efficiency of its features and the cognitive effort required of the users, and compared them with Microsoft Excel, which remains the most popular tool for editing taxon-by-character matrices. We hope our design of the Ontology and findings on the usefulness of the software features will provide useful insights for the interested communities to further develop Character Recorder and other ontology-enhanced data production tools.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-s1"><title>Materials: The Carex Ontology</title><p>The Carex Ontology is the primary ontology utilized in the prototype, alongside the Modifier Ontology [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The creation of the Carex Ontology involved the following steps:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Candidate phenotype terms were extracted from the <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> treatments in the Flora of North American V.23 (Cyperaceae) using the Explorer of Taxon Concepts (ETC) Text Capture tool [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ETC Ontology Builder was then used to produce a raw ontology based on the extracted characters and character states. Access to ETC tools is available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://etc.sbs.arizona.edu/etcsite/" ext-link-type="uri">http://etc.sbs.arizona.edu/etcsite/</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Terms irrelevant to <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> phenotypes were manually removed from the raw ontology by an undergraduate research assistant supervised by a <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> taxonomist. The assistant also adjusted subclass relations among the terms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The raw ontology was then imported to WebProtege (<ext-link xlink:href="https://webprotege.stanford.edu/" ext-link-type="uri">https://webprotege.stanford.edu/</ext-link>). At this time, the two top-level main classes were &#x0201c;anatomical entity,&#x0201d; the superclass for all anatomical structures, and &#x0201c;quality,&#x0201d; the superclass for all character and character state terms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In WebProtege, the raw ontology was further refined by adding appropriate annotation properties and object properties:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>We synonymized various expressions of the same concepts using obo:exact_synonyms Annotations such as obo:hasBroadSynonym, and carex:has_not_recommended_synonym were used to associate a term with other related words. For instance, carex:acute, denoting a shape, has a not recommended synonym of &#x0201c;acutish,&#x0201d; indicating the latter is imprecise and discouraged for use. Similarly, carex:bright, describing color brightness, has a broad synonym &#x0201c;light,&#x0201d; signifying carex:bright corresponds to only one meaning of &#x0201c;light.&#x0201d; Terms frequently used in the literature but considered suboptimal by Carex experts were marked as obsoleted. The carex:term_replaced_by annotations guide users to preferred terms For example, carex:awl_shaped has been deprecated in favor of carex:subulate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We added annotation properties, such as oai: elucidation, which link to graphic illustrations of specific characters or character states. We also introduced object properties, including carex:measured_from, carex:measured_to, carex: measured_include, carex: measured_exclude, and carex:measured_at, to detail the reference points used in numerical measurements of characters. For the measurement units and scopes, we added a unit class and a scope class. Furthermore, the carex:in_collection property was incorporated to link characters to their respective collections, such as the carex: carex_standard_character_set.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We incorporated a set of core characters, identified by <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> experts on the project, into the Ontology. These are essential for any description of a <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> taxon and recognized as the &#x0201c;Recommended Set of Characters&#x0201d; in Character Recorder and the carex: carex_standard_character_set in the Carex Ontology.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We introduced a carex: to review class within the Ontology to accommodate new term suggestions from Character Recorder&#x02019;s end-users. Upon expert review via the Conflict Resolver, these user-contributed terms are either integrated into the Ontology under the appropriate category (using rdfs:subclassOf) or deprecated in favor of a replacement term. Notifications about these updates and other ontological changes are available on the Character Recorder&#x02019;s Ontology Updates page. Moreover, in matrices, data cells containing deprecated terms are marked with small wrench icons to signal that users need to review and possibly accept the suggested replacement terms Importantly, to maintain the Ontology&#x02019;s and the matrices&#x02019; stability, the IDs of terms are kept persistent regardless of changes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lastly, for terms with equivalent concepts in other ontologies (such as the Plant Ontology and the Relation Ontology), we added cross-references to enhance interoperability.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list><p>The Carex Ontology used in the experiments contained 1880 classes, 44 object properties, 34 annotation properties, and a variety of axioms (2902 class axioms, 74 object property axioms, and 6768 annotation axioms). Top-level classes are shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>. Among the top-level classes, obo:anatomical_entity and carex: quality encompasses the majority of terms within the ontology, where quality terms are linked to entity terms through properties, such as carex:measured_from, carex:measured_to, carex: includes, carex: excludes, and carex:measured_at. Additionally, associations between entity terms are facilitated by the carex:maybe_part_of and carex:join_with properties.</p><fig position="float" id="F2" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Top-level classes in the Carex Ontology.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f2" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-s2"><title>Materials: Character Recorder</title><p>The design of Character Recorder was primarily based on domain scientists&#x02019; input and benefited from a few earlier studies: (i) The Create Character function in Character Recorder was evolved from the Measurement Recorder, which enables users to define new numerical characters for the Ontology for subsequent use in matrices [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. (ii) The user interface of Character Recorder for adding terms to the Ontology was developed based on findings from Reference [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. (iii) Moreover, applying data mining methods on 2283 colors extracted from high-quality <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> specimen images, color palettes for brown, yellow&#x02013;brown, yellow&#x02013;green, green, and red were created and employed in Character Recorder [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These palettes allow users to record colors directly, rather than selecting or creating color names to reduce the subjectivity associated with color naming.</p><p>The Character Recorder prototype integrated many features to guide users to select and use appropriate terms from the Carex Ontology in their character matrices. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;3&#x02013;7</xref> explain a few key features of the Character Recorder version used in the studies reported here. Improvements to these features have been implemented based on the findings from the studies and are described later.</p><fig position="float" id="F3" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3.</label><caption><p>The character setup page of Character Recorder, accessible after logging in.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f3" position="float"/></fig><p>As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, users can employ the &#x0201c;Recommended Set of Characters&#x0201d; or create new characters for a matrix. The &#x0201c;Recommended Set of Characters&#x0201d; constitutes a minimal set of core characters from the Carex Ontology. Each Carex treatment should include this set to ensure parallelism in descriptions. A prominent button prompts users to utilize the recommended set, but they also have the option to add specialized characters. This can be done by searching for existing characters known to the platform or by creating new ones. When adding a new numerical measurement character, users must define the reference points for the measurements. This requires selecting existing terms from the Ontology or contributing new terms Reference points that are recognized by the Ontology are marked with green checkmarks, indicating approval.</p><p>
<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, shows the matrix page. The matrix, containing user-selected characters, appears empty initially. The characters related to various organs are arranged across different tabs. The &#x0201c;Generate Description&#x0201d; button can be clicked to generate a textual description of the taxon based on the matrix&#x02019;s data. Following this, an &#x0201c;Export&#x0201d; button becomes accessible, enabling the user to export the matrix as a CSV file, the description as a DOC file, and RDF triples as a TRIG file. Refer to <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> for an overview of the features that support the formulation of character.</p><fig position="float" id="F4" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4.</label><caption><p>The matrix page of Character Recorder.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f4" position="float"/></fig><p>As <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows, the input template assists the user in formulating a character state, allowing for free-text pre- and post-constraints and the incorporation of certainty and degree modifiers from the Modifier Ontology. Top part of <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows that when the user clicks in an entry box associated with a character (e.g. growth form), the corresponding branch of the ontology opens for the user to select a term. The image icon or color icon next to a term can be evoked to open illustrations associated with the term or relevant color palettes. The user can also enter a value directly (&#x0201c;cespitose&#x0201d; in this case). The platform searches in the Carex Ontology for matches and permits the addition of new terms to the Ontology. In this example, with the user&#x02019;s approval, &#x0201c;cespitose&#x0201d; is replaced with its preferred term &#x0201c;caespitose.&#x0201d; Any new term contributed by users is immediately incorporated into the Carex Ontology and submitted to the Conflict Resolver for review.

The first study referred to as the Student Experiment, engaged undergraduate biology students to evaluate the overall usability of the features. The second study, known as the Expert Experiment, involved professionally trained botanists specializing in <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> taxonomy and/or the identification of <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> specimens. The focus of the Expert Experiment was on the effectiveness of the workflow design, ontology integration, character illustrations, and color palettes, as well as the dynamics of character reuse among experts. Given that MS Excel is the most widely used tool for editing character matrices, both studies compared Character Recorder with Excel in terms of effectiveness, efficiency (including cognitive demand), and user satisfaction in recording FAIR data. Both studies received Institutional Review Boards&#x02019; (IRB) approvals from relevant authorities (University of Arizona protocol # 2105767649; University of Manitoba protocol #: HE2021-0066; and University of Ottawa protocol# H-07-21-7202).</p><sec id="s2-s3-s1"><title>Student experiment</title><p>A total of 16 undergraduate students from the Biology Departments of the University of Manitoba (13) and the University of Ottawa (3) participated in the online usability study of Character Recorder from November 2021 to January 2022.

This was followed by a self-paced training session on Character Recorder (<xref rid="s6" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Appendix B</xref>) and a hands-on task session where participants recorded six characters provided to them for each of the two samples of a <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> taxon, using Character Recorder and Excel in different orders (<xref rid="s6" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Appendix C</xref>). A session concluded with a user experience questionnaire (<xref rid="s6" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Appendix D</xref>). There was no interaction among participants throughout the session.

This 3-day experiment took place in person at a fully equipped biology lab at the University of Ottawa in April 2022.</p><p>Experts were assigned unique participant IDs and followed an overall procedure similar to that of the student participants but less structured: Firstly, the self-guided training session in Student Experiment was replaced by a 10-min live demonstration of Character Recorder, followed by a 30-min Q&#x00026;A session. Secondly, the hands-on task session for experts was designed to be life-like and unstructured, extending over 2 days, as opposed to the students&#x02019; task of recording a few given characters in less than 1 h. Experts used desktop computers running Character Recorder to record relevant characters from mounted specimen sheets of <italic toggle="yes">Carex canescens</italic> L. and <italic toggle="yes">Carex rostrata</italic> Stokes. These species were chosen because of their contrasting phenotypes (e.g. unisexual versus bisexual inflorescence units, differences in perigynium and achene morphology, etc.) thus accentuating the range of variation found within the genus. Discussions among experts and with the experimenter in the hands-on session were allowed and encouraged. Although the experts&#x02019; activities were not video recorded, the character matrices they generated and their verbal feedback on the software were meticulously documented. Thirdly, the experts&#x02019; hands-on session was followed by a 1-day focused discussion session, addressing issues identified during the first 2 days and exploring potential solutions. Lastly, the user experience questionnaire experts independently and anonymously filled out contained a few additional questions on their overall assessment of the Character Recorder. For their active participation, each expert received a $50 Amazon gift card for every half-day of the experiment.</p><p>Note, unlike the Student Experiment, the experts exclusively used Character Recorder, foregoing Excel.

Participant responses were scored according to the respective scale, and the final score for each question is the average over all responses to the question. For instance, for a question employing a 3-point Likert scale, such as &#x0201c;[the component] did what I wanted it to do,&#x0201d; a response of &#x0201c;rarely&#x0201d; was scored as 1, &#x0201c;sometimes&#x0201d; as 2, and &#x0201c;always&#x0201d; as 3. The final score for the question was calculated as the sum of all scores divided by the total number of responses. This average score is interpretable on the original scale, for example, a mean of 2.8, which lies between &#x0201c;sometimes&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;always&#x0201d; but leans closer to &#x0201c;always,&#x0201d; can be interpreted as &#x0201c;almost always.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and analyses</title><p>All 16 student participants and 8 out of 9 expert participants completed the entire experiment sessions including both questionnaires.

Given a character and state pair, &#x0201c;length of stem or culm is 40 cm,&#x0201d; both &#x0201c;length of stem&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;length of culm&#x0201d; were accepted as correct characters in student Excel matrices, whereas in their Character Recorder matrices, only characters using good ontology terms were deemed correct.</p><p>Among the Excel matrices created, one did not adhere to the instructions (Participant S211), and two were incomplete (S127 and S213), missing most characters and states. There were 38 errors in total: 9 omitted characters, 27 incorrect character states (including 4 spelling errors of &#x0201c;conspicious&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;lanceloid&#x0201d;), and 2 incorrect character orders. For Character Recorder matrices, one was incomplete (S213), and 28 errors were found, including 19 spelling errors (&#x0201c;conspicious,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;lancoloid,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;gutter-shape&#x0201d;), 8 incorrect states due to preference for states given in the instruction sheet over recommended ontology terms, and 1 random state.

All experts used the recommended character set, and three of them adjusted by adding new characters or removing existing ones. In total, 43 new characters were created, and 8 of these were utilized by 2 experts. While creating new characters and recording character values, every expert contributed to the Carex Ontology:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Sixty-six (66) new terms were added to construct new characters: 22 were landmark terms for numerical measurements, for example, &#x0201c;junction between stem and rhizome,&#x0201d; and 44 referred to organismal structures to be described, such as &#x0201c;stem along a 2 cm segment below inflorescence,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;distal internode of the longest inflorescence,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;stem base.&#x0201d; New terms were all accompanied by clear definitions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Seventeen (17) new terms were added for character states. Some were good candidate terms such as &#x0201c;scabridulous,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;beneath,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;overlapping the proximal 2/3 of the perigynia&#x0201d; (to indicate the relative position to another organ). However, 7 terms could be composed using existing terms, for example, &#x0201c;antrorsely scabrous,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;papillose or smooth,&#x0201d; and there were also 2 color terms without definitions (&#x0201c;light yellow-green,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;medium green&#x0201d;).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nine (9) existing ontology terms were enhanced, by receiving a definition, a sample sentence, or being used in a different context. For instance, carex:smooth was initially a subclass of carex:surface_feature, but two experts used the term to describe &#x0201c;texture.&#x0201d; Consequently, the term was put under review for a potential new superclass, carex:texture (carex:toreview, see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>It is important to note that all the new terms added, except for the two-color terms, were accompanied by an informative definition. For example, &#x0201c;primarily pistillate inflorescence units&#x0201d; was defined as &#x0201c;Inflorescence units that are covered by pistillate flowers for more than half of their total length.&#x0201d; This practice would release the definition shortage problem many existing ontologies are facing.</p><p>A few issues were identified concerning the form of the terms For instance, some terms began with a preposition (e.g. &#x0201c;in terminal spike&#x0201d;), included conjunctions such as &#x0201c;and/or&#x0201d; within a single term (e.g. &#x0201c;papillose or smooth&#x0201d;), or used plural forms (e.g. &#x0201c;primarily pistillate inflorescence units&#x0201d;). All of these can be avoided through the careful design of error-preventing features in the user interface.</p><p>There were three instances where terms with the same meaning were added by different users; for example, &#x0201c;beneath&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;below.&#x0201d; This represents one of the seven types of issues that the Conflict Resolver is designed to handle. The seven types of issues include finding the correct category/superclass, approving definitions, approving new terms, identifying exact synonyms, determining equivalent terms, and resolving disputes over deprecations.</p><p>In summary, 92 terms were added or updated by experts during the recording of 1404 characters. The findings suggest that allowing real-time contributions to ontologies by users is an indispensable feature and that experts are capable of providing informative definitions for these terms. Terms contributed in this way would all have an informative definition. Contributions from different users to the same term are logged in one place as annotations, providing rich information that enables ontology managers to incorporate the terms effectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-s4"><title>Efficiency of Character Recorder: task completion time</title><p>To assess the efficiency of the Character Recorder in recording phenotype characters, we examined participant responses to questions related to the efficiency and task completion times of student participants.</p><p>

However, one expert voiced a concern during the hands-on session that this feature might impact an expert&#x02019;s independent assessment of a character.</p><p>One question, specifically tailored for students, inquired whether their participation in the study heightened their awareness of the variations in character expressions. With an average score of 6.06, the students&#x02019; responses confirmed that (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;14</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-s7"><title>Color palettes</title><p>We employed data mining techniques and created a set of color palettes from a color dataset. This color dataset was meticulously compiled by measuring the sRGB values of colors from high-quality images of <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> specimens with color calibration. The dataset contained 2883 colors of various organs and provided a sufficient number of observations to derive color palettes for brown, green, red, yellow&#x02013;brown, and yellow&#x02013;green. Details on the creation of the color palettes can be found in Reference [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Character Recorder (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref> a.2), experts were free to pick a color from these color palettes or enter textual color names for color-based characters.</p><p>In the experiment, experts documented a total of 78 color-based characters. Out of these, 21 were not represented in the provided color palettes, for example, &#x0201c;white,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;colorless,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;blue-green.&#x0201d; Of the remaining 57 colors that were included in the palettes, 9 were recorded as textual color names and 48 used the palette colors, amounting to 84% usage of the palettes. This high utilization rate suggests that the color palettes were generally suitable for the task. Although finding an exact color match to what experts observed can sometimes pose a challenge, the results underscore the benefit of recording colors to enhance the FAIRness and computability of character descriptions. As illustrated in <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;15</xref>: (i) Character Recorder captures both sRGB values and a textual name when a user selects a color from a palette. (ii) Recording colors as sRGB values allows for the computational measurement of differences between colors labeled the same, enhancing data usability and interoperability. (iii) In contrast, when colors are recorded as plain text, they lack reliability for comparison, diminishing their usability, reusability, and interoperability.</p><fig position="float" id="F16" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;15.</label><caption><p>Expert recorded colors for the color of sheath of <italic toggle="yes">C. canescens</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f15" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-s8"><title>Overall comparison and user recommendation</title><p>
<xref rid="F17" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;16</xref> summarizes participant responses regarding their preferred choice for recording FAIR data, alongside experts&#x02019; recommendations. The results indicate that both students and experts lean toward disagreeing with the notion that Excel would be their tool of choice, with average scores of 3.19 and 3.09, respectively (3 means &#x0201c;somewhat disagree&#x0201d;). Additionally, experts would recommend Character Recorder to their colleagues (average score&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.0). Furthermore, there is a strong consensus among experts (average score&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.75 out of 7) that Character Recorder is moving in the right direction and should be further developed and integrated into taxonomists&#x02019; workflows.</p><fig position="float" id="F17" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;16.</label><caption><p>Summary of participant final comparison between Character Recorder and Excel and their recommendations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f16" position="float"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4-s1"><title>Potential for Character Recorder or the like to replace Excel as the matrix editor</title><p>Despite the development of several character matrix editing software applications over the years, Excel remains the most popular, largely due to its versatility and lack of constraints on user input. Comparing Character Recorder with Excel allows us to determine whether Character Recorder, with its necessary ontological constraints for FAIR data, is a viable replacement. A significant focus in designing Character Recorder was on integrating ontology-supported features in a user-friendly manner to mitigate potential cognitive burdens. The findings indicate that participants perceived similar cognitive demands between Character Recorder and Excel while recognizing the superior quality of data recorded using Character Recorder. This is encouraging.</p><p>One key finding from the 2022 survey on the attitudes of phenotype data producers and consumers revealed that while respondents preferred author curation over third-party curation for published character descriptions, 50% of participants believed biologists lack of skills to curate their own characters using ontologies while only 22% disagreed [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The findings reported here provide evidence that it is possible to develop user-friendly editing platforms suitable for biologists across all experience levels to make their data FAIR. Experts contributed good terms and informative definitions to the Carex Ontology while filling out their matrices. A vast majority of participants reported that they quickly learned how to use Character Recorder. All ontology-supported features, and the character share and reuse features, were well-received by both undergraduate students and professional <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> systematists.</p></sec><sec id="s4-s2"><title>Improvements to Character Recorder</title><p>As a proof-of-concept prototype, Character Recorder has areas in need of improvement. Specifically, the creation of novel characters and the selection of recommended characters were identified by experts as requiring enhancements. The prototype lacks flexibility in supporting novel characters and it is also limited in its capability of intelligently recommending characters for various taxa. We actively engaged with experts to discuss potential improvements and implemented those after the Experiments. <xref rid="F17 F18" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;16 and 17</xref> provide a before-and-after comparison, showcasing the enhancements made to the &#x0201c;Form Character&#x0201d; window and the interface for recommended characters, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F18" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;17.</label><caption><p>A before (a)-vs-after (b) comparison on the Form Character window.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f17" position="float"/></fig><p>
<xref rid="F18" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;17</xref> (a) shows the Form Character window used in the experiments. Before values are entered (e.g. &#x0201c;pubescence&#x0201d; &#x0201c;of&#x0201d; &#x0201c;leaf&#x0201d;), the text boxes display brief instructions. <xref rid="F18" ref-type="fig">Figure 17</xref> (b) illustrates how the enhanced character window enables users to construct complex characters, incorporating an unlimited mixture of structural constraints (+S, associated with some organ), positional constraints (+P, indicating the location for measurements, e.g. at mid-height), and distance constraints (+D, relative to a reference organ). Shown here the &#x0201c;cross section shape of stem&#x0201d; is constrained with a Distance constraint &#x0201c;at 10% belowig flowering stem&#x0201d;. In future development iterations, rather than requiring users to manually complete fields, the system could employ a natural language parser to translate users&#x02019; natural language descriptions into structured representations.</p><p>
<xref rid="F19" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;18</xref> (a) shows the user interface used in the experiments. All taxa have the same set of core characters recommended for users to record. The Improved version shown in (b) incorporates a hand-crafted decision tree, which allows Character Recorder to recommend specific core characters based on the taxon in question. The selections users make at each step determine the subsequent questions and options displayed. For instance, if the taxon&#x02019;s inflorescence is unbranched, questions related to inflorescence units will not appear. Although not depicted in the figure, the &#x0201c;recommended characters&#x0201d; list dynamically adjusts according to the user&#x02019;s responses. This decision tree will likely be taxon-specific for different taxonomic groups.</p><fig position="float" id="F19" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;18.</label><caption><p>A before (a)-vs-after (b) view on the recommended characters.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baae097f18" position="float"/></fig><p>Other features experts discussed included color, surface feature, and internal textual terms and their groupings in the Carex Ontology. Experts reached a consensus of creating new classes carex:margin_shape, carex:apex_shape, carex:vestiture (as superclass for surface features and pubescence), and carex:internal_textual in the Ontology.</p><p>The feature for sharing and reusing character values was favored by all student participants, largely attributable to its potential to improve productivity. However, an analysis of matrices produced by students revealed that two misspelled character values (&#x0201c;conspicious&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;gutter-shape&#x0201d;) were introduced and then reused by many others, leading to a total of 18 instances of misspelled values. In contrast, during the Expert Experiment, we noted that experts reviewed values recorded by others and alerted one another about questionable entries. In examining the matrices produced by the experts, no cases of misspelled values were observed. The insight we discerned from these findings and observations is that the feature for sharing and reusing character values is not only beneficial for enhancing productivity and reducing variability but also serves as a means of peer quality control at the expert level. Nonetheless, the integration of a spelling checker would be necessary for novices to mitigate the risk of misspellings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-s3"><title>Next steps and code sharing</title><p>Being a proof-of-concept system, Character Recorder and other components of the platform are not fully developed nor is it evaluated at a larger scale. After confirming our work has shed lights on ontology design tips and helpful features, following the hands-on session, experts suggested that the next step in the development of this ontology-enhanced data production platform would be to invite more fauna and flora communities to further develop and evaluate it under different context and with more diverse use cases. Areas needing attention include, but are not limited to, the taxon-specific recommended character sets and associated decision tree (see <xref rid="F19" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;18</xref>), formulation and full ontologization of novel characters, comprehensive test of Conflict Resolver with all seven types and new types of ontological issues, and intellectual rights issues with character sharing.</p><p>In this article, we described the creation of the Carex Ontology in detail, which may be an accessible way for other taxon groups to create their first ontology. These domain-specific ontologies are expected to work under their reference ontologies. For plants, the reference ontology is the Plant Ontology. Carex Ontology and all the source code of the platform are available under CC0 and accessible via the Readme page of <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/biosemantics/character_recorder" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/biosemantics/character_recorder</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-s4"><title>Study design rationale and limitation</title><p>We conducted experiments with both undergraduate biology students and <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> systematists at varying career stages for several reasons: (i) To instill an early awareness of data quality issues among students. This objective was met, as students reported an increased awareness of data variation following the experiment. (ii) To gather insights from a wide range of potential users of a tool like Character Recorder, thereby informing future research and development. This goal was also achieved, as the findings reveal both a consensus between the groups and some notable differences. (iii) For the Expert Experiment, to assess the chance for experts to adopt Character Recorder or the like in their professional work we must provide a life-like setting for experts to experience Character Recorder in the hands-on session, risking potential biases that may be introduced through the peer interaction. To avoid introducing biases, the request for participants to provide their honest assessment was made both verbally during the session and in writing in the questionnaire. The facilitator encouraged peer discussions during the hands-on session and was open to all questions, comments, and critiques. The questionnaire was filled out by participants independently and anonymously in the end. Through those measures, we tried to make sure the responses to the questionnaire represent participants&#x02019; <italic toggle="yes">informed</italic> (through peer discussions) and <italic toggle="yes">true</italic> (through the pressure-free environment and anonymity) opinions. The (biology) Student Experiment, on the other hand, was well-structured and student participants completed their sessions without interacting with other participants. The findings of the two experiments are quite consistent, with differences well explained. However, we acknowledge the limitations posed by the small participant size in the Expert Experiment, which precluded statistical analysis of the findings. Nonetheless, the results are valuable and can inform the development of similar software applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this article, we described an author-driven FAIR data production platform and the evaluation of its key component, Character Recorder, a proof-of-concept prototype of an ontology-enhanced taxon-by-character matrix editing application.</p><p>The findings from the two evaluative experiments with biology students and <italic toggle="yes">Carex</italic> experts consistently confirm that ontology-supported FAIR data features are liked and usable by both groups of participants, adding evidence that authors are capable of producing computable data at the time of publication of their phenotypic data using ontologies. Character Recorder incurred a cognitive load comparable to that of Excel, yet it allowed participants to produce data that are more FAIR than Excel: all data points produced with Character Recorder were associated with ontological definitions; landmarks involved in all numerical measurements were explicitly defined; 84% of color values covered by the color palettes were associated with their sRGB values; and the number of unique words used in a matrix was dramatically reduced thanks to the guidance the Carex Ontology provided.</p><p>After using Character Recorder for 3 days, all expert participants agreed that the tool was on the right track and should be further developed and integrated into taxonomists&#x02019; workflows. Despite significant advances in Natural Language Processing through large generative language models like GPT, these technologies cannot outperform post-doctoral data curators in resolving ambiguous characters. It is essential to equip authors with practical tools to formalize the meanings of their characters. While making the Carex Ontology and all software source code CC0, we encourage further evaluation of the Character Recorder methodology under different contexts and with different use cases.</p><p>Based on the findings reported here, we propose that both existing and future tools to consider support these useful features. For the backend ontologies, include the specific semantic constructs we have included in the Carex Ontology that support: (i) system recommend characters to ensure parallel descriptions; (ii) recommended and not recommended character and character state terms to minimize variations and encourage terminology convergence; (iii) users add terms and definitions to facilitate efficient workflow and to encourage ontology adoption; and (iv) illustrations of character, character states for enhanced user experience. For user interface, consider support: (i) notifications about ontology updates to integrate ontologies seamlessly into user workflows; and (ii) share and reuse character and character states for peer-based quality control, variation reduction, and improved productivity; and (iii) domain-specific color palettes to support computable color feature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>baae097_Supp</label><media xlink:href="baae097_supp.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all student participants and Mr Quan Gan for helping conduct the Student Experiment.
