While the benefits of simulation in enhancing technical and non-technical competencies are well-documented, the transition of nursing students to the role of instructors within these simulations remains underexplored, particularly in the Spanish context. This study aims to investigate how assuming the instructor role in clinical simulations impacts the professional development of fourth-year nursing students. Methods: A qualitative study employing an interpretative phenomenological approach was conducted to deeply understand the experiences and perceptions of nursing students transitioning to instructors in clinical simulations. Nine fourth-year nursing students from the University of Vic&#x02014;Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC) were purposively selected to ensure diverse perspectives. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, a focus group, and non-participant observations, achieving data saturation. Thematic analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke&#x02019;s methodology, was utilized to identify and organize emergent themes related to professional development and pedagogical competencies. Results: The transition to the instructor role significantly enhanced both technical and non-technical competencies among the participants. Key findings include improved leadership, decision-making, and effective communication skills. Student-led debriefing sessions were identified as crucial for fostering deeper reflection and enhancing the ability to provide and receive constructive feedback. Conclusions: Assuming the instructor role in clinical simulations offers substantial pedagogical benefits, enriching the professional development of nursing students by strengthening essential competencies. These findings underscore the value of integrating instructor roles within nursing education programs in Spain, suggesting that such practices can lead to more competent and confident healthcare professionals.

Introduction</title><p>Nursing education varies considerably across the globe in terms of duration, structure, and pedagogical approaches, reflecting differences in cultural, economic, and healthcare policy frameworks. Nurses represent the largest group of healthcare professionals worldwide, comprising 59% of the global health workforce, and play a critical role in achieving universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [<xref rid="B1-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite their essential contributions, disparities in the quality and accessibility of nursing education exacerbate regional inequities in workforce distribution, hindering the provision of equitable and effective healthcare services [<xref rid="B1-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, nursing programs are renowned for their advanced frameworks that integrate theoretical instruction, clinical practice, and competencies in leadership and healthcare management. These robust structures have established the United States as a global leader in nursing education, emphasizing leadership, research, and clinical expertise as core competencies [<xref rid="B2-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similarly, Canadian nursing education prioritizes a competency-based approach designed to cultivate clinical proficiency and leadership capabilities in response to the evolving demands of healthcare systems [<xref rid="B3-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the increasing shortage of nursing faculty in high-income countries, including Canada, poses significant challenges to sustaining educational quality and necessitates targeted investments in academic infrastructure and workforce development [<xref rid="B1-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In Europe, nursing education aligns with the principles of the Bologna Process, which standardizes academic frameworks to ensure comparability and compatibility of qualifications across countries. In Spain, the integration of nursing education into the Espacio Europeo de Educaci&#x000f3;n Superior (EEES), enabled by Real Decreto 55/2005 [<xref rid="B5-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], facilitated the transition from hospital-based training models to university-level curricula, fostering alignment with European academic standards. The Bologna framework has also supported the integration of simulation-based learning into nursing curricula across Europe, as evidenced by its implementation in Austria [<xref rid="B6-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Austria&#x02019;s competency-based, outcome-oriented nursing education ensures alignment with healthcare system demands, equipping graduates with critical leadership and decision-making skills. Nonetheless, variations in program duration and structure persist across Europe, reflecting diverse national healthcare policies and demands [<xref rid="B7-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In Asia, countries such as Japan and South Korea demonstrate distinctive approaches to nursing education [<xref rid="B2-nursrep-14-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Japanese nursing programs combine clinical training with research-oriented curricula, fostering innovation in healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, South Korea integrates advanced technologies and interprofessional education into its four-year nursing programs, reflecting a commitment to collaborative practice and cutting-edge healthcare systems.</p><p>These global disparities underscore the need for harmonized strategies in nursing education to ensure the preparation of a highly skilled, adaptable nursing workforce. Within this context, clinical simulation has emerged as a transformative pedagogical approach that bridges gaps in theoretical knowledge and clinical practice, fostering the development of essential competencies in safe, controlled environments.</p><sec id="sec1dot1-nursrep-14-00267"><title>1.1.

Implications for Educational Practice</title><p>The findings of this study have significant implications for nursing education. Integrating opportunities for students to assume instructor roles in clinical simulations can enrich their professional development by fostering critical competencies essential for practice. Educational institutions should consider incorporating instructor roles for advanced students, allowing senior students to design and facilitate simulations. This approach not only enhances their learning experience but also cultivates leadership and pedagogical skills. Additionally, promoting preparation and active participation is crucial; implementing strategies that encourage prior preparation and student commitment&#x02014;such as specific assignments and formative assessments&#x02014;can lead to more effective learning outcomes. Furthermore, integrating simulation progressively throughout the curriculum is recommended. Introducing simulation activities from the early years and gradually increasing their complexity can significantly improve the acquisition of both clinical and non-technical competencies. Lastly, advancing effective debriefing practices is essential. Training both students and instructors in debriefing techniques can enhance the quality of reflections and resultant learning, ensuring that the simulations provide maximum educational benefit.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-nursrep-14-00267"><title>4.6. Limitations of the Study</title><p>This study has several limitations. The sample was limited to nine students from a single institution, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

Future research could incorporate larger and more diverse samples and employ mixed methodologies to validate and expand these findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-nursrep-14-00267"><title>4.7. Recommendations for Future Research</title><p>Future studies should explore the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The long-term impact of the instructor experience on graduates&#x02019; clinical performance and their integration into the workplace.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Effective strategies to improve student motivation and preparation in clinical simulations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The application of interprofessional simulations, involving students from different health disciplines to enhance collaboration and communication in multidisciplinary teams.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quantitative analysis of the impact of transitioning to the instructor role on indicators such as academic performance, competency acquisition, and student satisfaction.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nursrep-14-00267"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This qualitative study has demonstrated that transitioning nursing students to the instructor role within clinical simulations has a significant impact on their professional development. By assuming this role, students enrich their education by strengthening both technical and non-technical competencies, including skills in leadership, effective communication, and critical reflection.</p><p>The experience of acting as instructors allows students to deepen their understanding of clinical and educational processes, fostering greater self-confidence and preparedness to confront the challenges of real-world clinical practice. Moreover, student-led debriefing emerges as a pivotal component that facilitates the consolidation of learning and the development of essential competencies for professional practice.</p><p>These findings could have an impact on nursing education by informing curriculum development and teaching strategies. This practice can contribute to forming more competent and confident professionals, capable of responding effectively to the complex demands of the contemporary healthcare environment.</p><p>It is imperative that educational institutions consider these results in the design and enhancement of their curricula, promoting methodologies that foster active learning, student engagement, and the comprehensive development of competencies necessary for high-quality healthcare delivery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the nursing students who participated in this study.
