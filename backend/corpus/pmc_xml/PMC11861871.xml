The study was launched immediately after the start of the global COVID-19 vaccination campaign on 12 January 2021 and continued until 1 August 2023. Specific aspects of headaches and related variables were collected via an online questionnaire. The clinical headache characteristics of patients vaccinated with the Comirnaty (BioNTech), Jcovden (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson), Sputnik V (Gamelaya), Covilo (Sinopharm), Spikevax (Moderna), Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), and Convidecia (CanSino Biologics) vaccines were investigated. <bold>Results</bold>: Across all vaccines, the median and mean latency of headache onset after vaccine administration were 12 h and 23.3 h, respectively. The median and mean headache duration were 12 h and 23.3 h, respectively. When the nonreplicating viral vector vaccine Sputnik V was used, headaches occurred the fastest, with a latency of 17 h. The latencies for the Vaxzevria and Convidecia nonreplicating viral vector vaccines were 14.9 h and 19.1 h, respectively. The Covilo inactivated whole-virus vaccine had a latency of 20.5 h. The latencies of the mRNA-based Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines were 26.0 h and 22.02 h, respectively. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in the mean duration of postvaccinal headache for the vaccines tested. Compared with the Comirnaty, Covilo, and Vaxzevria vaccines, the Spikevax vaccine induced significantly greater headache intensities. Vaxzevria was associated with a significantly higher frequency of concomitant symptoms than the other vaccines. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: The phenotype of postvaccinal headache can vary significantly between vaccines. These results have clinical implications for differentiating between postvaccinal headache and other primary and secondary headaches. This knowledge is clinically relevant in differentiating life-threatening vaccination complications, such as thrombotic syndromes, which are also associated with headaches. Based on these results, new diagnostic criteria for postvaccinal headaches can be developed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>coronavirus disease 2019</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 virus</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>complications</kwd><kwd>headache</kwd><kwd>phenotype</kwd><kwd>postvaccinal headaches</kwd><kwd>head-to-head comparison</kwd><kwd>ICHD-3</kwd><kwd>Comirnaty (BioNTech)</kwd><kwd>Jcovden (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson)</kwd><kwd>Sputnik V (Gamelaya)</kwd><kwd>Covilo (Sinopharm)</kwd><kwd>Spikevax (Moderna)</kwd><kwd>Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) and Convidecia (CanSino Biologics)</kwd><kwd>spike protein</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>mRNA vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00113"><title>1.

The pathology of COVID-19 vaccines involves the immune system being exposed to one or more components of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus or being exposed to the virus as a whole [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], helping the immune system to subsequently build up protection against antigens [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. COVID-19 vaccines differ in terms of their composition and the mechanisms by which the antigen or antigens come into contact with the immune system [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In 2022, worldwide, 66 vaccines were in the clinical development phase and 176 vaccines were in the preclinical development phase [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Common vaccine-induced reactions include redness at the injection site, swelling, localized pain, headache, fever, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms. Vaccine-induced reactions are indications that the immune system is interacting with the vaccine, and these reactions are usually mild and temporary. However, reactions can also be very severe and persist for a long time or even permanently [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

In the authorization studies, only the number of headaches was recorded as a vaccine-induced reaction. However, detailed, clinical, qualitative phenotype reports of vaccine-induced headaches were not recorded. The characteristics of these headaches include the exact latency period between vaccine administration and the onset of headache, the duration, the character of the pain, the location of the pain, the accompanying symptoms, and possible pain-modulating factors.</p><p>The global vaccination campaign against COVID-19 enabled systematic investigations of these new forms of postvaccinal headache in very large national and international cohorts for the first time. Interim analyses of headache phenotypes after vaccination with the vector vaccine Vaxzevria<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, formerly the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca from AstraZeneca, and the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> from BioNTech/Pfizer have already been described [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the ongoing data analysis of postvaccinal headache phenotypes from 12 January 2021 until 1 August 2023 was extended.

Healthcare staff in hospitals, who were at very high risk of exposure to COVID-19, were also vaccinated as a top priority. As direct contact with vaccinated individuals was not possible due to anonymity, nursing home managers were contacted by email and asked to send information about the study to the residents and staff. A total of 12,000 nursing homes in Germany were contacted. Additionally, the departments responsible for organizing COVID-19 vaccination campaigns at university hospitals in Germany and the United Arab Emirates were contacted and asked to inform their staff about the study. The study was also publicized on the websites and social media platforms of the institutions. The present study analyzed the clinical characteristics of headaches among patients who were vaccinated with the Comirnaty (BioNTech), Jcovden (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson), Sputnik V (Gamelaya), Covilo (Sinopharm), Spikevax (Moderna), Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), or Convidecia (CanSino Biologics) vaccines and who completed the questionnaire from 12 January 2021 to 1 August 2023.</p><p>The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine at Kiel University approved this study (D403/21).

At the beginning of the questionnaire, the participants were informed that the data would be collected anonymously and that it would not be possible to withdraw from their participation in the study after submitting their answers. The participants could complete the questionnaire at any time after the onset of postvaccinal headache, and there was no time limit. As data collection began at the start of the vaccination campaign, the responses were generally related to the first vaccine dose.

This type of comparison is important because completely new vaccines with completely new modes of action (e.g., mRNA vaccines) have been widely used internationally. Postvaccinal headaches are not included in the current edition of the international headache classification ICHD-3 [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

The median duration of postvaccinal headaches was 12 h. This finding indicates that 50% of respondents experienced postvaccinal headaches within 12 h. Given that participants still reported the onset of headaches several days after vaccination, the analysis of the cumulative frequency provides a detailed understanding of the distribution of the latency between vaccine administration and the onset of headaches. After approximately 20 h, postvaccinal headaches occurred in approximately two-thirds of respondents. Approximately 90% of the participants experienced postvaccinal headaches within 48 h of vaccine administration. The close temporal relationship between vaccination and the occurrence of postvaccinal headaches is therefore an important differential diagnostic feature in determining whether a headache was induced by vaccination.</p><p>The time to the onset of postvaccinal headache differed significantly between vaccines. Headaches occurred most rapidly after vaccination with the Sputnik V and Vaxzevria vaccines (means of 17.0 and 17.9 h, respectively). Both the Sputnik V [<xref rid="B51-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B61-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B63-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and Vaxzevria [<xref rid="B56-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] vaccines are vector vaccines that carry the gene encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. These vaccines are technologically similar. By making the entire finished gene for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein available, it is hypothetically conceivable that the immune reaction will start more quickly; thus, postvaccinal headaches will occur earlier as a vaccine-induced reaction than with component vaccines. Hypothetically, an earlier onset can also be explained by the initial strength of the immune response, which can occur with different vaccines.</p><p>The mean duration of postvaccinal headaches across all vaccines was 24 h. The median duration was 8 h, meaning that 50% of respondents had a headache duration of 8 h.

When the Covilo vaccine was used, headaches were most frequently localized in the cranial region (29.4%). For the other vaccines, the headache was most frequently located in the right or left forehead area.</p><p>In terms of the aggregated data for all vaccines, 55.5% of the respondents stated that the pain did not radiate. In 24.9% of the patients, the headaches radiated to the neck and shoulders, and in 19.7% of the patients, they radiated to the forehead and temples. Radiation to the neck and shoulders was most common in 45.5% of those vaccinated with Convidecia.

Accompanying Symptoms</title><p>An analysis of the individual active vaccines revealed that dizziness was the most frequently reported concomitant symptom when Convidicea were used (28.6%). For other vaccines, however, tiredness and fatigue are documented as the most frequent accompanying symptoms. When Vaxzevria was administered, numerous concomitant symptoms occurred with a significantly greater frequency than with the other vaccines. This applies to fever (30.7%), joint pain (27.0%), chills (36.3%), concentration problems (21.4%), muscle pain (35.3%), dizziness (29.3%), and fatigue (37.9%). Compared with other vaccines, Vaxzevria had the most documented side effects in terms of quality and quantity.</p><p>There are clear differences in relation to the Vaxzevria vaccine with respect to concomitant symptoms. Compared with other vaccines, the most extensive side effects were documented for this vaccine, both qualitatively and quantitatively. For the Covilo and Convidecia vector vaccines, 18.5% and 21.4% of participants reported fatigue after vaccination, respectively. In contrast, fatigue was found in more than 45% of patients receiving other vaccines. Chills were reported most frequently by 36.3% of those vaccinated with Vaxzevria. Fever was also the most common symptom of vaccination with Vaxzevria (30.7%). Muscle pain, dizziness, and fatigue symptoms were also more common after vaccination with Vaxzevria than with the other vaccines used (35.3%, 29.3%, and 37.9%, respectively).</p><p>In pivotal clinical trials with Vaxzevria, the use of prophylactic paracetamol prior to vaccination was recommended in all trials (except in the COV005 trial; it was introduced as an amendment during the COV001 trial) [<xref rid="B57-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Vaccinees were advised to continue taking 1000 mg of paracetamol at 6 h intervals for 24 h to reduce the side effects caused by the vaccine. In the COV001 study, the effect of paracetamol on immunogenicity was investigated in participants via a standardized ELISA [<xref rid="B70-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. When the study participants who received paracetamol were compared with those who did not, no differences were found in the generation of antispike responses. However, it is possible that the headache phenotype and incidence of postvaccinal headache in these studies were attenuated by the prophylactic administration of paracetamol. No prophylactic administration of paracetamol took place in the open application as part of the vaccination campaign. In Germany, the prophylactic use of paracetamol was not recommended and was not included in the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) information sheets. It is also not included in the package leaflet. The headache phenotype recorded here can therefore provide a more realistic, unobscured picture for the first time.</p><p>Cases of cerebral venous thrombosis and other unusual thrombotic events have occurred following vaccination with the Vaxzevria vaccine [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B54-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B77-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This has led to widespread age restrictions in many countries worldwide, including the complete cessation of the use of the Vaxzevria vaccine. Headache is the leading symptom of cerebral venous thrombosis. For the differential diagnosis of headache due to this vaccine and headache due to cerebral venous thrombosis, it is of central clinical importance, as explained, to investigate whether and how the phenotypes and courses of these headaches can be differentiated. AstraZeneca&#x02019;s COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria was withdrawn from the market due to a significant drop in demand. The decision to withdraw the marketing authorization was requested by AstraZeneca itself for commercial reasons and came into effect on 8 May 2024.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot8-vaccines-13-00113"><title>4.8. Classification and Differential Diagnosis</title><p>The International Headache Classification does not yet provide operationalized criteria for the classification and diagnosis of postvaccinal headaches, whether in general or specifically for postvaccinal headaches after vaccination against COVID-19. On the basis of the data collected, the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD-3 [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] were proposed for headaches attributable to vaccination against COVID-19 [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <xref rid="vaccines-13-00113-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> summarizes the headache phenotype associated with vaccination against COVID-19 when the data for all the vaccines analyzed were aggregated.</p><p>Knowledge of these diagnostic criteria can be crucial, as postvaccinal headaches can also occur as secondary headaches in patients who have no other headache disorder. While headaches associated with a systemic viral infection typically have no specific headache characteristics in terms of temporal aspects, pain characteristics, localization, or accompanying symptoms [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the results of this study reveal a specific headache phenotype with characteristic accompanying symptoms.

Headaches with Other Vaccination Complications</title><p>Garcia-Azorin et al. [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] compared the temporal occurrence of headaches after COVID-19 vaccination in relation to cerebrovascular events. They analyzed all consecutive events recorded in the United States Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for events following COVID-19 vaccination in the period from 1 January to 24 June 2021. They analyzed the timing of the occurrence of postvaccinal headache in patients who experienced no adverse events or cerebrovascular events, including cerebral venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage. A total of 314,610 events occurred during 306,907,697 COVID-19 vaccinations. A total of 41,700 headache events and 178 cerebrovascular events were recorded. If only isolated headaches occurred, then the median time between the administration of the vaccine and the onset of the headache (1 day) was shorter than that for headaches associated with cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (4 days). In the case of ischemic stroke, the latency was 3 days; in the case of intracranial hemorrhage, it was 10 days. If headaches occurred within 1 day after COVID-19 vaccination, they were very rarely associated with cerebrovascular events (0.4%). The delayed onset of headache 3 days after the administration of the vaccine was a precise diagnostic biomarker for the occurrence of concomitant cerebrovascular complications. A latency of more than 3 days between the administration of the vaccine and the onset of headache was observed in 87.1% of respondents, which is specific to vaccine-associated cerebrovascular events. If headache occurred within 3 days after vaccination, then the occurrence of cerebral venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage could be excluded, with probabilities of 99.98%, 99.86%, and 99.95%, respectively (negative predictive value). Headaches occurred within one day in respondents who had no subsequent vascular complications (range 0&#x02013;1 day). These data clearly support the findings of our study. Patients who experienced cerebral venous thrombosis experienced headaches an average of 3 days after receiving the Comirnaty vaccine, 5 days after receiving the Moderna vaccine, and 10 days after receiving the with Jcovden vaccine (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Interestingly, as in our study, vaccination with Jcovden resulted in a longer latency between vaccine administration and the onset of headache, as well as a longer duration of postvaccinal headache. In patients who had suffered ischemic stroke, headaches occurred an average of 1 day after receiving Comirnaty, 2.5 days after receiving Spikevax, and 7 days after receiving Jcovden. If the patients experienced intracranial hemorrhage as a complication, then headache occurred an average of 2 days after receiving Comirnaty, 6 days after receiving Spikevax, and 11 days after receiving the Jcovden vaccine. The main finding of the study by Garcia-Azorin et al. [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was that a delayed onset of headache of more than 3 days indicated the onset of a serious cerebrovascular event, such as cerebral venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p><xref rid="vaccines-13-00113-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> shows a comparison between the medians of the latency period between vaccination against COVID-19 and the onset of headache.

Precise knowledge of the headache phenotype is essential in order for healthcare professionals to quickly identify the patients with life-threatening causes of new-onset headache who require emergency management.</p><p>On the other hand, these headaches must be differentiated from forms of headache that also cause a high level of suffering and require specialized treatment. The so-called &#x0201c;red flags&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;orange flags&#x0201d; for differentiating and recognizing threatening headaches must be identified [<xref rid="B84-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. These factors include the occurrence of new headaches that have never occurred before in this form (&#x0201c;headache like never before&#x0201d;), a lack of effectiveness in previously effective painkillers, an increasing worsening of headaches, a change in the phenotype of the headache, and the occurrence of previously unknown accompanying symptoms (fever, chills, neck stiffness, joint pain, neuropsychological disorders, etc.). Knowledge of the headache phenotype and its use in the differential diagnosis of different types of headaches is therefore of great clinical importance.</p><p>Recognizing delayed headache after COVID-19 vaccination requires the knowledge that the typical phenotype of headache involves the occurrence of headache within 1 day as part of the immune response. The present study documented onset within 1 day and described the complex phenotype of headache attributable to COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of delayed headache after vaccination against COVID-19 has now been included in the WHO guidelines for the clinical case management of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after COVID-19 vaccination [<xref rid="B81-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p><p>Jameie et al. [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of postvaccinal headaches in a cohort study in Iran. A total of 1,822 respondents completed a questionnaire on the characteristics of postvaccinal headaches. The prevalence rates of headache after the first, second, and third doses were 36.5%, 23.3%, and 21.7%, respectively. The authors stated that the headaches were mainly tension-type headaches (46.5%), followed by migraine-type headaches (3.61%). The headaches were mainly bilateral (69.7%), and the headache characteristics were mostly pressing (54.3%) and of medium intensity (51.0%). Headaches usually started within 10 h (4.0&#x02013;24 h) after vaccination and lasted for 24 h (4&#x02013;48 h). The authors cited a history of primary headache, post-COVID-19 headache or headache after a previous COVID-19 vaccination, fever, and vaccination with a vector vaccine as risk factors for postvaccinal headache. According to the authors&#x02019; data, primary headache and headache after COVID-19 vaccination should reduce the likelihood of prolonged headache after vaccination. Prolonged headaches after previous vaccinations, migraine-like headaches, and psychiatric disorders are thought to increase the risk of headaches after COVID-19 vaccination. This study did not adhere closely to the criteria of the International Headache Classification [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; therefore, the generalizability of the results is limited.

As part of a multinational European collaboration, a prospective cohort study was conducted to monitor adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines. The participants completed questionnaires initially after vaccination and then six further questionnaires on self-reported adverse events over at least six months after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, 10 follow-up questionnaires were made available for one year. More than 117,791 individuals completed the study. Fatigue and headache were the most frequently reported systemic side effects. Pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction. Headache was reported by 53.3% of Vaxzevria recipients, 11.9% of Pfizer recipients, 49.6% of Janssen recipients, and 29.8% of Moderna recipients.

A total of 25.9% reported headaches lasting more than three days. The headaches were mostly bilateral. The presence of primary headache was significantly associated with the occurrence of postvaccinal headache.

Emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalizations for new or worsening headache in the first 16 days after COVID-19 vaccination between January 2021 and January 2022 were recorded and compared with data from January 2019 to January 2020. Following the administration of a COVID-19 vaccination, the number of admissions to the emergency department due to headaches increased significantly. Approximately 14% of all patients who visited the emergency department due to headaches related to COVID-19 vaccination had to be hospitalized. No analyses of headache phenotypes were performed in the study by Ceccradi et al.</p><p>Atalar et al.

This study analyzed different phenotypes of persistent or worsening headaches associated with COVID-19 vaccination. The study was able to differentiate two clusters. Patients with a history of primary headache presented frontal pain localization, throbbing pain, and more severe headache with migraine-like accompanying symptoms. The second group consisted of patients with longer headache durations (over one month) and a stabbing/pressing pain quality.</p><p>Castaldo et al. [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] conducted a systematic literature review on headaches after COVID-19 vaccination.

The authors examined whether patients with pre-existing headaches were more likely to suffer from postvaccinal headaches. To this end, they conducted a study among nursing staff in a hospital. They categorized the sample into patients with migraines, patients with non-migraine-related headaches, and healthy controls. The frequency of postvaccinal headaches was significantly greater in the migraine group (69.2%) and in the group with non-migraine-related headaches (7.14%) than in the healthy control group (3.79%). The frequency of headaches was significantly greater after the second vaccination dose than after the first vaccination dose (4.56% versus 20.5%). The authors concluded that patients with a history of migraine or other headaches were more likely to experience postvaccinal headaches than healthy controls.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot10-vaccines-13-00113"><title>4.10. Limitations</title><p>This analysis has several limitations. Owing to the voluntary nature of participation in the study, it is possible that respondents with particularly severe headaches were more likely to participate. The resulting clinical headache phenotype could therefore describe particularly severe forms. We therefore tried to capture the headache phenotype as comprehensively as possible by recruiting a very large number of participants internationally. No definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding gender differences. As the population of vaccinated individuals is not known and participation in the study was voluntary, it is possible that a disproportionate number of women participated in the study. As headaches occur very frequently regardless of vaccination status, the data could be biased due to the occurrence of headaches unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the resulting headache phenotype is not congruent with either migraines or tension-type headaches. It is possible that the clinical symptoms of these two common primary headache forms were included in the responses and overlapped with the post-COVID-19 vaccination headache phenotype. Nevertheless, the described symptom complex of headache after COVID-19 vaccination is clearly distinct from the abovementioned primary headaches. The possible influence of analgesic treatment of headaches is not known. This study did not investigate the prevalence of postvaccinal headaches. Phase 3 clinical trials of various vaccine candidates provided detailed information on this topic by recording the frequency of possible side effects of the vaccination [<xref rid="B59-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B64-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B66-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B73-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B85-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].

Pathological Mechanisms</title><p>The pathological mechanisms behind postvaccinal headaches have not yet been elucidated. It remains unclear whether the spike protein, which is synthesized intracellularly with the help of the mRNA supplied by the vaccine, is responsible for the headaches or whether the headaches are due to the immune reaction triggered by this protein [<xref rid="B50-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B66-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B86-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="B87-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="B90-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The intracellular formation of the spike protein and the resulting immune response could be directly related to the development of the described headache phenotype, including the accompanying symptoms of tiredness, fatigue, muscle pain, dizziness, poor concentration, chills, and fever. The vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could cause short-term inflammatory and other pathological changes in the brain in the area of the craniocerebral axis [<xref rid="B92-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. As the process is time-limited, symptoms usually subside after 48 h but can also persist in some individual cases.</p><p>This process can activate inflammatory substances such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and cytokines [<xref rid="B86-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="B87-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines can be released during COVID-19 infection. According to our results, fever is a prominent concomitant symptom, especially among individuals who have received Vaxzevria. It can therefore be assumed that inflammatory mediators are also involved in the development of postvaccinal headaches. Pre-existing primary headaches such as migraines can lead to an increased duration and pain intensity in postvaccinal headaches. The existing sensitization with hyperexcitability of the trigeminovascular neurons in primary headaches may cause an increase in pain sensitivity, which is relevant to the intensification of postvaccinal headaches. Accordingly, a study by van der Arend et al. [<xref rid="B93-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] suggested that vaccination against COVID-19 may be associated with an increase in migraine duration in migraine patients. These results may indicate that the involvement of inflammatory mediators in the pathophysiology of migraine may influence the intrinsic threshold for approaching attacks.</p><p>A person&#x02019;s pre-existing conditions and immune system can be decisive in the course of COVID-19 disease and the possible development of postvaccinal headaches. Genetic make-up can also directly influence how much someone is at risk and how severe the disease is. This includes factors such as the cytokine and interleukin genes responsible for proinflammatory and immunomodulatory responses, as well as the genes thought to be responsible for the progression and complications of COVID-19 [<xref rid="B94-vaccines-13-00113" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00113"><title>5.
