However, the optimal strategy to combine EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with radiotherapy for maximum efficacy and minimal toxicity is still uncertain. Notably, EVs, which serve as communication mediators among tumor cells, play a crucial role in the anti-tumor immune response. Methods To exploit the role of EVs in the delivery of tumor antigens, we formulated a therapeutic strategy that involves the use of radiation-induced tumor-derived EVs (TEXs) loaded onto dendritic cells (DCs) as a kind of vaccine in conjunction with EGFR TKIs and assessed the efficacy and safety of this approach in the treatment of EGFRm NSCLC. Results In our study, we characterized the release of immunogens as influenced by various modes of cell death, examining the impact of different levels of cell death under diverse irradiation modalities. Our results demonstrated that a radiation mode of 6Gy*3f exhibited the most promising potential to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. This radiotherapy fraction, combined with TKIs, showed promising results in a tumor-bearing mouse model with an EGFR mutation, although there is a risk of radiation-associated pneumonitis. Furthermore, we found that 6Gy*3f-TEXs in vitro activate DCs and promote T cell proliferation as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated tumor cell destruction. The administration of EGFR-TKIs combined DCs loaded with 6Gy*3f-TEXs exhibited the potential to inhibit tumor growth and mitigate the risk of pneumonitis. Together, the research shows that TEXs from high-dose fractionation radiation can mature DCs and boost the killing of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Combining these DC vaccines with Osimertinib offers a promising and safe treatment for EGFRm NSCLC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>EVs</kwd><kwd>DC</kwd><kwd>radiation</kwd><kwd>NSCLC</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>82103777</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>2022T150786</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was approved by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82103777) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2022T150786).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-12-01412"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer continues to be the predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprising approximately 85% of all cases [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among the subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma is the most common, frequently exhibiting distinct molecular alterations that promote tumor growth and progression [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A significant advancement in the targeted treatment of lung adenocarcinoma has been identifying and developing epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EGFR-TKIs have markedly transformed the therapeutic paradigm for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC (EGFRm NSCLC) due to their high specificity and relatively favorable toxicity profile. Notably, Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, effective against both EGFR-sensitive mutations and T790M resistance mutations, has made substantial progress in the treatment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, especially as a first-line therapy and in the management of brain metastases [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite the advantages of EGFR-TKIs, their efficacy in treating EGFRm-NSCLC remains constrained. Persistent oligo-residual lesions in advanced stages may lead to acquired drug resistance and an increased risk of distant metastasis [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Radiotherapy (RT) is a crucial component in the management of lung adenocarcinoma, particularly in achieving local control and in conjunction with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. It has long been recognized for its efficacy through mechanisms that induce DNA damage and subsequent cell death. More studies, however, have increasingly highlighted the role of RT in modulating both local and systemic immune responses to exert anti-tumor immune effects, including the promotion of antigen recognition of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells to attack both irradiated and non-irradiated tumors [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].Furthermore, the immunostimulatory impact of radiation is influenced by variable factors such as radiation doses and fractionation regimens [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, there has been a growing interest in combining EGFR-TKIs with RT to enhance the anti-tumor activity and overcome resistance. Clinically, combining RT with EGFR TKIs may be more beneficial, as shown by the REFRACT study, which reported improved progression-free and overall survival, particularly in Asian patients with locally advanced EGFRm-NSCLC [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, pulmonary toxicity from combining RT and TKIs is concerning. The RECEL study reported that 16.7% of patients experienced severe radiation pneumonitis (RP) with RT and erlotinib. Another study found that 63.6% had moderate to severe RP with Osimertinib and thoracic radiotherapy [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More research on radiation patterns is needed to improve combination therapy and minimize side effects.</p><p>EVs are small vesicles released by cells that carry an extensive array of bioactive molecules, presenting promising applications in the therapeutic domain of lung cancer, including their use as targets for therapy, drug delivery vehicles, and EV-based immunotherapy. Tumor-derived EVs (TEXs) contain tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and can transfer these to DCs, triggering antigen-specific T cell activation [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Radiation alters the quantity and makeup of TEXs, which interact with immune cells and modify the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing tumor growth and treatment response [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Research has shown that irradiated NSCLC-derived EVs influence NK and B cell distribution in vitro, with effects varying by radiation dose and rate [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This study explored the optimal irradiation pattern to stimulate immune responses and examined the immune activation effects of EV-loaded DCs. The efficacy and superior lung safety of DCs loaded with radiation-induced TEXs (RA-TEXs) were validated in vivo in conjunction with TKIs in animals with an EGFRm background. The results offer a novel strategy for treating patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.

CRL-1642) cell lines were purchased from Procell Life Science &#x00026; Technology (Wuhan, China), cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), and authenticated via a short tandem repeat analysis. According to the literature [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], these cells were transfected with EGFR-Exon 19 Deletion (EGFR-19Del) overexpressing lentivirus from GeneChem (Shanghai, China) to express human EGFR-19Del protein. LLC cells were grown in six-well plates and infected with lentiviral particles. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2 &#x000b5;g/mL puromycin (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Two weeks later, puromycin-resistant cells were collected and EGFR-19Del protein overexpression was confirmed via Western blot.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.2. Apoptosis Detection</title><p>Cells were subjected to digestion using EDTA-free trypsin and subsequently gathered through centrifugation at 300&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 5 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. Following a double wash with PBS, the cells were resuspended within a 100 &#x000b5;L buffer. Additionally, 5 &#x000b5;L FITC-Annexin V and 5 &#x000b5;L PI (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan) were added and the cells were incubated for 5 min. After staining, 400 &#x000b5;L of buffer was gently mixed in. Apoptosis was quickly assessed using flow cytometry, identifying early apoptotic cells as Annexin V positive and late apoptotic or necrotic cells as Annexin V/PI double-positive.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.3. ATP Release</title><p>The ATP release was quantified using an ATP detection kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Cellular samples underwent treatment with a lysis buffer and subsequent centrifugation to isolate the supernatant. The resultant supernatant was combined with an ATP working solution within the detection wells and homogenized. The value of RLU was measured using a luminometer. The ATP concentration was determined by converting the RLU values through a standard curve derived from the standard samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.4. Bone Marrow-Derived Dendritic Cell (BMDC) Induction and Culture</title><p>Femoral bones from euthanized mice were used to extract bone marrow cells, which were then filtered and lysed to remove Red Blood Cells. The cells were cultured in RPMI Medium 1640 with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin, 20 ng/mL IL-4, and 20 ng/mL GM-CSF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). After 72 h, non-adherent cells were discarded and adherent cells were cultured, with half the medium being replaced every two days. On the ninth day, immature DCs (iDCs) were induced and differentiated. Semi-adherent and suspension cells were collected, cleaned, and prepped for further experiments. The cells were incubated with FITC-CD11c (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min in the dark for staining. The purity of these cells was then analyzed using flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.5. EV Isolation and Characterization</title><p>Cells demonstrating successful expression of EGFR-19Del protein were required to be substituted with a serum-free medium (Yeasen, Shanghai, China) to extract EVs after reaching the appropriate density. These cells were irradiated using an RS2000 Irradiator with parameters of 160 Kv and 25 mA and a dose rate of 1.175 Gy/min. EVs were extracted from LLC-EGFR19Del cell culture supernatants. Initially, cells and large particles were removed by centrifuging at 300&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 10 min. Crude EVs precipitates were then obtained by centrifuging at 2000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 30 min. Further centrifugation at 10,000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 60 min was performed to eliminate shed microvesicles. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 100,000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 120 min at 4 &#x000b0;C in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman Optima XPN-100, Beckman Coulter, FL, USA). The precipitate was resuspended with PBS and the ultracentrifugation was repeated once. After resuspension with sterile PBS, the precipitate was stored in portions at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. The EVs were analyzed for particle size using a Flow NanoAnalyzer (NanoFCM Inc., Xiamen, China) and for morphology using transmission electron microscopy. Post-protein cleavage, the supernatant was centrifuged and the extracted proteins were stored and used for detection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.6. Analysis of DCs Activation Induced by EVs</title><p>Mouse iDCs were procured as delineated in previous studies. Subsequently, these cells were cultured for 24 h by incorporating irradiated or non-irradiated tumor-derived EVs (20 &#x000b5;g/mL) or Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) at a concentration of 1 ng/mL (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Following incubation, the cells were harvested and prepared for flow staining to identify the DC phenotype. Concurrently, the supernatants were also collected to quantify the cytokines secreted by the DCs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.7. T Cell Proliferation and Tumor-Specific CTL Response In Vitro</title><p>Mice spleens were processed to isolate lymphocytes (Solarbio, Beijing, China). T lymphocyte concentration was determined via flow cytometry. These T cells were activated with CD3, CD28, and IL-2 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and stained with 5 &#x000b5;M Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) for 10 min at 37 &#x000b0;C, then washed with a 10% FBS medium. Subsequently, these CFSE-labeled T cells were co-incubated with DCs treated with EVs from various treatments. After 3 days, T cell-secreted cytokines were measured using ELISA and the expression of CFSE of T cells was also detected.</p><p>T cells activated by DCs functioned as effector cells/E, interacting with the unlabeled LLC-EGFR19Del as target cells/T, and these cells were co-incubated at the E/T ratios (5:1, 10:1, and 20:1) for 24 h. The CTLs&#x02019; killing activity was evaluated by measuring Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and Annexin V-positive expression in flow cytometry. The LDH release kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used to determine the 450 nm absorbance value and cytotoxicity (%) = (absorbance of treated sample &#x02212; absorbance of control sample)/(absorbance of maximum enzyme activity in sample &#x02212; absorbance of control sample) &#x000d7; 100%. Annexin V staining was used to analyze the percentage of apoptotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot8-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.8. Animal Model and Group Treatment</title><p>Six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> LLC-EGFR19Del and divided into groups randomly, each comprising five individuals when tumors reached an average size of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>. The treatment regimens administered were as follows: (1) Osimertinib, delivered via oral gavage, suspended in 0.5% CMC-Na at a dosage of 50 mg/kg per day for two weeks. (2) A daily dose of 6 Gy radiation targeted at the tumor for three consecutive days post-grouping utilizing the same radiation apparatus as previously described.

(4) The combined treatment with Osimertinib and RT/DCs. Tumor dimensions were measured bi-dimensionally every three days using calipers, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula of volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) = (width)<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; (length) &#x000d7; 1/2 to monitor tumor growth. Additionally, animal weights were recorded every three days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot9-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.9. Animals Sampling</title><p>After completion of treatment, the ocular tissues were removed to collect peripheral blood under anesthesia. The serum was collected by resting for 30 min and centrifuged at 2000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 20 min. The blood sample for flow staining was lysed to remove erythrocytes, followed by washing and antibody staining. Organs like the heart, liver, spleen, and lungs were removed and preserved in paraformaldehyde; then, HE was stained for safety evaluation. The spleens were extracted from the mice, macerated on a 200-mesh sieve, gently crushed, and rinsed with buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 300&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 5 min, and cells were washed with PBS after lysing erythrocyte. For cancer-tissue processing, about 300 mg of tissue was minced and mixed with a digestive solution, namely Collagenase Type IV and DNase I (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), then incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 35 min with shaking. The mixture was rinsed with PBS and filtered through a 70 &#x003bc;m cell strainer (Biosharp, Hefei, China) with 1%&#x02013;2% fetal bovine serum. The filtrate was subsequently centrifuged and resuspended in preparation for staining.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot10-vaccines-12-01412"><title>2.10. Flow Cytometry Detection</title><p>After adjusting the cell concentration, the Fc segment of the cell suspensions was blocked. T cells were stained with PE-CD45/BV421-CD45, APC-CY7-CD3, PE-CY5-CD4, PE-CY7-CD8, BV510-CD25, BV421-Foxp3 markers. DCs were marked with FITC-CD11c, PE-CY7-CD40, APC-CD80, BV421-CD86, and PERCP-MHC-II. Macrophages were labeled with PE-CY7-CD11b, FITC-F480, and APC-CD206. All of the antibodies were obtained from Biolegend, CA, USA. Surface markers were stained under light-protected conditions for 30 min, followed by a washing step and subsequent detection.

Western blot assays also confirmed the successful construction of LLC-EGFR19Del (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01412-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A,B).

Thus, we first used apoptosis and autophagy to assess the tumor immune response to different irradiation patterns, examining four radiation doses&#x02019; effects on tumor cell death. Results showed higher doses increased apoptosis and autophagy. All irradiated groups had significant apoptosis compared to the unirradiated group, with the 6Gy*3f dose being the most effective (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01412-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Radiation at 3Gy*3f and 18Gy enhanced autophagy compared to the unirradiated group, and 6Gy*3f had a statistically significant change.

For the primary assessment of ICD, the ELISA for HMGB1 in the supernatant and measurement of ATP release revealed that the two groups with the highest radiation dose exhibited an active process, which increased the secretion of HMGB1 and ATP in the supernatant. Compared with other groups, 6Gy*3f resulted in a marked increase in the release of ATP and HMGB1.

The lung tissues in both the control and TKI groups showed normal structures with intact alveolar intervals and well-expanded lumens.

The staining of other organs revealed no clear pathological abnormalities (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-12-01412" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>).

The treatment groups, especially those receiving RT, exhibited a marked increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration within the TME relative to the control group. However, radiation did not notably impede the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). This might be due to the hypoxic environment and increased release of factors like TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-1&#x003b2;, which promote Tregs expansion post-radiation therapy. The TKI group improved the activity of tumor-infiltrating T cells.

Our work confirmed these two points suggested by the literature. The mechanisms explaining the link between Osimertinib and RP include its role as an EGFR inhibitor, which hinders alveolar epithelial cell growth and the repair of radiation damage.

We confirmed the immunomodulatory effects of 6Gy*3f-TEXs and 6Gy*3f-TEXs-stimulated DCs combined with TKIs showed great tumor growth inhibition and better pneumonia control than RT, enhancing anti-tumor immunity in vivo and suggesting improved integration of RT with TKIs for future treatments. Our research acknowledges certain limitations. The preliminary exploration has affirmed the immunogenicity of radiation patterns and the EVs they stimulate through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Still, it does not include cases where tumors disappear entirely, possibly due to the persistence of cancer stem cells or immunosuppressive factors. Further sequencing and analysis of the EV cargo which influences DC function under radiation conditions could elucidate underlying mechanisms more comprehensively. In addition, improved delivery methods and engineered EVs may enhance the effectiveness of DC therapy, offering significant optimization opportunities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
