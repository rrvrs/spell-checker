In view of the fact that these data had already appeared in another publication prior to its submission to <italic>Oncology Reports</italic>, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. The authors were asked for an explanation to account for these concerns, but the Editorial Office did not receive a reply. The Editor apologizes to the readership for any inconvenience caused.</p></body></article>
