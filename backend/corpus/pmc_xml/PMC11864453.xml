EGFR inhibitors such as the monoclonal antibody tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erlotinib, decrease the metastatic potential of EGFR-positive tumors, leading to improved patient outcomes. However, this class of medications is associated with well-documented dermatological adverse events, most pertinently, rash [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Proactive management of these cutaneous side effects should be considered given that some studies show over 70% of patients have their EGFR inhibitor treatments paused or stopped altogether secondary to drug reactions [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>EGFR is expressed ubiquitously in sebaceous glands, epidermis, and hair follicular epithelium where it protects against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, promotes wound healing and normal skin health, and prevents inflammation. Although not completely understood, it is believed that inhibiting EGFR causes occlusion and subsequent rupture of affected follicles leading to the characteristic rash associated with EGFR inhibitors. Furthermore, the imbalance of EGFR inhibition to stimulation leads to an upregulation of genes that promote apoptosis, inflammation, and cell detachment, thereby causing follicles to rupture more readily [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Subsequent alteration in permeability of the skin barrier allows for bacterial overgrowth further contributing to the characteristic skin rash.</p><p>Before administering the drug, patients should be counseled to utilize sun-protective measures to prevent the progression of the rash and irritation of the already sensitive skin. However, despite these efforts, the rash may worsen to necessitate treatment with topical clindamycin, oral doxycycline, and topical steroids. Should that fail, a decrease in dosage and possible cessation of the EGFR inhibitor may be unfortunate, albeit necessary, considerations given that the medication is likely to provide immense benefit in the patient&#x02019;s oncologic care [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 67-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of EGFR-positive NSCLC presented to the outpatient clinic with an erythematous papulopustular rash with underlying erythema on the bilateral lower extremities (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The patient endorsed stinging and pruritus and resultant decreased quality of life. The patient first noticed the rash two weeks after starting erlotinib, suggestive of an adverse drug rash within a well-documented timeline [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The patient then failed the mainstay of treatment with topical steroids, topical clindamycin, and oral doxycycline. The next step in the escalation of care would have been to lower the dose of or discontinue erlotinib. However, given the oncologic benefit the patient stood to face should he continue erlotinib, shared decision-making was employed to look for other options to salvage his treatment plan.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Red to brown papulopustular rash distributed bilaterally on the posterior aspect of the lower extremities. Distribution of the rash was limited to the posterior aspect of the lower extremeties.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078078-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and dilute stem cells were initiated to combat the bacterial overgrowth thought to promote the EGFR inhibitor-induced rash while also sparing the patient&#x02019;s immune system. The patient had 70% improvement within the first 24 hours of therapy, had complete resolution within 96 hours, and has since been able to receive erlotinib treatment without recurrence of any cutaneous findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>EGFR inhibitors have been used to treat a variety of solid-organ malignancies, including NSCLC, gastrointestinal malignancies, and head and neck cancers [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Erlotinib is a medication within this drug class that acts on the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. Cutaneous side effects are common occurrences within this drug class with up to a 90% incidence rate that ranges widely in presentation and severity [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Presentations can include a papulopustular rash, as seen in this case, mucositis, nail changes, xerosis, and fissuring of the skin [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, UV exposure and lighter skin phenotypes may predispose patients to a dose-dependent adverse response to EGFR inhibitors.</p><p>EGFR is expressed ubiquitously in keratinocytes of hair follicles, nails, sweat glands, and the epidermis. In addition to plugging and later rupture of affected follicles, there is a disruption of normal keratinocyte function causing leukocytes and neutrophils to incite an inflammatory response. The scalp and face have a higher density of sebaceous glands which makes them more susceptible to the development of the rash. However, areas with a less dense representation of sebaceous glands, such as the legs, can also be affected [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline or minocycline have been given to patients with relative success [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with refractory cases leading to early cessation of chemotherapy. To our knowledge, we report the first documented case of refractory EGFR inhibitor-induced rash successfully treated with IVIG and stem cells. The patient experienced no adverse effects from said therapy and had resolution of the papulopustular rash without recurrence, allowing him to continue erlotinib treatment.</p><p>Further research in the form of randomized clinical trials can be done to elucidate the efficacy of IVIG and stem cell therapy in EGFR inhibitor-induced cutaneous reactions. The pathophysiology of how this therapy contributes to its resolution can be investigated to test the hypothesis of immunological sparing and inform on future treatments for chemotherapy-induced drug rashes. While the exact pathophysiology is unknown, it is theorized that IVIG promotes the immune system to combat the overgrowth of bacteria, while the influx of multipotent stem cells contributes to wound healing. IVIG in conjunction with systemic corticosteroids has successfully treated other drug reactions including drug rash eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). In the case of DRESS, IVIG is believed to cause an immunomodulatory effect that allows the patient&#x02019;s immune system to clear the rash [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We theorize that a similar benefit could be applied to the treatment of resistant EGFR inhibitor-related drug reactions.</p><p>Oncologists often provide stem cell transplants for patients to replenish healthy cells destroyed by chemotherapy. The use of stem cells for immune reconstitution is continuously being studied [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further studies for their use in conjunction with IVIG can provide an immense benefit for patients with resistant chemotherapy-related drug rashes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present a case of cutaneous toxicity in the form of a papulopustular rash secondary to erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor used to treat NSCLC. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of IVIG and stem cells. This approach is believed to stimulate the immune system to decrease bacterial colonization and inflammatory cytokines while providing an influx of healthy cells to promote wound healing. With the expanding use of EGFR inhibitors, drug rashes may be a common occurrence in oncology. Proper prevention with sun-protective measures, topical steroids, and oral antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for these toxicities. However, in patients who are refractory to these treatments, the use of IVIG and stem cells can be explored to allow patients to continue their chemotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Iya A.
