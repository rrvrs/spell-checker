In addition, the unfavorable impacts of immune imprinting, stemming from continuous exposure to antigens from circulated viruses, have been observed to incline immune response against earlier lineages, thereby declining the neutralization to newly emerged Omicron subvariants. In response to this, the advancement of next-generation vaccines against COVID-19 targeting components from new subvariants such as XBB-lineage is imperative. In the current study, a self-assembled trimeric recombinant protein (RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR) was generated by concatenating the sequences of the receptor binding domain (RBD) derived from XBB.1.5 with heptad-repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 sequences from the spike S2 subunit. Adjuvanted-RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses, characterized by elevated neutralization against JN.1-inculuded subvariants and a substantial population of antigen-specific T memory cells. Protective immunity conferred by RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine was preserved post-immunization, as evidenced by germinal center B (GC B) and T follicular helper (Tfh) responses, sustained neutralization potency, and an increase in memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). The RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine showed a favorable boosting effect when administered heterologously after three doses of inactivated virus (IV) and mRNA vaccines. Significantly, it provided protection against live Omicron EG.5.1 viruses in vivo. The monovalent RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine showed favorable safety and immunogenicity, boosting neutralizing antibodies against JN.1- and XBB-lineage subvariants in individuals with prior COVID-19 vaccinations. These findings highlight its clinical potential in safeguarding against circulating Omicron subvariants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; West China Hospital, Sichuan University 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Since first identified in late 2021, the Omicron BA.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 has marked a profound shift in the trajectory of viral evolution. Rapidly becoming the dominant strain, Omicron spread globally, giving rise to a multitude of descendant subvariants, which fueled widespread infections. By early 2023, the springing of the XBB lineages, marked by enhanced immune evasion, further propelled the evolution of various subvariants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Notable among these are XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16, which have rapidly disseminated across regions. In the wave of XBB.1.5, two of its descendant subvariants, EG.5 and EG.5.1, have experienced remarkable global expansion. Other XBB-derived lineages, including HK.3, FL.1.5.1, and HV.1have also surfaced,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> engaging in a competitive dance for dominance in different regions. Alongside the XBB lineages, a new subvariant, namely BA.2.86, was detected for the first time in August 2023.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Distinguished by significant mutation sites in the spike protein compared to both earlier BA.2 and later XBB.1.5, BA.2.86 raised serious concerns regarding its potential for immune escape. More recently, a descendant of BA.2.86, named JN.1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> carrying L455S mutationsite in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), has emerged as the dominant circulating variant globally. Its more recent descendants, KP.3.1.1 and XEC are the latest leading variants, continuing the rapid global spread.</p><p id="Par3">Though the World Health Organization (WHO) declared to end the emergency phase of COVID-19 pandemic, the persistent threat of virus reinfections underscores the critical importance of widespread vaccination in mitigating the risks associated with symptomatic infection, severe disease, and even mortality. Nevertheless, the complex hybrid immune background in individuals, shaped by diverse factors such as vaccination history, infection experiences, the presence of a variety of infectious variants, and the temporal gaps between vaccination and infection, brings ever-increasing challenges to the development of next-generation boosters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> On one hand, the newly emerged subvariants have demonstrated pronounced abilities for immune evasion, substantially impairing neutralization in individuals who have received booster or suffered breakthrough infections with pre-XBB-lineage subvariants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> On the other hand, the phenomenon of immune imprinting must be considered during vaccine development, such repeated prior antigen exposure can hinder the magnitude of neutralizing antibody response to new Omicron subvariants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Experimental studies in animal models have demonstrated vaccination-induced imprinting immunity, highlighting its relevance in the development of human vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> In addition, studies indicate that repeated vaccinations with mRNA vaccines or inactivated vaccines containing the Spike antigen from earlier variants tend to induce immune responses against those earlier lineage variants while decreasing immune responses toward more recent circulating Omicron subvariants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Similarly, BA.4-BA.5 bivalent vaccines only augment the immune response toward Omicron subvariants in a limited extent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> These findings underscore the pressing need to reassess the composition of current vaccines and to expedite the advancement of COVID-19 vaccines specifically targeting the evolving XBB lineages.</p><p id="Par4">In June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the use of monovalent XBB descendant as primary antigen of COVID-19 vaccines, leading to the approval of monovalent XBB.1.5 based mRNA vaccines by developers including Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> which have shown robust neutralization against the subvariants from XBB- and JN.1-lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Our research has previously demonstrated that vaccination with an XBB.1.5 variant derived antigen provides cross-neutralization against various Omicron variants when compared to those from other Omicron strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Despite the availability of these XBB-derived mRNA vaccines, some previous studies suggested that recombinant subunit protein vaccines might offer significant advantages as heterologous boosters following immunizations with inactivated vaccine (IV) or mRNA vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Responding to this potential, both our team and Novavax<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> have developed adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccines utilizing an updated XBB.1.5 antigen.

We harnessed the self-assembly characteristics of spike heptad-repeat sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> to generate an XBB.1.5 RBD-derived recombinant trimeric protein (RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR) on an insect cell (Sf9) protein expression platform. We incorporated an MF59-like oil-in-water adjuvant to formulate the XBB.1.5 monovalent protein vaccine. Intramuscular immunization with the adjuvanted RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR recombinant vaccine provoked robust and enduring humoral and cellular immune responses against JN.1 and XBB-lineage variants. Heterologous vaccination with the protein-based RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine, following three doses of inactive virus or mRNA vaccines, improved neutralizing activities in animal models. The monovalent RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine bestowed efficient protective immunity against the challenge of live Omicron EG.5.1 viruses in mice. Notably, the monovalent RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR COVID-19 vaccine showed good tolerability and safety in human participants, and induced sera cross-neutralizing antibodies against all XBB- and JN.1- lineage subvariants. These results suggest that the monovalent RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR protein vaccine represents a favorable candidate of COVID-19 booster for clinical use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine triggered robust humoral response in mice and rats</title><p id="Par6">In our previous study, we reported a self-assembled trimeric protein developed based on the ability of peptides containing the spike HR1 and HR2 regions to spontaneously form a 6-helix bundle (6-HD) higher-order structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> In the current study, we applied the same design strategy, directly linking the XBB.1.5-derived RBD (amino acids V320-G545) with the HR1 (L916-L966) and HR2 (K1157-L1203) sequences from the spike S2 subunit in a tandem arrangement. The resulting recombinant trimeric protein, named RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR, was subsequently expressed using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System and finally purified to a high degree of homogeneity, as described in previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup></p><p id="Par7">To determine the immunogenicity of RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine, National Institute of Health-Swiss (NIH) mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with of 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g oil-in-water MF59 adjuvanted-RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR proteins following a 21-day spaced prime-boost regimen for 3 times.

High titers of RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR protein-specific antibodies were observed in serum samples from vaccinated mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Neutralizing activity conferred by the monovalent RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine was subsequently assessed through pseudovirus neutralization assays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The vaccine demonstrated high potency of neutralization against all XBB-lineage subvariants. 50% neutralization geometric mean titers (GMTs) against pseudoviruses of XBB, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.16, XBB.1.16.6, and XBB.2.3 variants were determined as 21184, 56336, 39656, 20117, 22905, and 57620, respectively. The vaccine also exhibited efficient neutralization against EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1, and HV.1 pseudoviruses, representing several XBB-lineage descendants circulated globally.

Furthermore, immunization with the RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine confers effective protective immunity against infection with the live EG.5.1 variant in the local upper and lower respiratory tract. Remarkably, the RBD<sub>XBB.1.5</sub>-HR vaccine exhibits favorable safety and tolerability profiles in human participants and demonstrates excellent ability to induce strong neutralizing potency against XBB-lineages, JN.1 and recent KP.2 and KP.3 subvariants, highlighting its potential for emergency use as a boost shot in clinical settings against the circulating Omicron variant.
