In the field of coaching, women are confronted with inequity throughout their careers, which frequently has a detrimental impact. To gain a deeper insight into the under-representation of women in sport coaching, framing the Female Sport Coaching Training Programme (FEMCoach) project, an investigation was carried out to examine coaches' educational support. After reviewing the scientific literature, a survey was developed aiming to analyse the needs of women youth sports coaches in practice to design coaching educational programmes that promote gender equity in youth sports.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The present study collected and analyzed survey data from 463 coaches (45% women and 55% men) from 24 different countries, sports and competitive levels. Coaches completed a 40-question online survey, divided into seven topics: (1) sociodemographic data, (2) the inclusion environment for sports practice, (3) coach professional activities, (4) menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception and pregnancy/childcare, (5) barriers for females in sport, (6) coaches' courses, and (7) gender differences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Some differences were found between women and men coaches' perceptions regarding barriers or stigmas that women face in practice. Most women's [80% (&#x000b1;5%)] and approximately half of men's [54% (&#x000b1;5%)] believe that women coaches sometimes face discrimination and/or mistrust and most of the women's [78% (&#x000b1;6%)] and the majority of men's [64% (&#x000b1;5%)] recognize different opportunities for coaches between genders. Considering the presence of topics related to female biology in coaches' education process the majority of women [72% (&#x000b1;5%)] and men [63% (&#x000b1;5%)] considered that they were not approached enough, agreeing most of the coaches, women [92% (&#x000b1;3%)] and men [87% (&#x000b1;4%)], that coach education programmes should be more expanded to cover it. In open-ended questions coaches agreed that educational programmes can promote gender equality and mentioned a lack of contents related to equity, identity and female biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Finally, accepting the limitations, this survey study provides relevant contextual information and practical applications for coaching educational programmes targeting women coaches and athletes and insights for governing bodies and institutions to foster gender equality in coaching.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sports coaching</kwd><kwd>educational programmes</kwd><kwd>women</kwd><kwd>female</kwd><kwd>gender equality</kwd><kwd>youth sports</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>European Education and Culture Executive Agency</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100020311</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Gendered actions are socialized and perpetuated from a young age due to the normalization of societal stereotypes (Anderson and White, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), enriched by traditional gender-specific roles (Spence and Helmreich, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Although men and women frequently perceive these gender ideologies differently, the results are often restrictive and discriminatory (Grabrucker, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Nevertheless, research can encourage future change since stereotypes are socially shaped and not absolute (Azzarito and Solmon, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Male dominance in sports is intrinsically linked to hegemonic constructions of femininity, which emphasize traits such as &#x0201c;delicacy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;vulnerability&#x0201d; (Bell, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Since the 1970s, the absolute number of women and girls participating has gradually increased, with a significant rise in participation in health and fitness programmes (Norman, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Yet, these improvements in sports have not been reflected in the proportion of women in coaching and leadership positions, and the coaching profession continues to be particularly restrictive for women (Norman, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Regardless of social status, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity, organized sports should be accessible to all, as sports and participation in sports promote social inclusion (Bailey, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and support inclusive practices (Braum&#x000fc;ller et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>Gender stereotypes influence people's perceptions of themselves and others (Anderson and White, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), their behavior (Mulvey and Killen, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), their presentation (Carroll, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), their professional opportunities (Bird and Rhoton, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and their participation in sports (Staurowsky, <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Women and girls are less physically active than men and boys of the same age (Women in Sport, <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Menstruation is one of the main reasons why young women quit playing sports or engaging in physical exercise. According to recent studies, 70% of girls avoid exercising during their menses because of pain (73%), fear of leaking (62%), tiredness (52%), and/or self-consciousness (45%) (Women in Sport, <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). In general, female athletes from different sports and competition levels emphasize that menstruation is difficult and might have a detrimental effect on their athletic experiences (Adam et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). For young girls to benefit from physical exercise and not to consider their menstrual cycle an obstacle to participation, it is fundamental to learn how to encourage and keep them involved in sports (Keil et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, in a school-based context, research has shown that 42% of girls stop participating in physical education classes during their menses (Youth Sport Trust and Women in Sport, <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Sports participation benefits from an inclusive and diverse approach, and successful participation in sports is more likely to increase the probability of long-term commitment (C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; and Hancock, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Research shows that youth sports programmes focused on play and engagement across various contexts typically enable long-term gains that align with global governments' agendas for excellence and participation (Comeau, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Skille, <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). International sports organizations and governing bodies should consider this integrative approach to provide their members with more inclusive and beneficial sports opportunities (C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; and Hancock, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Regarding coaches' knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes, it is recognized that they significantly impact youth sports experiences (Lafreni&#x000e8;re et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), making these variables essential for the quality of coaching and the outcomes of young athletes (Li et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Coaching entails responsibility for an athlete's physical and technical development, as well as their psychological and social wellbeing, positioning the coach as a central figure in establishing and monitoring ethical sporting behavior (Norman, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In Western society, athletes' involvement in sports and their social and moral wellbeing leads to the assumption that coaches perceive their role as one that embodies an ethic of care and prioritizes ethical considerations beyond just technical aspects. In coaching, an ethic of care depends on the relationships that coaches build with their athletes, the interpretation of their knowledge and beliefs, and the effort to make coaching more inclusive and accessible (Denison, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Research shows some accomplishments in the participation of minority groups both as participants and in coaching. However, growth has been slow due to sporting organizations and governing bodies making minimal changes to their working methods, definitions, and rewards of competence. The understanding and interpretation of sociocultural issues, as well as the way in which individual and group differences are still supported, alongside the lack of changes to sports leadership, contribute to these challenges (Ely and Meyerson, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). As a result, persistent inequities remain in the field of sports.</p><p>Building appropriate and responsive educational tools and policies requires understanding coaches' experiences with discrimination and gathering their perspectives on potential solutions, given the critical role that coaches play in creating safe and inclusive athletic environments (Papageorgiou et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Several educational programmes in sports have been developed to raise awareness and combat discrimination. However, it is challenging to significantly change attitudes (Dixon et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), sometimes leading to the reinforcement of generalizations or stereotypes through anti-discrimination training, which perpetuates coaches' issues when navigating the complexities of real situations (Moustakas and Kalina, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). A recent study stated that to combat discrimination, education must begin in schools and athletic organizations. Moreover, anti-discrimination workshops and coach education were considered essential to addressing these issues in society and as key components in fostering long-lasting inclusiveness. The same study applied a survey to investigate the content that must be included when developing a training programme for youth coaches and staff about inclusion and combating discrimination, revealing the most important specific training activities, general awareness of discrimination and diversity, and content on specific marginalized groups (Kalina and Moustakas, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). In this context, describing the most important content to include in educational programmes, especially targeting the needs of female coaches, remains a gap in the literature.</p><p>To support the development of the FEMCoach programme, partners conducted extensive data collection with coaches through an online survey presented and discussed in this study, aiming to analyse the needs of women youth sports coaches in practice to design coaching educational programmes that promote gender equity in youth sports.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Participants</title><p>All participants received a freely accessible online survey invitation (via e-mail, phone, or social media) and were asked to complete the survey regarding the needs of women sports coaches. The online survey was available for data collection from July 5<sup>th</sup> until October 21<sup>st</sup>. By the end of this period, a convenience sample of 476 practitioners from various countries and all levels of competition had completed the survey. Since this is a pilot study, <italic>a priori</italic> sample size calculation was not conducted. We considered the number of respondents sufficient, as indicated by previous similar studies (Ciaccioni et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Dalamitros et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Kalina and Moustakas, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). The study was approved by the Universidade de Tr&#x000e1;s-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD) Ethics Committee (Ref. Doc70-CE-UTAD-2024) and was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). Participants were informed about the study's aims beforehand, and participation was voluntary.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Study design</title><p>A descriptive design was used for this study. The survey was developed using a web-based platform (Google Forms<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), which facilitated data collection (<ext-link xlink:href="https://forms.gle/RfMbJpZEEUbsbAcy5" ext-link-type="uri">https://forms.gle/RfMbJpZEEUbsbAcy5</ext-link>). The structure of the survey combines multiple-choice questions (i.e., only one answer allowed), checkboxes (i.e., multiple answers allowed), Likert scales, and open-ended, free-text responses to identify the perceived and actual needs of female coaches. The survey was created following a narrative review that collected scientific information on the subject. A total of 40 questions were included, divided into seven sections: (1) sociodemographic data (14 questions), (2) the inclusion environment for sports practice (three questions), (3) coach professional activities (one question), (4) menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception, and pregnancy/childcare (nine questions), (5) barriers for females in sport (five questions), (6) coaches' courses (three questions), and (7) gender differences (five questions). The survey was designed to be user-friendly, with completion taking up to 5 min.

But based on what I've observed in other sports, it's quite uncommon to see women coaching men, but the opposite - that is, men coaching women - is, I must admit, fairly prevalent. It's also usual for athletes to migrate into coaching roles, and male performance in absolute terms is typically better than female performance. Therefore, I believe this is why people confuse good coaches with strong athletes and still see a male coach as being better than a female.&#x0201d; (man, between 25 and 34 years old, Portuguese, team sport coaches, more than 7 years of experience, male and female athletes from 21 years of age)</p></disp-quote><p>In relation to <italic>personal life</italic>, coaches reported that women sometimes struggle with:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;Pregnancy periods when related to competitive calendars, lacking some understanding from club managers.&#x0201d; (man, over 55 years old, Portuguese, team sport coaches, more than 7 years of experience, male and female athletes from 5 to 15 years of age)</p><p>&#x0201c;In my country, female coaches have the duty to raise their children and take care of the home.

Thus, we support a gender equality view sustained in a society that provides equal opportunities to women as it does to men, with gender just considered as a factor in coaching (as in every other aspect) because there is still a different treatment of women than there is of men just because of gender and not sustained by any other reason, and that is exactly where our concerns must be focused.

Due to the similarities in anthropometric, physical, and motor skills profiles at a younger age, schools provide an opportunity for students to try out different sports before entering the years of specialization (Lovell et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A more gender-divergent physical education culture that minimizes gender differences is currently more acceptable and promoted throughout Europe. Symbolic and social boundaries are gradually disappearing as a result of the social creation of a gender-neutral physical education culture and the merging of cultures (Lundvall, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Positive physical education experiences enhance physical activity levels in adulthood (MacNamara et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and understanding the facilitators and barriers to sports equips professionals with the necessary skills to promote lifelong sports and physical activity participation (Corbin et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Negative stereotypes about gendered norms and sexuality are encountered by individuals who continue to play the sport as adults due to a lack of broader educational exposure (Grundlingh, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>According to Hay and Penney (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), societal values, cultures, opinions, political influences, and personal beliefs all play a role in the social construction of physical education. As a curricular subject, there is a distinct gendered habitus that favors particular groups in physical education (Green et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Metcalfe, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), either discouraging or reinforcing specific forms of femininity and praising masculinity and conventional masculine traits such as strength, speed, and competitiveness (Anderson and White, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Both teachers' and students' gendered habits and the domination of masculinity are cemented by these discourses, which are frequently reproduced and reinforced in practice (Valley and Graber, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Walseth et al., <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Wrench and Garrett, <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In fact, a limited, binary conception of gender is formed by the physical education environment in schools and is perpetuated in the subject through practices, instruction, and didactic materials, making it difficult to challenge stereotypes (Anderson and White, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), while remaining prevalent gendered norms, stereotypical practices, and disparities (Metcalfe, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Valley and Graber, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The present research results reveal the need to improve teachers' training and coaching educational programmes to provide essential training on gender equality and guarantee the provision of equal opportunities in sports.</p><p>A systematic review concluded that the most frequent physical activity barriers for young girls are the lack of support from peers, family, and teachers, followed by a lack of time. The most identified facilitators for physical activity among young girls are weight loss/management and peer, family, and teacher support (Duffey et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Physical activity promotion should attempt to implement strategies that can change the role and relationship of negative gender norms (World Health Organization, <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). By establishing cultural expectations of what it means to be feminine or masculine (Corr et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), gender norms and stereotypes have a particular impact on physical activity participation by restricting access to and existing opportunities. Gender stereotypes are perceived by young girls as a barrier to physical activity engagement, and perceived gender dominance arises when physical activity options are viewed as socially acceptable for boys only, diminishing the value and accessibility for girls (Martins et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Standiford, <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To meet the needs of young girls, curriculum development must use an inclusive approach. When creating a physical education curriculum that considers the preferences of young girls in a gender-responsive manner, an intersectoral approach, including education, sports, and health sectors, should be considered, probably requiring new policies in the field. Examples of how to adjust a curriculum for young girls include making it non-competitive and flexible, individually designed with a range of opportunities, and providing time for physical activity. The present research revealed the potential to increase schools' encouragement through sports to promote gender equality among children and youth, creating strategies to increase sports participation and inclusion. A possible strategy to increase physical activity opportunities may include policies and programmes that can promote physical activity outside of the conventional physical education setting in schools, such as active breaks and active extracurricular activities (Duffey et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Identifying the barriers that limit participation may be simpler with more discussion of negative gender norms in the environments where physical activity occurs (Martins et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). For instance, institutions, educators, and boys should be involved in acknowledging and addressing their role in promoting these norms and developing supportive environments for girls' participation in physical exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2 Female biology and sports</title><p>Regarding stigma in sports considering menstrual-related issues, research supports our findings, reaffirming the need for a change (Heather et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Menstruating athletes face struggles due to their menstrual cycle-related physical (e.g., menstrual cramps, tiredness, bloating) and psychological symptoms (e.g., mood changes, low motivation) (Nolan et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Athletes and coaches frequently view menstruation as a taboo, creating obstacles to open communication about the menstrual cycle (Bergstr&#x000f6;m et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Studies have shown a lack of confidence in discussing the menstrual cycle among both male and female coaches due to the delicate nature of the subject (Brown and Knight, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Marais et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), limiting athletes and coaches from having timely and open discussions about menstrual symptoms and dysfunction, which is also impacted by the widespread stigma associated with the menstrual cycle and the lack of knowledge regarding this subject (Bergstr&#x000f6;m et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Findlay et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Verhoef et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). This issue is more prevalent when male coaches are involved (Brown et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) due to a general bias and belief that the menstrual cycle is a &#x0201c;women's subject&#x0201d; (Holmes et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), which is supported by our results: fewer male coaches reported it being normal to talk about these topics. A coordinated and combined effort is needed from all stakeholders to shift perceptions of the menstrual cycle and end the social stigma associated with menstruation (Mart&#x000ed;nez-Fortuny et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between coaches and athletes is essential to the athletic environment, as coaches have a significant impact on players' personal and professional growth as well as their accomplishment of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and collective goals (Jowett, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Athletes and coaches may promote gender equity and foster a more successful, supportive, and inclusive athletic environment if they understand their roles in managing menstrual cycle-related factors and provide appropriate assistance. Athletes frequently state that the presence of a male or female coach influences the amount and quality of communication during the menstrual cycle, indicating discomfort and insecurity when discussing the subject with male coaches (Brown et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Findlay et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Verhoef et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). They believe that male coaches are unable to relate to their menstrual concerns, limiting their ability to provide helpful guidance or support (Koli&#x00107; et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; von Rosen et al., <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). As a result, athletes often choose to conceal their symptoms, attributing menstruation-related pain or discomfort to non-menstrual causes (Brown et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Studies indicate that male coaches can be reluctant to address the subject with their athletes, particularly the younger ones, while female coaches and physical education instructors are generally more open in their support and communication about the menstrual cycle, using their own experiences and knowledge of menstruation symptoms to assist in this process (Brown and Knight, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; H&#x000f6;&#x000f6;k et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Research also indicates that athletes tend to discuss menstrual cycles with female coaches and female staff members (von Rosen et al., <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Concerning male coaches, studies show their interest in learning more about how the menstrual cycle affects their athletes' training and performance, as well as how to approach and communicate with their athletes regarding menstrual symptoms (Bergstr&#x000f6;m et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Clarke et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>To create a safe environment for young women and girls to discuss their menstrual cycle, it is crucial to de-stigmatize menstruation, enabling educators and coaches to provide young athletes with the support they need (van den Berg and Doyle-Baker, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). Studies conducted on female professional athletes at the senior level revealed that 76% of athletes did not talk to their coaches about their menstrual cycle despite its impact on their daily lives, training, and performance (Armour et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, research found that although participants believed their menstrual cycles affected their performance, only 27% of elite athletes discussed them with their coach (Solli et al., <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The primary reasons reported for this reluctance were shame or discomfort caused by stigma and the fact that coaches are men. Out of the 140 athletes in the study, 44% of those with female coaches discussed menstruation with their coach, whereas 22% of those with male coaches did the same (Solli et al., <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>Education regarding the menstrual cycle is advised for coaches and athletes. According to recent studies (Brown et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Clarke et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), coaches receive little to no education on the subject, which is especially problematic for men as they have no firsthand experience with menstruation. Any coaching certification or course should include instruction for coaches to help destigmatise topics related to female biology (Keil et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Education is the most crucial element in raising awareness of the menstrual cycle and encouraging open communication among athletes and coaches (Bergstr&#x000f6;m et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Clarke et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Verhoef et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>Between coaches and staff, it is unclear who is responsible for gathering, organizing, and sharing menstrual cycle tracking data (Marais et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). According to the results of our research, a high percentage of coaches do not know whether their female athletes are using tracking software. This may indicate a lack of knowledge regarding the benefits of this tracking for both athletes and coaches or a lack of confidence between athletes and coaches in sharing personal information.</p><p>Menstrual tracking data can be useful for understanding the menstrual cycle, identifying symptom patterns, finding coping mechanisms, customizing training programmes according to athletes' symptoms, and providing breaks when needed (Epstein et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is crucial to ensure that menstrual tracking data are handled appropriately due to the power dynamics between coaches and athletes, especially in elite sports, as well as to decrease athletes' dissatisfaction stemming from coaches' failure to provide follow-up information (McHaffie et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Thus, sporting organizations should establish official procedures and structures for menstrual cycle tracking and data management, clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved (Levy and Romo-Avil&#x000e9;s, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>In the Srinivasa Gopalan et al. (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>) review, three key factors of sporting environments that support healthy sports participation for athletes related to the menstrual cycle are recognized. (1) The presence of female coaches is significant for open communication concerning the menstrual cycle since they can relate to the struggles and experiences of menstruation (Brown and Knight, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Given the historical underrepresentation of women in coaching, support, and administration roles in sports (Forsyth et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), this reinforces the need to expand opportunities and roles for women in sports leadership. (2) Exposure and experience are key as athletes learn to control and express their menstrual symptoms over time (von Rosen et al., <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), and coaches increase their awareness (Brown and Knight, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Additionally, involving older teammates in the creation of a supportive environment for younger athletes by sharing their knowledge and insights about the menstrual cycle can also help (Forsyth et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) or make athletes see their &#x0201c;role models&#x0201d; in sports talking openly about it (Keil et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). (3) In addition to gaining insight and understanding over time, athletes and coaches should emphasize comfort and trust in their relationships for open communication (Brown and Knight, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Marais et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>In line with our findings, Raudasoja and Ryba's (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>) research indicates that some individuals treat pregnancy as a taboo. Additionally, to avoid unfavorable reactions from their coaches and sports officials, pregnant athletes often delay disclosing their pregnancy (Davenport et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Pullen et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). The participation of pregnant women in competitive and elite sports is a social issue that remains highly controversial and is viewed as a sensitive topic by many of the coaches involved in this research. Sport has historically been perceived as inappropriate for pregnant women due to its underlying logic of striving for peak performance, which often comes at the expense of other aspects of life (Douglas and Carless, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), thereby perpetuating a sexist culture (Fink, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Davenport et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) found that coaches recognized the importance of reliable information regarding the safety of training during pregnancy. The existing guidelines are regarded as too conservative for elite athletes, and individualization, using specific benchmarks and athletes' subjective levels of discomfort as indicators, is recommended as a more effective strategy than applying a standardized schedule for all athletes participating in sports during pregnancy and returning to sports after giving birth (Davenport et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). In both traditional and social media, pregnant athletes are often portrayed as irresponsible, with sexism, particularly sexual objectification and unfair discrimination, identified as the primary factors contributing to this stigmatization (Weaving, <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>Considering the presence of these topics related to female biology in the coaches' education process, the results of the present research reinforce that they are not sufficiently addressed and that coach education programmes should be expanded to cover them. It is recommended that coaches frequently update their knowledge on issues related to female biology and maintain a clear and understandable manner of speech for athletes' comprehension. As our results confirm the lack of open communication between coaches and athletes regarding these topics, changes must be implemented. Additionally, since gender education is a powerful tool for reaching all age groups and influencing broader social change, it is recommended that mandatory content be created in schools (Raudasoja and Ryba, <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.3 Gender as a barrier to sports coaching</title><p>Overt or structural causes are not always the reasons for the barriers that prevent women from achieving positions of power in sports. Conversely, relatively minor events often shape women's experiences as coaches. Some men believe that coaching is primarily a male domain due to the cultural values associated with sports, and women who aspire to be successful often encounter feelings of doubt and mistrust from their peers. Consequently, female coaches often feel pressured to demonstrate their coaching abilities to men (Norman, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), which is supported by the present research results, where the majority of women indicated that they had experienced a sense of obligation to show their coaching skills to someone of a different gender, while most men reported that they have never experienced this. When asked if they agreed with the assertion: &#x0201c;the cultural values associated with sport made some men believe that coaching belongs to them,&#x0201d; coaches' opinions varied significantly, with the majority of women and only a third of men agreeing with this statement, reflecting differing understandings between genders. Moreover, male and female coaches' opinions diverge when asked about their beliefs regarding whether female coaches sometimes face discrimination and/or mistrust; in this case, the majority of women, but only half of the men, agreed with the statement.</p><p>According to Aitchison et al. (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), the industry where women face the greatest discrimination and harassment in sports. Everhart and Chelladurai (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) studied gender disparities in preferences for a coaching career and examined discrimination as a potential barrier for women pursuing coaching. Female coaches encounter numerous obstacles due to the unbalanced organizational structures prevalent in the coaching industry. Research in this field has demonstrated that women often receive less for their efforts than men, yet they quantitatively express some degree of satisfaction working within these institutions. Three retention factors (i.e., recognition and collegial support, inclusion, and working conditions) have been identified as significant in shaping work experiences. Despite women stating that inclusivity is an important aspect of their work experience, more men reported feelings of inclusivity (Pastore et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). In the present research, differences can be found in how men and female coaches perceive these ideas, reinforcing the need for greater awareness and the development of clear actions to combat the real barriers that women still face in their coaching careers.</p><p>Coaches must develop the ability to identify and address social justice concerns by becoming aware of social disparities, the unequal distribution of power, and ethics in both their actions and those of others. This process can also encourage coaches to engage in deeper self-reflection (Cushion et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). According to Culp (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), 43 student coaches from the United States participated in a 16-week social justice course based on social constructivism. Throughout the course, topics related to inequality were introduced and explored. Analysis after the course revealed shifts in coaches' social justice ideologies, a greater understanding of under-represented groups' perspectives, and an enhanced critical perspective when analysing sports procedures. In the same study, results suggested that coaching educational programmes might benefit from emphasizing constructivism and democratic education (Culp, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The findings of Norman (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) showed that viewing gender equity through an &#x0201c;equal opportunities&#x0201d; lens leads to a narrow conceptualization of such issues by coaches. This perspective fails to challenge dominant and discriminatory ideologies and does not enable coaches to effectively address equity within their practices. Consequently, coaches struggle to understand the importance of managing these issues. While equal opportunities between genders in sports coaching are a necessary step, they are certainly not sufficient to address and solve this issue when considering the bigger picture.</p><p>Equality and equity are multifaceted ideas that encompass distribution among groups, access to resources, the quality of interpersonal relationships, and whether people relate as equals (White, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). When discussing equality, Baker et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) raised several important questions, such as: (1) to understand equality, it is necessary to recognize the patterns of inequality, (2) these patterns need to be challenged using a suitable framework, (3) the goals of equality must also be determined, and (4) the best institutional structures for attaining equality in various situations must be established. This should outline the institutional strategies that would be most effective in fostering equality within a given setting.</p><p>To ensure equity (i.e., to mitigate potential inequities for people and groups), various institutions, sectors, and organizations work toward equality (i.e., everyone has equal opportunities and access to the system) through various projects, programmes, and services.</p><p>Sports continue to be considered as an inequitable, gendered, hegemonically male institution. Thus, identities, organizational practices, and processes of control and action are differentiated between men and women largely dominated by men (Fielding-Lloyd and Me&#x000e2;n, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In the present research, most coaches recognize different opportunities for coaches of various genders. Several coaches view gender equality as an equal opportunity between genders, and working to enhance inclusion through an equal opportunities ideology has the advantages of challenging inequality in sports, eliminating unfairness, and increasing the likelihood of minority groups being employed, trained, and retained in leadership roles (Ely and Meyerson, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). However, instead of scrutinizing organizational structures and cultures, an &#x0201c;equal opportunities&#x0201d; approach shifts the focus to external variables as the reason for under-representation (Lusted, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Shaw and Slack, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Regarding gender relations, previous research has emphasized that they are at the heart of women's sporting experiences and constitute motives for their under-representation in sports leadership or for unequal athletic experiences (Norman, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In Norman's (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) study, participants' experiences revealed that gender relations, intersecting principally with religion and ethnicity, supported their everyday coaching practices. In the present research, considerable differences between men and women were observed when asked if their regular coaching practices were primarily influenced by gender relations, with a greater impact reported by women.</p><p>Instead of being understood as power dynamics or factors influencing how people perceive their lives, aspects of an individual's identity are viewed as &#x0201c;add-ons&#x0201d; (Ely and Meyerson, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), contributing to a narrow and weak approach to these questions among coaches and athletes (Norman, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.4 Coaches' education for a paradigm change</title><p>Independent of gender, the differences in the hierarchisation of coaches' professional activities and the type of sport coached are well established. Thus, the perception of coaches changes depending on the sports' needs (Sterkowicz et al., <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Over the years, professional activities have been described, developed, and studied across various sports disciplines (Sterkowicz-Przybycie&#x00144; and Purenovi&#x00107;-Ivanovi&#x00107;, <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). A hierarchy of their importance related to sports success has emerged from previous publications that considered coaches' perspectives on the value of professional activities in different sports [e.g., judo (Sterkowicz et al., <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), artistic gymnastics (Sterkowicz-Przybycie&#x00144; and Purenovi&#x00107;-Ivanovi&#x00107;, <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), taekwondo (Bujak et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and karate (Dobrzycki, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)]. This hierarchy can be applied to enhance the educational programmes for upcoming generations of coaches in these fields (Sterkowicz-Przybycie&#x00144; and Purenovi&#x00107;-Ivanovi&#x00107;, <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The results of the present research indicate that coaches' gender did not have a considerable impact on the hierarchisation of coaches' professional activities. However, more research should investigate whether there are differences in coaches' perceptions of the hierarchisation of professional activities, considering specific sports and the gender of the coach. Researchers acknowledge the need for further investigation in this area to enhance current coaching educational programmes (Radojevi&#x00107; et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>When studying the individual impact of coaches' educational programmes, the research mentioned the need for an adaptive approach, considering genders (e.g., girls/women may benefit more from content related to physical activity and self-esteem than boys/men) (Douglas Coatsworth and Conroy, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Guagliano et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The present research results reinforce the need for a gender-sensitive approach when creating coaching educational programmes, considering the different degrees of usefulness that coaches attribute to various types of content to be included in such programmes. In addition, according to the results, they could also benefit from a reformulation of the didactic and educational material, considering participants' gender differences. This also emphasizes the importance of future studies to create large-scale interventions designed specifically for girls, particularly when female coaches supervise them. The complex effects of coaching highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to coaching education that incorporates the numerous demands and experiences of athletes and the progress of coaches (Li et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p><p>Over the past 10&#x02013;15 years, the effectiveness of coaching for youth has begun to include more robust outcomes, such as identity, mental health, social-emotional wellness, and moral education, as well as outcomes focused on equity and justice (Newman et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Zeisner and Smith, <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). It is important to understand that several variables appear to affect coaching effectiveness, including team individuality and coach dynamics, athletes' age and gender, the type of sport, how coaching educational programme interventions are conducted, and the backgrounds of coaches (Li et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p><p>It became clear from the results of the present research that not all coaches feel prepared to address questions of gender identity among their athletes and that they wish to gain more knowledge about this matter. This also highlights the need to incorporate this topic into coaching educational programmes to promote inclusivity. Everyone involved in sports (i.e., coaches, educators, athletes, administrators, doctors, and so on) should receive training on how to prevent heteronormativity from being reinforced and how to foster supportive environments, equipping them to prevent, identify, and address prejudice and discrimination due to their crucial role in translating policy to the field (Kavoura and Kokkonen, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>A scoping review found that addressing some problems faced by athletes and coaches, including gender and sexual minorities in sports, could be improved by combining the implementation of anti-discrimination policies with gender and sexual diversity education for all involved (Kavoura and Kokkonen, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Existing discriminatory ideas about gender and sexuality continue to thrive at a micro level due to the lack of strategic direction, actions, or guidance from national governing bodies, as well as inadequate sociocultural education for coaches (Norman, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). By highlighting the importance of inclusivity and exemplifying alternative approaches to institutional structures, athletic departments can act as &#x0201c;social change agents&#x0201d; and influence the sports environment for transgender athletes as well (Cunningham, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). There will likely be more educational opportunities through continuing education programmes and professional conferences as research on transgender needs and experiences progresses (Munson and Ensign, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the needs of women youth sports coaches through their opinions on the educational programmes' content and the perceived barriers and stigmas related to female coaches. The majority of participants recognized gender differences in the sports coaching profession and agreed that coaching programmes represent a primary approach to a paradigm shift. Therefore, it appears that theoretical and practical aspects align with the evidence of perceived needs among female coaches, which may serve as a starting point to help optimize both female coaches' careers and the development of female athletes by adapting coaching training to female biology.</p><p>Starting from what is, for many, the first contact with sports in physical education, schools must encourage sports to promote equality among children and youth, creating strategies to increase sports participation and inclusion. It is important to ensure that teachers' training and coaching educational programmes provide essential training on gender equality to guarantee equal opportunities to play each sport.</p><p>Regarding the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception, and pregnancy/childcare, a significant stigma is associated with these topics. Their relevance for open communication in coaches' educational programmes may stand as a first step to start changing mentalities and help coaches deal with these topics among female athletes, ultimately improving their performance. A discussion on gender identities must also be included as part of coaches' education so they can easily comprehend and manage issues that athletes may face. Concerning barriers for women in sports, the cultural values associated with sports have helped create some of them, and clearly, the sense of mistrust or discredit is still strongly present in the population of female coaches.</p><p>Regarding coaches' professional activities, the results indicated a similar pattern across genders. However, further research should explore whether different sports and/or the gender of the coach will influence these results, which must be considered in coach education. Finally, coaching educational programmes should adopt a gender-sensitive approach and consider coaches' gender adaptation of the content to their specific needs. These actions will help reduce gender inequalities and contribute to promoting equal opportunities between genders.</p><p>Considering the results obtained and acknowledging the limitations, we can conclude that this survey study provides relevant contextual information and practical applications that may be useful for educational programmes aimed at women sports coaches and female athletes. Additionally, it offers insights to promote gender equality and inclusivity in coaching, aspiring for equal opportunities between the genders in the coaching profession.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>6 Strengths</title><p>The main strength of the present study is that it provides a comprehensive approach and an up-to-date panorama of coaches' perceptions regarding the existence of gender differences in the coaching profession, considering both women's and men's opinions on the sports coaching profession from diverse backgrounds and countries.</p><p>This study represents an innovative investigation into female coaches' needs and barriers within their profession, opening the discussion about gender equity in coaching. By acknowledging gender differences in coaching, essential insights are provided regarding the challenges that female coaches face in practice, creating an important approach to develop the necessary strategies to improve their opportunities and, consequently, their professional careers. By reporting the stigmas related to female biology and highlighting the importance of addressing these topics in coach education programmes, we foster a supportive environment for female coaches and athletes. The discussion on the significance of specific topics in coach educational programmes encompasses various fields and reflects the current and actual needs of female coaches to implement conscious changes and raise awareness about the need for shifting mentalities.</p><p>In summary, the study's strengths lie in its innovative focus, new insights, and significant contributions to the discussion concerning gender equity within the coaching profession.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>7 Limitations</title><p>The present study acknowledges some limitations that should be considered, primarily related to the data collection instrument. The use of online surveys may result in varied interpretations of the questions posed, depending on the respondent. Although efforts were made to employ simple and precise language while keeping the questions concise and offering multiple options, along with extensive testing of the survey prior to distribution, misinterpretations may still have occurred. To reduce the impact of incorrect assumptions, we provided the lead researchers with contacts in case coaches required clarification. Additionally, the survey did not undergo a validation process for internal consistency or reliability of the collected responses (e.g., test-retest reliability), which may introduce some ambiguity into the final data.</p><p>Another potential limitation is the possibility of a response bias, as the largest proportion of survey answers were from Portugal. Thus, possible stereotypes and cultural differences among participants may have affected the results (Kemmelmeier, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Moreover, it is necessary to recognize the different degrees of emphasis given by each country to sports, in general and in specific types of sports. Moreover, a potential strategy to mitigate cultural bias should be considered for future research, including authors from different nationalities to analyse the results.</p><p>Furthermore, potential biases emerged from the convenience sampling approach since the survey was designed to be openly accessible to coaches and was advertised across various platforms (e.g., email, phone, social media), allowing all interested coaches to participate. This enrolment strategy limited the authors' ability to obtain crucial information regarding the practitioners who participated in the survey and those who did not (e.g., the rate of participation or rejection in each group).</p><p>Moreover, the results of the presented survey must be interpreted with caution because (1) the a priori sample size calculation was not performed, and although we considered the number of responders to be adequate in relation to the sample size of previous similar studies (Ciaccioni et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Dalamitros et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Kalina and Moustakas, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), the compatibility limits of proportions appear, in some cases, inadequate for comparison, suggesting that a larger sample size would be required, and (2) the uncertainties for comparisons of proportions are, in some cases, too large to draw confident conclusions.</p><p>Finally, the survey was developed exclusively in English, possibly making some coaches unable to participate, which created a sample bias regarding the English-speaking practitioners willing to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>8 Practical applications</title><p>Despite the study's limitations, the results from this research may be applied in the development of sports coach educational programmes, as they contribute to a deeper understanding of coaches' perceptions of gender equity among peers, emphasizing key issues and areas for intervention. These educational programmes would specifically address women's needs, helping coaches engage with their athletes and confront the stigma associated with topics such as the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception, and pregnancy/childcare. The educational programmes can also include structured discussions concerning gender identity and cultural perceptions of gender in sports.</p><p>The present study may also encourage reflection among schools, governing bodies, and institutions regarding inclusivity and gender equity in educational programmes, raising awareness of gender biases. Eventually, this could lead to the development of strategies to increase the participation rates of women and girls in sports and physical activities, as well as to ensure equal opportunities for all children and youth.</p><p>In conclusion, the practical applications of this study emphasize the importance of targeted educational programmes and awareness movements that directly address the needs of female coaches and contribute to a more equitable coaching landscape. This strategy may lead to meaningful improvements in the coaching profession and foster a more inclusive environment for all athletes (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Key findings to promote gender equality in sports coaching.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-16-1560764-g0009" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="s9"><title>9 Future lines</title><p>The present study establishes a foundation for ongoing research efforts by identifying several areas for further investigation. Longitudinal studies could assess the effectiveness of the proposed interventions and the long-term effects of adapting sports coach educational programmes to a more gender-sensitive approach.</p><p>To strongly support and solidify the results on this subject, future research should recruit more practitioners to resolve the sample size problem, develop a more effective recruitment method to minimize potential sampling bias and explore new directions in cross-cultural differences.</p><p>Following these future lines, we will be able to enhance the foundational knowledge gained from this study, ultimately striving for significant progress in gender parity within the sports coaching field in Europe.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Erasmus+ project (Project number: 101134453) Consortium from Universidade de Tr&#x000e1;s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Fundacja Institute for Sport Governance, Aristotelio Panepistimio Thessalonikis, Asocijacija Sport Za Sve Srbije, Associa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para o Desenvolvimento do Desporto Jovem&#x02014;ADDJ, Universitat de Girona, Universidad del Pais Vasco/Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, and Comite Ol&#x000ed;mpico Cabo-Verdiano.
