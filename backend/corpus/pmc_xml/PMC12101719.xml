Research with human adults has shown that the mPFC is involved in a variety of social cognitive processes, especially when thinking about the psychological attributes of self and others (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amodio and Frith, 2006</xref>). Subsequently, a body of developmental social neuroscience research with human infants has demonstrated that the mPFC is active from early in development, supporting social perceptual and cognitive processes in the developing human brain (see <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann, 2013</xref>, for a review). While previously thought to be functionally inactive in infancy (see <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chugani, 2018</xref>, for a review arguing that it is not until 1&#x02005;year of age that infant blood glucose levels increase in medial portions of the prefrontal cortex), studies using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) demonstrate that infants&#x02019; mPFC responds sensitively to infant-directed facial and vocal social stimuli from early in the first year (see <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann, 2013</xref>, for a review).</p><p>Following this progress based on the utilization of fNIRS, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Deen et al. (2017)</xref> obtained face-sensitive responses in the mPFC of 4&#x02013;6-month-old infants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This further supports the notion of the mPFC playing a specialized role in processing social information from early in human development. This resulted in a conceptual proposal stipulating that the mPFC plays a role in processing faces as more than just a class of visual stimuli but also as signals of social interaction (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, considering that infants&#x02019; mPFC response to faces is strongest when the faces are dynamic and include cues of positive social attention like direct gaze and smiling and when the social interaction is contingent suggests that the mPFC may be involved in evaluating the social relevance of faces and thereby facilitate social engagement early in development (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al., 2018</xref>). According to this proposal, mPFC involvement during face processing may contribute to the development of posterior (occipital and temporal) cortical face areas by directing infants&#x02019; attention toward the faces of potential social partners (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Opinion</title><p>The current opinion serves the function to provide an update based on recent research concerning mPFC function in infancy and its role in developing social cognition. This was partly prompted by the recent publication of a fMRI study by <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kosakowski et al. (2024)</xref>, which identified face-selective activity in mPFC of infants, as young as 2&#x02005;months old. Utilizing fMRI data from a large sample of awake infants aged 2&#x02013;9&#x02005;months, the researchers found that the mPFC exhibited significantly greater activation to videos of faces compared with videos of objects, bodies, and scenes. Confirming and extending prior work using fMRI with infants (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Deen et al., 2017</xref>), face-selective responses in the mPFC were observed across this age range, supporting the view that the mPFC's involvement in processing faces as socially relevant stimuli emerges in infancy (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al., 2018</xref>). In fact, there is also evidence to indicate that the mPFC is involved in face processing even before 2&#x02005;months of age. Using electroencephalography (EEG) methods, newborns have been shown to display face-specific brain responses localized to various cortical brain regions, including the mPFC (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Buiatti et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Beyond these important insights demonstrating the early ontogenetic emergence of mPFC involvement in social information processing, there now exists converging evidence attesting to the sophistication of the mPFC involvement in infant social cognition. EEG research with 4- and 9-month-old infants shows that the mPFC contributes to predictive face processing in infancy, showing anticipatory neural activity before the presentation of a face (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mento et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, 4- and 9-month-old infants exhibited a category-specific modulation of the contingent negative variation (CNV), an ERP component reflecting anticipatory activity, with a larger CNV elicited by human voices compared with nonhuman sounds when these cues predicted faces. These face-predictive effects were generated in several cortical regions, including the mPFC (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mento et al., 2022</xref>). This study further showed the CNV prior to face onset predicted the amplitude of the face-sensitive ERP component (P400; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mento et al., 2022</xref>), elicited over posterior brain regions, providing support for the view that mPFC drives specialized brain processes in face-selective regions in line with <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Powel et al.'s (2018)</xref> abovementioned proposal.</p><p>Further evidence for the sophistication of mPFC function in infancy comes from a study using a novel dual-brain fNIRS paradigm (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Piazza et al., 2020</xref>). This study provides evidence that the mPFC plays a critical role in real-life social interactions during infancy by demonstrating significant neural coupling (intersubject correlation) between infants and adults. Specifically, using intersubject correlation analysis 9- to 15-month-old infants&#x02019; mPFC responses displayed neural coupling (intersubject correlation) with an adult experimenter's mPFC responses during naturalistic face-to-face interactions, but not when the dyad was engaged in separate tasks (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Piazza et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, the infants&#x02019; mPFC activity preceded the adults&#x02019; mPFC activity, particularly during moments of mutual gaze, suggesting that infants&#x02019; brains play a leading and proactive role in the dynamics during such social interactions. These findings replicate and extend previous findings regarding mPFC's role in social interaction from screen-based experimental studies with infants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann, 2013</xref>) into real-life social interactions. Moreover, the findings from this study (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Piazza et al., 2020</xref>) highlight the importance of the mPFC in actively facilitating dynamic and reciprocal social interactions between infants and adults, challenging the traditional view of early social interaction as primarily driven by adult input.</p><p>Infants&#x02019; mPFC has also been shown to play a role in social evaluation and person perception (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Krol and Grossmann, 2020</xref>). In this study, 11-month-old infants&#x02019; brain responses were measured while they watched videos of four different individuals displaying either smiles or frowns, combined with direct or averted gaze. Following this impression formation phase, infants&#x02019; looking preferences for the individuals (now displaying neutral expressions) were assessed using eye-tracking. The findings from this study showed that infants&#x02019; mPFC responses discriminated between smiling and frowning individuals only when the faces exhibited direct gaze (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Krol and Grossmann, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, in this study, infants&#x02019; mPFC activity during the impression formation phase predicted subsequent person preferences seen in looking behavior. These findings demonstrate that the mPFC is involved in forming impressions underpinning person perception.</p><p>There also exists evidence from longitudinal work showing that mPFC responses during infancy predict later social behavior in toddlerhood (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann and Allison, 2024</xref>). This study used fNIRS to show that greater mPFC activity in response to social smiles, but not frowns, at 11&#x02005;months predicted higher levels of sociability at 18&#x02005;months. This finding suggests that early variability in mPFC response during positive social interactions is linked to individual differences in overt social behavior. The finding that infant mPFC activity predicts later sociability suggests that early neural responses to social cues may serve as a biomarker for emerging social tendencies rather than directly driving later behavior. A developmental mechanism could involve the mPFC's role in reinforcing positive social experiences, shaping early social motivation and engagement through repeated interactions (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann and Allison, 2024</xref>).</p><p>Finally, recent work measured brain responses using fNIRS in infants aged 6&#x02013;13&#x02005;months as they viewed videos of third-party social interactions and compared the brain responses with when infants viewed two individual actions and inverted social interactions as control conditions (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Farris et al., 2022</xref>). The results of this study demonstrate that infants exhibited greater activation in the mPFC when observing third-party social interactions compared with both control conditions. In conjunction with the prior work discussed above (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Piazza et al., 2020</xref>), this suggests that infants&#x02019; mPFC plays a role in flexibly supporting both first-person and third-person social interaction processing.</p><p>In summary, this suggests that mPFC (1) plays a role in social perception, starting early in human infancy (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Buiatti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kosakowski et al., 2024</xref>), (2) serves predictive and social-evaluative functions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Krol and Grossmann, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mento et al., 2022</xref>), (3) is involved in coupling with other brains during first-person social interaction (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Piazza et al., 2020</xref>) and in processing third-person social interactions (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Farris et al., 2022</xref>), and (4) longitudinally predicts social behavior beyond infancy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann and Allison, 2024</xref>). This paints a picture of infant mPFC as playing an active and multifaceted role in social perception, cognition, and behavior, earlier and more sophisticated than previously thought. This confirms and critically extends existing conceptual approaches that had hypothesized that mPFC plays a specialized role in social perception (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al., 2018</xref>) and in social cognition (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann, 2013</xref>) from early in human ontogeny. The novel evidence garnered from developmental social and cognitive neuroscience research with infants (1) challenges late maturational views of prefrontal cortex function and (2) also contests recent proposals, asserting developmental discontinuity between infants&#x02019; and adults&#x02019; brain functioning (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg and Adolph, 2023</xref>; see <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2023</xref>, for discussion).</p><p>Considering this progress, it appears important to flesh out pressing open questions that should be addressed in future work. First, in children and adolescents, the mPFC has been shown to display functional connectivity to other brain regions such as in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporoparietal junction during social tasks (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">McCormick et al., 2018</xref>). It is thus important to examine the functional connectivity from mPFC to other brain regions in infant-friendly, social perceptual, and social cognitive tasks.</p><p>Second, while the existing evidence suggests that mPFC function in infants is specialized in processing social cues, it is currently unclear what role more domain-general learning mechanisms might play in accounting for this specialization. For example, a recent study showed that, in infant as young as 3&#x02005;months of age, mPFC exhibited increased activity in response to structured versus random sequences of (nonsocial) visual stimuli, particularly during the second half of exposure to the structured sequences (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2021</xref>). This learning-related activity in the mPFC is consistent with its role in learning and memory processes in adults, suggesting that the mPFC, in concert with the hippocampus, supports statistical learning of nonsocial stimuli infancy. In this context, it is important to note that in a large meta-analysis of adult fMRI studies (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert et al., 2006</xref>), memory processes were associated with more lateral activations of the mPFC, whereas studies involving social cognition (perspective taking and mentalizing) were associated with more medial activations of mPFC. In future research, it will thus be important to assess and contrast statistical learning for social compared with nonsocial stimuli to determine whether social processing recruits specific subsections of the mPFC in infancy.</p><p>Third, while existing work suggests that mPFC plays a role in predictive processing (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mento et al., 2022</xref>), it remains to be seen whether mPFC modulates activity in posterior (face-selective) brain regions in a top&#x02013;down manner as seen in adults using dynamic causal modeling from fMRI (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Summerfield et al., 2006</xref>). While top&#x02013;down cortical modulation in posterior brain regions has been studied in infants using fNIRS (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Emberson et al., 2015</xref>), to date, there are no studies including measures from mPFC, which will be a critical extension of existing research.</p><p>Fourth, fMRI research with adults indicates that there are anatomically distinct subsections of the mPFC that map onto partly distinct processes involved in social perception, cognition, and behavior (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bzdok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lieberman et al., 2019</xref>). It is thus important to more precisely map social functions in mPFC during infancy using high-resolution techniques, now also available for fNIRS (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Collins-Jones et al., 2024</xref>), which is more infant-friendly than fMRI in its application as it is less restrictive in terms of noise, movement, etc. while allowing for a testing environment that better approximates infants&#x02019; real-life social experiences. Employing a high-resolution mapping approach to mPFC function and systematically comparing between social and nonsocial conditions across age during infancy in future research will enable the examination of functional specialization (domain-specificity) for processing social information.</p><p>Fifth, current evidence suggests that mPFC coupling (intersubject correlation) between infants and adults during social interactions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Piazza et al., 2020</xref>) reflects a shared neural state, but the precise functional significance of this coupling remains to be fully understood. One possibility is that neural coupling in mPFC plays a critical role in shaping real-time social interactions, actively facilitating shared attention and communication. Alternatively, it may primarily reflect a correlate of shared experience, without exerting a causal influence on interaction dynamics. Future work should explore whether individual differences in mPFC coupling predict specific aspects of social exchanges, such as turn-taking, joint attention, or responsiveness, which could help clarify its mechanistic role. Additionally, experimental designs that manipulate the degree of interactional contingency (e.g., live vs prerecorded or delayed interactions) could provide further insights into whether mPFC coupling drives, rather than merely reflects, social coordination. Given the foundational role of the mPFC in social cognition from early infancy (see <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grossmann, 2013</xref>, for a review), understanding the functional relevance of neural coupling in this region will be crucial for advancing theories of early social brain development.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the current opinion suggests that the mPFC appears to serve as a key region in the human brain playing a multifaceted role in social perception, cognition, and behavior from early in human ontogeny. This supports the notion that humans are extraordinarily social primates (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Tomasello et al., 2012</xref>), whose brains have evolved to actively learn, adapt, and benefit from living in interdependent, cooperative, and complex cultural groups.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Amodio</surname>

Specifically, the authors propose that mPFC:</p><p>1) plays a specialized, proactive and evaluative role in social perception</p><p>2) is involved in coupling with other minds while interacting and when watching other minds interact</p><p>3) predicts overt social behavior beyond infancy</p><p>However, there are several open questions that the authors do not address and that leave me confused about the main claims the authors are trying to make. Further, it is not clear that their hypothesis is supported given the cited literature. Finally, the authors do not engage in any possible alternative accounts of the reported literature. The authors need to make significant updates to the manuscript to address these problems.</p><p>First, the main claim that mPFC is a social hub in early infancy is not supported by the data presented. The strongest empirical work that the authors have to support their claims are that mPFC activity in older infants is correlated with behavior (social interaction in Piazza et al., 2020, differential looking times in Krol &#x00026;Grossmann, 2020, and later emerging social measures in Grossmann &#x00026;Allison 2024). However, there is a lot of developmental change, both behaviorally and anatomically, between early infancy (neonates cited in Buiatti et al., 2019 and 2-month-olds cited in Kosakowski et al., 2024) and later infancy (9-15 months in Piazza et al., 2020; 11-months in Krol &#x00026;Grossman, 2023; Grossman &#x00026;Allison, 2024). For example, there are several theories that infants' looking to faces early in infancy can be explained as a salience response (Several papers by Johnson and colleagues). The authors themselves cite Ellis et al, 2021, which is empirical evidence that supports the salience hypothesis over the social hypothesis. Further, there are known anatomical connections between mPFC and subcortical structures (e.g., Roberts et al., 2007; Eblen &#x00026;Graybiel, 1995; and many others) that are thought to support salience detection in human and non-human primates (e.g., Seeley, 2017). Behaviorally, empirical work shows that young infants will look for similar amounts of time to salient objects and faces (e.g., Kwon et al., 2016). Thus, it is completely possible that face responses in mPFC of young infants are in-fact salience responses and not at all social in nature.</p><p>The future directions section is also quite confusing. What do the authors mean when they say the "mPFC has been shown to operate in concert with other brain regions such as the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo-parietal junction during social tasks" and how is this relevant to the claims the authors are trying to make? Why does "rest-state measurement of functional brain network connectivity" matter at all? Especially in infancy?</p><p>The authors state that "mPFC modules activity in posterior brain regions in a top-down manner .. in adults." What does this statement mean and how is it relevant to the hypothesis that mPFC is a social hub in infancy?</p><p>Finally, the authors themselves point out that, "fMRI research with adults indicates that there are anatomically distinct subsections of the medial prefrontal cortex that map onto partly distinct processes involved in social perception, cognition and behavior..." Given the authors believe this, how can they make the claim that in infancy mPFC is a social hub? Do they think that mPFC starts as a so-called "social hub" and then divides into different anatomically distinct functions. Given they suggest that future research should use high resolution fNIRS, it doesn't seem like that is the claim they are trying to make. Rather, it seems like the authors believe that mPFC may already form anatomically distinct regions that support different functions, even early in infancy. If so, how is that idea consistent with the main claim that mPFC is a hub that supports social function in infancy?</p><p>Smaller points that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors never define what a hub is. The term "hub" has come to mean different things to different research groups where some focus on anatomical connections and others focus on functional integration. The authors use the work "hub" without defining it and without making a clear claim.</p><p>2) Please provide a reference for the claim that mPFC was:</p><p>"... previously thought to be underdeveloped in infancy..." and explain what you mean by it.</p><p>3) When citing Grossman (2013, 2015, and 2017), please make it clear that they are opinions/reviews, not empirical papers.</p><p>4) Deen et al., 2017 did not observe "face-selective" responses. "selective" generally means that the responses to one condition is greater than the response to every other condition. Deen and colleagues report a face response that is greater than the response to scenes but they never report if the face response is also greater than the responses to bodies and objects. Further, the authors themselves do not claim to find "face-selective" responses in mPFC. (See supplementary Figure 5 from Deen et al., 2017)</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Eblen, F., &#x00026;Graybiel, A. M.

MPFC has long been known to be involved in adult social cognition, and over the past ~15-20 years more and more evidence has shown that mPFC is also involved in social perception and cognition during infancy. This opinion paper particularly focuses on work from the last ~5-6 years that together provide a more detailed understanding of the role of mPFC in infant social cognition, and point to more sophistication of mPFC function in infancy than previously assumed. While this opinion piece does not put forth a completely novel idea, I do think that it clearly summarizes recent relevant work and synthesizes current understanding of the role of mPFC in social cognition in infancy.</p><p>Comments to the Authors (Required)</p><p>The authors provide a timely opinion piece focused on recent neuroimaging evidence (from fNIRS, EEG, and fMRI) that points to a sophisticated role of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in infant social cognition. They focus on three lines of evidence - (1) that infant mPFC plays a specialized role in social perception, (2) that infant mPFC is involved in "coupling with other minds" during interaction, and (3) that infant mPFC predicts social behavior beyond infancy - to make the claim that mPFC is a "hub" for social cognition early in development.</p><p>Overall, I found the paper clear, compelling, and timely. I have minor comments that the authors may wish to consider in the revision.</p><p>* I think this line would benefit from references: "While previously though to be underdeveloped... such as faces and voices" (lines 33-34) [unless this is is referring to references in the previous sentence?]</p><p>* The Piazza et al (2020) study looked at infant-adult neural coupling, but the adult was not the child's caregiver - I believe they had the same adult experimenter for all of the dyads. This should be fixed in line 81 of the paper which says that "mPFC responses were coupled with their caregiver's mPFC responses"</p><p>* I find the mPFC neural coupling evidence both relevant and interesting, and perhaps also worth mentioning in the "future directions" section because I think there are many unanswered questions. Does neural coupling mean that mPFC is playing a "critical role" in these interactions, or merely reflecting something about the shared experience? Do differences in neural coupling in mPFC predict features of the interaction? While I certainly think it means something that this similarity in processing happens in mPFC, the actual interpretation of what neural coupling means from a mechanistic standpoint is not completely clear (not a criticism of this paper, but just a general open question).</p><p>* With such a short paper, it is not possible to fully flesh out each line of evidence, but I felt that the third line of evidence (infant mPFC predicts social behavior beyond infancy) was a bit underdeveloped in terms of the overall argument. Is there a hypothesized developmental mechanism here, or is the claim about mPFC activity being a biomarker for "sociability"? Not critical to address if it doesn't fit into this short paper, but was left wondering about this piece of evidence in the broader scope of this opinion piece.</p><p>* I wonder whether the authors have room to slightly expand on this claim: "also contests recent proposals, asserting developmental discontinuity between infants' and adults' brain functioning" (line 132) - fine if not, but I agree that this evidence makes a compelling case for developmental continuity of mPFC.</p><p>* I think that the open questions section is a strength of this paper, identifying clear next steps for research in this domain.</p></sec></back></article>
