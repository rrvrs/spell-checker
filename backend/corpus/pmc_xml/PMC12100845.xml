The purpose of this systematic review is to identify preventative behavioural interventions that reduce health inequities or inequalities and to analyse which theoretical domains have been used in the intervention design and implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Behavioural interventions that reduced health inequities and inequalities were identified with use of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Interventions that were aimed at individuals within the axes of inequality and used the TDF in the design and implementation met our inclusion criteria. Periodicals indexed in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library databases were selected to undertake this review. Grey literature was sought from UK local government organisations, as the sector with significant influence over these determinants. A minimum of two independent reviewers used standardised methods to search, screen, critically appraise and synthesise included studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">This systematic review identified a total of 41 articles which includes <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;33 primary studies and <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8 local government reports of behavioural interventions that reduce inequalities for populations within the axes of inequality. Most of the evidence demonstrated that behavioural interventions significantly improved health outcomes and contributed towards positive behavioural changes in health and well-being. A large proportion of the evidence base consist of interventions focusing on diet and exercise uptake (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) specifically aimed at ethnic minorities and those of immigrants and refugee status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Most of the included studies incorporated elements from contemporary behavioural theory. Most health interventions identified in this review included a component to raise awareness and educate their target audience. However, whilst there was often an evidenced based rationale for use of a preventative behavioural intervention, specific frameworks were rarely used to align problems with solutions in a theoretically defined manner.</p></sec><sec><title>PROSPERO registration</title><p id="Par5">CRD42024553898.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Health promotion</kwd><kwd>Behavioural intervention</kwd><kwd>Theoretical domains framework</kwd><kwd>COM-B</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Gender inequalities</kwd><kwd>Ill housed</kwd><kwd>Low socioeconomic status</kwd><kwd>Poverty</kwd><kwd>Ethnic minorities</kwd><kwd>Economically disadvantaged</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Behavioural Science Unit of Public Health Wales provided funding to support this systematic review.

The Marmot review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] highlighted the connection between wider determinants of health and health inequalities, which have been exacerbated by over a decade of austerity measures. Vulnerable populations and individuals with protected characteristics exhibit a reduced health span compared to the most affluent in society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many communities with shared protected characteristics, such as race, disability, geography, and gender, experience high levels of multiple deprivation, which are often intergenerational and a precursor to unmet needs and inequities in health and social care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In England, there is a 19-year discrepancy in healthy life expectancy between individuals of high and low socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Wales, this discrepancy is 8 and 9&#x000a0;years for females and males, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Poorer people spend a greater proportion of their life in poor health than people living in less socioeconomic hardship. In Wales, the disparity in healthy life expectancy of males and females in the most and least deprived areas is 20 and 17 years, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Tobacco use, poor diet, problematic alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity are the primary behavioural factors that contribute to years of life lost or spent in poor health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Altering these factors and designing effective preventative behaviour change interventions is key to improving health and health outcomes for the population as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Behaviours that foster good health and health span while preventing illness are crucial for the future well-being of societies and for reducing the financial burden on public sector services. This is the objective of establishing effective life-course health opportunity architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], though many conventional interventions adhere to a restricted medical model, overlooking key social determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As such, the aim of this systematic review was to identify in the existing literature preventative behavioural interventions that were designed to reduce health inequities or inequalities. Furthermore, the review sought to categorise these behavioural interventions in a systematic and informative manner, as outlined below, in order to inform the design and role of future behaviour change approaches to reducing inequalities and inequity.</p><p id="Par9">From a theoretical perspective, an overarching consensus has gradually emerged in recent years to acknowledge at least two classes of behavioural processes, and hence to explore and understand how they function, integrate and compete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This dual-process approach ostensibly distinguishes between rapid, intuitive processes (type or system 1) and slower cognitive processes (type 2), with the former likely to drive behaviour in a conflicting situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Health and behavioural science researchers have developed theories of behaviour, and behaviour change, based on some mix of these multiple processes and many such theories have proliferated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whilst behaviour change is likely more effective when based on evidenced-based theory and principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], many applied approaches to real-world challenges are either atheoretical, employ overlapping constructs, or use different terminology for the same construct. Michie aimed to reach a consensus by developing a theoretical domains framework (TDF) to capture a definitive set of relevant constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This approach included a &#x02018;behaviour change wheel&#x02019; built upon the foundation of the TDF domains such that three key behavioural drivers emerge: motivation, opportunity and capability. The combination of these three drivers determines eventual behaviour, hence COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation =&#x02009;Behaviour) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As an example, one TDF construct is Knowledge, which encapsulates the way education, information and awareness raising can influence decisions and behaviour. This construct falls primarily within the Capability element of COM-B and would predominantly engage cognitive processes from a dual-process perspective. The TDF construct of Skills encompasses both motor skills, sometimes termed habits or routines, as well as cognitive skills and the development of cognitive schema. These would fall predominantly under intuitive and automatic processes from a dual-process theory perspective. The relationship between TDF and COM-B was captured by Atkins (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) focusing on behaviour change and implementation challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Researchers are increasingly adopting and validating the TDF in health and behaviour change research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and this review sought to identify its value in the context of health inequalities and inequities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The relationship between Theoretical Domains Framework and Capability, Opportunity, Motivation =&#x02009;Behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2025_22740_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><p id="Par10">Keywords were selected to identify adult and child populations pertaining to various axes of inequality, such as health promotion, intervention strategies, prevention methods, gender disparities, inadequate housing, low socioeconomic status, poverty, and ethnic minority groups. A comprehensive search strategy was developed based on these terms and adjusted with the use of database MeSH lists. Searches were limited to articles published in English language from 2014 to 2024 and within OECD context. Periodicals indexed in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library databases were chosen for this review. Grey literature was sought from UK organisations with a significant influence on wider determinants of health, such as Local Government Association, the Behavioural Science and Public Health Network, and the Behavioural Science Unit websites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A backward citation search was conducted, scrutinising the reference lists of all included studies to ensure that no relevant literature was missed. To ensure that evidence unintentionally making use of the TDF was not overlooked, the definition of'behavioural interventions'was purposefully broad, and specific behavioural terms were omitted from the search. The eligibility criteria is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>which incorporates an extended version of the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) structure. Searches were completed on 25 th May 2024. The full MEDLINE search strategy is available in searchRxiv data repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

(<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;= 5). The identified grey literature reports appeared more likely to base their design on the TDF (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;= 5), suggesting either that the framework has been more readily adopted by sectors such as local governments and the third sector or that the TDF remains in the early stages of adoption as a mainstream academic structure upon which to design behavioural interventions for health-focused research. Only one primary study designed an intervention explicitly based on theory: Filippone and colleagues implemented social cognitive and asset theories in their intervention to deliver health and mental health disability services to women of low socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. All studies employed a combination of techniques in composite or stacked interventions to maximise impact. None of the studies systematically identified the most effective components.</p><p id="Par18">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> illustrates that a key component of most interventions was enhancing participants'knowledge and capabilities through education and awareness, alongside the development of cognitive and physical skills. A smaller portion concentrated on behavioural regulation, emphasising the management of needs and the importance of inhibitory control in decision-making. Around half of the studies recognised the importance of the physical environment (opportunity) in influencing behaviour and sought to either redesign the context to support target behaviours or to help participants understand the risks and benefits of different environments. Some studies aimed to employ normative social information to subtly influence target behaviours, including peer influence and the utilisation of role models. Some interventions focused on identity and the abilities of target individuals such as focusing on self-efficacy, beliefs about capabilities, and personal identity. Others assisted participants in goal setting, behavioural planning, interpreting intents, and overcoming obstacles. Finally, a large variety of techniques were used to increase target behaviours using motivational interventions, ranging from motivational interviewing to providing direct incentives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Educational interventions</title><p id="Par19">A key theme identified was the emphasis on advancing educational interventions. Ten studies were identified in this domain.</p><p id="Par20">Two studies investigated diabetes support within ethnic minority populations. The STAR MAMA program targeted low-income Latina women with gestational diabetes and overweight status during pregnancy. Participants in the intervention group were provided information via an automated telephone support system and health coaching calls. The material included health themes related to postpartum care and prevention focused health themes, such as diet, exercise, breastfeeding, mood, and infant care, aimed at promoting behaviours that reduce the risk of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A case study by Hughes and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] aimed to enhance health outcomes in two Chicago neighbourhoods primarily populated by Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black residents, where diabetes prevalence was 10%, surpassing the national average of 7%, due to inadequate insurance coverage. The intervention employed a home-based strategy for managing and educating individuals regarding their lifestyle choices. A community health worker delivered diabetes education and supported individuals in formulating personalised behavioural objectives. Both studies reported improvements in health outcomes, notably a decrease in body weight among mothers in the intervention group, as noted by Hughes and colleagues.</p><p id="Par21">Five educational interventions were designed to increase HIV knowledge with elements of risk reduction, health education and navigation, financial literacy and empowerment, and adopting protective behaviours. These interventions focused on a diverse population of socially and economically disadvantaged persons such as incarcerated black men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], black and Latina women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], incarcerated women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], female sex workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and underserved and hard to reach groups such as ethnically diverse men who have sex with men and transgender women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The interventions demonstrated positive outcomes, including enhanced access to appropriate care and a reduction in missed health care appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; financial empowerment, increased optimism related to employability prospects, and greater social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The study conducted by Tanner and colleagues observed a self-reported reduction in sexual partners alongside an increase in sexual health education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Sandwell Council investigated the application of behavioural science in improving COVID- 19 vaccine acceptance in workplace settings. Unvaccinated individuals were provided with information presented within a behavioural framework. Individuals who received vaccinations were exposed to behaviourally framed messages aimed at promoting advocacy for increased vaccination uptake. Behavioural treatments did not significantly influence vaccination behaviour or the emergence of vaccination advocacy. The study identified significant beliefs and attitudes related to vaccinations that are associated with vaccine hesitancy. Concerns included possible side effects, beliefs about the ineffectiveness of vaccination, and scepticism about the risks associated with COVID- 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">A trial designed to influence consumer decision-making and decrease sugar intake in Liverpool implemented stop signs on high-sugar chilled drinks in two hospital stores, resulting in a 7.3% reduction in sales of high-sugar beverages. During the period when signs were displayed, there was a slight increase in sales of lower sugar alternatives, suggesting that consumers substituted high sugar beverages with these options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">An initiative aimed to influence behaviour change by improving health literacy among Syrian refugee women living in Turkey. A RCT was performed to evaluate the efficacy of health educational materials to improve knowledge and awareness about mammography, Pap smear tests, self-breast examinations, and HPV vaccination for breast and cervical cancer.

All three studies evidenced an improvement in the preventative behaviours of parents.</p><p id="Par27">Two studies aimed to examine attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours related to healthcare and enhance participation in NHS Health Check programmes. One was community-based, incorporating outreach events and was designed in a user-centred approach with an Afro-Caribbean community in England. The second study was aimed at men aged 40&#x02013;59 in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of Northeast London. The intervention involved an SMS invitation for the NHS Health Check, containing a link to a voice note utilising the principle of'people like you'. Patients were identified by name; specific terminology was employed, including phrases such as"You are at the top of the queue"and"A spot has been reserved for you,"and the objectives of the Health Checks were clearly articulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. NHS health checks motivate attendees to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. Additionally, these health checks enabled attendees to engage with healthcare professionals about further health issues and promoted social interaction by encouraging discussions of test results among peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Three e-health interventions were identified that employed a combination of telephone calls, emails, and text messages to promote attendance at health appointments. Two studies examined older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. An additional intervention focused on individuals facing multiple deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. All three interventions resulted in increased appointment attendance rates relative to control groups without contact. A further e-health intervention employed the situated Information, Motivation, Behavioural Skills (sIMB) model to inform the development of an interactive text messaging service targeting Latina parents during their child's first year of life. The model enabled the creation of intervention components aimed at improving parental information, motivation, and behaviours that foster engagement with healthcare. The components were adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics influencing Latino families, considering personal, cultural, situational, and structural dimensions. The intervention group exhibited a reduction in Emergency Department (ED) utilisation and an enhancement in flu vaccine uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">A pre-post study aimed to identify key barriers to colon cancer screening uptake and to develop evidence-based strategies for targeted interventions. This included reminder letters sent by General Practitioners (GPs) to patients who did not respond to their invitation from the national screening program was supplemented with two behavioural strategies:"anticipated regret messaging"&#x02014;prompting individuals to contemplate the potential emotional consequences of receiving a late diagnosis&#x02014;and offering entry into a lottery as an incentive for undergoing screening. There was a significant rise in the number of patients who returned their screening kit after receiving the letter, with the highest rate observed during the 6&#x000a0;weeks after the letter's delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Five studies evaluated interventions to improve physical activity, including motivational interviewing following a health age assessment within a rural Australian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. An active travel initiative employed a mixture of strategies such as motivating statements, goal setting and planning in order to replace car journeys with walking or cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. An exercise and sport intervention among individuals residing in a refugee camp in Greece was designed according to self-determination theory, which highlights psychological needs such as autonomy, competence and relatedness. Motivational strategies were employed through an internal chat group and direct interactions. Participants demonstrated intrinsic motivation via autonomy, with positive feedback improving competence and facilitating opportunities for social connection, thus promoting relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Nudges, such as in-app push notifications, significantly enhanced all outcomes within a six-week walking program aimed at low socioeconomic and inactive populations integrated components of the COM-B model with behavioural concepts including goal setting, commitment, social comparison, and motivational feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Long- and short-term behavioural change was evident in the majority of these studies. However, a walking program that was based on the trans-theoretical and socio-cognitive models of behaviour change and utilised motivational interviewing and goal setting to reduce sedentary behaviour among individuals with intellectual disabilities was unsuccessful. This was partly attributed to the challenges of creating a behaviour change intervention for adults with intellectual disabilities that complies with guidelines for interventions targeting disadvantaged groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Two interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity and nutritional education were implemented for children from immigrant families. Both interventions included a behavioural change or training component and employed family-based, culturally relevant strategies to promote healthier lifestyles in disadvantaged communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Soltero and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] observed a significant reduction in parental weight, stable weight in children, and an improvement in the quality of life for both parents and children. Although there was a decrease in physical activity and no notable difference in fruit and vegetable consumption in the intervention conducted by Kobel and colleagues, there was a significant reduction in screen media and soft drink consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">An overwhelming amount of evidence of behavioural interventions aimed at smoking cessation was identified. Four studies that explicitly stated the use of behavioural methods in the intervention were included. Three of these studies focused on individuals of low socioeconomic status and employed a variety of methods, including nicotine replacement therapy, telephone quit lines, community referrals, counselling, and extensively validated therapeutic modalities, which encompassed pharmacological interventions, skill training, and group support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Gilbody and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] conducted a study on individuals with severe mental illness, utilising modified behavioural support and pharmacological interventions specifically designed for this demographic.

CHWs interacted with individuals via goal-setting exercises, personalised action plan development, and motivational interviewing to tackle issues such as food insecurity, rental assistance, medical care, and transportation to appointments. This was accomplished by assisting residents in collecting necessary documentation, guiding them to appropriate agencies, scheduling appointments, facilitating applications for emergency rental assistance, and coordinating transportation.

This review aimed to identify the existing evidence of preventative behavioural interventions that reduce health inequities or inequalities and to analyse which theoretical domains had been used in the intervention design and implementation.</p><p id="Par43">Since the COVID- 19 pandemic, there has been a rejuvenation in interest in the role of behavioural science in&#x000a0;supporting improvements in health, whether through treatment and rehabilitation (e.g. behavioural adherence) or in preventative measures. Nonetheless, this review identified a mix of studies from the recent decade that utilised behavioural techniques to reduce inequity. For example, goal-setting and motivational interviewing have been shown to empower individuals to achieve self-determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Several interventions equipped participants with the tools and resources to navigate the health system autonomously, minimise risk, or develop coping methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">A specific objective of this review was to determine if studies were purposefully designed with a specific behavioural theory in mind or favoured one type of intervention approach over another. Most health interventions included a component to raise awareness and educate their target audience with a view to prevention of avoidable ill&#x000a0;health, disability and&#x000a0;premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This would seem a logical and necessary first step in changing behaviour. Although the &#x02018;nudge&#x02019; approach, popularised in the 2000 s by Thaler and Sunstein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], advocates a more subtle and non-conscious, or implicit, approach to behaviour change, it appears that such an approach does not appear to have noticeably made it into mainstream research in this domain. Conversely, it has been adopted as an approach to influence clinical behaviours in healthcare settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. However, most interventions were multi-component and often combined education with other elements that could be defined as engaging the autonomic system&#x02014;such as cognitive or physical training to establish new skills or habits. The majority of studies created interventions that combined techniques from all three overarching categories of the theoretical domains (COM), though none framed their intervention designs in those terms. While several studies were based on evidence-based approaches, such as mindfulness or CBT, few provided a theoretical basis for the rationale behind implementing such approaches or how they fit with other elements of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This may reflect a lack of input from academia in real-world implementation studies, demonstrating a gap in &#x02018;capability&#x02019; around behavioural science theory and practice.</p><p id="Par45">Several papers identified in the initial search explicitly referenced COM-B or the theoretical domains framework; however, these primarily described intervention designs rather than fully delivered and evaluated studies. The grey literature indicates the explicit application of TDF and COM-B in intervention design, suggesting that this framework is gaining traction. It is noteworthy that the majority of studies employed interventions that integrated components from all three theoretical domains. The prevalent combinations included goal setting, motivational interviewing, and planning, alongside beliefs regarding consequences or abilities from the Motivational category; normative influences derived from peer interactions or role modelling within the Opportunities category; and education, behaviour regulation, and skill training (cognitive and physical) from the Capability category. Common behaviour change techniques involved promoting intrinsic motivation and personal autonomy, grounded in self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], alongside approaches to improve self-efficacy and confidence in personal abilities. Approaches categorised as opportunities involved identifying suitable contexts for facilitating change, e.g., community centres for treatment and employing peer support, including community support, to share cultural norms and role model appropriate health behaviours, e.g., vaccination uptake. Therapeutic approaches, including CBT or mindfulness, were integrated with other behaviour change interventions to specifically address mental health challenges while promoting positive change. Given that behaviour is often triggered automatically by stimuli in the environment, several studies used technological solutions to prime target behaviours, such as the use of in-app push notifications, text messages, or telephone calls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">A key strength of basing an intervention in theory is that the analysis of the problem can lead to insights into potential successful solutions. If a barrier to the target activity is recognised as a lack of opportunity, such as insufficient access to a community centre, the solution design might focus on improving that opportunity. None of the reviewed studies employed the COM-B model or the TDFs to align the issue with the offered solutions. None of the studies identified in this review specifically attempted this kind of process in matching the problem space with the solution space in a theoretically defined manner. Many of the interventions acknowledged the likely problem causes, i.e., numerous target groups were recognised as lacking knowledge or awareness of the desired behaviours. Although there was frequently an evidence-based rationale for the application of interventions, e.g., CBT or Mindfulness, there was a lack of consideration regarding how theoretical domains might map between problem behaviours and solutions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par47">To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of interventions to reduce health inequities that are&#x000a0;underpinned by behavioural science theory. This review identified a substantial evidence base comprising a variety of high-quality study designs and methods, facilitating a thorough overview of the topic. All studies employed methods consistent with the TDF, though only a few explicitly cited the formal TDF framework. The identified grey literature reports used the TDF in their design, suggesting either an increasing adoption of the framework by the third sector, including local governments, or a limited mainstream acceptance of the TDF as a foundational structure for designing behavioural interventions in health-related research. All studies used a combination of techniques; however, none systematically identified the most effective components. While evidence-based rationale for interventions like CBT or Mindfulness was often present, there was insufficient consideration of how theoretical domains could align between problematic behaviours and their respective solutions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par48">The relevant JBI Checklists were used to assess the quality of the included articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. However, as the TDF is validated for its use in behaviour change and implementation research, we utilised this as a marker of quality in which to critically examine the use of theory (see Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and implementation within each intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Whilst the eligibility criteria for this review were constructed with the aims and objectives of the review in mind, due to the lack of available tools, there is a possibility that selection bias may have occurred in the additional screening stage when selecting studies that had utilised or implemented theory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Implications for policy and practice</title><p id="Par49">Most interventions were multi-component, integrating teaching with additional elements that engaged the automatic system, including cognitive or physical exercise to develop new skills or habits. Most studies employed methods from all three overarching categories of the theoretical domains (COM-B), though none framed their intervention designs in those terms. Although numerous studies incorporated evidence-based approaches, including mindfulness and cognitive-behavioural therapy, few provided a theoretical basis for the rationale behind the implementation of these approaches or their integration with other intervention components. This may reflect a lack of academic input in real-world implementation studies, demonstrating a gap in &#x02018;capability&#x02019; around behavioural science theory and policy design and implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par50">This systematic review found substantial evidence of preventative behavioural interventions that aimed to reduce inequities among populations affected by various axes. Evidence indicates that interventions significantly enhanced health outcomes and facilitated positive behavioural changes in health and well-being. Most of the studies analysed integrated components from all three theoretical domains into interventions, with explicit use of the TDF and COM-B frameworks most evident in the grey literature. Health interventions examined in this review incorporated elements aimed at increasing awareness and educating their target audience within the sphere of preventing avoidable ill&#x000a0;health, disability and premature death. Despite the presence of an evidence-based rationale for the use of an intervention, neither the COM-B model nor the TDF was employed to systematically align problems with solutions in a theoretically defined way. A prudent future strategy would be to increase capability and capacity in applied behavioural science in order to optimise the impact and efficacy of targeted preventative health interventions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre and the Bangor Institute of Medical and Health Research for their dedication to methodological rigour, training and information transfer, which was utilised in the development of this review.
