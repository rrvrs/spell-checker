R focuses on linking perception with action, where AI plays a crucial role in ensuring this connection is intelligent. Therefore, these two fields complement one another while fulfilling distinct functions. Robotics is a technological discipline that involves the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, whereas AI is a segment of computer science dedicated to creating programs that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. AI algorithms can address learning, perception, problem-solving, language comprehension, and/or logical reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">AI has expanded rapidly in our everyday experiences: we rely on Google&#x02019;s smart search, voice recognition in iPhone personal assistants, knowledge management, and applications like City Mapper to navigate cities effectively. ChatGPT, a prominent large language model, has recently attracted attention and is achieving global recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">A report released in 2020 indicates that dental AI facilitates rapid task completion, precise diagnosis via logical decision-making, and the standardization of procedures. It is anticipated to become increasingly tailored to fulfill user requirements and enhance convenience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In recent years, deep learning systems have emerged as one of the AI methods utilized for various clinical tasks. They have proven to be effective across multiple domains for automated diagnosis based on images, as well as in the design of removable partial dentures, management of temporomandibular disorders, orthognathic treatment, analysis of root morphology, assessment of periodontal diseases, detection of oral cancer, evaluation of radiolucent lesions, cephalometric analysis, and the debonding process of CAD/CAM crowns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Recently, robots designed for dental applications have been created. For instance, realistic human-like robots used for training in dentistry are known as &#x0201c;phantoms,&#x0201d; while robots used for treatment encompass Simroid, nanorobots, implant robots, endo micro-robots, robotic dental drills, and orthodontic arch wire bending robots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Dental robots have been shown to enhance the accuracy of various dental procedures across all branches of dentistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Artificial intelligence-driven simulators create realistic, interactive settings for students to practice procedures like tooth preparation and arrangement. These virtual exercises provide instant feedback, promoting skill enhancement without requiring direct patient engagement. Additionally, AI systems can assess student work, including radiographic evaluations or cavity preparations. By integrating artificial intelligence, the burden on educators can be reduced, and educational expenses can be lowered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The increasing use of AI applications in clinical care, research, and education is evident in the growing interest in training medical students on this subject. Various organizations have suggested that healthcare workers should be educated in areas such as AI, data sourcing and safety, ethics, and the critical evaluation and interpretation of AI tools in healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Considering this ongoing AI transformation, it is essential to ensure that both current and future clinical professionals are informed about the capabilities of this emerging technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is a growing recognition that dental students need to be educated about AI technologies. As a result, it will be necessary to survey dental undergraduate students to gather their opinions and views on the potential impact of AI in dentistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Amiri et al., 2024 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] performed a systematic review and meta-analysis that offered insights into the attitudes, knowledge, and skills of medical, dental, and nursing students regarding artificial intelligence, involving 5789 participants from 24 different studies. In general, 44% of the students displayed a medium to high understanding of AI applications and principles. However, many students possessed minimal knowledge about artificial intelligence. While students exhibited moderate levels of knowledge, they typically held positive views towards AI, with 65% of all students agreeing with incorporating AI in medicine and having a favorable perspective.</p><p id="Par13">Several studies conducted in Egypt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Saudi Arabia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and South Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] have assessed dental students&#x02019; knowledge of AI. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study that evaluates the understanding of both R and AI among dental students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. No study has been done about Egyptian dental students&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes regarding the employment of R technology and AI in the dental field. Therefore, this study aimed to assess Egyptian dental students&#x02019; Knowledge, perception, and attitude toward the role of robotics and artificial intelligence in dental practices.

The current study aims to evaluate Egyptian dental students&#x02019; knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes toward using R and AI in dentistry.</p><p id="Par45">In this study, the selected sample consisted of dental students, as the younger dentists are likely to be more comfortable with using technology and more inclined to support the integration of AI and related technologies in clinical practice. They believe these advancements can improve the quality of work and make procedures easier than traditional dental methods. Additionally, they see the availability of such technologies as prestigious and trustworthy in the clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It remains uncertain if the current curriculum is preparing dental students for the integration of R and AI in their future practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">In the presented study, 53.7% of the participants were female, while 46.3% were male. This distribution is consistent with the findings of Y&#x000fc;zba&#x0015f;&#x00131;o&#x0011f;lu, 2020 and Elchaghaby and Wahby, 2025. The study participants were 54.3% of fourth-year students and 45.7% of fifth-year students. Several studies have included students from various grades; for instance, Elchaghaby and Wahby, 2025 selected students from the third, fourth, and fifth years, while Y&#x000fc;zba&#x0015f;&#x00131;o&#x0011f;lu, 2020 included students from all five grades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this study, only fourth and fifth-year students were selected because, according to the Egyptian curriculum, they are considered clinical-year students and are knowledgeable about the theoretical and clinical aspects of different dental fields.</p><p id="Par47">Among the study participants, 85.8% were familiar with R and AI technologies in dentistry. This finding is consistent with the results of Y&#x000fc;zba&#x0015f;&#x00131;o&#x0011f;lu 2020 and Abouzeid et al. 2021, who found that 78.9% and 83.7% of the participants, respectively, were familiar with AI technologies in dentistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This consistency may refer to the fact that both study participants were students, and the younger generations are more well-acquainted with recent technologies.</p><p id="Par48">Most of the study participants had heard about AI and robotics in dentistry; however, only 41% could differentiate between the two. This finding is consistent with the results of Krishnaprakash et al., 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], who found that half of the participants understood the distinction between the technologies. Conversely, only 7% of Saudi students in the study by Abouzeid et al., 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were able to identify the differences. These discrepancies may stem from differences in educational curriculum between various countries.</p><p id="Par49">About 57% of the students indicated that R could aid in diagnosis and treatment planning, while 69.7% recognized its role in measuring patients&#x02019; vital signs. These findings align with those of Abouzeid et al. 2023, who reported that 60.6% had similar insights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to Elchaghaby and Wahby, 2025, 49.7% of students believe that AI will be helpful in diagnosis, while 24.7% think that AI will be beneficial in treatment plans. Although this study was also conducted with Egyptian students, the lower results in the Elchaghaby and Wahby study may be attributed to the fact that 21% of the participants were in their third year, which could indicate that they have less knowledge compared to senior students.</p><p id="Par50">Misdiagnosis poses significant challenges in dental practice, as it can compromise the quality of care provided to patients. Subtle changes in a patient&#x02019;s condition may often go unnoticed by clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, the participants reported the effectiveness of AI in areas such as examination and interpretation, pathology, and tissue sampling. Additionally, they noted AI&#x02019;s role in detecting early-stage oral cancer, with percentages of 80.6%, 73.1%, and 68.6% respectively. These results followed Egyptian, Turkish, and Indian students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The results demonstrate dental students&#x02019; interest in new technologies like AI and their eagerness to learn.</p><p id="Par51">When study participants were asked if the use of R and AI is beneficial in dentistry, 72% of students expressed that they found AI and robotics exciting. Students from Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia expressed enthusiasm for these technologies, with 57%, 51%, and 47.3% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The lower responses in these studies may be due to differences in countries and the grades of the selected students, in addition to a shortage of attendance at workshops and conferences related to AI.</p><p id="Par52">Several students from different countries agreed that AI could be utilized across all branches of dentistry, particularly in surgery, prosthodontics, orthodontics, restorative treatments, and implantology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This consensus was also shared by the Egyptian students involved in this study. This may be due to students viewing robots as an appealing option for patient care in the clinics. They might believe that having a robot on-site would give patients the impression that the dentist is highly advanced and utilizes the latest technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">The application of surgical robots for tasks such as bone milling, drilling holes, making deep saw osteotomy cuts, and performing orthognathic surgery shows great promise. Micro endodontic robots have the potential to safely and accurately treat patients with root canal issues in and reliable manner. This technology could help reduce dependence on individual dentists&#x02019; skills and minimize human error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">A total of 66.9% of participants rejected the idea that R and AI could permanently replace dentists, which aligns with several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Deloitte&#x02019;s partnership with the Oxford Martin Institute indicates that AI may be able to automate 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. Nevertheless, replacing human positions with AI in the healthcare sector is more complicated because of the ethical concerns related to its application in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Unlike many other professions, it is evident that AI technology will have difficulty fully replacing medical professionals such as physicians or dentists. This is due to several factors, including the inability of AI to engage in meaningful conversations with patients, which are essential for building trust, providing reassurance, and showing empathy. Furthermore, while sensors can gather crucial data to support diagnosis, doctors will always be necessary to interpret complex cases, integrate patients&#x02019; medical histories, perform physical examinations, and engage in ongoing discussions with patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">A total of 56% of the students recommend treatment administered by robots, while 51% are willing to undergo such treatment themselves. These findings align with the studies conducted by Abouzeid et al., 2021 Krishnaprakash et al., 2023 and Alzahrani, 2024 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], However, Abouzeid et al. reported higher rates of recommendation and acceptance, at 83% and 84.5%, respectively. These discrepancies may be attributed to differences in countries, educational curriculum, and the characteristics of the study participants. Notably, approximately 41% of the participants in Abouzeid et al.&#x02018;s study were interns and postgraduate students, who tend to have more experience and familiarity with AI technology compared to undergraduate students.</p><p id="Par57">The application of R and AI in educational tools is rapidly growing, and the heightened enthusiasm among study participants to learn from robots is evident, as more than 50% of the students responded positively or neutrally about utilizing the robot simulation lab for training in restorative treatment, attending a lecture, or participating in a workshop led by a robot. Additionally, they concurred that receiving information from a teaching robot boosts their self-confidence, a conclusion supported by Abouzeid et al., 2021, and Krishnaprakash et al., 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">It is crucial to pay particular attention to R and AI in education, as an articulated curriculum should be established to enhance the role of robotics in teaching. Tailored curricula, educational resources, and training programs for teachers should be designed for various types of robotic technology and different levels of dentistry education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Over 60% of the participants at the university are open to using R and AI in their work. They believe that incorporating these technologies could improve their clinical practice and emphasize the necessity of transitioning to a secure digital environment that leverages AI applications. Furthermore, they advocate for the development of a healthcare system that utilizes the latest technologies. These findings are consistent with the research of Abouzeid et al. 2021 and Krishnaprakash et al., 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Almost 75% of students express interest in learning about R and AI in the future. Since education is a continuous process, it is essential to improve the curriculum and enhance the overall educational experience. the integration of R and AI in the dental field. Additionally, there should be a focus on the utilization of these technologies during dental workshops and conferences.</p><p id="Par61">In this study, no significant differences were found between males and females regarding their knowledge, perception, and attitude toward the subject. These findings align with those of Elchaghaby and Wahby 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A possible explanation for this outcome is that both genders are studying the same curriculum.</p><p id="Par62">However, there was a significant difference in attitudes toward the utilization of R and AI in dentistry based on students&#x02019; years of study. Fifth-year students exhibited a more positive attitude, which is consistent with the results of Y&#x000fc;zba&#x0015f;&#x00131;o&#x0011f;lu, 2020. This could be attributed to the fact that senior students are generally less apprehensive about new technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The null hypothesis was rejected because the study participants demonstrated good knowledge, positive perception, and attitude.</p><p id="Par63">Ultimately, it is important to emphasize the need for incorporating such topics into dental programs, along with proposing strategies to address the potential limitations of technology. Advocating for research and development of R and AI within dental education and its curriculum, as well as involving all stakeholders in the development process while ensuring a solid legal and ethical foundation, will be crucial for the success of the R and AI sector.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par64">This study had certain limitations. Firstly, the responses from dental students might not accurately reflect their actual knowledge and practices, as they may aim to present themselves as more competent individuals in their field. This could potentially result in the emergence of social desirability bias.</p><p id="Par65">The research was limited to Egypt, so varying educational curriculum and teaching methods in other countries may influence the findings. Furthermore, the participants chosen may not have adequately represented the overall population of dental students, given the low response rate to the Google form. Additionally, the questionnaire relied on self-reported data, which may not apply to all dental students in Egypt.</p><p id="Par66">Furthermore, since we focused solely on the attitudes of undergraduate dental students, it is possible that postgraduate students and even more experienced dentists do not share the same more optimistic perspectives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par67">Dental students possess a good understanding of and positive attitudes toward the use of R and AI in diagnosis and interpretation. They believe that AI can actively participate in various aspects of dental practice, including surgery, restorative treatment, and orthodontics. However, they are skeptical about the possibility of AI and robotics replacing dentists.</p><p id="Par68">The results offer important perspectives on the obstacles that AI researchers need to tackle and the potential applications of AI in dentistry.
