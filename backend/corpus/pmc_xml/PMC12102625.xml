The use of telenursing is increasing significantly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to treat and prevent chronic diseases. Telenursing is growing in many countries to reduce health care costs, increase the number of aging and chronically ill populations, and increase health care coverage to distant, rural, small, or sporadically populated regions. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help to solve increasing shortages of nurses, reduce distances, save travel time, and keep patients out of the hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this study is to apply the self-management telenursing program and telenursing system developed by the researchers to Bangladesh and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy (improved diabetes control in participants).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a pilot, quasi-experimental pre- and post-intervention study. Diabetes patients who will attend the Grameen Primary Health Centers (PHCs) in Bangladesh will be enrolled between September 2024 and August 2025. We include patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, both sexes, ages 18-75 years old, all types of treatment, willing to participate and give us consent. We exclude patients who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, diabetes as a secondary cause, complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is less than 7% for the past 1 year with CKD stage 1 or 2, no complications or complications with good control, having enough knowledge (had education before) and implemented good practice regarding diabetes management assessed by the research nurses, and disabled persons who need other person&#x02019;s support for daily living. The sample size was calculated and found 70. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. The study protocol got approval from the National Research Ethics Committee of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC/NREC/2022-2025/336) on September 08, 2024. The outcome of this study is to evaluate the effects of telenursing intervention by controlling HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The project was funded in 2024.

Globally, diabetes caused 1.6 million deaths and 47% of all deaths before the age of 70 years in 2021. Diabetes increases the risk of death from kidney and cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing over the last few decades in all countries and is considered a global epidemic [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], more quickly in low- and middle-income (LMICs) countries than in high-income countries. Moreover, diabetic treatment coverage was the lowest in the low- and middle-income range in 2022 [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is alarming that an estimated half of the global people (49.7%) living with diabetes remain undiagnosed [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Diabetes has acute complications including ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia. Chronic complications are macroangiopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and diabetic foot. Patients with diabetes are vulnerable to infections, myopathy, osteoporosis, arthropathies, and liver damage [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Patients with diabetes may be able to prevent or delay diabetic health problems by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, taking medicine regularly, and controlling blood glucose levels [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The use of telenursing is increasing significantly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to treat and prevent chronic diseases [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a field, it is part of telemedicine and has many points of contact with other medical and nonmedical applications, such as telediagnosis, teleconsultation, and telemonitoring. The field, however, is still being developed as the information on telenursing is not comprehensive enough [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Telenursing has been adopted by many developed and developing countries. It reduces health care costs and increases the coverage of health care to outreach, rural, small, or sporadically populated regions [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is useful for the increasing number of aging and chronically ill populations [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help solve increasing shortages of nurses [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; to reduce distances and save travel time and keep patients out of hospital [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A greater degree of job satisfaction has been registered among telenurses [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with diabetes by integrating diagnostic devices for 24-hour real-time data transmission [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and IBM Watson Health for personalized lifestyle optimization can help to identify and prevent the early appearance of diseases. It allows rural patients to receive personalized, high-quality care and improves health care access and outcomes [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Diabetes in Bangladesh</title><p>The prevalence of diabetes was 9.2% (male: 8.8%, female: 9.6%) and prediabetes was 13.3% (male: 13%, female: 13.6%) in 2017. Among the patients, only 30.4% had controlled diabetes, 35.2% took treatment regularly and 61.5% were not aware of their diabetic condition. The factors related to getting diabetes were increasing age, overweight, and hypertension. The proportional mortality was 3% from diabetes of total death in all ages. In Bangladesh, 17% population was overweight (male: 14.4%, female: 19.6%), 3.3% were obese (male: 2%, female: 4.6%), and 25.1% had physical inactivity (male: 9.2%, female: 41.3%), those are the related risk factors for diabetes [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For the national response to diabetes, Bangladesh has an operational policy, strategy, and action plan for controlling diabetes and reducing physical inactivity, but not for reducing overweight and obesity. There are evidence-based national diabetes guidelines available, but not fully implemented. There are no set standard criteria for referral of patients from primary care to higher levels of care. In the primary care facilities, there are only blood glucose measurements and urine strips for glucose and ketone measurements generally available, but no facilities for insulin, metformin, sulphonylurea, oral glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) test, dilated fundus examination, retinal photocoagulation, foot vibration perception by tuning fork, renal replacement therapy by dialysis, foot vascular status by Doppler, renal replacement therapy by transplantation in 2016 [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>As there are no standard criteria for referring patients from primary care to a higher level of care, we will facilitate the patients to acquire self-management skills to understand the risk factors for diabetic complications and seek treatment in referral hospitals as necessary. They can attend referral hospitals to prevent diabetic complications by doing HbA<sub>1c</sub> tests, dilated fundus examinations, retinal photocoagulation, foot vibration perception by tuning fork, renal replacement therapy by dialysis and transplantation, and also foot vascular status by Doppler.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Objectives</title><sec><title>General Objective</title><p>To apply the self-management telenursing program and telenursing system developed by the researchers to Bangladesh to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy (improved diabetes control in participants)</p></sec><sec><title>Specific Objectives</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To control patients&#x02019; diabetic condition by measuring HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>By having them acquire self-management behaviors and increase their self-efficacy, to minimize the risk of arising diabetic complications.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To see the feasibility and barriers to implementing telenursing among patients with diabetes in Bangladesh.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Research Questions</title><p>Whether implementing a health education program will improve diabetic patient outcomes or not and will be operational and acceptable by the patients and health care professionals in Bangladesh.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The diabetes self-management program developed by the researchers cannot improve the participants&#x02019; management of their diabetes (avoid aggravation, develop complications, and hospitalization) (H<sub>0</sub>) or can improve the participants&#x02019; management of their diabetes (H<sub>1</sub>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is the telenursing system developed by the researchers operational in Bangladesh?

The data collection schedule is also set in <xref rid="app5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 5</xref>.</p><p>Sociodemographic data, clinical history, and lifestyle are taken at the initial assessment (Initial assessment sheet). Satisfaction is measured by the Likert scale (Satisfaction scale). Achievement of monthly goals is measured by percentage. Behavior change is measured by the researcher-developed scale (Lifestyle behavior questionnaire). Self-efficacy is measured by the Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale.</p><p>Qualitative data will be interviewed, described, or recorded when it occurs. Engagement and follow-up rate, education material used, complication management, and &#x0201c;patients who have achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> in recommended level&#x0201d; will be counted. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be expressed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean with SD or median with quantile, distribution, and range for the continuous variables. To compare the categorical variables between pre- and postdata, the chi-square test will be performed. To compare feasibility and efficacy (pre and post), continuous variables will be compared by paired <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA for the normally distributed and or McNemar test or Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test for the not normally distributed variables after checking the data normality. Qualitative data will be described and categorized if necessary. Statistical significance will be set as &#x0003c;0.05. Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (IBM Corp).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC/NREC/2022-2025/336). The researcher will explain the consent procedures including the purpose, procedure, confidentiality, right to withdraw from the study, risk, and benefits, and will obtain written informed consent (ICFs) individually from all the participants. To maintain privacy and confidentiality, data will be collected anonymously. The data will be stored on two password-protected computer sets in the GCCN research room. After deleting all personal identifying information, anonymized data will be used for data analysis, so that research participants will not be identified. To participate in this study, we will not provide any money to the participants. We will provide all the treatments free of cost. As there is no risk or minimum risk to participate in this study, therefore, we will not provide any compassion to participate in this study. We ensure that identifiable features of research participants in any images of the manuscript or supplementary material will not be visible.</p><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Data will be cleaned, organized, and verified by investigators as well as checking for any missing data or error data. Then analyze, interpret the findings, conclude, recommend dissemination, and further publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Training of the Study Nurses</title><p>The study nurses received overseas telenursing training on materials development and telenursing services. They have regular oriented sessions about the telenursing research activities with the investigators before the study initiation. They have been receiving protocol-specific hands-on training on how to collect data to perform procedures about self-care and behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure for Maintaining Confidentiality</title><p>This research will be conducted in accordance with the &#x0201c;Declaration of Helsinki (2013)&#x0201d; by the World Medical Association. This research will be conducted in compliance with the ethical guidelines set forth by the institutional review board of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC). The IRB ensures that the human participants are protected through the study. Before enrolling in this study, we will get written informed consent from the participants. Furthermore, we will keep confidentiality maintain through the research process. The researchers of our study will take all necessary steps to ensure the anonymity of the participants. The shared information will not be identified. We will keep all medical information, description of treatment, and results of the laboratory tests confidential, under lock and key, and only our key research staff will have access to this information. The regular monitoring and evaluation system will be conducted to ensure the implementation of preventative measures, or any other potential risk arising during the study. All the study-related information will be kept under lock and key in a secure data store. An appropriate password-based login mechanism would be used to prevent unauthorized access to the server. The collected information would only be visible to authorized research team leaders on a need basis.</p><p>No identifiable information would be published anywhere.</p></sec><sec><title>Reasons for Termination of the Study</title><p>The study would be terminated based on the following reasons:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Unpredicted ethical concerns that could not be adequately addressed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Unexpected negative events or any harm to participants.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Insufficient participant enrollment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Financial barriers that could affect the feasibility of the study.</p></list-item></list><p>
<bold>Discontinuation of Research</bold>
</p><p>The PI will consider whether to continue the research if any of the following applies:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>When the ethics review committee has given instructions to change the implementation plan, it is deemed difficult to accept such instructions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When facts or information that undermine the ethical validity or scientific rationality of the research are obtained.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When facts or information that undermine the appropriateness of the implementation of the research or the credibility the research results are obtained.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Quality Assurance, Control, and Data Monitoring</title><p>The study quality will be assured and controlled by the PI and other investigators. Data will be collected by the trained research nurses. The participants&#x02019; names will be coded by a unique ID number, and the data will be recorded with the IDs to maintain confidentiality. The data will be cross-checked among the research team. Data will be entered by the nurses. If any discrepancy is found, it will be corrected before data entry. A weekly meeting will be held among the research team to discuss the study and resolve if there will be any study-related confusion.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The project was funded in 2024. The enrollment of the participants started on October 26, 2024, and as of February 2025, all the participants (N=70) were enrolled. Data analysis will be started after the completion of follow-up data collection and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2026 if all information is available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>The results of the research will be disseminated in international scientific conferences and will be published in the <italic>International Science Citation Index (SCI) Journals</italic>. If the results show significance, we will share them with the policymakers, stakeholders, and the research community to implement such interventions in the government and private hospitals. Patients with diabetes will benefit, and it will reduce morbidity and mortality and will reduce patients&#x02019; and national economic burden. To control diabetes, health education and lifestyle changes such as food habits, exercise, and medication adherence are imperative. By doing this research, we can improve quality of life by controlling diabetes and preventing complications and death. In this way, we can also decrease the number of hospital visits and admissions and economic burden. This study will increase patients&#x02019; health literacy so that they can share their health knowledge with their peers and in the community. The study findings may assist us in the future implementation of telenursing interventions with a large sample size for determining factors that influence the quality of life among patients with diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Perspectives</title><p>By implementing this pilot study, we would like to see the feasibility and significance of this study. We can understand the potential barriers to use the telenursing system. Based on this study, we can revise the methodology and use multiple sites to make further research more effective. If we find our disease management program is effective, we can scale up this program throughout the country. Moreover, government and other nongovernment and private organizations can adopt this program and integrate into the existing health care system of Bangladesh. We can establish a public-private partnership incorporating all the stakeholders to develop a sustainable telenursing system [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has certain limitations. As we use a purposive sampling technique for selecting the study sites and participants, it causes selection bias. This is a pre- and poststudy design, not using any control group, and thus no causal inferences could be made. We will use appropriate statistics to understand associations in outcome measures to minimize biases [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We use 2 rural PHCs from one district; therefore, our findings cannot be generalized for the population of the whole country. Some of the enrolled patients may not understand and follow the study procedures, so we can arrange group education via video conference to minimize this.</p></sec><sec><title>Facilities Available</title><p>GCCN has 76 different PHCs throughout Bangladesh. PHC receives patients with diabetes. They also have laboratory facilities to diagnose patients with diabetes. In this study, we have trained investigators and diabetic consultants who will conduct research activities and will provide consultancy. All the data will be entered into a password-protected computer and documents will be kept in the cabinet with a lock and key. Telecommunication will be conducted using smartphones.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>By participating in this study, patients with diabetes will acquire disease-specific self-management skills and can manage a healthy lifestyle and prevent complication.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the respected personnel of Grameen Primary Health Centers, the diabetes specialist, and patients for their kind patience and willful participation in this study.
