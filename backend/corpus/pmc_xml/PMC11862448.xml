This study utilizes intelligent prediction models to explore the key features of titanium implant materials in macrophage polarization. <bold>Impact Statement:</bold> This pilot study provided some insights into the great potential of machine learning in exploring bone immunomodulatory biomaterials. <bold>Introduction:</bold> Titanium materials are commonly utilized as bone replacement materials to treat missing teeth and bone defects. The immune response caused by implant materials after implantation in the body has a double-edged sword effect on osseointegration. Macrophage polarization has been extensively explored to understand early material-mediated immunomodulation. However, understanding of implant material surface properties and immunoregulations remains limited due to current experimental settings, which are based on trial-by-trial approaches. Artificial intelligence, with its capacity to analyze large datasets, can help explore complex material&#x02013;cell interactions. <bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, the effect of titanium surface properties on macrophage polarization was analyzed using intelligent prediction models, including random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and multilayer perceptron. Additionally, data extracted from the newly published literature were further input into the trained models to validate their performance. <bold>Results:</bold> The analysis identified &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;roughness&#x0201d; as the most important features regulating interleukin 10 and tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; secretion. Additionally, the predicted interleukin 10 levels closely matched the experimental results from newly published literature, while the tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; predictions exhibited consistent trends. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The polarization response of macrophages seeded on titanium materials is influenced by multiple factors, and artificial intelligence can assist in extracting the key features of implant materials for immunoregulation.</p></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="ID0E4BAE1031"><funding-source>

The immune response caused by titanium metal materials after implantation, especially the macrophage immune response, plays a double-edged sword effect on osseointegration and bone regeneration [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While an excessive immune reaction may result in peri-implantitis and treatment failure [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], an appropriately regulated immune response can promote successful osseointegration and tissue regeneration [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Macrophages exhibit 2 phenotypes depending on environmental cues: M1, which releases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) that may impede bone healing, and M2, which promotes anti-inflammatory responses and tissue regeneration by secreting cytokines like interleukin 10 (IL-10) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given the significance of macrophages in mediating the immune response, modulating their polarization through the surface physicochemical properties of titanium has been a primary research focus. Several strategies, including surface modifications that adjust roughness, hydrophilicity, and pore size and modification of titanium metal surfaces through the introduction of copper, zinc, magnesium, and silver ions, have been explored to optimize immune regulation [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, most studies focused on modifying one or a few titanium surface characteristics at a time, which is incomplete in unveiling the cumulative effects on the macrophage. The polarization response of macrophages is collectively influenced by various factors on the titanium surfaces, rather than by individual physicochemical properties [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Mathematical modeling has been employed to predict macrophage behavior and bone growth in response to titanium surfaces, yet these models cannot handle large-scale, complex datasets, limiting their predictive power [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To address this gap, advanced methods like machine learning (ML) can provide a more holistic and data-driven approach to studying the complexity of macrophage polarization and the immune response to titanium surfaces. Since its inception in the 1950s, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has evolved into a comprehensive field spanning computer science, logic, biology, psychology, philosophy, and more [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. At its core, AI aims to extend human intelligence by training computers to simulate and learn humanlike behaviors [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ML, a branch of AI, has shown immense potential in analyzing large datasets and revealing complex patterns in fields like medicine and materials science [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In medicine, materials science, and their intersections, ML has become crucial for analyzing complex experimental data, predicting material properties, and optimizing experimental design. For instance, in medicine, ML aids in the early detection of osteoporosis by identifying abnormal bone density [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In materials science, it assists researchers in discovering novel polymers with high glass transition temperatures [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, at the intersection of materials science and medicine, ML is employed to predict the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles to immune cells, offering valuable insights for designing and applying safe nanoparticles [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The digitized ML approach surpasses traditional data acquisition, integration, and analysis techniques, enabling efficient extraction and exploration of correlations in complex datasets to assist researchers in prediction [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>By employing ML techniques to investigate the modulation of macrophage polarization, it is possible to conduct an in-depth analysis of titanium metal&#x02019;s regulatory role (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1;, as key anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory factors of macrophages, respectively, play essential roles in regulating immune responses [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), on the other hand, reflects the accuracy of model predictions and is applicable for evaluating regression model performance, with its value range being (0,+&#x0221e;). By comprehensively considering both <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> and MAPE, the performance of the models can be evaluated from 2 dimensions: model fit and prediction accuracy. The performance differences among the 4 ML models on the IL-10 dataset&#x02019;s test set are illustrated in the <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>. Notably, the random forest (RF) (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.70, MAPE = 2.82), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.73, MAPE = 3.60), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.71, MAPE = 1.69) models outperform the support vector machine (SVM) model (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.24, MAPE = 3.64), with <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> values surpassing 0.7 for these 3 models. In this study, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> values exceeding 0.7 indicate that the features considered in the models can explain over 70% of the variability in cytokine secretion response. Higher <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> values signify better fitting of the model to the observed data. Therefore, the selected ML models, including RF, XGBoost, and MLP, demonstrated significant capabilities in capturing and interpreting latent patterns relating the selected features to cytokine secretion responses.

The comparison between the predicted values and the actual values on the test set for the RF, XGBoost, and MLP models is shown in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, where the data points are scattered around the diagonal, indicating high reliability for the 3 models. Therefore, the RF and XGBoost models, which are interpretable and perform well on the test set, were chosen in this study to predict the weights of factors affecting TNF-&#x003b1; protein secretion.</p><p>As depicted in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C, the RF (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.73, MAPE = 1.85), XGBoost (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.72, MAPE = 1.96), and MLP models (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.73, MAPE = 1.58) outperformed the SVM model (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.07, MAPE = 3.65) on the test set of the TNF-&#x003b1; dataset. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, both the RF and XGBoost models identified &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;roughness&#x0201d; as influential features for TNF-&#x003b1; protein secretion while considering &#x0201c;aperture size&#x0201d; to have a minor impact. Due to the high <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> and low MAPE of the MLP model, it was employed to explore the influence of key features on TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels by macrophages. For example, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E (a), the trends of TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels by different types of macrophages varied with cell seeding density, with human-derived monocytes generally exhibiting higher TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels than murine-derived monocytes. Additionally, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E (b), macrophage TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels were also influenced by the contact angle, with TNF-&#x003b1; levels increasing as the contact angle increased. Notably, RAW J774 cells exhibited a sharper increase in TNF-&#x003b1; levels compared to other macrophage types, particularly in the contact angle range of 60&#x000b0; to 90&#x000b0;. This further indicates that multiple factors regulate TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels by macrophages.</p><p>Additionally, this study verified the utility of the MLP model using the literature described in the &#x0201c;Experimental verification&#x0201d; in Materials and Methods. Using the MLP model to predict the TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels of macrophages seeded on 4 different surfaces mentioned in the literature, the predicted values were compared with the reported TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels. The comparison results in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F indicate that while significant discrepancies exist between the predicted and observed values, the predicted trend aligns with the observed values. Specifically, the predicted TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels increase sequentially in the 4 experimental groups &#x0201c;Micro&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Micro/Nano-180&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Micro/Nano-440&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Micro/Nano-780&#x0201d;. This suggests that despite the significant differences, the MLP model has the potential to predict TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels due to its ability to capture the underlying trend.</p><p>In summary, applying ML techniques to predict TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels further demonstrates the high potential of ML techniques in the field of biomaterials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study explored ML approaches to extracting titanium metal characteristics that affect the properties of macrophage polarization and cytokine production, utilizing IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; as representative anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory agents, respectively.</p><p>In both the IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; datasets, the RF and XGBoost models consistently indicated that features such as &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;roughness&#x0201d; significantly influence cytokine secretion. This finding aligns with numerous research outcomes, further emphasizing the importance of titanium metal surface hydrophilicity and its synergistic interaction with surface roughness [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It underscores the utility of RF and XGBoost models in our study&#x02019;s predictive tasks. Moreover, the predictive results of RF and XGBoost models also highlight the crucial role of the &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d; feature in regulating macrophage secretion on titanium metal materials, reminding researchers to pay attention to experimental operational details. In both the IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; datasets, the MLP model&#x02019;s predictions regarding the modulation of macrophage polarization responses by features such as &#x0201c;roughness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d; are consistent with the findings of many researchers, such as the superior anti-inflammatory properties of titanium alloys compared to those of pure titanium, the better performance of highly hydrophilic surfaces in alleviating inflammatory responses, and the differences in experimental results obtained from different types of macrophages [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This further confirms the accuracy and practicality of the MLP model in prediction.</p><p>This study utilized the MLP model to predict the secretion levels of IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; on these modified surfaces. The results indicated a high level of agreement between the IL-10 secretion levels predicted by the MLP model and the experimental results in the literature. In contrast, TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels showed similar trends but with significant numerical discrepancies. These discrepancies can be attributed to 4 main factors. Firstly, the limited data used to train the ML model resulted in features such as &#x0201c;elemental composition&#x0201d; not being included in the model due to data scarcity, despite their potential importance in modulating macrophage secretion levels. Secondly, variability in the experimental data, including experimental errors from the cited literature or potential errors made by experimenters in recording data, could have affected the model&#x02019;s accuracy. Thirdly, range errors occurred during data input, as the model only accepted specific values without accounting for the reported variability. Fourthly, the data established through the literature search were unevenly distributed. For instance, few samples had TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels above 400 pg/ml, limiting the model&#x02019;s ability to capture responses under special conditions. Despite these biases, the predictive value of the MLP model in biological experiments was still validated.</p><p>Studies on the effects of different sizes of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes on macrophage polarization responses have yielded diverse conclusions in recent years. Notably, ML models trained in this study contribute to elucidating these seemingly contradictory research findings. For example, Lu et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] suggested that 80-nm TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes could better reduce in&#x000a0;vitro verification, while Wang et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] proposed that 80- to 100-nm TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes could induce macrophages into the M1 phenotype, and 30-nm TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes tended to induce M2 phenotype. These contradictory outcomes underscore the complexity of the interactions between titanium surface properties and macrophage behavior. This study utilized ML technology to explore the possible reasons behind these differences in depth. According to the predictions of RF and XGBoost models, the &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d; feature significantly influences macrophage polarization responses. At the same time, the &#x0201c;macrophage type&#x0201d; feature also has a certain impact on macrophage polarization. The differences in experimental operational details, such as the seeding density of macrophages and the selection of different types of macrophages by researchers on both sides, may be the reasons for the different results. These findings elucidate potential factors contributing to the observed disparities in previous studies. This study not only addresses the existing contradictions in the literature but also highlights the critical role of experimental details, such as macrophage seeding density and the selection of macrophage types, in shaping research outcomes in the field of implant materials.</p><p>The efficient data acquisition method, through extensive literature searches and in-depth reading, provided a wealth of experimental data to train ML models. However, this approach has limitations. Firstly, during the literature review process, certain features, such as &#x0201c;elemental composition&#x0201d;, were mentioned infrequently in the relevant studies in this field. Therefore, they were not included in the final feature selection. In this study, we reviewed the literature to summarize the relevant features reported in this field and statistically analyzed their occurrence frequency to determine which features to include. However, while this feature may influence macrophage polarization, the ML model could still capture its effects indirectly through other related features. Consequently, although some features were not explicitly used, their impact could be represented through correlations with other included features. Secondly, some literature is needed to provide complete feature data, leading to occurrences of missing data. For instance, during the thorough reading of a paper by Xu et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it was found that the feature &#x0201c;roughness&#x0201d; did not provide detailed data. Among the methods for handling missing values, simple approaches like replacing missing values with zeros, the mean, or the median are commonly used. These methods are straightforward, easy to implement, and computationally inexpensive, making them suitable when the missing data are minimal and the data distribution is uniform. In contrast, the kNN algorithm is highly effective for imputing missing values in cases with complex data patterns, especially when the missing data show some correlations. Even though this study employed mode and kNN algorithms to impute missing values, these filled data may only partially reflect the actual situation, which could affect the fitting of ML models trained on this dataset. Thirdly, when acquiring data from previous research literature, issues such as experimental personnel errors, inaccurate data recording, or errors in the experiments themselves may arise. For example, in a study by Zhang et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the data for the feature &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d; exhibited a range of errors, with the &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d; data for the different groups Ti, Ti-A, Ti-D, and Ti-AA recorded as 96.80&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 2.08&#x000b0;, 14.37&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 2.00&#x000b0;, 50.11&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 2.40&#x000b0;, and 26.22&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 1.50&#x000b0;, respectively. Therefore, there is a need to improve the methods used to collect data in order to increase the quality and reliability of the datasets used for ML model training and validation.</p><p>Through the predictive analysis of RF and XGBoost models, this study revealed the significant impact of titanium surface roughness, hydrophilicity, and the operational detail of the seed density on the in&#x000a0;vitro polarization response of macrophages. This suggests that researchers should enhance their focus on these physicochemical properties and experimental procedures in future studies. Additionally, the MLP model predicted the effects of variations in key features on the secretion levels of cytokines by macrophages, aiding in elucidating the complex relationship between these key features and cytokine secretion levels. These findings provide valuable insights for deepening researchers&#x02019; understanding of the intricate interactions between titanium surface properties and immune responses.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the synergistic regulation of titanium surface properties and titanium&#x02013;macrophage interactions on macrophage polarization responses using ML technology, focusing on the secretion of the cytokines IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1;. Through the application of RF and XGBoost algorithms, significant influences of the features &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;roughness&#x0201d; on macrophage polarization responses were identified. Particularly noteworthy was the prominent effect of the feature &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d;, highlighting the importance of the physicochemical properties of titanium and its interaction with macrophages, thus emphasizing the need for increased attention to experimental operational details. Using the MLP model, variations in the key features &#x0201c;cell seeding density&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;roughness&#x0201d; on IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels were explored, providing deeper insights into the complex relationships between titanium surface physicochemical properties, titanium&#x02013;macrophage interactions, and macrophage polarization responses. For instance, it was observed that when macrophages were seeded on highly hydrophilic pure titanium and titanium alloy surfaces, higher levels of IL-10 secretion were observed. In contrast, differences in IL-10 secretion levels were noted when macrophages were seeded on pure titanium and titanium alloy surfaces with water contact angles between 40&#x000b0; and 80&#x000b0;. ML techniques were employed to elucidate the apparent contradictions among recent research findings in the field, demonstrating the wide-ranging potential applications of ML in the interdisciplinary field of biomaterials.</p><p>Future work in this area can further explore the applications of ML in the field of biomaterials from several aspects. Firstly, to obtain more diverse and high-quality data for building highly fitting ML models and comprehensively analyzing the relationships between features and labels, future studies should adopt high-throughput experimental methods for data collection. Secondly, regarding model selection, ML models that are robust with small datasets, such as RF, XGBoost, MLP, and SVM, were utilized in this study due to the relatively small sample size. Given the stringent requirements for interpretability in medical research, these models can ensure reliable and understandable predictions. Integrating advanced ML techniques and algorithms in future research could significantly improve the models&#x02019; ability to capture the complex and nonlinear relationships between features and labels, thereby enhancing predictive performance. Techniques such as deep learning, ensemble methods, and transfer learning will be particularly beneficial. Lastly, future research should focus on a deeper mechanistic understanding, exploring how different physicochemical properties of implanted materials and their cell interactions influence cytokine secretion through cellular signaling pathways.</p><p>In conclusion, this study explored the potential application of ML technology in the field of biomaterials, deepening our understanding of the complex interactions between titanium surface properties and immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study workflow is presented in Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>Overview of the study workflow and key findings.

In step 5, experimental verification was performed by comparing the predicted results with new experimental data obtained from the literature, ensuring that model predictions were consistent with experimental outcomes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmef.0100.fig.007" position="float"/></fig><sec id="sec10"><title>Building datasets</title><p>The data incorporated in this study primarily originated from previous research papers and experimental findings, meticulously curated through an in-depth literature review to ensure the inclusion of accurate information. Data from figures were extracted using the software GetData Graph Digitizer 2.24 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://getdata1.software.informer.com" ext-link-type="uri">http://getdata1.software.informer.com</ext-link>). Initially, a comprehensive search of literature from 2002 to 2021 was conducted on Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed using keywords such as &#x0201c;titanium surface modification&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;nanomodification&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;macrophage polarization&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;inflammation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;titanium dioxide&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;immune response&#x0201d;. Subsequently, the literature was screened based on 4 criteria: (a) Experiments selected from the literature must be conducted in&#x000a0;vitro. (b) The selected literature must exclusively explore the modulation of macrophage polarization by titanium surface physicochemical properties, prohibiting any other types of experiments, such as studies involving the addition of drugs to titanium for regulating macrophage polarization. (c) The experiments selected from the literature are not co-culture experiments, and the substrate material for seeding macrophages must be titanium or titanium alloy. (d) Studies on macrophage polarization reactions in the selected literature must include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments. Finally, feature data information was extracted from the screened literature to establish datasets with target labels representing the secretion levels of IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; by macrophages, named as the IL-10 dataset and TNF-&#x003b1; dataset, respectively. The criteria for feature selection were as follows: (a) The data sample size must exceed 30% of the total sample size. (b) Feature values cannot be unique.</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>When extracting data from the literature, numerical features were recorded directly to ensure accuracy. For instance, the &#x0201c;contact angle&#x0201d; feature, representing water contact angle values, was documented as presented in the papers. In cases where different papers reported values in varying units, these were converted to a common unit to ensure consistency before being recorded. All values were carefully documented to reflect the original measurements accurately. For discrete features, such as &#x0201c;material type&#x0201d;, which could take values like &#x0201c;pure titanium&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;titanium alloy&#x0201d;, standard labels were assigned for consistency. Specifically, &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; was used for pure titanium and &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; for titanium alloy. This labeling method was employed to facilitate the transformation of categorical data into formats suitable for ML models. To ensure effective training of ML models, data preprocessing was conducted prior to model training in this study. Firstly, visualization of missing values for features was performed to understand the extent of missing data, providing a basis for subsequent data analysis. Next, the dataset was split into 2 groups based on the label values, specifically one dataset with TNF-&#x003b1; secretion levels as the label and the other with IL-10 secretion levels as the label. Missing values were handled according to feature type. Within each group, missing values of discrete features were imputed using the mode, while missing values of numerical features were filled using the kNN regression method, with <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 5. The algorithm identifies the 5 closest data points based on the feature space and assigns the missing value by averaging the nearest neighbors&#x02019; values. Subsequently, one-hot encoding was employed to preprocess discrete features, thereby converting them into numerical representations suitable for ML algorithm training. For numerical features, standardization was applied to preprocess the data, ensuring uniform scaling across features. Finally, the dataset was randomly split, allocating 80% for training the models and adjusting model hyperparameters, and 20% for testing the model&#x02019;s performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec12"><title>Model training and selection</title><p>To predict the secretion levels of IL-10, a numerical data type, 4 suitable ML models were selected: RF, XGBoost, SVM, and MLP models.

The specific experimental steps were as follows: (a) The data of the training set were randomly divided into 10 subsets for subsequent 10-fold cross-validation. (b) Hyperparameter tuning for the 4 models was performed using a combination of 10-fold cross-validation and grid search strategy. Grid search is a widely used hyperparameter optimization method aimed at finding the best combination of hyperparameters to enhance model performance and generalization ability.</p><p>Evaluation of the trained models in this study involved 2 main aspects: assessing the performance differences of the 4 models on the dataset and evaluating their practical application performance.
