Among these chemicals, deltamethrin (DM), a widely used pesticide, and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antimicrobial commonly detected in water bodies, pose significant ecological risks. This study investigates the acute toxicity, neurotoxic effects, oxidative stress responses, immune-related gene expression, and feeding behavior of adult zebrafish exposed to DM and SMX. The 96 h LC<sub>50</sub> for DM was 4.84 &#x000b5;g/L, indicating significant acute toxicity, while the LC<sub>50</sub> for the DM + SMX mixture was 11.32 &#x000b5;g/L, suggesting that SMX may mitigate the toxicity of DM. Neurotransmitter alterations, including reduced levels of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (&#x003b3;-GABA), serotonin (5-HT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), were observed, with the combination of DM and SMX showing partial restoration of AChE activity. Oxidative stress markers revealed significant changes in antioxidant enzyme activities, with DM exposure increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, while decreasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities. Immune-related gene expression demonstrated suppressed IgM, IgD, and IgZ levels, along with altered inflammatory responses, with both DM and DM + SMX exposure inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, feeding behavior was significantly impaired in the DM group at the 3 min mark, while the DM + SMX group showed partial mitigation of this effect. These findings highlight the neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and behavioral effects of DM and SMX, and underscore the potential for chemical interactions to modulate toxicity in aquatic organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pyrethroids</kwd><kwd>antibiotic</kwd><kwd>immunotoxicity</kwd><kwd>neurotoxicity</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key Research and Development Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2021YFC3200801</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>42377274</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 42377274, and the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2021YFC3200801.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-toxics-13-00128"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Deltamethrin (DM), a widely used pyrethroid insecticide, has raised significant concerns due to its neurotoxic effects on aquatic organisms, including fish [<xref rid="B1-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Pyrethroids like DM exert their toxicity primarily by disrupting sodium ion channels in the nervous system, which leads to excessive neural stimulation and, ultimately, mortality in aquatic species [<xref rid="B3-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a commonly applied pesticide, DM is frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems, such as rivers, lakes, and streams, particularly those affected by runoff from agricultural fields, where it becomes a major environmental contaminant [<xref rid="B4-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The concentrations of DM are reported to range from ng/L to &#x000b5;g/L [<xref rid="B6-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are high enough to pose a risk to aquatic organisms, especially in the case of chronic exposure or during periods of heavy runoff. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a widely used synthetic antimicrobial agent belonging to the sulfonamide class of antibiotics [<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is commonly widely used in both human medicine and aquaculture to treat a variety of bacterial infections [<xref rid="B11-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. SMX is also frequently detected in aquatic environments due to its widespread use and limited degradation in natural water bodies [<xref rid="B11-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As another pervasive contaminant in water systems, SMX poses a potential threat to aquatic organisms, as it can accumulate in water and affect the health of aquatic species, including fish [<xref rid="B12-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The environmental persistence of SMX, combined with its frequent co-occurrence with other pollutants, such as pesticides, raises concerns about the potential synergistic or antagonistic effects of chemical mixtures on aquatic organisms. Recent studies indicated that mixtures of environmental contaminants can alter the toxicity of individual chemicals through various mechanisms, including metabolic interactions and changes in bioavailability [<xref rid="B15-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The toxicological effects of individual chemicals have been extensively studied. However, there is limited research on the combined toxicity of pesticides and antibiotics, particularly concerning neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immune dysfunction in aquatic species. Given the frequent detection of these chemicals together in aquatic environments, it is essential to explore how their combination impacts the health of aquatic organisms.</p><p>Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a prominent model organism for toxicological studies due to their well-documented sensitivity to environmental contaminants and their physiological similarity to other vertebrates, including humans [<xref rid="B18-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This study investigates the acute toxicity of DM, both individually and in combination with SMX, in adult male zebrafish to explore the potential neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and behavioral effects of these chemicals. Altered feeding behavior often signals disruptions in neurological function, energy metabolism, or general health [<xref rid="B20-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Given that pyrethroids like DM are known to affect neural pathways, we hypothesized that exposure to DM may impair zebrafish feeding behavior. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate whether the presence of SMX modulates these effects. In addition to behavioral changes, we also investigated the effects of these chemicals on neurotransmitter levels, immune-related gene expression, and oxidative stress markers in the brain. These biomarkers are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity, as they provide insights into the disruption of neurochemical signaling, immune function, and cellular stress responses, which may have long-term implications for fish populations and aquatic ecosystems. The neurotransmitters &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin (5-HT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are key indicators of neurotoxicity in zebrafish [<xref rid="B21-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], with alterations in their levels reflecting disturbances in neural signaling [<xref rid="B22-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, oxidative stress and immune dysfunction, which are often induced by chemical exposure, can contribute to long-term neurotoxic effects [<xref rid="B24-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Overall, this study seeks to address this gap by investigating the acute toxicity, neurotoxic effects, and immune-related impacts of DM, both individually and in combination with SMX, in adult zebrafish. Specifically, we aim to examine alterations in neurotransmitter alterations, oxidative stress markers, and immune function, all of which are key indicators of chemical-induced neurotoxicity and systemic disruption. By investigating these endpoints, we aim to better understand the potential risks posed by the co-occurrence of pesticides and antibiotics in aquatic environments and the implications for the health of aquatic organisms and inform future risk assessment efforts for aquatic ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-toxics-13-00128"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxics-13-00128"><title>2.1. Chemicals and Reagents</title><p>Deltamethrin (&#x02265;98% purity), sulfamethoxazole (99% purity), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, chromatographic grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Solarbio (Beijing, China). MS-222 (tricaine methanesulfonate), at a concentration of 100 mg/L, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The DM and SMX were dissolved in DMSO to obtain a stock solution and then diluted with water to achieve the desired test concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxics-13-00128"><title>2.2. Zebrafish Maintenance and Exposure Design</title><p>Wild-type AB adult zebrafish (approximately 6 months old) were obtained from the State Key Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Environmental Sciences. The fish were maintained in a flow-through system at 27 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C, 50 &#x000b1; 10% relative humidity, and a 14 h:10 h light:dark cycle. Continuous aeration in water was employed to maintain dissolved oxygen levels above 7.72 mg/L, while conductivity was kept at 480 &#x003bc;S/cm, with minor fluctuations in these values possible. The fish were acclimatized for 14 days prior to the start of the experiment, during which they were fed freshly hatched brine shrimp (<italic toggle="yes">Artemia nauplii</italic>) twice daily. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Keeping and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Chinese Academy of Environmental Sciences. For the acute toxicity test, we conducted the experiment based on the OECD Test Guideline No. 203 for Fish, Acute Toxicity Testing. To avoid potential reproductive or hormonal differences that could influence behavior and neurochemical responses, only male zebrafish were used to assess the toxic effects of DM and SMX in this study. Adult male zebrafish (10 fish per parallel, 6 parallels per concentration group) were exposed to different concentrations of DM (0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 &#x003bc;g/L) in a clear glass beaker containing 2 L of water for 96 h. Additional groups were exposed to the same concentrations of DM in combination with SMX (30 &#x003bc;g/L) for the same duration. The concentrations of SMX were selected based on environmentally relevant levels [<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The DM concentrations were chosen based on prior toxicity studies in zebrafish, which demonstrated toxic effects at these concentrations and provided a foundation for evaluating potential ecological risks [<xref rid="B6-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Each concentration was tested in six replicates to ensure statistical reliability. Control groups were exposed to DMSO at the same concentration as in the experimental groups (0.001% DMSO). Fish were observed for signs of acute toxicity, including mortality, abnormal swimming behavior, and other physical changes (e.g., coloration, fin damage, or erratic movement). At the end of the exposure period (96 h), fish were euthanized using an overdose of MS-222 and thoroughly rinsed and sterilized with PBS, and the following endpoints (mortality, behavioral changes, and immunotoxicity) were assessed. Based on the LC<sub>50</sub> values, the concentration closest to the LC<sub>50</sub> was selected for further analysis (4.0 &#x003bc;g/L). This concentration was chosen because it represents a sublethal concentration that ensures sufficient survival rates and it is also suitable for evaluating potential sublethal effects. The control group (0 &#x003bc;g/L) was used to compare and evaluate the baseline endpoints under normal conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxics-13-00128"><title>2.3. Feeding Behavior Assessment</title><p>Food intake was analyzed to assess feeding behavior based on previous studies [<xref rid="B20-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B28-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After 96 h of exposure, a total of 15 zebrafish from each treatment group (2 or 3 in each tank) were randomly collected and placed into three 2 L glass tanks, with five zebrafish per tank and 1 L of clean water in each tank. After a 2 h acclimation period, the zebrafish were fed 30 commercially available food pellets (average diameter = 1 mm; Yee Corp., Weifang, China). The number of pellets consumed by the zebrafish was recorded at 3, 5, and 10 min post-feeding to assess their feeding behavior. The results were expressed as the ratio of the number of pellets consumed by the zebrafish to the total number of pellets provided.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxics-13-00128"><title>2.4. Assessment of Neurotransmitter and AChE Levels</title><p>The zebrafish brain was carefully dissected, ensuring that the tissue was kept on ice throughout the process to minimize enzymatic degradation. Each brain sample was collected in an ice-cold PBS solution. The brain tissue was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold PBS using a tissue homogenizer or a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 4 &#x000b0;C for 15 min at 5000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> to remove debris. The supernatant was collected and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis.</p><p>The total protein concentration in each sample was first measured using a BCA assay, and the data were normalized. The activity of AChE was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The contents of 5-HT and gamma aminobutyric acid (&#x003b3;-GABA) were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Shanghai Enzyme-Linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s guidelines. The absorbance (OD value) of AChE and three neurotransmitters was measured by the double-antibody sandwich assay at a wavelength of 450 nm using a enzyme-labeled instrument (BioTek Epoch 2, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The concentrations of AChE and the three neurotransmitters in the zebrafish samples were calculated using the linear regression equation derived from the standard curve, which was established by plotting the concentrations of the standards against their corresponding OD values. To meet the required sample size for the experiment, we collected the brains from two zebrafish per replicate. Each group included 4 biological replicates (n = 4), and enzyme activity measurements were performed in duplicate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxics-13-00128"><title>2.5. Analysis of Oxidative Stress Enzyme Activity</title><p>Firstly, zebrafish brain tissue was accurately weighed and added to 9 times the volume of saline in the ratio of weight (g):volume (mL), 1:9, of physiological saline. Mechanical homogenization was performed in an ice-water bath, followed by Eppendorf 5804R centrifugation at 2500 RCF for 10 min(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and determination of protein content in the supernatant using the kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were determined using commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) following the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. For the assessment of oxidative stress enzyme activity, each treatment group (including the control and experimental groups) consisted of 4 biological replicates (n = 4), and each replicate contained two zebrafish brain tissues. The enzyme activities were measured in duplicate to ensure reliability and consistency of the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-toxics-13-00128"><title>2.6. Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) Analysis</title><p>Following the 96 h exposure, zebrafish brain tissues were collected for measuring the expression of immune genes to assess the effects of exposure on organisms. Total RNA was extracted from the brain tissues using a commercially available RNA extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The extracted RNA was quantified and checked for purity (A260/A280 ratio) by using a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). RNA (1 &#x003bc;g) was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. RT-qPCR was performed using a Fluorescent Quantitative PCR Detection System (LineGene 9600, Hangzhou Bioer Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China) with the FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) kit (Roche). Primer sequences for target immune-related genes and housekeeping (RPL13a) genes were referenced to previous literature, and the detailed primer sequences are shown in <xref rid="app1-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>. Primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The relative expression of the genes was performed for each gene with three technical replicates and three biological replicates (n = 3) and was calculated using the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-toxics-13-00128"><title>2.7. Data Statistics and Analysis</title><p>The LC<sub>50</sub> values for deltamethrin and sulfamethoxazole were calculated using Origin 2023 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA). Mortality rates were expressed as percentages for each concentration, and the dose&#x02013;response data were fitted to a logistic regression model using the Nonlinear Curve Fit tool. The LC<sub>50</sub> value was derived from the concentration corresponding to 50% mortality based on the logistic equation. The goodness of fit for the logistic model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), with a value closer to 1 indicating a good fit. The confidence intervals for the LC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated, and the precision of the estimates was assessed. Prior to statistical analysis, the normality of the data was evaluated using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test, which confirmed that the data followed a normal distribution. Therefore, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to analyze the effects on immunogenes, ingestion, neurotransmitters, and oxidative stress enzymes by using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). Dunnett&#x02019;s test was used to identify significant differences between the control and treatment groups. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-toxics-13-00128"><title>3.1. Acute Toxicity of DM and SMX in Adult Zebrafish</title><p>The acute toxicity of DM and SMX was evaluated by calculating the 96 h LC<sub>50</sub> for adult zebrafish based on statistical mortality, as shown in <xref rid="app1-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>. The LC<sub>50</sub> for deltamethrin was found to be 4.84 &#x000b5;g/L, indicating significant acute toxicity at relatively low concentrations (<xref rid="toxics-13-00128-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The relatively low LC<sub>50</sub> observed in this study is similar to previous reports highlighting the neurotoxic potential of pyrethroids to aquatic species [<xref rid="B29-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the toxicity of the deltamethrin&#x02013;SMX mixture was lower than that of deltamethrin alone, with the LC<sub>50</sub> of the mixture being 11.32 &#x000b5;g/L, which is almost twice the LC<sub>50</sub> of deltamethrin alone. This result suggests a protective or mitigating effect of SMX in reducing the acute toxicity of deltamethrin at the tested concentration. SMX is widely used in aquaculture to control various bacterial diseases due to its ability to inhibit the folate metabolism pathway in bacteria [<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. SMX may alter the pharmacokinetics or bioavailability of deltamethrin, thereby reducing the toxic effects. Deltamethrin exposure in adult zebrafish has been shown to result in similar LC<sub>50</sub> values as those observed in the current study [<xref rid="B30-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These findings suggest that the presence of additional contaminants, such as sulfamethoxazole, may alter deltamethrin toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-toxics-13-00128"><title>3.2. Neurotransmitter Alterations in the Zebrafish Brain Following Chemical Exposure</title><p>To investigate the neurotoxic effects of DM and its combination with SMX on neurotransmitter levels in adult zebrafish, we quantified &#x003b3;-GABA, 5-HT, and AChE in the brain 96 h following acute exposure to 4 &#x000b5;g/L of DM and a combination of 4 &#x000b5;g/L of DM and 30 &#x000b5;g/L of SMX (<xref rid="toxics-13-00128-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The level of &#x003b3;-GABA in the brain was significantly altered across the treatment groups. In the control group, the &#x003b3;-GABA level was 4.94 &#x000b1; 0.19 &#x000b5;mol/L, while in the DM group and the DM + SMX group, the levels were significantly reduced to 3.91 &#x000b1; 0.39 &#x000b5;mol/L (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.002) and 4.34 &#x000b1; 0.30 &#x000b5;mol/L (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.040), respectively. The significant decrease in &#x003b3;-GABA levels following DM exposure suggests an impairment of inhibitory neurotransmission, which could be indicative of disruptions in GABAergic signaling pathways [<xref rid="B31-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. GABA is a crucial inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and alterations in its levels may be associated with neurological disorders, including seizures and anxiety-like behavior [<xref rid="B32-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The combined exposure to DM and SMX did not further exacerbate the reduction in &#x003b3;-GABA levels, suggesting that while SMX may not directly affect GABAergic systems, its presence does not significantly enhance the neurotoxic effects of deltamethrin on GABAergic signaling. This finding indicates that the impact of SMX on neurotransmitter systems may be less pronounced compared to deltamethrin, and that any observed alterations in &#x003b3;-GABA levels are primarily driven by deltamethrin exposure.</p><p>Similarly, the 5-HT levels were found to be lower in both the DM&#x02212; and DM + SMX-exposed groups compared to the control. The 5-HT concentration was 12.91 &#x000b1; 0.71 pg/L in the control group, which significantly decreased to 10.88 &#x000b1; 0.40 pg/L in the DM group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and 11.57 &#x000b1; 0.90 pg/L (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the DM + SMX group. This suggests potential disturbances in serotonergic signaling, which plays a key role in regulating mood, behavior, and neuroendocrine functions. The reduction in 5-HT, particularly in the DM group, could be linked to the neurotoxic effects of DM, which has been previously reported to affect serotonin receptors and transporters in various organisms [<xref rid="B1-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B33-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The AChE activity was also significantly affected by the chemical exposures. The control group exhibited a level of 11.40 &#x000b1; 1.03 nmol/L, while the DM group showed a notable decrease to 8.99 &#x000b1; 0.40 n&#x000b5;mol/L. In the DM + SMX group, the AChE level was partially restored to 11.28 &#x000b1; 0.94 nmol/L, although this was still lower than the control group. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant reduction in AChE activity in the DM group, but no significant change was observed between the DM + SMX and control groups. AChE activity is essential for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine at synapses, and its inhibition can lead to overstimulation of cholinergic receptors, with subsequent neurological effects [<xref rid="B34-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The significant reduction in AChE activity in the DM group indicates potential cholinergic dysfunction, which may contribute to neurobehavioral alterations [<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, the partial restoration of AChE activity in the DM + SMX group suggests that sulfamethoxazole might modulate the impact of cyfluthrin on cholinergic systems, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-toxics-13-00128"><title>3.3. Oxidative Stress Response in the Zebrafish Brain After Chemical Exposure</title><p>Previous studies have reported oxidative stress effects in zebrafish exposed to deltamethrin (DM), although the specific responses can vary depending on exposure conditions and chemical interactions [<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To investigate the oxidative stress response in zebrafish brains after acute exposure to 4 &#x000b5;g/L of DM and the combination of 4 &#x000b5;g/L of DM with 30 &#x000b5;g/L of DM + SMX for 96 h, we measured the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide SOD, CAT, GPX, and GST (<xref rid="toxics-13-00128-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The results revealed a significant alteration in the levels of these enzymes in the zebrafish brain after chemical exposure. In the control group, the SOD activity was 24.62 &#x000b1; 1.24 U/mg protein, but it significantly increased to 31.68 &#x000b1; 1.60 U/mg protein in the DM group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and 26.87 &#x000b1; 1.48 U/mg protein in the DM + SMX group (<xref rid="toxics-13-00128-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The increase in SOD activity in the DM group suggests a compensatory response to oxidative stress induced by cyfluthrin exposure. SOD is the first line of defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide anions into hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which may indicate an attempt by the zebrafish brain to counteract oxidative damage [<xref rid="B35-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the decrease in SOD activity in the DM + SMX group compared to the DM group suggests that the combination of cyfluthrin and sulfamethoxazole may impair this compensatory mechanism, leading to less efficient ROS neutralization. For CAT, a key enzyme involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detoxification [<xref rid="B36-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the control group exhibited an activity of 19.03 &#x000b1; 1.04 U/mg protein. After chemical exposure, the levels were significantly increased to 22.87 &#x000b1; 1.13 U/mg protein in the DM group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and 20.21 &#x000b1; 2.20 U/mg protein in the DM + SMX group. These reductions reflect a disruption in the detoxification pathway for hydrogen peroxide, a potentially harmful byproduct of cellular metabolism [<xref rid="B37-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The observed decrease in CAT activity in both the DM and DM + SMX groups is consistent with the heightened oxidative stress due to chemical exposure, which may overwhelm the cellular antioxidant defenses. Previous studies have reported that DM exposure has been shown to induce oxidative stress in various aquatic organisms, including zebrafish, by disrupting the antioxidant defense systems [<xref rid="B38-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which supports our findings of significant changes in SOD and CAT activity in zebrafish brain tissues. For instance, a study demonstrated that exposure to deltamethrin led to a significant decrease in SOD and CAT activities in zebrafish liver, suggesting oxidative damage as a result of pesticide toxicity [<xref rid="B2-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similarly, a review study reported that DM exposure in zebrafish embryos resulted in increased oxidative stress markers, including lipid peroxidation, and impaired antioxidant enzyme activities, such as SOD and CAT [<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which aligns with the findings in our study showing an increase in SOD activity in the DM group and a decrease in CAT activity in both the DM and DM + SMX groups.</p><p>The GPX activity in the control group was 12.10 &#x000b1; 0.52 U/mg protein. In the DM group, GPX activity was significantly reduced to 11.50 &#x000b1; 0.49 U/mg protein (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and it further decreased to 10.95 &#x000b1; 0.67 U/mg protein in the DM + SMX group. GPX is crucial for reducing lipid peroxides and protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage [<xref rid="B37-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The reduction in GPX activity suggests that both cyfluthrin and its combination with sulfamethoxazole induced oxidative damage in zebrafish brain cells, compromising the organism&#x02019;s ability to mitigate lipid peroxidation and oxidative injury [<xref rid="B24-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B39-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>GST activity, which plays an important role in detoxification by conjugating reactive electrophiles to glutathione [<xref rid="B40-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], was 8.90 &#x000b1; 0.82 U/mg protein in the control group. In the DM group, the activity significantly increased to 11.72 &#x000b1; 0.99 U/mg protein (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), while in the DM + SMX group, it decreased to 7.44 &#x000b1; 0.51 U/mg protein. The elevated GST activity in the DM group suggests an enhanced detoxification response to cyfluthrin exposure, possibly due to the increased production of reactive intermediates. However, the decrease in GST activity in the DM + SMX group may indicate an additive or synergistic toxic effect of the two chemicals, which could impair the zebrafish&#x02019;s ability to detoxify harmful compounds, leading to an exacerbation of oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-toxics-13-00128"><title>3.4. Changes in Immune-Related Gene Expression in the Zebrafish Brain</title><p>We investigated changes in immune-related gene expression in the zebrafish brain following exposure to DM and SMX. Specifically, we assessed the expression of immunoglobulin genes (IgM, IgD, and IgZ) and inflammatory cytokines to understand the immune response alterations induced by these chemicals (<xref rid="toxics-13-00128-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The expression of IgM, IgD, and IgZ in the zebrafish brain was significantly reduced in both the DM and DM + SMX treatment groups compared to the control group. Specifically, IgM expression decreased from 1.13 &#x000b1; 0.11-fold in the control group to 0.37 &#x000b1; 0.13-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in the DM group and 0.65 &#x000b1; 0.41-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the DM + SMX group (<xref rid="toxics-13-00128-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, IgD expression was significantly downregulated in the treatment groups, dropping to 0.19 &#x000b1; 0.22-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in the DM group and 0.20 &#x000b1; 0.18-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in the DM + SMX group, compared to 0.98 &#x000b1; 0.23-fold in the control group. For IgZ, the control group showed an expression of 1.25 &#x000b1; 0.36-fold, while both the DM and DM + SMX groups exhibited significant reductions to 0.46 &#x000b1; 0.17-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and 0.37 &#x000b1; 0.34-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), respectively. These findings suggest that exposure to DM and SMX suppresses immune-related pathways, particularly those involving immunoglobulins that are crucial for both systemic and mucosal immunity in zebrafish [<xref rid="B41-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], potentially impairing their ability to produce antibodies in response to pathogens.</p><p>We also assessed the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The control group exhibited an expression of 1.24 &#x000b1; 0.20-fold, whereas the DM and DM + SMX groups had significantly lower expression levels of 0.39 &#x000b1; 0.39-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and 0.32 &#x000b1; 0.33-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), respectively. IL-10 is known to regulate inflammatory responses, and its suppression may indicate an impaired ability of the zebrafish to resolve inflammation [<xref rid="B42-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], potentially leading to prolonged immune activation and tissue damage [<xref rid="B43-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In contrast, IL-8, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, showed an upregulation in both treated groups. The control group exhibited a baseline expression of 1.24 &#x000b1; 0.28-fold, while the DM and DM + SMX groups had significantly higher levels of 2.95 &#x000b1; 0.27-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and 2.73 &#x000b1; 0.95-fold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), respectively. This suggests that both deltamethrin and sulfamethoxazole induce a pro-inflammatory response in the zebrafish brain, likely triggering the activation of innate immune pathways. IL-8 plays a role in neutrophil recruitment and the overall inflammatory cascade, and its elevation points to an exacerbated inflammatory environment in the brain following chemical exposure [<xref rid="B45-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; was significantly elevated only in the DM group, with no significant change observed in the DM + SMX group. IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; are key players in the initiation of acute inflammation and are known to activate downstream immune signaling pathways [<xref rid="B44-toxics-13-00128" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The observed increase in these markers in the DM group suggests that deltamethrin specifically induces an inflammatory response, which may contribute to neuroinflammation and potential neurotoxic effects. Interestingly, the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; did not show significant changes in either the DM or DM + SMX groups compared to the control. Overall, these results highlighted the potential immunotoxic effects of these chemicals, which could impair immune function and contribute to neuroinflammation in aquatic organisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-toxics-13-00128"><title>3.5. Effects of Deltamethrin and Sulfamethoxazole on Feeding Behavior of Zebrafish</title><p>The feeding behavior of zebrafish was assessed by recording the number of pellets consumed at 3, 5, and 10 min after feeding, with results expressed as the ratio of consumed pellets to the total provided (<xref rid="toxics-13-00128-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). At 3 min, the control group consumed 95.00 &#x000b1; 4.08% of the pellets, while the DM group showed a significantly lower feeding rate of 70.00 &#x000b1; 12.25% (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), which suggested that DM exposure negatively impacts the immediate feeding behavior of zebrafish. However, the DM + SMX group did not significantly alter feeding behavior (85.00 &#x000b1; 4.08%), indicating a potential mitigating effect of sulfamethoxazole on the feeding impairments caused by deltamethrin. Although feeding rates in the DM and DM + SMX groups slightly decreased at the 5 and 10 min time points compared to the control, no significant differences were observed at these time intervals. The impact on feeding behavior seemed to be short-lived, with no significant differences at later time points.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-toxics-13-00128"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study demonstrated that DM induced significant acute toxicity, neurotoxic effects, and oxidative stress in zebrafish, while SMX appeared to mitigate some of these effects, particularly in terms of feeding behavior and AChE activity. The combination of DM and SMX did not exacerbate the neurotoxic effects, but partially restored AChE activity. Additionally, oxidative stress responses and immune system alterations suggested that these chemicals can impair the zebrafish&#x02019;s ability to cope with environmental stressors. The observed decrease in immune-related gene expression and increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines indicated potential immunotoxicity, which may contribute to neuroinflammation. These findings underscore the importance of considering chemical interactions in environmental risk assessments and highlight the need for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms of toxicity and their long-term impacts on aquatic ecosystems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
