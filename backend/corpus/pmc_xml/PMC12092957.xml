Medical students, as future healthcare professionals, must be well-informed about food labeling to guide patients in making healthier choices. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding food package labels among Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students in Chennai, South India.</p><p>Methods</p><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted among 425 undergraduate medical students. Participants were selected by their year of study using a stratified random sampling method. Data were collected using a structured, pre-tested questionnaire covering socio-demographics and KAP related to food package labels. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), employing descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and Kendall&#x02019;s tau correlation to determine associations between variables.</p><p>Results</p><p>About 57% of the participants were females. A majority (96.9%) acknowledged the presence of food labels, and 86.1% understood their purpose. However, only 27.5% reported reading food labels regularly. While 65.2% demonstrated good knowledge, only 54.4% exhibited poor attitudes toward&#x000a0;food labels despite recognizing their importance and 53% actively applied this knowledge in purchasing decisions. Female students had better knowledge (66.1% vs. 63.9%, p=0.02), but a more negative attitude compared to males (58.7% vs. 48.6%, p=0.01). Kendall&#x02019;s tau correlation showed a significant positive relationship between KAP scores.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The findings of this study reveal a significant gap between knowledge and actual utilization of food package labels among MBBS students in Chennai. A relatively low percentage of students reported regularly reading labels or incorporating nutritional information into their purchasing decisions, indicating a disconnect between awareness and application. Furthermore, while female students showed a higher level of knowledge compared to their male counterparts, they also exhibited a more negative attitude toward&#x000a0;the importance and utility of food labels. This knowledge-practice gap suggests that mere awareness is insufficient to influence health-conscious behavior&#x000a0;and that underlying perceptions and motivations play a critical role in translating knowledge into practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>awareness</kwd><kwd>food products</kwd><kwd>healthy diet</kwd><kwd>labels</kwd><kwd>nutritive value</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been determined that food labels are a crucial public health tool for encouraging a balanced diet. Consumers can compare the nutritional values of similar food products and make informed, healthful food choices by using the information on food labels, which helps them better comprehend the nutritional value of food [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Customers are demanding more nutritional information as they become more conscious of the link between diet and illness. As a result, food labels help those on special diets (such as those with diabetes or high blood cholesterol) choose foods that are appropriate for their medical conditions [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Numerous significant diet-related illnesses and issues affect the general public, including poor nutrition, obesity, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dietary factors are responsible for about 30% of cancer cases in developed nations [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Customers believe they are informed about using food labels. The sections of the label that were read the most were those about calories, fat, sugar, salt, and fiber content. When making food purchases, they also consider serving size, ingredient lists, percentage daily values, pricing, brands, and health and nutritional claims. Many customers choose to use food labels rather than depending solely on their own expertise because they feel confident in their ability to read labels [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>It is critical to evaluate consumers' attitudes toward&#x000a0;choosing healthier foods as well as their degree of nutrition knowledge on dietary sugars, fats, and cholesterol. An analysis of consumer research on food labeling examined whether consumers utilize or read food labels when purchasing prepackaged foods [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, it has been noted that there was a positive correlation between the educational level of customers and their attitudes and knowledge. Higher-educated people are typically more open to learning about diet and health. Some studies have indicated that food label use decreases with age [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studies on consumers' awareness of the nutritional aspects of using food labels in our nation are scarce. Although consumers knew how important it was to read food labels, it was clear that the most important information they focused on was the manufacturing date, expiration date, and contents of the package [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This may be explained by the fact that the majority of foods produced or repackaged in the area have labels that are devoid of many of the nutrition facts, serving sizes, unique characteristics, health claims, and health warnings that are mandated by Indian standards [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Considering the significant role of consumers&#x02019; awareness of food labels in making healthy food choices, it was, therefore, important to enlighten our community about the importance of reading food labels.</p><p>Among the consumers, medical students were considered a potential group for this study due to their critical role as future healthcare professionals. MBBS students will soon become doctors who advise patients on health and nutrition, and understanding food labels is fundamental in promoting healthy dietary choices [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Food labels provide key information on nutritional content, serving sizes, ingredients, and potential allergens, which are crucial for making informed decisions that can prevent and manage lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. Assessing MBBS&#x000a0;students' knowledge and attitudes toward&#x000a0;food labels will highlight gaps in their awareness, enabling the development of targeted educational interventions to enhance their competency in this area [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, examining their personal practices regarding food labels will provide insights into how well they apply nutritional knowledge in their own lives, which can influence how effectively they counsel patients [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the long term, improving MBBS students' knowledge and attitudes regarding food labels can contribute to more informed public health advice and promote healthier behaviors in the general population.</p><p>Hence, this study was conducted among undergraduate medical students in Chennai, South India, to assess consumers' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) regarding food labels and to determine the association between KAP and the gender of the participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design</p><p>This study employed an analytical cross-sectional design to assess the KAP&#x000a0;of undergraduate medical students regarding food package labels. A cross-sectional study was chosen&#x000a0;as it allows for the collection of data at a single point in time, providing insights into the current state of awareness and behavior related to food labeling among medical students. This approach is particularly effective for identifying gaps in knowledge and variations in practices among different demographic groups within the study population.</p><p>Study area and population</p><p>The study was conducted in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, among undergraduate medical students. Specifically, the study targeted Phase 3 MBBS Part 1 and Part 2 students, as they had already completed foundational courses in Physiology, Biochemistry, and Community Medicine, which include essential nutritional concepts. Participants were required to be at least 18 years old and willing to provide informed consent.</p><p>Sample size and sampling method</p><p>In a study done by Robert SD and Chandran A [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in South India, about 46% of participants read the food labels. A sample size of 382 was calculated at a 95% confidence interval (CI), with a margin of error (l) of 5%, using the formula Z<sup>2</sup>pq/l<sup>2</sup>, where Z=1.96, the proportion who read the food labels in the reference study (p)=46, and q=1-p. Accounting for 10% non-response, the final sample size for the study was 425. A stratified random sampling method was employed to ensure adequate representation of students from different academic years. The entire population of eligible Phase 3 MBBS students was first divided into strata based on their academic year, Part 1 and Part 2. This ensured proportional representation from both cohorts, minimizing sampling bias. Within each stratum, a simple random sampling technique was applied using student roll numbers as the sampling frame. This method ensured that every student within each academic year had an equal probability of being selected, thus enhancing the representativeness and generalizability of the study findings.</p><p>Data collection tool</p><p>Data were collected using a structured, pre-tested questionnaire designed based on previously validated studies on food label awareness and usage. The questionnaire comprised four major sections: (a) socio-demographic information: age, gender, year of study, place of residence, and any type of physical activity such as walking, jogging, swimming, etc.; (b) knowledge assessment: questions related to the components of food labels, their interpretation, and the significance of various nutritional information; (c) attitude assessment: participants' perceptions regarding the importance of food labels, their willingness to rely on food labels for dietary choices, and their confidence in interpreting the information; and (d) practice assessment: the frequency of reading food labels, specific sections of the label reviewed, and the influence of food labels on purchasing decisions.</p><p>To quantify KAP&#x000a0;levels among participants, a pre-defined scoring system was employed based on responses to the structured questionnaire. Participants scoring &#x02265;70% of the maximum possible score were categorized as having good knowledge, while those scoring below 70% were categorized as having poor knowledge. The cumulative attitude score was then categorized using the median split method, where scores equal to or above the median were classified as having a good attitude, and those below as poor attitude. Total practice scores were then categorized as good practice (&#x02265;60% of maximum score) or poor practice (&#x0003c;60%). The questionnaire was pilot-tested among 30 students who were not part of the final study to assess the clarity, reliability, and validity of the questionnaire. Necessary modifications were made based on feedback before administering the questionnaire to the study participants. The cut-off points were based on commonly accepted thresholds in similar KAP studies and were also informed by the distribution of scores from the pilot testing phase, ensuring cultural and contextual relevance.</p><p>Data collection procedure</p><p>Data were collected through self-administered surveys distributed both in paper format and online via Google Forms. Participants were given the option to choose either of the option. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before they completed the questionnaire and electronic consent was obtained from those who participated through google forms. Participation was voluntary, and anonymity was maintained to encourage honest responses. Data collection was conducted over a period of four weeks.&#x000a0;</p><p>Data entry and statistical analysis</p><p>The collected data were entered into Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) and subsequently analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22. Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and percentages, were used to summarize categorical variables. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables. For analytical statistics, the Chi-square test was used to assess associations between categorical variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Kendall&#x02019;s tau correlation coefficient was used to find the linear relationship between KAP scores.&#x000a0;This method was favored over Spearman&#x02019;s correlation due to the existence of tied ranks in the data, which Kendall&#x02019;s tau addresses more effectively, particularly in intermediate sample sizes and ordinal datasets.</p><p>Ethical considerations</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Human Ethics Committee of&#x000a0;Sree Balaji Medical College and Hospital before commencing the study (Approval no: 001/SBMCH/IHEC/2024/2214). Participants were informed about the study&#x02019;s objectives, procedures, and their right to withdraw at any stage without any consequences. All data were kept confidential and used solely for research purposes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This analytical cross-sectional study assessed the KAP&#x000a0;of undergraduate medical students regarding food package labels.

The data were collected through self-reported responses, focusing on key domains such as awareness of nutritional information, frequency of label usage, and interpretation of health claims. The responses were statistically analyzed using descriptive and inferential methods to identify trends, associations, and potential gaps in understanding. The findings suggest that while knowledge of food package labels is relatively high among medical students, gaps exist in translating this knowledge into actual practice. The study highlights the need for targeted educational interventions to improve awareness and encourage more consistent use of food labels among future healthcare professionals. The importance of food labeling has grown with the increased awareness of nutrition, lifestyle diseases, and consumer rights.</p><p>Healthcare professionals, particularly MBBS students, are expected to have a deep understanding of nutrition and food labels as they guide patients toward healthier lifestyle choices [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In recent years, the importance of reading and understanding food labels has gained prominence as a public health tool, especially in tackling lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Our findings indicate that while most medical students recognize the importance of food labeling, there remain significant gaps in their actual knowledge and practical application. Although the majority of students demonstrated a sound understanding of the presence and purpose of food labels, this knowledge was not consistently translated into practical behaviors.&#x000a0;This aligns with previous studies that have reported similar discrepancies between theoretical understanding and real-world application of nutritional knowledge [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Our results show that a majority of medical students are aware of the existence of food labels and their importance in making informed dietary choices. However, when asked about specific components of food labels, such as serving sizes, percentage daily values, and nutrient reference values, many participants demonstrated incomplete knowledge. Similar findings were reported in a study by Campos et al., where consumers, despite being familiar with food labels, often misinterpreted critical nutritional information. This systematic review covered studies done among participants from various geographical regions and different age groups. The lack of comprehensive knowledge among MBBS students is concerning, given their role as future healthcare providers [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A study conducted among MBBS students in India found that while most students were aware of food package labels, their understanding of specific components such as macronutrients, portion sizes, and recommended daily intake values was often incomplete [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Research among Health sciences students in Saudi Arabia revealed that only 50% of the surveyed students checked the food labels before buying food items [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One study conducted in Turkey highlighted the lack of detailed knowledge about food allergens among restaurant personnel. Despite being a critical aspect of food labeling, fewer than half of the participants surveyed could identify common allergens such as gluten, dairy, or nuts on food labels [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similar studies on food allergy and allergens are needed to be done among medical students to equip their knowledge.&#x000a0;</p><p>As emphasized by Sugimoto et al., doctors play a key role in educating patients about healthy dietary habits, and inadequate knowledge about food labeling can hinder their ability to provide effective nutritional counseling [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A study conducted by Miller and Cassady (2015) also found that while young adults had a positive perception of food labels, their ability to correctly interpret complex nutritional information such as values of macronutrients, minerals, and vitamins was limited [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another study by Cowburn and Stockley (2005) concluded that while consumers frequently use food labels, comprehension levels are often low, particularly regarding macronutrient and calorie calculations [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most participants in our study exhibited a positive attitude toward&#x000a0;the importance of food labels. They acknowledged that reading food labels helps in making healthier food choices and agreed that food labeling regulations should be stringent to ensure consumer safety. However, despite this positive attitude, there was a noticeable gap between their beliefs and their actual practices. A possible explanation for this attitude-practice gap could be the limited emphasis placed on nutrition education in the medical curriculum. Coleman et al. have previously highlighted that while medical students recognize the significance of nutrition in disease prevention, their formal training in this area remains inadequate [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A study from a medical college in Saudi Arabia found that most MBBS students acknowledged the importance of food labels in promoting healthier eating habits. However, only a small percentage considered this knowledge essential for their future medical practice. This discrepancy suggests that while students may value food labeling on a personal level, they do not fully recognize its relevance in patient care [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Research from a university in South Africa showed that MBBS students were generally positive about using food labels in their personal lives, but they were less confident in counseling patients about nutrition. This lack of confidence was attributed to insufficient training in nutrition and food label interpretation during their medical studies [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A study from Brazil highlighted that MBBS students largely viewed food labeling as an important tool for public health but believed that government regulation was insufficient [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>When it came to actual practices, our study found that only a moderate proportion of students consistently read food labels while purchasing packaged foods. The most frequently checked sections of food labels were expiry dates, ingredient lists, and calorie content. Other critical components, such as trans fats, sodium content, and serving sizes, were often overlooked. This is consistent with findings by Vijaykumar et al., who reported that supermarket shoppers in Singapore predominantly focus on basic information like expiration dates rather than detailed nutritional data [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One of the significant barriers to regular label usage among students was time constraints and difficulty in understanding technical terms. Many respondents reported that food labels often contain complex scientific terminology, making it difficult for the average consumer to interpret them accurately. This highlights the need for better consumer education and simplified labeling formats to enhance comprehension. A study by Grunert and Wills (2007) noted that while many European consumers claim to use food labels, their ability to make meaningful health decisions based on this information remains inconsistent [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This suggests that despite increased awareness, practical application still requires further improvement.</p><p>Several studies conducted in India and globally have explored consumer awareness and usage of food labels. Vemula et al. reported that urban consumers in India exhibit moderate levels of food label awareness but often lack an in-depth understanding of nutrition facts [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, research by Gandhi et al. emphasized the necessity of integrating nutrition education into the medical curriculum to improve knowledge and awareness among future doctors. The findings of this study underscore the urgent need to strengthen nutrition education within medical training programs [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A study in India found that while a majority of students reported occasionally reading food labels, only 30% did so consistently. The primary reasons for not using food labels included time constraints, difficulty in understanding the information, and a lack of perceived need, especially when purchasing familiar products [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Research from a medical college in Indonesia found that students who regularly used food labels made healthier dietary choices, opting for foods lower in sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. However, only a small fraction of students reported using food labels to manage their own health, such as controlling weight or preventing diseases like hypertension or diabetes [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A study from a medical university in Malaysia revealed that while students who read food labels were more likely to plan balanced meals, most still did not prioritize nutritional information in their meal planning. Instead, factors such as taste, convenience, and price often overshadowed the nutritional benefits when making food choices [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Given the rising burden of lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, equipping future doctors with robust knowledge about food labels is crucial in promoting healthier dietary habits among the general population. Medical curricula should incorporate more extensive training on food labeling, including practical workshops on interpreting nutritional information. Conducting awareness programs for medical students about the importance of food labels could enhance their knowledge and encourage better practices. Hands-on workshops where students practice reading and interpreting food labels could help solidify their understanding and make this a more practical part of their medical education. MBBS students should be trained in counseling patients about nutrition, including how to use food labels to make healthier choices. This training should emphasize the importance of food labeling in managing lifestyle diseases. Regulatory bodies should consider revising food labels to make them more user-friendly and easily interpretable. Students should be encouraged to actively practice reading and analyzing food labels in their daily lives, thereby reinforcing their theoretical knowledge with real-world application.</p><p>Limitations of the study</p><p>While this study provides valuable insights into medical students' KAP on food package labels, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The study included a limited population and the results may not reflect broader trends. A larger and more diverse study population would improve the study's external validity. Data collection relied on self-reported responses and there is a risk of social desirability bias. Also, a cross-sectional study design captures only a single point in time. Longitudinal studies could provide a better understanding of trends over time.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The KAP&#x000a0;of MBBS students regarding food package labels reflects a critical area that requires improvement. While medical students generally recognize the significance of food labeling in making informed dietary choices, there are notable gaps in their understanding and practical application. Many students may be aware of the existence of nutrition labels but lack the necessary skills to interpret them effectively. This limitation not only affects their personal dietary habits but also reduces their ability to guide patients toward healthier nutrition choices. Given the growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions, the ability to analyze and apply food label information is becoming increasingly essential in medical practice. Addressing these gaps through targeted education and training will help ensure that future healthcare professionals are well-equipped to incorporate nutrition counseling into their practice.</p><p>As the role of nutrition in healthcare continues to grow, the ability of MBBS students to effectively utilize food labels will be crucial in addressing lifestyle-related diseases and promoting public health. Well-informed doctors can significantly influence patient behavior by providing evidence-based dietary guidance tailored to individual needs. Additionally, by fostering a culture of nutrition awareness within the medical community, healthcare professionals can serve as role models, encouraging patients and the public to make informed food choices. A comprehensive approach to nutrition education, one that includes theoretical knowledge, practical training, and public health advocacy, will not only enhance medical students&#x02019; competencies but also contribute to long-term improvements in public health outcomes. Therefore, prioritizing food label literacy in medical education is a necessary step toward creating a healthcare system that emphasizes prevention alongside treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants for their time and for volunteering to participate in the study.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
