</self-uri><abstract><p><italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> peat bogs store a large fraction of biologically-bound carbon, due to a steady accumulation of plant material over millennia. The resistance of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> biomass to decay is poorly understood and of high importance for preservation efforts and climate models. <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> peat mostly consists of the polysaccharide-rich cell wall of the moss but the mechanisms by which it resist degradation by microbes remain unclear. Here we show that enzymatic saccharification of peat polysaccharides including cellulose and other glucose-rich polysaccharides is predominantly limited by access to the substrate. The experimental approach involved biotechnological tools including hydrothermal pretreatment to disrupt and relocate cell wall components. This physical change was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. A cocktail of microbial enzymes (Cellic&#x000ae; CTec3) designed for industrial saccharification of lignocellulose of vascular plants was used to assess enzymatic digestibility of peat polysaccharides. The glucose yield increased from close to zero for untreated peat to 30% and 50% when pretreated at 160 and 180 &#x000b0;C. An overall catalytic rate constant for enzymatic glucose-release from peat-cellulose of 26.98&#x02009;h<sup>-1</sup> was calculated using a kinetic model. This is a similar or higher rate compared to cellulose from vascular plant tissues. With an iron content of 2&#x02009;g/kg dry peat, oxidative inactivation of enzymes is an important factor to take into account. A high inactivation constant of 125.91 x10<sup>-3</sup> h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was found for the used saccharification conditions, but the addition of catalase alleviated the oxidative inactivation and increased the glucose yield with 60% in peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C. These findings show that molecular structures of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> peat which prevents access for cell wall degrading enzymes can be disrupted by hydrothermal pretreatment. This brings us closer to understanding peat recalcitrance and thus how very large amounts of organic carbon is stored.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Introduction</title><p>Soil organic matter contains more organic carbon than the global vegetation and the atmosphere combined [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of the estimated 4,000 billion tons of soil carbon, an estimated 500 billion tons is stored in northern peatlands [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In light of the current climate crisis, the importance of keeping these vast carbon stores in place has led to international calls for peatland restoration and protective legislation [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Peat profiles in bogs show increasingly decomposed plant material to a depth of several metre, representing thousands of years of carbon accumulation. Although the plant matter is more decomposed the deeper it is below the surface, the carbon stored in deep waterlogged anoxic zones (the catotelm) is very stable [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This remarkable recalcitrance and preservation of peat has been a matter of debate, with several hypotheses proposed to explain these properties. For example, the slow decomposition rate of the top layer (the acrotelm) has been attributed to increasingly anoxic conditions, the composition of the plant cell wall polysaccharides [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the phenolic content of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the main vegetation comprising the top layer. The low concentration of nutrients and acidic pH also likely contribute to the preservation of peat [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More recently, it was proposed that soil organic matter in peat bogs is stabilized by complexing with iron [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Vascular plants synthesize lignin to strengthen cell wall integrity and protect polysaccharides from degradation. Bryophytes, including <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic>, do not synthesize lignin but do contain polyphenolic lignin-like compounds [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These lignin-like compounds have been detected in Sphagnum leaves by histological approaches and from detecting autofluorescence intensities similar to that of vascular plants [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Electron microscopy analysis of cryo-fractured hyaline leaf cells from <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum fuscum</italic> suggested that the lignin-like compounds surround the cellulose, possibly forming a protective amorphous layer that could restrict access by cellulases [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the removal of phenolics had negligible effects on the degradation of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> polysaccharides by a microbial inoculum from a bog [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> likely has important composition and cell wall architectural adaptations leading to greater recalcitrance compared to vascular plants. For example, fungal taxa isolated from a boreal peat bog decomposed spruce wood chips faster than <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum fuscum</italic> biomass [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> was thought to contain an unusual pectin-like polymer, sphagnan [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with tanning properties [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but this claim has since been disputed [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Overall, the reason behind the particular recalcitrance of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> to decomposition remains poorly understood.</p><p>Several environmental factors have been proposed to influence the preservation of peat. In the enzymatic latch hypothesis, putative <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic>-degrading enzymes are inhibited by phenolic compounds, with phenol oxidase as a key enzyme preventing this inhibition by degrading the inhibiting phenolic compounds [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent studies have challenged this hypothesis showing no or little relation between <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> degrading enzymes and concentration of phenolics [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], including some that focus on the role of iron in peat preservation [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The &#x0201c;iron gate&#x0201d; theory suggests that when oxygen enters the peat due to receding water levels, ferrous iron Fe(II) is oxidized to ferric iron Fe(III), which then complexes with phenolic compounds, thus creating an &#x0201c;iron gate&#x0201d; against phenol oxidase, protecting the phenolic compounds from degradation [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, a study investigating the effect of drainage on the protection of soil carbon by metals in peatland dominated by <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> or non-<italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum,</italic> reported that the &#x0201c;iron gate&#x0201d; mechanism is highly influenced by the vegetation type. In a <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum-</italic>dominated peatland, most carbon was metallic bound under waterlogged conditions compared to drained conditions, while the opposite was true for non-<italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> peatland [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The role of iron in the preservation of carbon in wetlands, particularly in <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum-</italic>dominated wetlands, thus remains unclear.</p><p>The recalcitrance of plant cell walls is partially due to the high chemical stability of the 1&#x02013;4 &#x003b2;-glycosidic bond. Indeed, the polysaccharides by themselves have a half-life on the order of millions of years [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Secreted microbial enzymes, which synergistically degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, induce turnover rates down to seconds, however. In vascular plants, limited access (at the nano-scale level) to the individual polysaccharides can be the main factor limiting such enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic cell walls [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Whether this also holds true for <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> cell walls remains unknown. It is generally acknowledged that S<italic toggle="yes">phagnum</italic> contains cellulose [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but the similarity of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> cellulose to that of vascular plants has not been fully clarified. Early work on the nature of cellulose in <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum,</italic> extracted and chemically characterized cellulose from S<italic toggle="yes">phagnum recurvum</italic> and from cotton fibres. The cellulose of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> behaved differently from that of cotton during extraction, and the extracted cellulose exhibited chemical differences compared to cotton [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Whether the limit to enzymatic degradation of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> cell walls is attributable to limited access to cellulose and other polysaccharides, or possibly to differences in cellulose, remains unknown.</p><p>The enzymatic digestion of lignocellulose releases saccharides and is therefore termed saccharification. This process has been optimised through decade-long research initiatives and is now applied in industrial settings for efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, such as sugar cane bagasse, corn stover and wheat straw into ethanol [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, it is an absolute requirement in the industry, that the raw material is first pretreated in order to disrupt the structure of the plant tissue. Hydrothermal pretreatment using pressurized reactors is currently operating in commercial production of lignocellulosic bioethanol. When saccharification conditions such as temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen content are controlled and optimised, an enzyme cocktail can degrade more than 80% of cellulose from steam-pretreated wheat straw [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The degree to which peat would be degraded under such conditions is unknown. However, peat has long been used in horticulture as growth medium for soil improvement. Under these conditions, it is well known that peat decomposes. This leads to the main research question addressed in this study: How recalcitrant is the cellulose in peat to saccharification by an enzyme cocktail optimised for lignocellulose degradation? It is not a purpose of this study to design or propose methods or processes for industrial exploration of Sphagnum peat.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the enzymatic digestibility of peat polysaccharides by applying methods developed for enzymatic degradation of lignocellulose from vascular plants. It is shown that peat is resistant to saccharification by an industrial enzyme cocktail. However, hydrothermal pretreatment of peat renders the material highly accessible to enzymatic saccharification. The overall catalytic rate and inactivation constants for the commercial enzyme cocktail used for saccharification of pretreated peat are estimated. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the disruption of cells and dislocation of cell wall components by the pretreatment. These findings suggests that access of the polysaccharide degrading enzymes to their substrates is a major reason for the recalcitrance of peat to degradation.

Peat was sieved through a 1&#x02009;mm mesh to remove stones and small pieces of wood and was then stored at room temperature in a closed plastic bucket. For comparisons, acrotelm and catotelm collected from a known mire (peatland) and hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw were used. Hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw is a well described lignocellulosic material. Steam-pretreated wheat straw was previously prepared by [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and stored at &#x02212;18 &#x000b0;C. The pretreated wheat straw was thawed at 4 &#x000b0;C prior to saccharification experiments. The wheat straw had been pretreated at 195 &#x000b0;C with a residence time in the pretreatment reactor of six minutes. Acrotelm and catotelm was were sampled from the palsa mire &#x02018;Storflaket&#x02019; (68&#x000b0;20&#x02032;48&#x02032;&#x02032;N,18&#x000b0;58&#x02032;16&#x02032;E) close to Abisko Scientific Research station in subarctic Sweden. The sampling spot was typical <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum fuscum</italic> (Schimp.) H. Klinggr. hummock. Specifically, on July 22, 2023, a hole was cut with a bread knife to a depth of approximately 40&#x02009;cm under which the peat was frozen. Acrotelm was collected from just below the capitula of the moss shoots and to 10&#x02009;cm in depth. Catotelm peat was collected just above the frozen layer. Samples were transported in plastic bags on ice. All collected materials originated from <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum-</italic>dominated bogs and therefore consisted mainly of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> cell wall remains. We were permitted access to sample in the field through the Abisko Scientific Research Station under the Swedish Polar Secretariat.

A wheat straw reference material from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was analysed in parallel to validate the composition analysis. First, the plant materials were oven-dried at 50&#x000b0;C for two days. Afterwards, the samples were ground with a mortar and pestle and the dry matter (DM) content was determined in triplicate using a moisture analyzer (HC103, Metler Toledo). Approximately 15&#x02009;mg dried material was weighed and placed into 2.5-mL screw cap tubes, soaked in 83 &#x000b5;L of 72% (v/v) sulphuric acid and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with vortexing every 10 minutes. The volume was adjusted to 1.5&#x02009;mL with deionized water, resulting in a 4% (v/v) sulphuric acid solution and 1% (w/v) biomass before incubation at 121 &#x000b0;C for one hour in a heating block. Finally, samples were cooled on ice and vacuum filtered through a pre-weighted sintered glass filter crucible por. 4 (Duran, Buch og Holm, Denmark) to separate the acid-soluble and acid-insoluble fraction. The acid-soluble fraction was neutralized with CaCO<sub>3</sub> and spun for 10 minutes at 2000&#x02009;rpm. The supernatant was filtered through sintered 0.45-&#x000b5;m glass filters, and analysed for arabinose, galactose, glucose, xylose and mannose on a Dionex ICS-5000 (Thermo Scientific). Monosaccharide content was converted into the theoretical amount of homopolymers as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The acid-insoluble part of the biomass, Klason lignin&#x02009;+&#x02009;ash, was retained in glass the filter and measured gravimetrically after drying at 105 &#x000b0;C overnight.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>2.4 Analysis of metal contents in the substrates</title><p>Transition metals are involved in oxidative chemistry. The concentration of metals including iron, copper, manganese, aluminium was quantified in the substrates by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

To separate soluble and insoluble glucan in peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C, a slurry of 1% (w/w) DM was prepared in a 250-mL plastic bottle. The 1% DM slurry was shaken for 10 seconds by hand and then centrifuged at room temperature for 5 minutes at 3000&#x02009;rpm.

Briefly, 20&#x02009;g of a slurry of 5% (w/w) DM was hydrolysed in duplicate samples in 50&#x02009;ml falcon tubes at 50 &#x002da;C and pH 5.2 in a hybridization incubator (combi-D24, Finepcr) for up to 144 hours. Lactrol was added to a concentration of 75&#x02009;mg/kg slurry to prevent growth of lactic acid bacteria. The commercial enzyme cocktail CTec3 was used in three dosages of 5, 10, and 15&#x02009;mg/ g DM. In addition, the effect of 10, 50 and 100 &#x000b5;L catalase on saccharification efficiency of pretreated peat incubated with 15&#x02009;mg CTec3 was assessed. To determine the glucose concentration during saccharification, samples were taken from the falcon tubes after 1.5, 3, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. After each sampling, the pH was adjusted with 1 M KOH, except at the 3 hours sampling time. The concentration of monosaccharides was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis using a Dionex ICS-5000 as described below. Fractional conversion of cellulose was calculated by dividing the glucose concentrations, measured by HPLC at each time point, by the original cellulose content of the substrate. The soluble glucose concentration prior to enzyme addition and the amount of glucose added with CTec3 was subtracted from the measured glucose before calculating the fractional conversion.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>2.7 Saccharification of soluble glucan released from peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C</title><p>The soluble part in the first wash of peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C was centrifuged at 14,000&#x02009;rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature and sterile-filtered (0.45 &#x000b5;m).

While <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> does not contain lignin <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic>, the peat samples had a much higher content of Klason lignin and ash than steam-pretreated wheat straw. Peat is formed from humification processes in the environment and the Klason-lignin part of the peat will therefore also contain humic substances that include proteins and fatty acids. Ash was not measured directly in the samples but the element content in the catotelm peat, peat samples and pretreated wheat straw can be found in <xref rid="pone.0312219.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>. The content of cellulose was calculated based on the glucose concentration in the sulphuric acid&#x02013;hydrolysed samples.

The concentration of monosaccharides in the soluble part increased with pretreatment temperature, as expected (<xref rid="pone.0312219.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). While hardly any monosaccharides was released from pretreatment at 121 &#x000b0;C, all five monosaccharides were in concentrations from about 0.1&#x02013;0.3&#x02009;g/L in the soluble part of peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C.

The pretreated peat samples also acidified during saccharification and required the addition of more KOH to maintain the pH at 5.2 than wheat straw. However, there was no apparent effect of enzyme dosage on pH and acetic acid was not detected in samples. The cause of acidification of pretreated peat slurry during saccharification is therefore likely due to the abiotic oxidative reactions catalysed by iron as discussed above. While minimal enzymatic conversion was observed for the untreated and autoclaved peat samples, a temperature-dependent increase in saccharification efficiency was seen for peat samples subjected to pretreatment at 140 &#x000b0;C, 160 &#x000b0;C, and 180 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0312219.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

The autofluorescence signal from catotelm (<xref rid="pone.0312219.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), collected about 40&#x02009;cm below the acrotelm, was significantly lower than that of the acrotelm, but with some degree of cell integrity left.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0312219.g006"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0312219.g006</object-id><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum fuscum</italic> leaf material from different sources of peat moss.</title><p>Acrotelm (A) and catotelm (B) collected in Abisko peat bog compared to peat (C) and peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C (D). &#x003b2;-1.4 glucans are visualized with calcofluor white staining and shown in cyan.

Following the 180 &#x000b0;C pretreatment of peat (<xref rid="pone.0312219.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>), individual cell types could no longer be recognized and the calcofluor white signal was no longer localized to cell walls. The autofluorescence signal from lignin-like compounds was intensified and appeared to have relocated to droplets, similar to observations of wheat straw lignin relocation following pretreatment [<xref rid="pone.0312219.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>When robust microbial enzymes are deployed and oxidative inactivation is taken into account, the polysaccharides of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> peat are just as susceptible to enzymatic saccharification as lignocellulose from vascular plants. Certainly, the rather large proportion of glucose in the soluble fraction after pretreatment and the very different shape of progress curves suggests different molecular structures in the cell wall of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> that warrants further investigation. These findings offer a new perspective on the recalcitrance of <italic toggle="yes">Sphagnum</italic> moss and the protection of carbon storage in peat bogs.</p></sec><sec id="sec025" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Estimation of the inactivation (ki) and the catalytic (ks) rate constants.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s001.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Metal concentration in substrates.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s002.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Detection of acetic acid.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s003.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of pretreatment temperature on titrant requirements during saccharification.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s004.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of dissolved oxygen on saccharafication and KOH (1M) requirements of peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s005.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>CTec3 resistant oligosaccharides from saccharification of 180 &#x000b0;C pretreated peat analysed by polysaccharide analysis with carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s006.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s007" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>R-code.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s007.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0312219.s008" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Estimation of glucan fraction in soluble part of peat pretreated at 180 &#x000b0;C.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0312219.s008.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0312219.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lehmann</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kleber</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>The contentious nature of soil organic matter</article-title>. <source>Nature</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>528</volume>(<issue>7580</issue>):<fpage>60</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/nature16069</pub-id>
