Purposive and snowball sampling methods were used for recruitment. Semi-structured interviews and a focus group session were conducted. Data was analysed using qualitative content analysis.

Most participants perceived their role in the provision of general dietary advice, and there was a consensus that nutrition is important. Key barriers (e.g. lack of time and resources, perceived lack of knowledge, scope of practice), including unique patient-related barriers (e.g. co-morbidities, fatalistic mindset), and key facilitators (e.g. need for education, evidence-based resources, multidisciplinary team approach) to dietary advice provision fell within five TICD domains (intervention, health professional factors, patient factors, professional interactions, incentives and resources). Common barriers (e.g. disconnections in multidisciplinary care, lack of structured referral pathways) and facilitators (e.g. clear referral pathways) to referral fell within four TICD domains (intervention, health professional factors, professional interactions, incentives and resources).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The barriers and facilitators to referral and provision of dietary advice by HCPs suggest the need for system-level changes via a multi-pronged approach. Simple and accessible nutrition resources, stronger nutrition education for HCPs, improved referral pathways and role clarity are required to support a multidisciplinary approach to nutritional care. More qualitative research on patient-level factors involving older adults with cancer is warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00520-025-09254-7.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dietary advice</kwd><kwd>Dietetic referral</kwd><kwd>Nutrition education</kwd><kwd>Healthcare professionals</kwd><kwd>Older adults</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Flinders University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p> Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Cancer survivorship rates have increased over the years due to earlier diagnosis, improved treatment and better survivorship care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, this rate decreases with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Older adults (65&#x000a0;years and above) are more likely to develop cancer than the younger population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They experience greater disease burden and poorer health outcomes due to other co-morbidities and age-related physical, emotional and psychological issues, increasing the complexity of their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Coupled with nutritional impairments due to the pathogenesis of cancer and its treatment, older adults face additional barriers to maintain an optimal nutritional status, which is a determinant of overall health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although the causative relationship between malnutrition, cancer and ageing is yet to be fully elucidated, the detrimental impacts of malnutrition, including changes in body composition and weight loss, have been demonstrated to be far more pronounced amongst older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Malnutrition has been associated with poorer prognosis, lower survival rates and quality of life in older adults with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It also contributes to other syndromes, such as sarcopenia and cachexia, which are interrelated and highly prevalent in older adults with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, malnutrition is strongly linked to the development of frailty, which further predisposes older adults to poorer treatment outcomes and a higher risk of complications and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, the nutritional management of cancer, including nutritional assessment, dietary counselling, nutritional support and therapies, is critical in cancer care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Individualised dietary counselling is effective in improving nutritional status in oncology patients, with several clinical guidelines including it as part of the standard of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the current Australian cancer care system, dietary counselling is mainly led by dietitians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, access to dietetic services differs across various healthcare settings, with greater challenges in rural areas due to geographical location and disproportionate funding for oncology-specific dietetic positions, placing a higher burden on patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additional barriers impacting access to dietetic services include inadequate referral pathways, suboptimal coordination of post-treatment nutrition care and cost of private oncology services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This emphasises the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to nutritional care in clinical practice guidelines for people with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Apart from dietitians, other healthcare professionals (HCPs) may also contribute to nutritional care (including the provision of dietary advice) during routine care, particularly in situations where access to dietitians is suboptimal and dietary advice is general in nature. Despite strong evidence for a multidisciplinary approach, cancer survivors in Australia previously reported that non-nutrition HCPs do not provide adequate or appropriate dietary advice post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Patients with cancer have previously indicated their desire for advice to be delivered by other HCPs as they value dietary guidance via a multidisciplinary approach throughout the continuum of their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Recent reviews in oncology found that although HCPs perceive nutrition care as part of their role, certain factors may influence their provision of dietary advice to older people, including a lack of knowledge and time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although there is some understanding of dietary advice provision to people with cancer, there is limited research examining the views of HCPs regarding the provision of dietary advice and referral practices specifically to older people, which is likely to be different to younger adults. To facilitate the involvement of HCPs in the nutritional care of older people with cancer, a better understanding of HCPs&#x02019; perspectives is necessary. Hence, this research aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of HCPs caring for older people with cancer regarding dietetic referral and provision of dietary advice, including their perceived barriers and facilitators to optimal nutritional care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and philosophical assumptions</title><p id="Par9">The philosophical stance on the meanings of reality and knowledge should underpin all aspects of research, including choosing the methodology and data interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This research was underpinned by a relativist and subjectivist paradigm; researchers believe each participant&#x02019;s experience contributes to the reality of a phenomenon. Therefore, the qualitative description methodology and focus group/interview methods were employed to meet the study aims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (Supplementary Material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The qualitative description approach aims to provide a comprehensive description of the phenomena by staying close to the data, aligning with the philosophical paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, this methodology is well-suited for issues that have limited previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the issue, the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) checklist was used for further analysis of inductively identified factors influencing dietetic referral and dietary advice provision by HCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This checklist can be used to identify factors influencing change in HCPs&#x02019; practice, which can inform the development of future interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The TICD checklist has seven domains (Supplementary Material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and was selected based on the appropriateness of its purpose, specific use in patients with chronic diseases and inclusion of multiple domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and participants</title><p id="Par11">This study included HCPs who had not received formal training in nutrition or dietetics, worked in any healthcare setting across Australia and had current or past experiences providing care to older people with cancer. Recruitment occurred between July and November 2023 and was conducted through purposive and snowball sampling. Emails were sent to potential HCPs known to the research team via their professional networks. Potential participants were encouraged to forward the recruitment emails via their own professional networks. One researcher (RW) contacted HCPs who agreed to participate and screened them for eligibility. Attempts were made to recruit a range of professions to increase the diversity of perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recruitment ceased once researchers perceived information power where adequate data was collected to answer the research aims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This study was approved by the Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC reference: 104.22) and Flinders University Human Research Ethics Committee (FUHREC reference: 6379). All participants provided written informed consent. To ensure confidentiality and anonymity, each participant was provided with a numerical label (e.g. P1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interview protocol</title><p id="Par12">A topic guide was developed by the research team to guide the semi-structured format of all interviews and focus group sessions (Supplementary Material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Initial questions sought to obtain information on participants&#x02019; past and present healthcare roles, work settings and their interactions with older people with cancer. Subsequent questions focused on five main areas regarding their perspectives on nutritional care in older people with cancer: (1) perceived importance of dietary advice on health outcomes, (2) their perceived roles, (3) current provision of dietary advice and referral to dietetics, (4) their awareness and use of dietary guidelines and (5) perceived barriers and facilitators to providing dietary advice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interviews and focus group session</title><p id="Par13">All interviews were conducted in-person or online, according to participants&#x02019; preference, by one trained interviewer (RW). After the first three interviews, the recordings were checked by two researchers (RK, CH), and in-depth feedback was provided to RW to improve standardisation. The focus group was conducted by one researcher (RW), and CH was present to collect field notes. Participants were encouraged to share their thoughts freely with the interviewer, providing verbal prompts only where necessary to minimise interruptions to participants&#x02019; responses. All sessions were audio-recorded after obtaining participants&#x02019; verbal consent and transcribed verbatim (Microsoft Word, Version 2307). Transcripts were de-identified and cross-checked for accuracy by one author (RW) and imported into NVivo Software for coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par14">Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously as per recommendations for qualitative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Participant characteristics were analysed using descriptive statistics and presented as frequencies and range. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify sub-categories and categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The term &#x02018;categories&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;themes&#x02019; was chosen given the manifest level of abstraction during analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The analysis process followed three main stages (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Firstly, coding was conducted using an inductive approach, and open coding was done by the first author (RW). Codes were constructed to stay as close to the data as possible while keeping the research aims in mind. Two research team members (RK, CH) coded a subset of the transcriptions separately (15%). Coding discrepancies were discussed to reach a consensus. Second, codes were grouped into sub-categories and categories; a refined coding framework was developed after discussion with three other researchers (RK, CH, JT) Supplementary Material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Finally, to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing dietetic referral and dietary advice provision by HCPs, RW employed a deductive approach to map the codes representing barriers and facilitators to domains in the TICD checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The final analysis was reviewed by RK.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Three-stage data analysis process of healthcare professionals&#x02019; perspectives and experiences and an example of mapping a code representing a factor influencing healthcare professionals&#x02019; provision of dietary advice to a domain in the TICD</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="520_2025_9254_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Demonstrating positionality, reflexivity and rigour</title><p id="Par15">This study was reported according to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (Supplementary Material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). All authors have backgrounds in nutrition and dietetics, including three trained dietitians with at least 10&#x000a0;years of dietetic/research experience each. The first author is a research student (RW) and was guided by co-authors who were researchers experienced in qualitative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. There were no pre-existing relationships between the interviewer (RW) and participants. At the start of the interviews, RW introduced herself as a research student and explained the study objectives. RW acknowledged the influence of her dietetics background on her perspectives and employed reflexivity throughout the research. To confirm the findings, researcher triangulation was achieved through discussions with all authors. To enhance dependability, RW kept an audit trail of the coding iterations. Representative quotations were included to increase the confirmability and transferability of the findings (Supplementary Material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><p id="Par16">Thirty HCPs were invited to consider participation via email between August and October 2023. Four were ineligible because they had no experience providing care to older persons with cancer. One HCP declined due to unavailability, and five did not respond to the recruitment email. A total of 20 HCPs were interviewed from August to November 2023: 16 individual interviews and one four-person focus group session, ranging between 22 to 47&#x000a0;min. The focus group session and two of the individual interviews were held in-person; all other interviews were online.

Perspectives on their own provision of dietary advice</title><p id="Par29">The frequency of dietary advice provision varied amongst the different HCPs. While some reported that they generally do not give advice, nurses and oncologists were more likely to engage in advice provision. Many participants described the quality of their dietary advice as basic and informal advice, with one participant reflecting on how the advice provided was sub-optimal. Different information sources of nutritional knowledge were identified. Many participants mentioned that knowledge was from past work experiences, while some identified education sources like hospital grand rounds, nutrition webinars and basic nutritional lessons in school.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Sub-category 3.4.

Barriers and facilitators to the provision of dietary advice</title><p id="Par37">Five of the seven TICD domains were identified in relation to factors that influence the provision of dietary advice (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The three prominent domains were individual health professional factors, incentives and resources and patient factors.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Factors influencing healthcare professionals&#x02019; provision of dietary advice to older people with cancer, categorised into barriers and facilitators and mapped to the relevant TICD domains</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="520_2025_9254_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><sec id="FPar5"><title>Domain 1: Intervention</title><p id="Par38">Some participants felt that adequate scientific evidence of nutrition on cancer and health outcomes were important facilitators, and research was perceived as important to standardise the care for older people with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Domain 2: Individual health professional factors</title><p id="Par39">Majority of the participants stressed that nutrition was not their expertise or priority and were often worried and cautious about providing advice outside of their practice scope. Participants desired for better clarity in the roles and responsibilities regarding the provision of dietary advice and the knowledge of dietary guidelines. Many participants highlighted their concerns around providing incorrect or inappropriate advice, and they often attributed these concerns to a perceived lack of nutritional knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Domain 3: Patient factors</title><p id="Par40">The commonly reported patient-related barriers included participants&#x02019; perceptions of patients&#x02019; preconceived nutritional beliefs and knowledge, resistance to change and low socioeconomic status (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Several participants talked about how a patient&#x02019;s poor health literacy or low socio-economic status increased the challenge of providing advice. Some participants reported their experiences with older people having a fatalistic mindset about their health. Other participants perceived long-term dietary habits in older adults as difficult to change and felt that patients often did not prioritise nutrition and were more eager to understand their medical treatments. Other perceived barriers closely related to an older person include co-morbidities and poor physical and cognitive health.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Domain 4: Professional interactions</title><p id="Par41">Many participants felt that team processes, including a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of referral networks, would facilitate advice provision as the multidisciplinary team (MDT) can provide support to one another. Some participants discussed how working closely with a dietitian gave them the confidence to provide dietary advice.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Domain 5: Incentives and resources</title><p id="Par42">The most reported barrier to the provision of dietary advice across all domains was the lack of time. Most participants mentioned that consultation times were limited and insufficient for them to provide advice, especially individualised advice. One participant mentioned that the lack of FTE dietitians was also a barrier as their role was to reinforce given advice.</p><p id="Par43">Participants also perceived a lack of physical nutrition resources and training. Many participants expressed the need for nutritional education on what advice is appropriate and clarity on when to refer, as well as physical resources. Ideal resources were described as evidence-based and accessible, with simple information catered to an older person. Education by dietetic professionals was also identified as a facilitator.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par44">This study provides comprehensive insights into the perspectives and experiences of non-nutritionally trained HCPs regarding the provision of nutritional care to older people with cancer. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first study in Australia that examined HCPs&#x02019; perceptions regarding their referral practices to dietetics and the provision of dietary advice specifically to older people with cancer. Overall, dietary advice to people with cancer was perceived by participants to be important yet inadequate due to various reasons, including poor access to dietetic services, inconsistencies in referral practices and perceived sub-optimal provision of dietary advice by HCPs other than dietitians. The challenges in providing optimal nutritional care to an older person with cancer are multifaceted.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Inadequate provision of dietary advice and lack of clarity around perceived role</title><p id="Par45">Most participants perceived that the provision of dietary advice to older people with cancer is inadequate. This study also found that HCPs perceived their own advice to be of sub-optimal quality, and advice provision was not a standard practice. This sentiment is supported by a recent review of patients&#x02019; perspectives; cancer survivors in Australia commonly reported limited and ineffective dietary information from HCPs post-cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Most participants believed that they had some role to play in the provision of dietary advice; however, there was diversity in responses regarding their specific roles and perceived uncertainty in responsibilities. These findings were mirrored by recent reviews involving HCPs, indicating poor clarification in the scope of practice around the provision of dietary advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Consequently, patients may not receive adequate nutritional support across their cancer care as the responsibility of providing advice gets shifted from one professional to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This highlights the importance of clearly defined roles in the provision of dietary advice within a healthcare setting and system. Not all patients have access to a dietitian throughout their cancer care. Hence, it is important to improve the clarity of roles via good communication within each healthcare organisation and to increase HCPs&#x02019; awareness of this issue since they are well placed to contribute to general advice provision and reinforcement of the importance of nutrition to older people with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Factors influencing the provision of dietary advice by HCPs</title><p id="Par46">Key perceived barriers to providing dietary advice included lack of time, concerns around providing incorrect or inappropriate advice, lack of nutritional knowledge and staying within their scope of practice. Contrastingly, the most represented facilitators were education on nutrition, evidence-based resources and a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care. These factors were similarly reported in reviews looking at HCPs&#x02019; perspectives regarding the provision of dietary advice to people with cancer and another expert consensus study that identified essential elements for optimal dietary practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Interestingly, some barriers in this present study fell under the domain: patient factors, which were not identified in previous reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This may mean that there are barriers unique to an older person with cancer, such as the challenges associated with multiple co-morbidities, perceived fatalistic mindset and preconceived ideas around nutrition. This is unsurprising as older people with cancer have distinct nutritional needs as compared to their younger counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Patient-level barriers, including perceived difficulties in changing an older person&#x02019;s eating habits due to preconceptions around nutrition, were also identified in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">The diversity of barriers and facilitators mapped to several domains of the TICD checklist suggests that a multi-pronged approach targeting patients, healthcare professionals, professional interactions, incentives and resources is required. Given the specialised needs and potential differences in perspectives of older people, it is worthwhile to examine the views of older people with cancer regarding the receival of dietary advice from HCPs using qualitative methodology. This would allow for a deeper understanding of patient-level factors from the patient&#x02019;s perspective and the development of appropriate patient-targeted interventions that consider these unique factors. To tackle barriers within the individual health professional domain, there should be a championing of education for HCPs not formally trained in nutrition. Education should focus on what general dietary advice can be provided to older people, guidance on when to provide and when to refer patients to dietitians, as well as dietary guidelines for people with cancer. Nutrition topics should be included within the undergraduate curriculum of non-nutritionally trained HCPs, given the current inadequacy of nutrition education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Other potential educational methods include continuing professional and inter-professional education programs; dietitians and professional dietetic bodies can act as educators for other HCPs. In the context of professional interactions, enhancing collaboration between dietetics and other disciplines would support the delivery of effective dietary advice to people with cancer. Strengthening the multidisciplinary approach in the cancer care pathway is a key facilitator to optimising nutritional care. Lastly, evidence-based resources were highly sought by HCPs; these need to be tailored to an older person&#x02019;s needs and include advice for where to seek help if they do require more information. The development of such resources and guidelines for HCPs may help them to navigate general advice provision within their limited consultation time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Inconsistent referral practices</title><p id="Par49">Although many participants perceived the importance of their role in referring patients to the dietitian, referral was often limited by disconnections in multidisciplinary care and the lack of referral pathways, particularly in the outpatient setting. Disconnections related to poor accessibility of referral pathways and the lack of standardised and structured referral processes were similarly expressed by medical and nursing professionals in a recent Australian review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The implementation of nutrition care pathways, including structured referral systems, has been previously examined in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and was associated with improved patient outcomes like lower rates of malnutrition and higher rates of dietetic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The use of evidence-based referral pathways is further supported by Cancer Australia in their ten-year Cancer Plan, which outlined actions to develop an optimal care pathway for older people with cancer, and the recent consensus study that highlighted elements of evidence-based care pathways as essential for optimal referral practices for cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Cancer care is conventionally specialist-led, and this traditional care model may contribute to the lack of optimal referral pathways outside of an acute healthcare setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Given that referral processes would differ across different settings, healthcare transitions need to be improved, and clearer referral pathways may improve access to dietetic services. Referral protocols should include information for HCPs on how, when and where to refer older people with cancer to dietetics. Although the inadequate and delayed referrals of cancer patients have been well-documented, there is limited research on HCPs&#x02019; perceived knowledge of and skills in referral and their input on the development of referral pathways for older people with cancer, which should be further explored in future qualitative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Intervention trials examining the feasibility and use of referral pathways and protocols may also be warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par51">One of the strengths of this study was the diversity of the sample, including a range of HCPs, years of work experience and work settings. The use of the TICD checklist strengthened the analysis of barriers and facilitators by organising them into different domains, enhancing the usefulness of findings for other researchers, HCPs and organisations. Although the study included HCPs that were fundamental to cancer care in older adults (e.g. medical oncologist, general practitioner, oncology nurse practitioners, geriatricians, physiotherapist), it did not capture every allied health profession&#x02014;in particular, point-of-care nurses who seem to be the top referrers to dietitians. Future studies should explore the views of different professions in different countries, as there may be geographical and cultural differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">This study adds to the limited literature on HCPs&#x02019; perspectives and experiences around referral to dietetics and the provision of dietary advice for older people with cancer, with unique patient factors identified. Future qualitative studies involving older people with cancer are warranted to gain a deeper understanding of patient-level factors influencing the provision of dietary advice by HCPs. Key perceived barriers and facilitators around referral practices and the provision of dietary advice suggest a need for a multi-pronged approach to improve the nutritional care of older adults with cancer. Simple and accessible nutrition resources, advocacy for nutrition education of HCPs and improved dietetic referral pathways are required to better support a multi-disciplinary approach in nutritional care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="520_2025_9254_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 1593 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all 20 participants for their contribution to this research and time taken out of their schedules to participate in either a focus group or an individual interview.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>RK and JT contributed to the study conception, design, and material preparation.
