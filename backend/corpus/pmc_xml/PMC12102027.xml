The inflammatory process, closely associated with the formation of the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion, plays a crucial role in LUAD development. This study utilized data from public databases to analyze inflammation-related genes (INF) associated with prognosis in LUAD. Based on differentially expressed INF, molecular subtypes of LUAD were identified. Subsequently, a novel INF scoring system was developed to establish a prognostic model for LUAD patients, assessing its independence and reliability. Comprehensive evaluations, including immune microenvironment infiltration features, somatic mutation characteristics, and differences in immune therapy responsiveness, were conducted to characterize the prognostic model associated with INF. We further selected MMP14 from the screened INF targets for further in vitro experiments. Experiments such as western blot, qRT-PCR, colony-forming assay and Transwell assay confirmed that downregulation of MMP14 could inhibit the cloning, proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells, thus confirming the results of bioinformatics. Our findings provide evidence from a new perspective on the role of inflammation in LUAD and offer new insights for clinical precision and personalized therapy.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12672-025-02513-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Lung adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>Prognostic value</kwd><kwd>Immune microenvironment</kwd><kwd>MMP14</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">As a lung cancer originating in the cells of the lung, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is of great concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Early detection and prompt medical attention are key to successful treatment of LUAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Treatment options may include surgical removal of cancerous tissue, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy, depending on the stage and severity of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the current efficacy of LUAD treatment is not satisfactory.</p><p id="Par3">Inflammation is a biological response typically triggered by damage to tissues or stimulating factors, serving as a protective reaction of the body. As part of the immune system, inflammation aims to eliminate damaged tissue or clear factors causing injury, thereby promoting the repair process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, cancer cells, along with stromal and inflammatory cells in the surrounding microenvironment, interact to form an inflammation-related tumor milieu, which drives tumor initiation, growth, progression, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The inflammation-related tumor microenvironment (TME) participates in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of lung cancer through mechanisms such as immune escape, tumor angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, inflammation contributes to tumor progression and development by supplying pro-tumorigenic components to the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In LUAD, inflammation similarly plays a crucial role in TME, and anti-inflammatory agents provide another therapeutic option for LUAD treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, defining molecular targets that regulate tumor-promoting inflammation and deepening the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the inflammatory process are essential for further development of LUAD anticancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Inflammation is a critical process in immunotherapy, which holds promising advancements in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Immunotherapy typically targets tumor cells by activating the patient&#x02019;s immune system, leading to an inflammatory response in TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This treatment-induced inflammatory response is considered one of the indicators of treatment success, indicating that the immune system is launching an attack on the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Immunotherapy-based combination therapies show promise in overcoming resistance and improving prognosis in LUAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, tumor immunotherapy still faces challenges such as toxicity control and low response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given these associations, a better understanding of the biological links between inflammation process and LUAD will help identify new therapeutic targets, enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance, and facilitate the development of more effective immunotherapy strategies.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we analyzed prognostic inflammatory associated genes (INF) in LUAD and identified INF-associated LUAD subtypes using data from public databases. We then developed the INF scoring system, developed a prognostic model for LUAD patients, and comprehensively evaluated its characteristics. We further selected MMP14 from the screened INF targets for further in vitro experiments. The in vitro results confirmed downregulation of MMP14 could inhibit the cloning, proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells, thus confirming the results of bioinformatics. Our results provide evidence for the role of inflammation in LUAD from a new perspective, and provide new ideas for precise and individualized clinical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Acquisition and preprocessing of LUAD sample gene transcriptome data</title><p id="Par6">Using &#x0201c;lung adenocarcinoma&#x0201d; as a keyword, we downloaded transcriptome data and clinical baseline information for LUAD from two independent publicly available databases.

Additionally, based on the GEO database, we collected the dataset GSE72094, which includes LUAD sample transcriptomic matrices and clinical baseline information (Platforms: GPL15048 Rosetta/Merck Human RSTA Custom Affymetrix 2.0 microarray [HuRSTA_2a520709.CDF]). After excluding LUAD samples lacking clinical prognosis time and status, we extracted 397 samples from the GSE72094 dataset for further analysis. Similarly, based on the GEO database, we collected the GSE31210 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;106) (Platforms: GPL570[HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) and GSE37745 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;226) (Platforms: GPL570[HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) datasets as independent external validation cohorts. After excluding samples lacking clinical baseline characteristics, we gathered a total of 332 LUAD samples for subsequent independent validation analysis. In the Perl programming environment, we annotated gene labels based on the platform annotation files for the two datasets. Gene labels in the TCGA database were annotated using Ensembl&#x02019;s human genome browser GRCh38.p13 annotation file within Perl scripts, and gene labels with identical annotations were averaged. In the R environment, the TCGA-LUAD dataset was transformed from Count format to TPM format using the &#x0201c;limma&#x0201d; R script, and batch effects were corrected and normalized across both TCGA-LUAD and GSE72094 datasets using the &#x0201c;sva&#x0201d; R script [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

A chromosome co-localization plot illustrated the distribution of differentially expressed INF genes across different chromosomes, suggesting their potential association with genetic information in LUAD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Integrating clinical prognosis information of LUAD, we evaluated the potential associations of these 58 INF genes with LUAD prognosis.

Integrating TCGA and GSE72094 datasets, we collected a total of 904 LUAD samples to assess INF molecular subtype features (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1A, B). Using optimal model parameters and classification ratios from consensus clustering algorithm, we identified three significantly distinct INF molecular subtype patterns in LUAD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Principal component analysis (PCA) plot results demonstrated significant separation among the three INF molecular subtypes in LUAD, indicating accurate classification of LUAD samples based on INF signatures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B).

The heatmap visualization revealed significantly decreased expression of most INF signatures in INF subtype A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Using GSVA algorithm, we calculated differential regulation of KEGG signaling pathways between INF molecular subtypes to elucidate potential molecular mechanisms contributing to clinical prognosis differences among INF molecular subtypes.

Reports have indicated that early-stage LUAD patients often have surgical opportunities, whereas lobectomy in stage III-IV patients is not significantly associated with improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Whether INF classification is related to surgery and perioperative survival requires further exploration. Compared to stage III&#x02013;IV patients, stage I and II patients exhibit higher immune and stromal scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Tumors in stage III&#x02013;IV patients are often in an immunosuppressive state, and immune escape mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment may significantly affect the effectiveness of the INF score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Resistance to chemotherapy or immunotherapy in stage III-IV patients may also limit the predictive capability of the scoring system in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Additionally, different genomic events between early- and late-stage LUAD patients may contribute to the heterogeneous predictive performance of the INF score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Therefore, although the INF score has prognostic value in early-stage LUAD, it may struggle to accurately reflect prognostic differences in immunosuppressive late-stage patients.</p><p id="Par37">Our in vitro results showed that downregulation of MMP14 inhibited the cloning, proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells, which is consistent with the previous observation that MMP14 promotes the migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. As a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), MMP14 is involved in the degradation of various ECM components and processing and shedding membrane-bound proteins, which makes it capable of tumor-related functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. MMP14 raised in several types of cancer, promote angiogenesis, inflammation, cancer cell invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In LUAD, the regulation of MMP14 at mRNA and protein levels can promote tumor progression and induce macrophage M2 polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Concerning the impact of M2 macrophages on the development of LUAD, it may partially explain the mechanism of action of MMP14 on LUAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In addition, MMP14 can interact with bone sialoprotein to promote osteolytic bone metastasis in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the role and its clinical value as an intervention target of MMP14 in LUAD.</p><p id="Par38">In summary, we provided a new risk stratification approach for inflammation in LUAD and partially validated its reliability. One of the weaknesses of this study is that we were unable to conduct a comprehensive analysis of how the cohort samples received immunotherapy based on public database data, limiting our ability to accurately study inflammation status and immunotherapy response. Although we provided simple in vitro experiments to validate the reliability of our bioinformatics results, this is far from sufficient for a comprehensive investigation of INF functions and mechanisms. Currently, we are conducting related mechanistic studies at both the cellular and animal levels to evaluate the immunotherapy response in LUAD patients and perform comparative analysis with our bioinformatics findings. Deep sequencing of LUAD samples using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is also necessary to comprehensively assess somatic mutation profiles and validate prognosis-related mutation types. Additionally, comparing the INF scoring system with other single-variable evaluation standards, such as TMB and PD-L1, for predicting clinical immunotherapy responses holds significant clinical value. In conclusion, further evaluation of the INF score system and the inflammatory process will help improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, providing more personalized and precise treatment for LUAD patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
