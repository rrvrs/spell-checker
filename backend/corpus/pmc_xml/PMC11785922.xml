However, some rare antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 NTD potently neutralize the virus. This finding suggests the NTD may contribute, in part, to protective immunity. Pansarbecovirus antibodies are desirable for broad protection, but the NTD region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high level of sequence divergence; therefore, cross-reactive NTD-specific antibodies are unexpected, and there is no structure of a SARS-CoV NTD-specific antibody in complex with NTD. Here, we report a monoclonal antibody COV1-65, encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">IGHV1-69</italic> gene, that recognizes the NTD of SARS-CoV S protein. A prophylaxis study showed the mAb COV1-65 prevented disease when administered before SARS-CoV challenge of BALB/c mice, an effect that requires intact fragment crystallizable region (Fc) effector functions for optimal protection in vivo. The footprint on the S protein of COV1-65 is near to functional components of the S2 fusion machinery, and the selection of COV1-65 escape mutant viruses identified critical residues Y886H and Q974H, which likely affect the epitope through allosteric effects. Structural features of the mAb COV1-65&#x02013;SARS-CoV antigen interaction suggest critical antigenic determinants that should be considered in the rational design of sarbecovirus vaccine candidates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

During S protein processing, it is cleaved by the host protease furin into S1 and S2 subunits. S1 consists of 2 subdomains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Numerous studies have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV S protein RBD binds to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (<italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>), facilitating viral entry (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A total of 18 amino acids (aa) in <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> contact 14 residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Two amino acids, aa 479 and 487, are critical for the interaction of the RBD to human <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> and are likely a reason for the spread to humans through the pandemic. While RBD mediates attachment to receptor <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>, the purpose of the NTD is poorly recognized.</p><p>In several coronaviruses, the NTD can recognize specific sugar moieties upon initial attachment and could play a critical role in the prefusion-to-postfusion shift of the S protein (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Likewise, NTD of the MERS &#x02018;S&#x02019; protein is a site of vulnerability for recognition by neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In recent studies of SARS-CoV-2, the NTD of S1 has been projected to cooperate with receptors such as dendritic cell&#x02013;specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3&#x02013;grabbing nonintegrin (<italic toggle="yes">DC-SIGN</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">CD209</italic>) or coreceptors, neuropilin-1 (<italic toggle="yes">NRP-1</italic>), or intracellular adhesion molecule-3 (<italic toggle="yes">L-SIGN</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">CD209L</italic>) to facilitate viral attachment and allow SARS-CoV-2 infection via the proven <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> receptor route (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 spike-NTD protein has been shown to bind biliverdin by employing tetrapyrrole rings to avoid neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a few antibodies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Moreover, the NTD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein displays conformational plasticity to accommodate assorted glycan-rich host sialosides that may facilitate infection of host cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Our group and others have discovered NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs targeting major antigenic sites on SARS-CoV-2 NTD (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Collectively, functional characteristics of the antibody response against NTD of beta-coronaviruses are poorly understood. In this current study, we isolated B cells that are reactive to NTD and extensively studied potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-NTD specific antibody COV1-65 from a SARS-CoV convalescent donor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Strong binding and potent neutralization by SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 reactive mAbs.</title><p>We used PBMCs of a SARS-CoV donor to isolate mAbs that bind RBD or NTD and cross neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We chose a human hybridoma approach, collected PBMCs from an individual about a decade after infection with SARS-CoV in 2003 and PBMCs from a SARS-CoV-2&#x02013;infected individual in 2020. Here, we characterized 8 mAbs (designated COV1-57, -58, -62, -65, -80, -90, -99, and -100) from the SARS-CoV&#x02013;immune individual and COV2-3144 from the SARS-CoV-2&#x02013;immune individual. First, we assessed the binding of these 9 mAbs to prefusion-stabilized full-length recombinant S proteins of SARS-CoV (S2P<sub>ecto</sub>) and SARS-CoV-2 (S6P<sub>ecto</sub>). All 9 mAbs bound strongly to SARS-CoV-S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, only 5 mAbs (COV1-57, -58, -80, -100, and COV2-3144) of the 9 mAbs tested bound to SARS-CoV-2-S6P<sub>ecto</sub> protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We made recombinant CR3022, based on the sequence of a previously identified SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive mAb, as a positive control for recognition of both proteins, while the recombinant dengue virus 2D22 (rDENV-2D22) antibody is a negative control that does not bind to either &#x02018;S&#x02019; protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, A and B</xref>).</p><p>We assessed the neutralizing activities of these mAbs against recombinant replication-competent chimeric VSV (rVSV) expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 &#x02018;S&#x02019; protein using real-time cell analysis (RTCA). RTCA assay revealed that mAbs COV1-58, -62, -65, -90, -99, and COV2-3144 neutralize potently, with IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 200 ng/mL against rVSV-SARS-CoV (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Since some of the antibodies also exhibited cross-reactive binding for SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we next examined the neutralizing activity of these mAbs against rVSV-SARS-CoV-2. Only COV2-3144 neutralized rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We also tested the ability of these mAbs to neutralize the mouse-adapted authentic SARS-CoV-MA15 strain and found that COV1-58, -62, -65, -90, and -99 potently neutralized the authentic virus with IC<sub>50</sub> values for neutralization comparable with those for rVSV-SARS-CoV (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). COV2-3144 neutralized SARS-CoV-MA15 but with moderate potency. Given that SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 (Bat SL-CoV-WIV1), and the SARS-like virus SHC014-CoV are the closest relatives to the epidemic SARS-CoV strains, we tested the ability of our mAb to neutralize these viruses. Notably, RBD antibodies COV1-62, -90, and -99 showed some neutralizing activity against WIV1, while COV2-3144, which was isolated from an individual with a history of COVID-19, partially neutralized SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). To identify the differences in neutralization or no neutralization against these viruses, we aligned RBD amino acid sequences of those viruses tested and noticed certain mutations, which might be a reason for the loss of neutralization activity (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI178880DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI178880DS1</ext-link>). We next evaluated the ability of the neutralizing mAbs to block S protein binding to <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>, since most potently neutralizing CoV antibodies prevent virus attachment to cells by blocking virus attachment via S protein to <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> receptor. Only 3 mAbs COV1-90, -99, and COV2-3144 blocked <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> from binding to recombinant 2-proline-stabilized SARS-CoV S protein ectodomain (S2P<sub>ecto</sub>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed genetic sequences and confirmed diverse sequence features of neutralizing antibodies, including varied V- and J-gene usage, CDR3 lengths and amino acid sequences for both light and heavy chains (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Competition-binding reveals 6 distinct antigenic sites on SARS-CoV-S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein.</title><p>Competition-binding analysis was performed using the SARS-CoV-S2P<sub>ecto</sub> antigen by competing with the previously described SARS-CoV mAbs CR3022 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), S230 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), S309 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and COV2-2094 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) that we identified to bind a conserved cryptic epitope on SARS-CoV. The studies revealed 6 competition groups on the surface of &#x02018;S&#x02019; protein that recognize nonoverlapping antigenic sites (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, COV1-90 and -99 competed with the previously described mAb S230, which neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus by blocking S protein binding to <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>. COV2-3144 segregated with COV2-2094 and rCR3022, which was shown previously to neutralize SARS-CoV by binding to the side of RBD and destabilizing S protein. Although COV1-62 partially competed for binding with S230, COV1-90, and -99 it grouped with COV1-58 to a different antigenic site on SARS-CoV-S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein. Remarkably, COV1-65, -100, and S309 each map to unique additional sites on SARS-CoV-S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Epitope identification and structural characterization of COV1-62, -65, and -90.</title><p>Although the competition-binding ELISA provided some knowledge about the number of antigenic sites to which these mAbs can bind, negative-stain electron microscopy was used to image the ectodomain of S protein (S2P<sub>ecto</sub> trimer) in complex with fragment antigen-binding region (Fab) of COV1-62, -65, and -90. COV1-62 and -90 bound to the RBD. As anticipated, the most potently neutralizing antibody, COV1-90 Fab, bound to recognition motif the same as human <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>. COV1-90 mAb bound the &#x02018;open&#x02019; conformational state of the S2P<sub>ecto</sub> trimer, which exposes the <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> interaction residues on RBD and is (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) consistent with our <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> blocking ELISA results (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The Fab of COV1-62, which represents a different antigenic site/group based on competition-binding ELISA, appeared to bind the apex of RBD on the S2P<sub>ecto</sub> trimer at a distinct angle from COV1-90 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), away from the <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> binding site (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). MAb COV1-65 represents a distinctive antigenic site from the competition-binding ELISA results, bound to the NTD on the S2P<sub>ecto</sub> trimer, approaching from underneath the domain (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Although COV2-3144 was cross reactive and neutralizing, we did not consider doing further structural characterization since it competes with known mAb CR3022 that binds to the side of RBD.</p></sec><sec><title>Escape from neutralizing antibodies by VSV-SARS-CoV variants.</title><p>Relative to SARS-CoV-2, the extent to which SARS-CoV can adapt to evade human monoclonal antibodies is incompletely understood. Using a rVSV-SARS-CoV virus, we found that virus variants with SARS-CoV &#x02018;S&#x02019; protein mutations in the RBD and NTD that conferred resistance to mAbs can be selected easily. To identify neutralization escape variants, we used a high-throughput RTCA assay, as previously described (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) We isolated variants of virus that escaped at a saturating concentration (5 &#x003bc;g/mL) of neutralizing antibody and identified point mutations for COV1-62, -65, and COV2-3144. The point mutations were R449G and E452D for COV1-62, Y886H and Q974H for COV1-65, and Y367H, G400R, and Y886H for COV2-3144 mAbs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We reconfirmed that escape variants of virus selected in the RTCA assay experiments conferred resistance to 20 &#x003bc;g/mL with respective mAbs. The COV1-65 mAb escape point mutations Y886H and Q974H were surprising to us, so we started to investigate more and identified that these residues (Y886H of SARS-CoV = Y904H of SARS-CoV-2; Q974H of SARS-CoV = Q992 of SARS-CoV-2) are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 as well. Next, we searched against 15,797,292 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in the GSAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) database for the corresponding mutations if reported and found none reported confirming their detrimental effect on virus fitness. Furthermore, no escape mutants were detected for COV1-57, -90, -99, -100, or S230, which we used as a control mAb in our assay. The location of these escape mutations was highlighted as a ball-and-stick representation on the SARS-CoV S protein structure (PDB:5 &#x000d7; 58 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Escape mutant viruses were selected promptly in the presence of high concentrations of 3 mAbs (COV1-62, -65, and COV2-3144), suggesting that antigenic variants that escaped mAb neutralization existed within the viral population obtained in cell monolayer cultures of the virus. To confirm if the loss of neutralization correlates with mAb binding, we performed a SARS spike cell surface displayed AB-binding assay using escape VSVs, i.e., COV1-62 (R449G), COV1-65 (Y886H), and COV2-3144 (Y367H, Y886H), including SARS1 WT VSV.</p><p>As anticipated, mAbs (COV1-62, COV1-65, COV1-90, COV2-3144, rSA55 [positive control], and rANDV5 [negative control]) tested bound to WT spike except for negative control. COV1-62 mAb lost its binding activity to R449G escape virus, indicating R449 is a critical residue for COV1-62. Similarly, COV2-3144 lost its binding activity to its respective escape virus bearing Y367H and Y886H mutation. While COV2-3144 retains its binding to COV1-65 escape virus contains the Y886H mutation, indicating that Y886H mutation may not be essential for COV2-3144. Interestingly, we found that COV1-65 still retains binding to its respective escape virus that contains the Y886H mutation, but 2-fold less compared with the WT spike without mutation. On the other hand, a similar 1&#x02013;2-fold reduction in the binding of COV1-65 to COV2-3144 escape virus containing Y886H mutation confirms the above results (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next, to test our hypothesis that Y886H mutation in the escape virus would affect <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> avidity, we performed SARS1 WT and COV1-65 escape virus spike cell surface <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>-binding assays. As anticipated, we noticed a 2-fold increase in <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> binding to the COV1-65 escape spike, which has a Y886H mutation in the base of the spike, compared with the WT spike. This indicates that the Y886H mutation might play a role in the avidity of <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> towards spike protein (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cryo-EM of COV1-65 and COV1-62 mAbs bound to the SARS S2P<sub>ecto</sub> trimer reveal unique epitopes.</title><p>To further investigate the distinct antigenic epitopes targeted by mAbs COV1-65 (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">IGHV1-69*02/IGLV2-8*01</italic> variable genes) and COV1-62 (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">IGHV2-5*02/ IGLV7-43*01</italic> variable genes), we performed single-particle cryo-EM of each mAb complexed with S2P<sub>ecto</sub> trimer (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). A 3.2 &#x000c5; resolution structure (C3 symmetry) of the COV1-65 Fab-trimer complex revealed the Fab fragments recognizing the membrane-proximal side of the NTD on each protomer at a steep angle of approach (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). The COV1-65 light chain (LC), situated in the cleft between the NTD and the subdomain 2 (SD2) of the same protomer, is within proximity to the S1/S2 cleavage site and may sterically block the enzymatic cleavage event necessary to generate the 2 fusion-competent subunits (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). COV1-65 engages the NTD primarily using its heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) and the light chain CDR1 (LCDR1) with a total buried surface area (BSA) of 1062 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The long (23 residue) HCDR3 interacts with NTD residues 201&#x02013;202, 211&#x02013;215, and 273&#x02013;274, while the LCDR1 makes contacts with residues 280&#x02013;282, and 623 near the NTD-SD2 interface (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The interaction is mediated by extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bond contacts at residues HCDR3 Y104 with P202, R109 with F213 and T273, S108 with N214 and LCDR1, Y26 with P282, N281, and S623 and G31 with Q280 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, R62 present in the framework region of the heavy chain mediates salt bridge interaction with E294 situated in the C-terminus of NTD, potentially acting as a stabilizing contact (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The LCDR3 residues S96 and N97 are also within proximity to the spike, allowing for some minor contacts. Furthermore, we did IMTG junction analysis to look at the genetic background of the contact residues in HCDR3 and found that the COV1-65 D gene was coded by IGHD1-26*01 with 4 D region mutations, including Y014, S108, and R109 with a 19 nucleotide&#x02013;long N2 addition, which makes COV1-65 mAb a distinctive antibody. (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) Taken together, COV1-65 targets an uncommon antigenic site on SARS-CoV-2 NTD, potentially neutralizing the virus by preventing enzyme access to the S1/S2 cleavage site.</p><p>Our cryo-EM analysis of COV1-62 IgG with S2P<sub>ecto</sub> trimer yielded a 4.5 &#x000c5; resolution map of the complex revealing antibody binding to a cryptic epitope on the inner silent face of the RBD, accessible only in the open conformation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). COV1-62 IgG is capable of cross linking 2 adjacent RBDs on a spike, as evidenced in the 2D class averages, with the antibody-bound RBDs existing in a considerably more open conformation relative to the unbound open states of the RBD (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>). While the local resolution in the flexible RBD-Fab region did not allow for model building, docking the structures of SARS-CoV RBD and a model of COV1-62 Fv (variable fragment) generated by ABodyBuilder (<ext-link xlink:href="https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sabdab-sabpred/sabpred/abodybuilder/" ext-link-type="uri">https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sabdab-sabpred/sabpred/abodybuilder/</ext-link>) allowed detailed analysis of the antibody footprint (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, B&#x02013;D</xref>). COV1-62 uses both the heavy and the light chain to engage the spike with the main contact surface on the RBD, encompassing loop 444&#x02013;466 and &#x003b2;-strands 340&#x02013;344 and 380&#x02013;385. The density for the long HCDR3 (21 aa) is observed near the RBD &#x003b2;-sheet residues situated away from the apex (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Docking an <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>-bound RBD model into the cryo density shows no overlap between the COV1-62 binding site and the receptor binding motif, indicating that the main mechanism of neutralization is not <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> blocking (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 6D6, 7D6, HSW-1, CC25.4, CC25.56, and CC25.43, exhibiting binding breadth across Sarbecoviruses, have been recently shown to target this conserved silent face of the RBD (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, the COV1-62 epitope appears closer to the apex in comparison, possibly explaining its lack of breadth.</p></sec><sec><title>Protection against SARS-CoV MA15 infection.</title><p>Next, we tested the protective efficacy of all mAbs as monotherapy in the BALB/c mouse model of SARS-CoV MA15 infection. Mice treated with 200 &#x003bc;g (10 mg/kg) of mAb DENV-2D22 (isotype-control) to an irrelevant target (dengue type 2 envelope protein) 12 hours before intranasal inoculation with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-MA15 experienced weight loss from 2&#x02013;4 days after inoculation. In contrast, prophylaxis with 200 &#x003bc;g of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 mAbs prevented weight loss in all mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We also assessed gross congestion scores in lungs at the time of harvest. The lung scores for most potently neutralizing mAbs never rose above a score of 1, whereas the lung congestion scores were close to 2 for mice treated with the isotype-control mAb DENV-2D22 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistent with these lung congestion findings, we observed a clear peak in viral replication (10<sup>6</sup> PFU/lobe of the lung) in the mice treated with isotype-control mAb DENV-2D22, whereas mice pretreated with COV1-62, -90, and -99 showed significantly decreased viral load in the lung (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Analysis of H&#x00026;E-stained lung sections showed a reduction in perivascular and parenchymal immune cell infiltration and alveolar space consolidation in the lungs of mice pretreated with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 mAbs compared with DENV-2D22-treated animals (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, the SARS-CoV NTD-specific antibody COV1-65 also protected mice from SARS-CoV-MA15 infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Fc effector functions contribute to optimal protection by COV1-65.</title><p>Because all mAbs bound avidly to SARS-CoV-S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), we considered that part of their protective activity might be facilitated by effector functions through Fc engagement of complement factors such as C1q or Fc&#x003b3;Rs that could facilitate clearance. To test this, we made LALA-PG amino acid mutations into the Fc region of the human IgG1 mAbs to revoke the interaction of the Fc region with Fc&#x003b3;Rs and complement proteins. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We then assessed if the LALA-PG Fc variant of IgGs can still offer protection in vivo. Interestingly, the LALA-PG variants of RBD-specific mAbs COV1-62 and -90 mediated protection against weight loss and significantly reduced viral titers, suggesting that these mAbs function solely through blocking virus interaction with <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic>. In contrast, mice that were administered mAbs COV2-3144 or COV1-65 that bind to the side of RBD or NTD, respectively, lost significant amounts of weight and did not clear lung virus, suggesting that these mAbs function primarily through Fc-mediated mechanisms and require intact WT IgG Fc sequences for clearing the virus in vivo (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, D&#x02013;F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Serious outbreaks of coronaviruses have occurred over the last 20 years, including SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Studies of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have shown that NTD does not have any role in binding to the receptor ACE2 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and the function of NTD in CoV infections is not well understood. Recently, it was shown that NTD possibly will help in binding to sugar moieties (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and may cooperate in the conformational transformation of S2, which is essential for fusion of membranes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Potently neutralizing antibodies targeting NTD have been isolated from convalescent patients with COVID-19 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This observation signifies that NTD is an appealing target for rationally designing vaccines and therapeutics. However, only 53.5% similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV NTD was observed (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), finding cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies against NTD are uncommon.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, most of the neutralizing mAbs in our panel targeted RBD except for COV1-65 and -100. Our competition-binding ELISA and cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV S with COV1-65 Fab revealed an important antigenic site in the NTD of SARS-CoV S protein. While antibodies against the NTD of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are well studied, the structure of a SARS-CoV NTD-specific antibody in complex with NTD has not been reported. Antibody 7D10 recognized MERS-CoV NTD and neutralized pseudotyped and authentic viruses equivalent to antibodies targeting RBD (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Similarly, an NTD antibody 5F9, which showed synergistic neutralization effects with other RBD-specific antibodies against MERS-CoV, has also been reported (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Recent structural analysis using polyclonal Fabs made from pre&#x02013;COVID-19 pandemic human sera were complexed with S proteins from OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV. These revealed OC43-NTD&#x02013;reactive antibodies that are targeting sites adjacent to the RBS, encompassing residues from NTD loops, and were able to sterically block receptors and inhibit OC43 infection (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Structural analysis of COV1-65 provided more insights into where COV1-65 interacts with the NTD of SARS-CoV S protein. We found that the mAb COV1-65 footprint on S protein was similar to that of mAb C1717, sharing recognition of an antigenic site close to functional components of the S2 fusion machinery (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Interestingly, both COV1-65 and C1717 used the same V<sub>H</sub> gene for their heavy chain (<italic toggle="yes">IGHV1-69</italic>), although the genes encoding the light chains differ. Antibodies encoded by <italic toggle="yes">IGHV1-69</italic> participate in antiviral responses to diverse viruses. For instance, the <italic toggle="yes">IGHV1-69</italic> germline gene segment encodes (a) the influenza virus RBS-specific mAb F045-092, (b) the influenza virus HA stem-specific mAb CR9114 (although the interactions are through HCDR2) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), (c) the mAb 4E10 recognizing the HIV-1 membrane-proximal-external region (<italic toggle="yes">MPER</italic>) on HIV-1 gp41 protein, (d) mAb VRC13 recognizing the <italic toggle="yes">CD</italic>4 binding site (CD4bs) on HIV-1 gp120 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), (e) the mAb AR3C recognizing the HCV E2 antigen region 3, and (f) the HC84-1 mAb recognizing the E2 434-446 amino acid peptide of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and (g) glycan cap&#x02013;directed human mAbs against ebola viruses such as BDBV-43 and EBOV-293 (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Similar to mAb C1717, other mAbs, such as S2M24 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), DH1052 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and polyclonal Fabs from donor COV57 (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), also were identified in individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In spite of similar V<sub>H</sub> genes, there are marked variations in the orientation of the antibody heavy-chain domains comparative to the position of the NTD, which may influence the potency and breadth of these antibodies.</p><p>Despite the substantial neutralizing potency of mAb COV1-65 in vitro, SARS-CoV virus may still escape from neutralization. COV1-65 selection of escape mutant viruses resulted in indirect escape mutations, i.e., Y886H and Q974H, which likely affect the epitope through allosteric effects. Escape mutations can occur directly in the critical neutralizing epitope or indirectly outside the targeted epitope, altering stability or accessibility to antibodies (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Moreover, a closer look at the fine details of the structural aspects of these interactions, such as the proximity of the COV1-65 light chain (LC) to the S protein S2 domain fusion machinery could explain the escape mutation profile (Y886H, Q974H) identified for mAb COV1-65.</p><p>Finally, we also showed that mAb COV1-65 protects BALB/c mice when administered prior to the SARS-CoV challenge, and this protection requires intact Fc effector functions for optimal protection in vivo. Studies of SARS-CoV2 NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs showed that NTD-specific mAbs with intact Fc function can efficiently activate Fc&#x003b3;RIIa and Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa in vitro. Similarly, these findings are consistent with studies showing FcR effector functions are critical correlates of protective immunity for pansarbecovirus vaccine performance (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Further, the magnitude of functions that are mediated by Fc may be influenced by specificity of the mAbs on the epitope and draw attention to the orientation of the Fc fragments bound to S-protein for efficient engagement of Fc&#x003b3;R and cross-linking (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Similarly, prior work on MERS-CoV that established NTD as the target for several potently neutralizing and protective mAbs showed that NTD-binding mAbs can be a critical barrier to infection, and the sites of vulnerability for neutralization are attractive targets to include in rational vaccine design efforts against SARS-CoV. A limitation of the current study is that we did not perform dosing studies to elucidate the impact of Fc&#x003b3;R signaling in the protection of the potent neutralizing mAbs. Also, we did not test the antibody as a treatment of existing infection. Although we did not test the antibodies characterized here as a treatment of existing infection, those that bind to RBD compete with S230, CR3022, and S309, which have been studied in therapeutic models (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that the NTD-specific antibody COV1-65 effectively neutralizes the virus and offers in vivo protection against the SARS-CoV challenge. Additionally, structural attributes and genetic determinants of the mAb COV1-65-SARS-CoV antigen interaction we defined here can help to guide rational vaccine design approaches based on the incorporation of critical antigenic determinants driving neutralizing antibody lineage maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sex as a biological variable.</title><p>Our study exclusively examined female mice because male mice are prone to injuries that alter immune responses to viruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies.</title><p>The human antibodies studied in this paper were isolated using PBMCs collected in 2013 from an individual infected with SARS-CoV in 2003 or from an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.

RTCA IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism software.</p></sec><sec><title>Human ACE2 binding inhibition analysis.</title><p>Wells of 384-well microtiter plates were coated with 1 &#x003bc;g/mL purified recombinant SARS-CoV S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Plates were blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk and 2% normal goat serum in DPBS-T for 1 hour. For screening assays, purified mAbs from microscale expression were diluted 2-fold in blocking buffer starting from 10 &#x003bc;g/mL in triplicate, added to the wells (20 &#x003bc;L per well) and incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature. Recombinant human ACE2 with a C-terminal Flag tag peptide was added to wells at 2 &#x003bc;g/mL in a 5 &#x003bc;L per well volume (final 0.4 &#x003bc;g/mL concentration of human ACE2) without washing of antibody and then incubated for 40 minutes at ambient temperature. Plates were washed and bound human <italic toggle="yes">ACE2</italic> was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. A8592, lot SLBV3799, 1:5,000 dilution) and TMB substrate. ACE2 binding without antibody served as a control. The signal obtained for binding of the human ACE2 in the presence of each dilution of tested antibody was expressed as a percentage of the human ACE2 binding without antibody after subtracting the background signal. For dose-response assays, serial dilutions of purified mAbs were applied to the wells in triplicate, and mAb binding was detected as detailed above. IC<sub>50</sub> values for inhibition by mAb of S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein binding to human ACE2 was determined after log transformation of antibody concentration using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression analysis (Prism v.8.0, GraphPad).</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy stain grid preparation, imaging, and processing of S2P<sub>ecto</sub>&#x02013;Fab complexes.</title><p>To perform electron microscopy imaging, Fabs were produced by digesting recombinant chromatography-purified IgGs using resin-immobilized cysteine protease enzyme (FabALACTICA, Genovis). The digestion occurred in 100 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2 (PBS) for around 16 hours at ambient temperature. To remove cleaved Fc from intact IgG, the digestion mix was incubated with Capture Select Fc resin (Genovis) for 30 minutes at ambient temperature in PBS buffer.</p><p>For screening and imaging of negatively stained SARS-CoV S2P<sub>ecto</sub> protein in complex with human Fabs, the proteins were incubated at a Fab:S protein monomer molar ratio of 4:3 for about 1 hour at ambient temperature, and approximately 3 &#x003bc;L of the sample at concentrations of about 10&#x02013;15 &#x003bc;g/mL was applied to a glow-discharged grid with continuous carbon film on 400 square mesh copper electron microscopy grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The grids were stained with 2% uranyl formate (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Images were recorded on a Gatan US4000 4k &#x000d7; 4k CCD camera using an FEI TF20 (TFS) transmission electron microscope operated at 200 keV and control with Serial EM (ref). All images were taken at 50,000&#x000d7; magnification with a pixel size of 2.18 &#x000c5; per pixel in low-dose mode at a defocus of 1.5 to 1.8 &#x003bc;m. The total dose for the micrographs was around 30 electron per &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. Image processing was performed using the cryoSPARC software package. Images were imported, CTF-estimated, and particles were picked. The particles were extracted with a box size of 256 pixels and binned to 128 pixels. 2D class averages were performed and good classes selected for ab initio model and refinement without symmetry. Model docking to the EM map was done in Chimera (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>).

The general processing workflow on CryoSPARC include CTF estimations, micrograph curation, template-based particle picking, particle extraction, iterative rounds of 2D classification, heterogenous refinement, and nonuniform refinement. For COV1-62, additional 3D classification was performed with masks around the RBD-Fab region to enrich for particles with COV1-62&#x02013;bound RBDs, before performing final nonuniform refinement on the selected class. The final reconstructions for COV1-65 and COV1-62 were resolved to 3.2 &#x000c5; and 4.5 &#x000c5;, respectively. The processing details are described in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Model building was only performed for COV1-65.

A total of 50 &#x003bc;L of cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) was added to each well of a 96-well E-plate to obtain a background reading. A suspension of 18,000 Vero E6 cells in 50 &#x003bc;L of cell culture medium was seeded per each well, and plates were placed on the analyzer. Measurements were taken automatically every 15 minutes and the sensograms were visualized using RTCA software version 2.1.0 (ACEA Biosciences Inc). VSV-SARS-CoV virus (5,000 PFU per well, ~0.3 MOI) was mixed with a saturating neutralizing concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g/mL in a total volume of 100 mL and incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. At 16 to 20 hours after seeding the cells, the virus-antibody mixtures were added into 1&#x02013;88 replicate wells of 96-well E-plates with cell monolayers. Wells containing only virus in the absence of antibody and wells containing only Vero E6 cells in medium were included on each plate as controls. Plates were measured continuously (every 15 minutes) for 72 hours. The escape mutants were identified by unexpectedly high CPE in wells containing neutralizing antibody. To verify escape from antibody selection, isolated viruses were assessed in a subsequent RTCA experiment in the presence of 20 &#x003bc;g/mL of mAb, as was used for the escape virus selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis of the gene encoding S protein from S protein expressing VSV escape mutants.</title><p>To identify escape mutations, present in S protein-expressing VSV mAb-selected escape variants, the escape viruses isolated after RTCA escape screening were propagated in 6-well culture plates with confluent Vero E6 cells in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;g/mL of the corresponding antibody. Viral RNA was isolated using a QiAmp Viral RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) from aliquots of supernatant containing a suspension of the selected virus population. The S protein gene cDNA was amplified with a SuperScript IV 1-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using primers flanking the S gene. The amplified PCR product (4,000 bp) was purified using SPRI magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 ratio and sequenced by the Sanger sequence technique using primers giving forward and reverse reads of the S protein (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Protection against WT SARS-CoV-MA15 in mice.</title><p>Ten-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and used for virological, clinical disease, and survival studies.

Anti-SARS-CoV human mAbs or isotype control mABS were administered 24 hour before SARS-CoV-MA15 inoculation. Weights and lethality were monitored daily for up to 4 days after inoculation and mice were euthanized at 4 dpi and tissues were collected. Gross pathology (congestion score) of the lung was assessed and scored on a scale from &#x02018;0&#x02019; (no lung congestion) to &#x02018;4&#x02019; (severe congestion affecting all lung lobes). For plaque assay, homogenates were diluted serially 10-fold and applied to Vero-furin cell monolayers in 12-well plates.
