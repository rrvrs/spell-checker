</self-uri><abstract><p>High circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism is proposed to be a key driver of the skeletal phenotype of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) leading to high bone turnover and cortical bone deterioration. The association between high PTH and the skeletal phenotype is typically clearly demonstrated in preclinical models of CKD; however, clinical studies show the relationship between PTH and skeletal outcomes is not as clear. The clinical data have led to a proposed hyporesponsiveness to PTH in the CKD setting with unclear causes. In the current study, we assessed skeletally mature male C57BL/6J mice at 12-weeks and 21-weeks of adenine-induced CKD (Ad) with the second timepoint seven weeks longer than we have previously assessed. We found that serum BUN was high in Ad mice in both groups indicating the presence of kidney disease while PTH was higher in 21-wk Ad vs. 12-wk Ad. Despite the higher PTH, bone formation rate in 21-wk Ad mice was lower than 21-wk Ad mice. Additionally, immunohistochemical assessment of the PTH receptor, PTHR1, and RANKL, a key factor upregulated by PTH, showed a lower percentage of osteocytes positive for the proteins in 21-wk Ad vs. 12-wk Ad. Furthermore, regression analyses demonstrated a positive relationship between serum PTH and PTHR1 and RANKL at 12-weeks, but this relationship was lost by 21-weeks. Overall, these data indicate that prolonged exposure to continuously elevated PTH in adenine-induced CKD mice eventually led to an altered skeletal response indicating lower responsiveness of bone, particularly osteocytes, to the chronic PTH signal. This has implications for using PTH as a surrogate marker of bone outcomes in CKD as well as pointing to the need to better understand the time-based relationship between PTH and skeletal outcomes in CKD.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

With declines in kidney function, complications impacting the skeleton occur, known collectively as CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Fracture rates are higher in patients with CKD compared to the general population at all ages [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in both pre-dialysis [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and dialysis patients [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, post-fracture complications, including cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and mortality, are high in CKD patients [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>One component of CKD-MBD is high circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism which is postulated to cause high bone turnover with resorption exceeding formation favoring bone loss. For example, cortical bone deterioration over approximately ~1.5 years in CKD patients was related to circulating PTH levels [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, clinical bone biopsy studies show a more complex picture with ~40&#x02013;50% of CKD patients having low bone turnover, often termed adynamic bone disease in renal osteodystrophy [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One bone biopsy study found that the adynamic bone phenotype was associated with PTH levels above the upper limit of normal range [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which contrasts with the idea that PTH is a potent stimulator of bone remodeling. Therefore, it appears the relationship between circulating levels of PTH and skeletal outcomes in clinical CKD is complex. For these reasons, skeletal hyporesponsiveness to PTH (also called skeletal resistance to PTH) has been proposed to occur in CKD [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but what causes it and to what extent or in what conditions it occurs remains largely unknown.</p><p>In contrast to human clinical bone biopsy studies, pre-clinical animal models consistently demonstrate clear associations between high circulating PTH and cortical bone loss, particularly cortical porosity development [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and high trabecular bone formation and bone resorption [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Animal models of CKD generally model a high PTH/high bone turnover phenotype including 5/6 nephrectomy [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], adenine-induced CKD [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and genetic models like the Cy/&#x02009;+&#x02009;rat [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. One challenge with translating animal models to clinical scenarios is that most animal experiments are relatively short duration. Therefore, the impact of prolonged (i.e., over 3 months) elevated PTH in an animal model of CKD is not well established. In this current project, we compared male C57BL/6J mice with adenine-induced CKD at two time points &#x02013; 12-weeks and 21-weeks after initiating the adenine diet. We originally hypothesized that prolonged CKD with continuously high PTH levels at 21-weeks would lead to greater cortical porosity and higher bone turnover than 12-weeks. Our results contradict this hypothesis, suggesting this model, when allowed to continue development over time, may be suitable to study skeletal hyporesponsiveness to PTH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6J mice (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;33) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (JAX #000664) at 15 weeks of age and allowed to acclimate to the facility for one week. Mice were group housed 3&#x02013;5 per cage in an institutionally approved animal facility with 12-hr light/dark cycles and an average room temperature of 70&#x000b0; F. Treatments were based on cage due to the diet induction. Confounders due to cage location could not be fully controlled due to space within the facility. At 16 weeks of age, all control mice (CON; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) were switched from the facility-provided grain-based diet to a purified casein-based diet with 0.9% phosphorous and 0.6% calcium (Teklad Diets [TD.150303]; Inotiv, Madison, WI, USA). All adenine-induced CKD mice (AD; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) were switched to an identical purified casein-based diet with the inclusion of 0.2% adenine (Teklad Diets [TD.170948]; Inotiv). After a 6-week induction period on the diets, all AD mice were switched back to the control casein-based diet without adenine for the remainder of the study protocol as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The CON groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) remained on the casein-based diet without adenine for the entire study protocol. After 12-weeks of adenine initiation, the 12-week groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9/group) were fully anesthetized via vaporized inhaled isoflurane and continuously monitored with the depth anesthesia confirmed via lack of toe pinch reflex. Animals were then humanely euthanized via exsanguination following by thoracotomy. The 21-week timepoint groups (CON&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, AD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) were euthanized 21-weeks after the initiation of diets (<xref rid="pone.0324628.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). All mice were injected with fluorochrome calcein labels 7 and 2 days prior to euthanasia. All mice were checked daily for health, normal activity, and cage nest quality (described below) and body weight was monitored weekly. No animals showed signs of pain or distress or experienced rapid, unexpected weight loss throughout the protocol and no mice required supportive treatment of any kind. No analgesia was used or was necessary during the entire protocol. Previous work has established n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 as sufficient for detecting differences between control and adenine in serum PTH and cortical porosity. All animals made it to the planned study endpoint and no animals were excluded from analyses. All animal procedures were approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Animal Use and Care Committee prior to the initiation of experimental protocols and methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0324628.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324628.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Study schematic, body weight, and serum markers.

Once a week, all cages received two Bed-r-Nest pucks (The Andersons, Inc., Maumee, OH, USA) and one Nestlet (Ancare, Bellmore, NY, USA) that were not separated/manipulated by caretakers. 24-hours later the cages were graded on the 3-dimensional nest (grades 2&#x02013;5 with 2 a flat nest and 5 a full domed nest), intactness and incorporation of the Bed-r-Nest (scale of 1&#x02013;5 with 1 untouched and 5 fully incorporated into nest), and intactness and incorporation of the Nestlet (scale of 1&#x02013;5 with 1 untouched and 5 fully incorporated into nest). Individual cage scores were then combined to have a total cage score out of 15. Nesting scores were obtained from weeks 3&#x02013;11 of the study protocol as this is the time that weight loss is most prominent in the model.

Samples were subsequently embedded in paraffin and longitudinally sectioned to 5 &#x000b5;m thickness. Sections were stained utilizing a standard avidin-biotin method. Samples were stained for receptor activator of nuclear facto &#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTHR1; Abcam), and annexin V, an early cellular marker of apoptosis (Abcam). Peroxidase development was performed with an enzyme substrate kit (DAB, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and nuclear stain counterstaining with methyl green (Vector Laboratories). Negative controls for all antibodies were completed by omitting the primary antibody. Analyses were completed in both the trabecular bone for the proximal femur and in the cortical bone closest to midshaft. Results are reported as the percentage of osteocytes stained positively for the protein (DAB-positive) relative to all osteocytes (DAB-positive and methyl green-positive) in the regions of interest.

Nesting scores and body weight across the adenine induction and early recovery phase were measured by a mixed model ANOVA with time as a repeated factor. If data were normally distributed, data were analyzed with a 2x2 Factorial ANOVA (disease-by-time) with all main and interaction effects recorded. When the model 2x2 ANOVA p-value was statistically significant, a Tukey HSD post hoc test was completed to assess individual group differences. When data did not meet normality assumptions (with a Shapiro-Wilk test of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), data were run with a Kruskal-Wallis test. When the Kruskal-Wallis test was statistically different, a Steel-Dwass post hoc test was completed to assess individual group differences while controlling for the overall error rate. For pore network from micro-CT and pore histology assessments, which were only done in CKD groups due to the presence of porosity, normally distributed data were analyzed with a Student&#x02019;s t-test. Data that did not meet normality assumptions were analyzed with a Wilcoxon test. Data that did not meet normality standards are called out with the nonparametric test used in the results text (Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon). Regression analyses were completed between serum PTH (independent factor) and cortical osteocyte PTHR1 and RANKL (separately as dependent factors).

Most notably we show that despite 9 more weeks of compromised kidney function and continued elevated PTH, there was a blunted skeletal response in bone formation rate and osteocytes positive for PTHR1 and RANKL. Regression analyses highlight positive relationships between serum PTH and cortical osteocyte PTHR1 and RANKL at the 12-week time point which is lost by the 21-week time point. These results show the time-dependent PTH dynamics in CKD and suggest that prolonged exposure to high PTH alters the osteocyte response to PTH. This has implications both for using serum PTH as a sole surrogate for bone status in CKD as well as the timing and likely efficacy of therapeutics aimed to reduce high circulating PTH to protect bone.</p><p>The clinical progression of CKD is typically slow and heterogeneous over months or years. In contrast, animal models of CKD often progress quite rapidly and homogenously.

In our previous experience with the adenine-induced CKD model in C57Bl/6J mice, we have noted what appears to be a more stable disease condition between 10&#x02013;14 weeks post-induction of adenine [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we aimed to explore disease stability and skeletal properties over a more prolonged period. We found the overall well-being of the animals to be high, as evidenced by the fact that adenine-induced CKD mice were active, well-groomed, displaying natural nest building behaviors, and had no additional weight loss between 12- and 21-weeks. BUN was high at both timepoints indicating the presence of kidney disease, while PTH was statistically higher at 21-weeks vs. 12-weeks. Overall, the mice exhibited a maintained CKD state with continued elevations in PTH.</p><p>Cortical porosity is a common skeletal feature of CKD with high PTH. Previously, we have demonstrated the progression of porosity development in different models. In the naturally progressing Cy/&#x02009;+&#x02009;rat model, cortical porosity develops rapidly within ~5 weeks in the tibia [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and appears throughout the skeleton by ~35 weeks of age [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the development of adenine-induced CKD, C57Bl/6J mice had approximately double the cortical porosity in the femur between 6- and 10-weeks post adenine induction [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the current study, we found that cortical porosity was present in both adenine groups regardless of time. Analysis of the volumetric pore network showed that 21-week adenine mice had greater pore number than did the 12-week adenine mice. We do not know at what point in the 9-week period between the groups the development of porosity was most rapid, if it continued to develop at a steady state, or if porosity development slowed at some point. Intracortical bone formation rate analyses and osteoclast assessments within the pores in adenine-CKD groups showed no difference between the two timepoints indicating the formation/resorption balance was not different at the two study endpoints.</p><p>An intriguing finding of this study was lower bone formation rate in the 21-week adenine-CKD mice vs. the 12-week adenine-CKD mice which occurred despite the continued high PTH. This was the result of both lower mineralized surface and lower mineral apposition rate at the later timepoint indicating both a reduction in the number and activity of osteoblast teams on trabecular surfaces. This counter-intuitive finding led us to investigate whether a hyporesponsiveness to PTH occurred due to the prolonged exposure to high PTH. Immunohistochemistry for the PTH receptor, PTHR1, showed ~2-fold higher trabecular osteocytes positive for the receptor in 12-week adenine-induced CKD mice compared to controls; within the 21-week groups, adenine-CKD mice had higher (~50%) but more modest elevations compared to controls. Similar patterns were seen with RANKL, a key factor in bone upregulated by PTH. In cortical bone, there were no differences between 21-week control and 21-week adenine mice in either PTHR1- or RANKL-positive osteocytes. Regression analyses demonstrated that circulating PTH statistically predicted ~60&#x02013;70% of the variability in cortical osteocytes positive for PTHR1 and RANKL only at the 12-week timepoint. When regression analyses were performed with both timepoints together, there was no statistical relationship present. Furthermore, when only assessing the 21-week timepoint, there was no statistical relationship between PTH and PTHR1 and there was a mild, but statistically significant inverse relationship between PTH and RANKL. Together these data indicate that prolonged exposure to high PTH in the context of CKD eventually leads to altered osteocyte characteristics in response to elevated PTH.</p><p>We found that both osteoclast surfaces and osteoclast numbers in trabecular remained high in adenine-CKD mice regardless of the timepoint, despite lower bone formation rate at the later time point. PTH signaling increases bone turnover which typically results in high bone resorption and high bone formation. In this context, the high bone resorption remained at the later timepoint while bone formation rate was blunted. It is likely that various other factors contribute to high osteoclasts in CKD including circulating uremic toxins, oxidative stress, and a pro-inflammatory state induced by CKD. Therefore, in this model it appears that osteoclast drive remains high despite lower PTHR1 and reduced RANKL in osteocytes. One potential contributing factor to the high osteoclasts at both timepoints is increased osteocyte apoptosis as seen by elevated annexin V-positive osteocytes found in adenine-CKD mice at both timepoints, particularly in trabecular bone. Previously, we found lower annexin V-positive osteocytes in younger female C57BL/6J adenine-CKD mice at earlier time points [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which we attributed to elevated PTH inhibiting osteocyte apoptosis. However, in this study at later timepoints in skeletally mature male mice, annexin V-positive osteocytes were higher in CKD. It is possible that a PTH-induced decrease in apoptosis may be lost earlier in the disease course particularly as other CKD-induced factors increase. Since osteocyte apoptosis is a driving signal for targeted bone resorption [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it is possible the high osteoclasts at the later timepoint with blunted PTHR1 and RANKL is due to the continued higher osteocyte apoptosis. Additionally, this demonstrates that PTH signaling alone is not the only driver of skeletal changes due to CKD.</p><p>The concept of skeletal hyporesponsiveness to PTH in CKD, also called skeletal resistance to PTH in some literature, is poorly understood, but has been alluded to as a factor contributing to the highly variable skeletal response to CKD seen clinically. Recently, Evenepoel and J&#x000f8;rgensen highlighted that the variability of responsiveness to PTH clinically compromises its viability as a biomarker of bone turnover [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some evidence in clinical literature points to continually high PTH in CKD resulting in lower responsiveness. For example, infusion of PTH showed a lower calcemic response in CKD patients [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another study found that 46 hours of infusion with PTH(1&#x02013;34) resulted in increased serum calcium in control and low bone turnover hemodialysis patients, but no change in high turnover hemodialysis patients [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There also appears to be population differences in skeletal responsiveness to PTH with differences in Japanese vs. Belgian hemodialysis patients [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Within one cohort of CKD patients, PTH levels above the upper limit of normal were associated with adynamic bone, a condition with low resorption and low formation [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As PTH stimulates increased bone turnover, this effect is hypothesized to be due to a lack of responsiveness to PTH in these patients [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies have also shown downregulation of PTHR1 mRNA in osteoblasts in ESRD patients [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] while another study found higher PTHR1 in bone compared to healthy controls in earlier CKD stages (stages 2&#x02013;3) while stage 5 CKD, when circulating intact PTH was highest, was not different from control levels [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Overall, these studies demonstrate the complexity of the clinical skeletal response to CKD and allude to high variability the responsiveness to PTH.</p><p>One challenge hindering a greater understanding of skeletal hyporesponsiveness to PTH in CKD is a lack of animal models showing this effect. Many animal models move rapidly through advanced stages of CKD limiting the ability to study a prolonged state of high PTH. Without manipulation, most animal models show a clear relationship between high PTH and high bone turnover. A couple of studies have aimed to experimentally explore the impact of CKD without high PTH in animal models. One such study assessed the calcemic response of infusion of PTH in rats with parathyroidectomy with or without CKD induced via 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) and found a decreased calcemic response in Nx rats [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another study assessed thyroparathyroidectomy (TPTx) and 5/6 Nx in rats with a constant infusion of a physiological dose of PTH and showed low bone formation rate and reduced expression of PTHR1 in rats with both TPTx and Nx compared to those with only TPTx [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Both studies indicate that CKD itself may alter bone&#x02019;s responsiveness to PTH, but this effect may be masked by naturally progressing secondary hyperparathyroidism. In our current study, we found blunted bone formation rate and lower PTHR1 and RANKL in adenine-CKD mice with no manipulation other than length of time with adenine-induced CKD. This study indicates that the length of time exposed to high PTH likely plays a role in the development of skeletal hyporesponsiveness to CKD. As the adenine model requires no further experimental manipulation, it potentially could lead to further insights into the relationship between time, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and the skeletal phenotype in CKD.</p><p>Limitations of this study include using only male mice. We previously have reported similar phenotypes in adenine-induced CKD in both male and female C57Bl/6J mice [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], however, we have not assessed female mice to a timepoint later than 14-weeks post-induction with CKD [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, we only assessed one age and are unable to conclude how this response could be different at different ages. Other factors associated with CKD including systemic inflammation and oxidative stress may also contribute to the skeletal response to CKD, but the causal relationships have not yet been defined. Finally, some <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies have alluded to how uremic toxins may contribute to inducing skeletal hyporesponsiveness to CKD. For example, uremic ultrafiltrate from hemodialysis patients reduced PTHR1 mRNA when cultured with osteoblast-like cells [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] while another study found the uremic toxin, indoxyl sulfate, reduced PTHR1 expression in cultured osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0324628.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Future work should assess uremic toxins over time and compare with circulating PTH and the skeletal phenotype.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that 12-weeks of adenine-induced CKD resulted in high bone formation rate and a high percentage of osteocytes positive for PTHR1 and RANKL; however, nine weeks more of exposure to high PTH led to blunted responses in all these factors. These data allude to a time-based development of hyporesponsiveness to chronically elevated PTH in CKD. Whether this is due solely to the prolonged exposure to PTH or other CKD-related factors or a combination of both is unclear; however, this demonstrates that measurements of serum PTH in CKD may not correlate with skeletal changes. Furthermore, these data point to the need to greater understand the timing and how to assess the efficacy of therapeutics that lower PTH in the time course of CKD development to maximize the effectiveness of these treatments on bone.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324628.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Nesting scores and body weights during adenine induction and immediate recovery.</title><p>A) Cage nesting scores recorded during weeks 3&#x02013;12 of the study.

</p><p>Reviewer #1: The longitudinal design of the study is a notable strength, as it captures the progression of skeletal changes over time&#x02014;a feature often lacking in animal models of CKD.</p><p>However, there are several areas where the study could be improved.

Second, while the study identifies altered osteocyte characteristics and reduced expression of PTH receptor 1 (PTHR1) and receptor activator of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL) as potential mechanisms, it does not explore the role of other CKD-related factors, such as uremic toxins or systemic inflammation, which may also contribute to skeletal hypo responsiveness.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comments. In the limitations paragraph we addressed the limitation of only assessing male mice as well as the need to address uremic toxins and their role in future studies with citations of in vitro work on that front.
