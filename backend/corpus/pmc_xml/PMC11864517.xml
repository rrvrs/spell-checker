According to the United Nations&#x02019; estimates, 143 million people are today aged 80 years or older. By 2050, there will be nearly 430 million 80-year-olds worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Sleep apnea in the elderly is associated with several adverse health consequences and a wide variety of comorbid conditions [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Elderly people partially share the same sleep apnea symptom profile as middle-aged individuals [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, it is possible that cognitive impairment, nocturnal urination and recurrent falls can be the main complaints in elderly individuals [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to previous studies the cardinal symptom of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), is often absent or at least experienced milder in the elderly [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The symptoms of sleep apnea can also be confused with the physiological changes related to aging, such as a decline in sleep quality and cognition.</p><p>Depression is another important public health concern that is associated with a great deal of human suffering and high healthcare costs. Multiple studies have linked obstructive sleep apnea with depression and a range of other psychiatric disorders [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The prevalence of depressive symptoms and clinically diagnosed depression are higher among patients with sleep apnea than in those without it [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There is some evidence of comorbidity between depression and sleep apnea also in the elderly [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, deeper understanding of the direction of association between these conditions and their impact on elderly patients&#x02019; health is needed.</p><p>The commitment of the elderly to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment has long been of interest. Concomitant depressive symptoms may however impair adherence to CPAP treatment [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In population studies, the prevalence of major depression ranges from 0.9% to 42% among elderly [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] whereas prevalence of sleep apnea in older people in the general population can vary from 20% all the way to 80% [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Finnish population studies have estimated 12-month prevalence of clinically significant depression in the adult population and young people to be approximately 5&#x02013;7% and slightly lower in the over 65-year-olds [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In a study by Markkula et al. the 12-month prevalence of depressive disorder was as high as 8% in those aged 75 or older [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In a study published by Acker et al. the prevalence of depression was found to be 21.5% among adult people with sleep apnea [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Given the high prevalence rates and shared symptoms of these conditions we may end up in misdiagnosing sleep apnea for depression or vice versa.</p><p>There are also limited data regarding gender differences in symptoms, comorbidities as well as cardiorespiratory polygraphy (PG) variables of elderly sleep apnea patients. It has been stated that women are more likely to suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Whether this is also true in elderly patients is unknown. Multimorbidity in individuals with sleep apnea is highly prevalent [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] but data on the burden of comorbidities especially in the elderly sleep apnea patients is scarce. We wanted to find out how multimorbidity, age and gender affect the symptoms of sleep apnea in the elderly and enhance especially the understanding of role of depression in the elderly sleep apnea patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients and data extraction</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive retrospective registry study of consecutive patients aged 18 years and over diagnosed with sleep apnea at Turku University Hospital in years 2012&#x02013;2019. Patients with sleep apnea were identified from electronic medical records using G47.3 ICD-10 code (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition). Out of the 13,651 patients found, we included patients for whom sleep registration data could be found at least partially and whose sleep apnea based on the apnea&#x02013;hypopnea index (AHI) was at least moderate (AHI &#x0003e;&#x02009;15).</p><p>The study was approved by the Turku University Hospital Clinical Research Center which is our Institutional Review Board (Approval number: TO5/040/19). Patient integrity was not compromised as we used anonymised patient hospital records without contacting the patients, and therefore the permission of the ethics committee or the patient&#x02019;s informed consent was not required according to Finnish legislation. Auria Clinical Informatics (Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland) collected data from electronic medical records between April 21, 2020 and December 5, 2022. The data was accessed for research purposes for the first time on August 8, 2020.</p><p>In accordance with local practice, the majority of the PG examinations are performed in primary care or occupational health care. Thereafter, patients diagnosed with sleep apnea are referred to specialist care if lifestyle modifications and positional treatment are judged to be inadequate. A smaller proportion of PG&#x02019;s are performed at the Department of Pulmonary diseases or Clinical Neurophysiology, most of them as ambulatory investigations. Less than one percentage of patients are diagnosed with polysomnography (PSG).</p><p>PG or PSG data from patients diagnosed with sleep apnea as well as anthropometrics, data from capillary blood gas analysis, ESS score [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], depression scale score (DEPS) [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire score (GHQ-12) [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] were collected from electronic medical records using a search algorithm. Values for all variables were obtained, if possible, from the start date of sleep apnea treatment, or from the date closest to start date.</p><p>Sleep studies were scored according to the rules of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine valid at the time of performed sleep studies. AHI was used to describe sleep apnea severity. Hard copies of sleep study reports from PGs performed elsewhere than the hospital were not included in electronic health records. Furthermore, medical narratives were often short and not including all data of sleep study reports resulting in missing data.</p><p>Mean and minimum values of peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) measured by pulse oximeter were obtained from sleep studies. ESS was used to assess subjective daytime sleepiness. Usually, 10 points or more is interpreted as clearly abnormal, indicating EDS. DEPS [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] is a tool for identifying depressive symptoms and screening for depression. About one-third of those scoring 9 points or more on DEPS, and nearly half of those scoring 12 points or more have depression. GHQ-12 [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] measures psychological distress. If the subject receives 3 points or more, the test is &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d;, in which case the sensitivity for the diagnosis of mental illness is about 70% and the specificity is about 75%.</p><p>For assessing multimorbidity and heavy multimorbidity, we retrieved comorbidity data from the patient data system. We obtained data on diagnoses that were present prior or at the time of sleep apnea diagnosis. We then classified the diseases relevant to sleep apnea according to the classification introduced by Palom&#x000e4;ki et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] which is, in turn, based on models introduced by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare and Calder&#x000f3;n-Larra&#x000f1;aga et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>An individual was classified as multimorbid if two or more chronic diseases were present prior or at the time of sleep apnea diagnosis and heavily multimorbid if they had at least four chronic diseases. Comorbidity data was available from 2004 to 2019. The ICD-10 codes were available with a precision of the first three characters. For this study, we also collected information about the diagnosis of depression with ICD-10 codes F32, F33 and F34.</p><p>Capillary blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CB-pCO<sub>2</sub>) is generally determined especially in obese and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with sleep apnea to identify concomitant hypercapnic respiratory failure such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For descriptive statistics and basic data analysis, patients were divided into three age groups: &#x0003c;70 (young-middle aged adults), 70&#x02013;80 (elderly) and those over 80 years of age (very elderly).</p><p>Descriptive clinical characteristics of the sample were summarized by listing means and standard deviation for continuous variables, unless otherwise stated. Continuous variables were compared between two age groups using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, and with the Kruskal-Wallis H test for multiple comparisons. The Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables between age groups. From the multiple comparisons we reported the Bonferroni corrected adjusted p-values.</p><p>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was conducted to analyze the effects of age, gender, AHI, mean SpO<sub>2</sub>, minimum SpO<sub>2,</sub> CB-pCO<sub>2</sub>, BMI, ESS score, pre-existing diagnosis of depression and multimorbidity on the likelihood of having DEPS score at least 9. We reported data as odds ratio (95% confidence interval). Patients at least 70 years of age at the time of diagnosis were included in the regression analyses. Missing values were handled by available-case method in statistical analyses.</p><p>The p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (IBM Corp. Released 2020. IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec005"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 5870 patients were included in the study (Men&#x02009;= 3855, 65.7%; mean age 57.5 &#x000b1; 13.5 years).

To the best of our knowledge, compared to previous similar studies comparing age and gender differences of sleep apnea, our study included the highest proportion of persons over the age of 80 (&#x0201c;very elderly&#x0201d;).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the link between body weight and sleep apnea deteriorates to some extent with age [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The results of our study suggest that almost half of the very elderly with at least moderate sleep apnea are obese, but in line with previous findings the elderly were less obese than the young-middle-aged.</p><p>It is known that the prevalence of sleep apnea tends to rise with age [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We do not know to what extent the increased prevalence of sleep apnea is due only to the physiological increase in AHI with aging [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is also poorly known whether there is a ceiling effect with age for this rising tendency of AHI and, how does the increasing severity of sleep apnea affect the symptoms in different age groups and gender. For this study, we selected patients whose AHI was over 15, i.e., the severity of sleep apnea was at least moderate to reduce the effect of physiological AHI increase on our research results. The severity of sleep apnea did not differ between age groups based on any of the PG variables studied. AHI was, however, somewhat higher in men than in women in every age group.</p><p>It has been stated that older patients suffer less from daytime sleepiness [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, most studies use ESS as a measure of EDS, which may underestimate the symptoms in older adults with sleep apnea. In a study by Iannella et al. persons over 65 years of age had a lower average ESS compared with the younger ones [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our study is the first to compare over 80-year-olds to younger age groups. The patients in our cohort were surprisingly homogeneous not only in terms of PG measurements but also regarding daytime sleepiness even when considering the selectivity of the group. Young-middle aged women had higher ESS scores compared to young-middle aged men. Apart from that, there did not seem to be any differences between the groups.</p><p>In addition to daytime sleepiness, sleep apnea can manifest as insomnia, impaired quality of life and depression. Depressive symptoms in sleep apnea are more common in women [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There is some evidence that depression is recognized as a comorbidity also in the elderly [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To our knowledge there is no data on the prevalence of depression diagnosis in elderly sleep apnea patients. Sforza et al. investigated the rate of depressive symptoms from healthy elderly with unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea and found out that neither the existence nor the severity of the sleep apnea was associated with anxiety or depression score [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Different questionnaires are widely used in studies investigating depression or depressive symptoms in sleep apnea patients. However, the actual diagnosis of depression cannot be based only on symptom questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms do not reliably differentiate between transient depressive symptoms and DSM-5 criteria of depression. The diagnosis of depression is always based on the symptoms found during the interview, the number, severity, duration and temporal predominance of them, and ruling out differential diagnoses with physical examination and laboratory tests. In our study levels of depressive symptoms were consistently higher in women than men of comparable age including the very elderly, which is in line with the previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In men, the DEPS score was higher in the very elderly than in other age groups (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). For women, the DEPS score also appeared to be slightly higher in the very elderly than in younger age groups. Interestingly, in contrast, there was a decreasing trend in the number of depression diagnoses with increasing age in both men and women. For both men and women, the number of depression diagnoses differed in the youngest age group compared to others. We also examined the prevalence DEPS scores of at least 9 by age group and gender. In very elderly women 46.8% of patients had DEPS score of at least 9, whereas in very elderly men, 32.1% achieved this score. It has been studied that about one-third of those scoring 9 points or more on the DEPS, have depression [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We can speculate that among moderate-severe sleep apnea patients about 15% of very elderly women and 10% of very elderly men are likely to have depression. When compared the proportions with pre-diagnosed depression, the gap is significant. Considering that ICD-10 code F34 includes not only long-term depression but also other long-term mood disorders, this difference is even more significant.</p><p>It is possible that a larger proportion of elderly depression remains undiagnosed in the elderly, perhaps due to prejudice that depression is a normal part of ageing. Indeed, a large Brazilian National Survey with 70,806 participants (15&#x02013;107 years old) found that the prevalence of depression underdiagnosis was higher in the among elderly population [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. On the other hand, as mentioned, the symptoms of depression and sleep apnea can resemble each other, especially in the elderly. Symptom questionnaires may also somewhat overestimate the difficulty of the situation. The patient data for our study was from specialized medical care. It is possible that it underestimates the prevalence of depression, especially milder depression. On the other hand, the situation is the same for all age groups.</p><p>GHQ-12 scores were higher in the very elderly compared to other age groups meaning higher levels of mental distress. The same difference was also observed when a cut-off value of at least 3 points was used for the comparison of GHQ-12 scores. Using the same cut-off value we found a significant difference between the genders in the young-middle aged and elderly age groups.</p><p>Partial pressures of carbon dioxide from capillary blood were slightly higher in young-middle aged men compared to very elderly which probably is the result of obesity and subsequent hypoventilation being more frequent in the young-middle-aged. In contrast, women&#x02019;s CB-pCO<sub>2</sub> values were higher in the oldest age group which can be thought to be impact of late menopause on ventilatory control [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>As expected, the proportion of multimorbid and heavy-multimorbid people increased with age. There was no significant gender difference in the two oldest age groups.</p><p>Lastly, we wanted to find out in more detail which factors influence the appearance of depressive symptoms in elderly and very elderly sleep apnea patients. In the multivariate analysis, the female gender stood out by being the most significant factor influencing the occurrence of depressive symptoms. Interestingly, mean SpO<sub>2</sub> also contributed to the occurrence of depressive symptoms, although AHI or multimorbidity had no effect. We also found a link between depressive symptoms and daytime sleepiness. It is not surprising that daytime sleepiness is also reflected in mood. Condoleo et al. showed a significant improvement in depressive symptoms after treatment of sleep apnea with CPAP [<xref rid="pone.0318569.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, it is also possible that daytime fatigue is caused by concomitant depression and is not directly related to sleep apnea.</p><p>Our study highlights the impact of age and gender on the presentation of sleep apnea in the elderly population. More detailed exploration of different presentation of phenotypes and their impact on treatment adherence as well as treatment efficacy is needed in order to focus the limited healthcare resources cost-effectively.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>There are some major strengths in our study. First, we utilized a large number (N = 5870) of real-world patient data for these analyses, which included a high percentage of females. Second, the proportion of the very elderly (&#x0003e;80-year-olds) in this dataset is, to our knowledge, higher than that of any other similar study. Third, in addition to cardiorespiratory polygraphy measurement and different symptom questionnaires, our study also included information on anthropomorphic measurements such as BMI. We also had comorbidity data at our disposal.</p><p>There are, however, also limitations of this study that need to be considered. Firstly, we did not have a healthy control group available, therefore we cannot draw definite conclusions whether the patients&#x02019; symptoms are due to sleep apnea or some other unknown factor. However, our intention was to compare, sleep apnea symptoms and other variables by age group and gender, and we think we succeeded in that. Secondly, PSG is the gold standard when diagnosing sleep apnea, and more accurately determines the severity of sleep apnea. Therefore, we cannot exclude that using PG may overlook or weaken some differences between the age groups or genders. Thirdly, due to the retrospective study design, there was a high number of missing values in most variables. However, AHI was available for all patients included in the study, so we were able to compare patients by sleep apnea severity and deliberately selected only patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea, ranked by AHI. The patient data of our cohort consists of patients sent to specialized medical care which may limit the generalisability of the findings. Information on, for example, the mildest depressions that have been treated in primary health care or occupational health care was not necessarily available. For this particular study, we had access to the sum of comorbidities for each patient and data on previous depression diagnoses. No information was available on whether the patient was still suffering from depression. The same limitation applies to other comorbidities. For technical reasons, we were unable to distinguish between temporary diagnoses and long-term and permanent diagnoses. Lastly, we did not account for differences across race or ethnicity. However, the population is known to be very homogenous especially in the two oldest age groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study revealed that some of the clinical features found in the young-middle aged (&#x02009;&#x0003c; 70 years old) and in the elderly (70&#x02013;80 years old) are also present in the very elderly (&#x0003e;80 years old). The claim about less daytime sleepiness in the elderly sleep apnea patients does not seem to be true in patients with at least moderate sleep apnea.</p><p>While the severity of sleep apnea did not differ between age groups based on any of the cardiorespiratory polygraphy variables studied, there were differences in perceived symptoms.</p><p>Occurrence of mental distress was higher in the very elderly, suggesting higher likelihood of psychiatric conditions. Levels of depressive symptoms in women were consistently higher than in men of comparable age including the very elderly, which is in line with the previous studies.</p><p>We found a significant gap in the number of depression diagnoses and high scores of the DEPS questionnaire mapping the occurrence of depression which can mean a significant amount of undiagnosed depression, especially in the elderly and very elderly. We showed the link between occurrence of depressive symptoms and age, female gender, CB-pCO<sub>2</sub>, ESS score and mean SpO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Sleep apnea should not be ignored in older adults and studies focusing on specific characteristics and outcome as well as effectiveness of CPAP treatment in older adults are needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec009" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0318569.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>The proportion of GHQ-12 score &#x02265; 3 among sleep apnea patients by age group and gender.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0318569.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0318569.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>The proportion of DEPS score &#x02265; 9 among sleep apnea patients by age group and gender.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0318569.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0318569.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>United Nations; Department of Economic and Social Affairs; Population Division</collab>.

</p><p>We would kindly like to thank the reviewers for devoting their valuable time to review our manuscript. Our detailed responses to the specific comments can be found below in italics.</p><p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript "Depressive symptoms are more common in elderly sleep apnea patients" by Olli Lyyra et al. addresses a topic that has been relatively underexplored, namely sleep apnea in the elderly, and highlights how mental well-being can impact the worsening of this clinical condition.

In my opinion, the manuscript is worthy of publication.</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for these positive and encouraging comments.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This study offers important insights into sleep apnea in older adults, with a particular focus on gender differences. By analyzing a large group including a significant number of very elderly individuals, it adds valuable data to existing research. A key finding is that while the severity of sleep apnea didn&#x02019;t vary much across age groups, symptoms like daytime sleepiness and mental distress did. The study also sheds light on the underdiagnosis of depression, particularly women. By exploring factors like SpO2 and ESS scores, it deepens our understanding of the connections between sleep apnea and over mental health.</p><p>We would sincerely like to thank the reviewer for these kind words and the constructive comments regarding the manuscript.</p><p>Major Issues:</p><p>The title "Depressive symptoms are more common in elderly sleep apnea patients" does not accurately reflect the full scope of the study.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We have now modified the title as follows: &#x0201c;Differences in the clinical presentation of sleep apnea patients according to age and gender&#x0201d;</p><p>Please provide an explanation and, if feasible, the rationale behind dividing your population in this manner, along with the sources that support this approach. For example, the United Nations defines an older person as someone over 60 years of age, while the most commonly used age to define elderly is 65.</p><p>Finnish people frequently work after their retirement age since it increases their pension. The old-age pension will increase by 0.4 per cent for each month that a employee retires late, that is, for each month past the month in which he/she reached his/her retirement age of 69 when the employer&#x02019;s statutory pension insurance obligation ends. Therefore people 60 to 65 and even 65-70 years old are often still very active both physically and socially. The proportion of frail elderly people rises more thereafter. Based on these points, we decided to use the age of 70 as a cut-off point.</p><p>Provide a more detailed theoretical explanation for the gap in depression findings in your study, as this represents a significant limitation.</p><p>We have extended the Discussion, beginning from page 14, line 329 as follows: &#x0201c;It is possible that a larger proportion depression remains undiagnosed in the eldelry, perhaps due to prejudice that depression is a normal part of ageing. Indeed, a large Brazilian National Survey with 70,806 participants (15-107 years old) found that the prevalence of depression underdiagnosis was higher in the elderly population.&#x0201d; Faisal-Cury A, Ziebold C, Rodrigues DMO, Matijasevich A. Depression underdiagnosis: Prevalence and associated factors. A population-based study. J Psychiatr Res. 2022 Jul;151:157-165. doi: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.04.025.</p><p>Minor Issues:</p><p>The conclusion section needs better alignment with the organization of the results, particularly regarding the occurrence of depressive symptoms in women (lines 47), which should be explicitly addressed in the results section.</p><p>We have revised the Abstract&#x02019;s Results -section to better represent the differences in the elderly population as follows: &#x0201c;The severity of sleep apnea did not differ between the age-groups based on any of the PG variables studied. No significant differences wer found in the level of subjective daytime sleepiness between age-groups. Women had higher DEPS scores than men in all age-groups. Very elderly men had higher DEPS scores compared to men in other age-groups (6.3 &#x000b1;4.6 vs. 5.6 &#x000b1;5.9 vs. 5.1 &#x000b1;4.8, p&#x0003c;0.05) while the differences in DEPS scores did not reach significance among women. Each unit increase in SpO2 was associated with a 22% decrease in the odds of having a DEPS score of &#x02265;9.&#x0201d;</p><p>Further, we have revised the Conclusion as follows: &#x0201c;The severity of sleep apnea or subjective daytime sleepiness did not differ among age-groups in moderate-severe sleep apnea patients. Occurrence of depressive symptoms was consistently more common in women than in men of comparable age. Mental wellbeing was the worst in the very elderly. Higher SpO2 was associated with less depressive symptoms.&#x0201d;</p><p>The keywords overlook important terms like depression and psychological distress, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have added the terms &#x0201c;daytime sleepiness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;depression&#x0201d; and psychological distress&#x0201c; to the list of keywords.</p><p>A more critical examination is needed to assess the impact of using polysomnography, given its application in less than 1% of patients.</p><p>We have added the following text in limitations of the study, beginning from page16, line 374: &#x0201c;PSG is the gold standard when diagnosing sleep apnea, and more accurately determines the severity of sleep apnea. Therefore, we cannot exclude that using PG may overlook or weaken some differences between the age groups or genders.&#x0201d;</p><p>Offer a more detailed explanation of the distinction between clinically diagnosed depression and self-reported symptoms, highlighting the differences in diagnostic processes, criteria, and their implications for treatment.</p><p>We have now provided a more detailed explanation as follows, beginning from page 14, line 310: &#x0201c;However, the actual diagnosis of depression cannot be based only on symptom questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms do not reliably differentiate between transient depressive symptoms and DSM-5 criteria of depression. The diagnosis of depression is always based on the symptoms found during the interview, the number, severity, duration and temporal predominance of them, and ruling out differential diagnoses with physical examination and laboratory tests.&#x0201d;</p><p>Please incorporate age subtypes&#x02014;very elderly, elderly, young, and middle-aged&#x02014;into each table, and Replace 'Depression' with 'DEPS' in Table 5.</p><p>We have incorporated age subtypes into each table, and replaced &#x0201c;Depression&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;DEPS&#x0201d; in Table 5.</p><p>Add more information to contextualize your research and provide a clearer direction for future research, including potential areas for further exploration and development.</p><p>We have added the following text in Discussion on page 16: &#x0201c;Our study highlights the impact of age and gender on the presentation of sleep apnea in the elderly population. More detailed exploration of different presentation of phenotypes and their impact on treatment adherence as well as treatment efficacy is needed in order to focus the limited healthcare resources cost-effectively.&#x0201d;</p><p>While the conclusion is clear and concise, it is somewhat lengthy.</p><p>We have shortened the conclusions as follows:&#x0201d; This study revealed that some of the clinical features found in the young-middle aged (&#x0003c; 70 years old) and in the elderly (70 -80 years old) are also present in the very elderly (&#x0003e;80 years old). The claim about less daytime sleepiness in the elderly sleep apnea patients does not seem to be true in patients with at least moderate sleep apnea.</p><p>While the severity of sleep apnea did not differ between age groups based on any of the cardiorespiratory polygraphy variables studied, there were differences in perceived symptoms.</p><p>Occurrence of mental distress was higher in the very elderly suggesting higher likelihood of psychiatric conditions. Levels of depressive symptoms in women were consistently higher than in men of comparable age including the very elderly, which is in line with the previous studies.</p><p>We found a significant gap in the number of depression diagnoses and high scores of the DEPS questionnaire mapping the occurrence of depression which can mean a significant amount of undiagnosed depression, especially in the elderly and very elderly. We showed the link between occurrence of depressive symptoms and age, female gender, CB-pCO2, ESS score and mean SpO2.</p><p>Sleep apnea should not be ignored in older adults and studies focusing on specific characteristics and outcome as well as effectiveness of CPAP treatment in older adults are needed.&#x0201d;</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0318569.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to the Reviewers_final.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0318569.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0318569.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318569.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ebrahimi</surname><given-names>Mohammad Hossein</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Mohammad Hossein Ebrahimi</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Mohammad Hossein Ebrahimi</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0318569" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
