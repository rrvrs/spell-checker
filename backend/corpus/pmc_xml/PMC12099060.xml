Gout mainly presents with severe pain, redness, swelling, and movement disorders in the lower limb joints. Gout is often self-limiting, and its symptoms typically resolve within 7&#x02013;14&#x000a0;days, entering an asymptomatic phase. However, underlying health issues and uncontrolled hyperuricemia often induce the recurrence of gout, leading to chronic gouty arthritis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dalbeth et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, gout imposes a significant burden on both society and families (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>MSU acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that stimulates innate immune responses. After reaching its solubility saturation point (428&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), uric acid crystals can precipitate due to changes in temperature, injury, or underlying diseases (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Sivera et al., 2017</xref>). These crystals can regulate the mechanical environment, which amplifies the inflammatory response and even damages the joints (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). These crystals then stimulate surrounding macrophages via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and subsequently activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, which leads to the release of IL-1&#x003b2;. Activation of interleukin-1 receptors triggers a cascade of downstream signals, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which recruit neutrophils and other immune cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">So and Martinon, 2017</xref>). In chronic gout, the formation of tophus can damage the joint structure. Furthermore, persistent inflammation induces the release of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO). These factors enhance the expression of degenerative enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in chondrocytes, accelerating cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, they promote chondrocyte autophagy and senescence, leading to chondrocyte apoptosis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keller and Mandell, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition to inflammatory cytokines, new mechanisms have been implicated in cartilage degeneration (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2024</xref>). Copper ions regulate cellular oxidative stress. The cellular copper metabolism relies on proteins involved in copper ion intake, such as CTR1, and proteins involved in copper ion efflux, such as ATP7A and ATP7B. Copper ions excessively accumulated in the intracellular space can bind to thiolase-containing mitochondrial enzymes (e.g., DLAT) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which activates the upstream regulatory factor FDX1 and enhances toxic stress and cell death. This process is known as cuproptosis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cobine and Brady, 2022</xref>). The initial step of cuproptosis occurs in mitochondria, where dysregulation of the TCA cycle impairs cellular energy metabolism and damages the mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, copper ion accumulation exacerbates the loss of Fe-S clusters and induces cell death. Glutathione, Hsp70, and Hsp90 can mitigate oxidative stress following copper ion accumulation in the intracellular space (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Previous studies have reported that inflammatory cell infiltration and the release of inflammatory cytokines can lead to the depletion of glutathione and heat shock proteins (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Jhang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, stimulating chondrocytes with interleukin-1 was shown to downregulate ATP7B and FDX1 levels and induce copper ion overload in the intracellular space (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Li B. et al., 2024</xref>). These findings indicate that inflammatory cytokines can undermine cellular resistance to cuproptosis.</p><p>Two-thirds of copper in the human body is stored in bones, contributing to bone metabolism and development (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2024</xref>). Previous studies have shown that abnormal distribution of copper ions can be observed in various orthopedic diseases. Copper overload decreases repair capacity and induces cellular death, thereby increasing the risk of osteoarthritis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Li B. et al., 2024</xref>). In addition to skeletal disorders, copper ion homeostasis imbalance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancies (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2022</xref>). In patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, reduced glutathione levels in dopaminergic neurons can lead to excessive intracellular copper accumulation, which disrupts Fe-S cluster proteins and downregulates Fe-S cluster proteins. These alterations mediate cytotoxic stress and cell death, finally leading to neuronal degeneration and even neuronal death (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). Vascular injury and inflammation trigger localized copper release, which promotes neointimal hyperplasia and arterial stiffness (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2025</xref>). Circulating copper levels are positively correlated with the risk of colorectal cancer, while the presence of pro-tumorigenic cuproptosis biomarkers in breast carcinoma is associated with cancer stemness, contributing to tumor proliferation and metastasis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, crystal deposition is linked to cuproptosis. Previous studies have shown that inhalation of silica can induce pulmonary infiltration of immune cells, regulate cuproptosis, and affect the progression of lung fibrosis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ma R. et al., 2024</xref>). How the activation of immune cells in crystal foci of gouty arthritis affects the normal metabolism and repair capacity of chondrocytes remains unclear.</p><p>Current therapeutic options for gouty arthritis, such as colchicine, primarily relieve the symptoms and have limited efficacy. We established a screening model by simulating the inflammatory environment in gouty arthritis by co-culturing macrophages and chondrocytes to identify the potential agents that can treat gouty arthritis. We identified cuproptosis as a new mechanism of cartilage injury, specifically inflammation-induced chondrocyte death. We screened 24 natural products. Syringaresinol-4-O-&#x003b2;-d-glucoside (SSG) has shown the best efficacy in reducing macrophage inflammation and suppressing chondrocyte cuproptosis. Further studies showed that SSG inhibited MSU-induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and NLRP3 pathways in macrophages. Furthermore, SSG was shown to regulate the expression of sulfur-linked mitochondrial enzymes in the cuproptosis pathway, thereby deactivating the upstream regulator FDX1 in chondrocytes. SSG also alleviated inflammatory pain, protected against cartilage damage, and improved motor dysfunction in mice with acute or chronic gouty arthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Reagents and media</title><p>Syringaresinol-4-O-&#x003b2;-d-glucoside (C28H36O13; MW 580.58&#x000a0;g/mol; purity &#x02265;98% [TargetMol, Shanghai, China]) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide.

After co-culturing with RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS and MSU, ATDC5 chondrocytes exhibited signs of cuproptosis, such DLAT upregulation and FDX1 downregulation, compared to ATDC5 chondrocytes stimulated solely with LPS and MSU (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Subsequent stimulation of ATDC5 chondrocytes with the inflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; similarly enhanced cuproptosis, indicating that the inflammatory cytokines released by macrophages, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, can promote chondrocyte cuproptosis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).

Recent studies have indicated that tophus, commonly found surrounding the lesion of gouty arthritis, is formed by MSU crystals and chronic granulomatous tissue, which is encapsulated by fibers and blood vessels (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2023</xref>). Chronic gouty arthritis recurs due to persistent inflammation induced by pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the surrounding fibrovascular tissue, leading to cartilage damage (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Stamp and Dalbeth, 2019</xref>). Our study indicated that inflammatory factors released by macrophages can promote cuproptosis in chondrocytes, elucidating the mechanisms underlying cartilage damage in gouty arthritis.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that cuproptosis is commonly observed in Menkes disease, Wilson disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. There are already therapeutic approaches promoting cuproptosis in cancer (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Liu W. Q. et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang C. et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lutsenko et al., 2025</xref>). We initially hypothesized that the pathogenesis of gout is accompanied by chondrocyte senescence and abnormal copper ion metabolism in the intracellular space, leading to cuproptosis and osteoarthritis. Our study indicated that in a co-culture model simulating the microenvironment of gouty joints, inflammatory factors released by macrophages can significantly induce cuproptosis in chondrocytes, characterized by decreased FDX1 expression and increased DLAT expression. This phenomenon is similar to that observed in chondrocytes induced by TNF-&#x003b1;. However, treatment with colchicine did not alleviate cuproptosis in chondrocytes.</p><p>We mechanistically inhibited inflammatory factors expression in macrophages and alleviated cuproptosis in chondrocytes. From 24 non-flavonoid traditional Chinese medicines, we identified SSG as the most effective therapeutic agent. SSG reduced macrophage immune responses by inhibiting the NF-&#x003ba;B and NLRP3 pathways. It also suppressed pro-inflammatory phenotypes, including M1 polarization, phagocytosis, mitochondrial damage, and ROS production. In chondrocytes, we demonstrated that SSG can inhibit inflammatory pathways in chondrocytes, prevent the degradation of the extracellular matrix, promote chondrocyte proliferation, delay aging, and significantly reduce cuproptosis. Previous studies have shown that SSG possessed vigorous analgesic effects (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). In mouse models of both acute and chronic gout, SSG exhibited both short-term and long-term analgesic effects, with excellent effects on the recovery of mouse motor function. It also effectively alleviated synovitis and protected the cartilage. Colchicine can only be used for short-term treatment, but its long-term efficacy remains unsatisfactory. In immunohistochemical staining of the tissues, SSG significantly reduced macrophage infiltration and M1 polarization, and alleviated cuproptosis in chondrocytes. In addition, SSG was shown to mitigate diabetes and anxiety (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhai and Wang, 2018</xref>). In the mice models of ulcerative colitis, SSG protected intestinal epithelium by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt/MAPK/Wnt pathway (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Liu Y. et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, further studies using DEL technology are needed to screen cuproptosis key proteins in gouty arthritis, aiming to identify more specific and potent drug candidates (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ma P. et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Colchicine exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to tubulin heterodimers, thereby interfering with microtubule formation and subsequently inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis, inflammasome assembly, and interleukin expression (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2025</xref>). It is clinically used to prevent and treat acute episodes of gout and familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine has also shown promising therapeutic effects in pericarditis, chronic coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and thrombosis, and is applied in clinical practice (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Imazio and Nidorf, 2021</xref>).

Therefore, SSG possesses significant therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases, such as gout.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that SSG possesses potent anti-inflammatory effects and maintains chondrocyte function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, the validation of its safety and efficacy in clinical settings necessitates future studies. Several critical issues must be addressed to promote the clinical application of this drug. First, it is needed to clarify the conservation of SSG&#x02019;s protein targets between humans and animals. Second, validating the immunogenic potential of drug metabolites and the parent compound in human cells and in humans is needed before clinical application. Third, both acute and chronic toxicity experiments and safety profiles in humans are necessary before clinical translation. This integrated approach can facilitate the systematic translation of preclinical findings into clinical applications while addressing critical gaps in current knowledge.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, we did not identify the specific protein targets through which SSG inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways to suppress the release of inflammatory factors from macrophages. Second, although we demonstrated that inflammatory factors induce cuproptosis in chondrocytes, we did not investigate how these factors alter copper ion influx and efflux in chondrocytes. In the future, we plan to investigate changes in the expression levels of ion channels, such as ATP7A, ATP7B, and CTR1. Finally, the current study was based on murine cells and mouse models, and we did not validate the efficacy and potential toxic side effects of SSG in human cells. Therefore, we will verify these issues using human cells, such as THP-1 and chondrocytes, to determine the optimal administration route and appropriate dosage.</p><p>In summary, our study indicated that MSU induced inflammatory factor release by macrophages and impaired chondrocyte copper homeostasis in gout.
