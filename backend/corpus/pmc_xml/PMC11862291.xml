Our study looks over 3 years, and all patients analyzed have a dual diagnosis of both bipolar disorder and substance use disorder and were hospitalized in the psychiatric ward of a tertiary university hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec3676"><title>Results</title><p>
There were 2384 hospitalizations in the Coimbra&#x02019;s University Hospital psychiatric ward, and 88 hospitalizations were coded with a dual diagnosis of bipolar disorder and substance use disorder.</p><p>Tobacco was the substance more consumed by the patients (53.4%), followed by alcohol (46.6%) and cannabinoids (30.7%). In 18.2% of the patients was identified consumption of cocaine and in 6.8% there was an abuse of opioids. It is important to highlight that 20.5% of the patients used 2 or more substances at the same time.</p><p>Regarding adherence to treatment for both their bipolar disorder and substance use disorder, in 25% of the patients, there wasn&#x02019;t a satisfactory compliance with the treatment prescribed.</p><p>In the group of patients with polydrug use, half of them didn&#x02019;t comply with the treatment. In the patients consuming only one substance, we found out that 30% of patients who use alcohol didn&#x02019;t adhere to the treatment, while around 13% of the patients using cannabinoids didn&#x02019;t comply with the suggested treatment.</p><p>The relationship between the type of substance used and treatment adherence was statistically significant with a p=0.004 (considering p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Regarding abstinence from consumption, around 42% of the patients keep using at least one substance. In the group with polydrug use, around 65% of the patients were not abstinent in the last appointments, while in the cannabinoids users&#x02019; group around 50% of them were still using the drug. In the group with patients using alcohol, around 43% of them are not abstinent.</p><p>The relationship between the type of substance used and maintenance of abstinence was found to be statistically significant with a p=0.037 (considering p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec3677"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Substance use disorder can have a huge impact on adherence to treatment, worsening the prognosis of the comorbid bipolar disorder. On the other hand, this dual diagnosis can impact the maintenance of abstinence.</p><p>Early detection of both diagnosis and simultaneous treatment from an early phase are essential to improve the prognosis of both diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec3678"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
