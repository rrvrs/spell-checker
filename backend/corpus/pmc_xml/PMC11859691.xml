The highest prevalence of psychopathological symptoms was found in patients with CI, somewhat less in patients with PE, and the lowest in patients with PCD.</p><p>Signs of mild depressive disorder were found in patients who underwent CS in ACC, elevated levels of adynamic depression indicators, depression with fear and agitated depression, as well as increased levels of anxiety: the average level of anxiety, mental and somatic anxiety. The indicators of expressiveness of depression and anxiety in patients with CI turned out to be the highest, in patients with PE &#x02013; lower, and in patients with PCD &#x02013; the lowest.</p><p>We proposed a mathematical model for predicting the development of psychosocial maladjustment (PM) in patients who have undergone CS in ACC. It is based on a comprehensive assessment of three key vectors that can have a mutually potentiating pathogenetically related effect on the course of the formation of PM: surgical, neurological, and psychopathological. A complex of diagnostic, corrective and preventive measures for each of the risk groups has been developed.</p></sec><sec id="sec5356"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Verification of the proposed model on a representative sample of patients confirmed its high predictive ability and reliability in use.</p></sec><sec id="sec5357"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
