Current treatment strategies primarily rely on antibiotics and corticosteroids; however, the emergence of antibiotic resistance and potential side effects from prolonged corticosteroid use limit the effectiveness of these therapies in clinical practice.

This condition typically begins with a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, with common pathogens including canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine influenza virus (CIV), and canine herpesvirus type 1 [CHV-1; (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)]. These pathogens spread rapidly in crowded or stressful environments, such as animal shelters and breeding facilities (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Viral infections can lead to bronchopneumonia or bronchointerstitial pneumonia. As the disease progresses, damage to the respiratory epithelium and excessive inflammation further compromise the lungs' natural defenses, increasing the risk of secondary bacterial infections, with common bacterial pathogens including <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Primary clinical signs include coughing, dyspnea, and fever, with symptoms potentially lasting for several days to weeks. Current treatment strategies primarily rely on antibiotics and corticosteroids; however, concerns over antibiotic resistance and potential side effects from prolonged corticosteroid use necessitate the exploration of new therapeutic strategies (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Anemoside B4 (AB4), an active compound extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine <italic>Pulsatilla</italic>, has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). AB4 modulates the NF-&#x003ba;B and TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathways, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Additionally, AB4 reduces the expression of IL-12 and STAT4, thereby decreasing Th1 cell activation while simultaneously enhancing the expression of IL-4 and STAT6 to promote Th2 cell-mediated anti-inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Furthermore, AB4 significantly improves the histopathological appearance, lung function, oxidative stress, and protease levels in lung tissue (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Collectively, these mechanisms mitigate inflammation-induced damage, improve clinical symptoms, and reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infections. In clinical practice, appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments can effectively reduce inflammation, accelerate recovery, and alleviate clinical symptoms in dogs, making them a rational and effective therapeutic strategy.</p><p>AB4 exhibits a good safety profile, as demonstrated in a study where mice received continuous intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 g/kg of AB4 for 14 days. No significant effects on body weight or overall appearance were observed, and serum levels of ALT, AST, CREA, and BUN remained unchanged, indicating low toxicity of AB4 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Additionally, preliminary unpublished safety trials have shown that AB4 is well-tolerated in canine models.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of AB4 on the comprehensive clinical scoring of canine pneumonia. Secondary objectives included efficacy assessments conducted on Days 7 and 14, as well as the evaluation of recovery times for primary symptoms. We also investigated the safety of AB4 in a clinical setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Trial design</title><p>This prospective, randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of AB4 in treating canine pneumonia. The trial was conducted from March to August 2024 at the Veterinary Drug Research and Evaluation Center of South China Agricultural University (SCAU) and the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of SCAU.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Dogs</title><sec><title>2.2.1 Inclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were dogs aged 1&#x02013;10 years and weighing 3&#x02013;20 kg. Clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and dyspnea. Chest radiography revealed patchy or patchy infiltrative shadows or interstitial changes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Dogs were required to have a defined epidemiological background, such as a history of residing in high-density environments (e.g., breeding facilities or animal shelters) with cases demonstrating a pattern of clustered outbreaks rather than isolated occurrences. For privately owned dogs must have a history of exposure followed by the onset of symptoms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Symptoms were mild and common, and disease conditions were stable.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.2. Exclusion criteria</title><p>Dogs with other physiological or pathological conditions or systemic diseases affecting drug pharmacokinetics or evaluation of effect indicators were excluded. {Specific exclusions included: 1. confirmed malignancies tumors or severe comorbidities associated with malignancies; 2. severe renal disease [classified as stage IV according to the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) Chronic Kidney Disease Guidelines or serum creatinine levels &#x0003e;5.0 mg/dL; (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)]; 3. severe hepatic disease, as determined by the attending veterinarian based on liver enzyme levels and clinical symptoms}, dogs with aggressive or uncooperative behavior, dogs administered other drugs or anti-inflammatory medications with prolonged effects within 2 weeks prior to enrollment, dogs with a history of vomiting or recent anesthesia or diagnosed with aspiration or foreign body pneumonia, and dogs with insufficient or unclear medical history (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>To ensure animal welfare, any dog could withdraw from the study at any time and receive conventional treatment based on owner request or the veterinarian's judgment. For instance, if there is evidence of bacterial infection or clear signs of such an infection during the study, dog could withdraw from the study and receive empirical antibiotic therapy and symptomatic treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.3 Case collection</title><p>To reduce iatrogenic infection risk and minimize confounding variables, a block randomization method was used along with a phased admission strategy. Each phase included recruitment and study intervention periods. Preliminary eligible subjects entered a candidate pool for up to 3 days. Enrollment closed upon completion of each recruitment phase, with candidates selected based on predefined protocol criteria. Following enrollment, subjects began the intervention phase, precluding further enrollment until the conclusion of the trial. After the completion of each phase, subsequent recruitment phases continued until the target sample size was achieved. Continuous hospitalization for all trial participants was required throughout the study for precise administration and daily clinical monitoring. All procedures and forms were reviewed and approved by the appropriate animal clinical research ethics committee (approval number: 2023C058) and complied with ethical guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2.3 Randomization and masking</title><p>Dogs meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled and assigned a unique random identification number and group code. The randomization sequence was generated using SAS software version 9.4, with block randomization of three and a 1:1:1 allocation ratio for the AB4, CXL, and placebo groups. A dedicated pharmacist prepared the medications and blinded the syringes. A designated &#x0201c;medication administrator&#x0201d; administered the medication according to the randomized codes. Neither the pharmacist nor the medication administrator was involved in clinical evaluations. The Principal Investigator (PI) and data analysts were blinded to group assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Trial medication</title><p>The investigational drug, AB4 for injection (Guangxi Innovate Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guangxi, China), was diluted to 48 mg/mL with normal saline and administered at 20 mg/kg. The control medication, Chuanxinlian injection (Guangxi Innovate Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guangxi, China), was administered at 2 mL per dog. The placebo consisted of a normal saline injection (HFQ Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China) with a volume equivalent to that of the investigational drug. All injections were administered subcutaneously once daily for seven consecutive days.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 Clinical evaluation</title><p>The clinical efficacy evaluation system comprised three dimensions: clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and radiographic scores (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The clinical symptom score assessed the severity of fever, dyspnea, cough, mental status, sputum production, appetite, and nasal discharge, using a graded scoring system. The laboratory test score assessed the complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEUT), neutrophil percentage (NEUT%), lymphocyte count (LYM), and lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), with scoring based on reference range criteria. Additionally, the absolute counts of WBC, NEUT, and LYM were logarithmically transformed and compared between groups to observe their changing trends. The radiographic scoring system divided the pulmonary fields on chest X-ray images into six distinct zones, each scored on a six-point scale (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Additional points were allocated for findings such as pleural effusion, pleural thickening with adhesion, and interstitial lung abnormalities. The final composite clinical score combined the weighted clinical symptom score (50%), laboratory test score (30%), and radiographic score [20%; (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)]. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated based on score reduction from baseline: clinical cure (reduction &#x02265; 90%), marked efficacy (70% &#x02264; reduction &#x0003c; 90%), improvement (30% &#x02264; reduction &#x0003c; 70%), and ineffective (reduction &#x0003c; 30%). &#x0201c;Symptom recovery time&#x0201d; was defined as the day following the last appearance of specific symptoms. Key symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, and cough, were monitored to determine recovery time.</p></sec><sec><title>2.6 Study procedures</title><p>The study spanned 15 days, with a 7-day treatment period and a 7-day post-treatment observation period. Prior to enrollment, a Case Report Form (CRF) was established to collect dogs' basic information. The day of enrollment was marked as D0 (Day 0), and treatment began on D1 (Day 1), The medication was administered once daily via subcutaneous injection for a consecutive period of 7 days, Observations continued through D14 (Day 14), During the study period, routine clinical examinations were conducted daily on the dogs, which included assessment of mental status, measurement of rectal temperature, and collection of heart rate and respiratory rate data. Clinical Composite Scores were obtained on Assessment Days at D0 (baseline), D4 (mid-treatment), D7 (end of treatment), and D14 (7 days post-treatment). These scores included clinical symptom assessment, radiological examination, and laboratory test. The clinical assessment involved scoring various parameters, including fever, cough, dyspnea, psychological condition, food intake, sputum production, and nasal discharge. Radiological examination was conducted by scoring chest X-ray images. Laboratory test included blood collection and subsequent routine hematological analysis Safety assessments included routine clinical examinations, biochemical blood test conducted only on D0, D7 and D14, and monitoring for Adverse Events (AEs). Dogs had free access to food and water throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>2.7 Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 25.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous data with normal distribution were expressed as Mean &#x000b1; Standard Deviation and compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). If variance homogeneity was satisfied, Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons were performed; otherwise, Tamhane's T2 test was applied. Non-normally distributed continuous data were assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis H test, followed by pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests when significant, with &#x003b1; adjusted for multiple comparisons (e.g., &#x003b1; = 0.05/3 = 0.0167). If no significant difference was found in the Kruskal-Wallis test, results were reported without pairwise comparisons. Categorical data were reported as frequency/percentage (n, %) and analyzed with Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test, depending on sample size. Time-to-event data were assessed using the log-rank test. All tests were two-tailed, with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>3 Results</title><sec><title>3.1 Baseline characteristics of dogs</title><p>Dogs were recruited through a combination of online promotion and in-person visits. A total of 72 dogs were enrolled (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, sourced from stray dog shelters (45.83%), dog breeding facilities (25.00%), individual dog traders (15.28%), private owners (11.11%), and dog training centers (2.78%). Statistical analyses and homogeneity testing indicated no statistically significant differences in breed, age, sex, body weight, or pre-treatment composite clinical scores among the AB4, CXL, and placebo groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), confirming the consistency and comparability of baseline characteristics across groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

The placebo group showed significantly higher levels of these markers than the AB4 group on the same day (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting a more pronounced inflammatory response in the placebo group, likely due to the absence of treatment. This finding indicated that the increases in WBC, NEUT, and MON observed in the AB4 group were likely typical immune responses to infection or inflammation, rather than drug-induced (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>On Day 14, RBC, HGB, and HCT levels in the AB4 group showed significant increases from baseline (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.025) but no significant differences compared to the placebo group on the same day (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Some dogs presented with anemia, malnutrition, and parasitic infections at enrollment. Standardized feeding care and deworming treatments during the study may have contributed to the observed improvements in these parameters (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Additionally, on Day 14, PLT levels in the AB4 group showed significant changes compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.025), with no significant differences compared to the placebo group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Both groups showed an increase in PLT levels from baseline, with a more pronounced increase in the placebo group. This increase is likely related to infection and inflammation, as the body releases large amounts of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, which stimulate bone marrow platelet production. The stronger inflammatory response in the placebo group, due to the lack of treatment, likely led to increased platelet production (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Since PLT levels in the AB4 group remained within the reference range, these changes were not considered drug-related.

On Day 14, TBIL, ALT, UREA, and TP levels in the AB4 group were also significantly different from those at baseline (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.025). However, TBIL, ALT, AST, and TP levels remained within reference ranges throughout the study, with no consistent upward or downward trends, suggesting that these changes likely represent normal physiological fluctuations rather than drug-induced, clinically significant liver injury.</p><p>Some dogs in the AB4 group had UREA levels below the normal range at enrollment; however, these levels increased by Day 14, with the median and interquartile range falling within reference ranges. The observed changes in UREA may have been due to preexisting nutritional imbalances or insufficient protein intake, leading to lower urea levels (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

These findings underscore the potential of traditional Chinese medicine in treating inflammatory diseases. AB4, an emerging plant extract, has been shown in preclinical studies to effectively mitigate inflammatory responses and improve clinical symptoms by modulating inflammatory signaling pathways, thereby reducing the risk of secondary bacterial infections (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Furthermore, AB4&#x02032;s favorable safety profile and low toxicity in animal models make it a promising option for treating canine pneumonia, particularly considering antibiotic resistance and the side effects associated with corticosteroid use. AB4 holds potential as an effective alternative therapy for dogs with pneumonia, offering promising avenues for future research and clinical practice, thereby promoting its application in veterinary medicine.</p><p>AB4 demonstrated antipyretic effects similar to those of its source plant, <italic>Pulsatilla</italic>, and showed greater improvement in dyspnea symptoms than the placebo group (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Radiographic analyses on Days 7 and 14 revealed significantly lower scores in the AB4 group than in the placebo group, likely due to AB4&#x02032;s ability to reduce inflammatory cytokine expression, thereby decreasing inflammatory exudation and improving pulmonary pathological changes, ultimately alleviating dyspnea in dogs. However, no significant improvement was observed in cough symptoms. The composite clinical scores of the AB4 group demonstrated a significant decline over the course of the trial, with scores on Days 7 and 14 significantly lower than those of the placebo group, indicating a positive effect of the treatment on the animals' overall condition. No statistically significant difference was observed between the AB4 and CXL groups. The AB4 group also exhibited earlier recovery, with higher cure rates and overall efficacy on Days 7 and 14 compared to the CXL group.</p><p>AB4 has been demonstrated to possess significant anti-inflammatory effects. Previous studies have shown that AB4 alleviates pneumonia induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae and influenza virus FM1 in mice by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Additionally, it prevents acute lung injury (ALI) by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These studies consistently report that AB4 reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-1&#x003b2; in blood and lung tissues, thereby decreasing WBC and NEUT counts. In our study, the log-transformed values of WBC and NEUT in the AB4 group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group only on D14, with no significant differences observed at earlier time points. This discrepancy may be attributed to the greater exposure to confounding factors in clinical cases compared to laboratory conditions, such as dogs' physical condition and differences in infectious pathogens. Additionally, the relatively small sample size may have limited the ability to detect statistical differences. However, comparisons of the median absolute counts and mean log-transformed values on D4 and D7 consistently showed lower levels in the AB4 group compared to the placebo group. Although these differences did not reach statistical significance at these time points, the observed downward trends in WBC and NEUT align with previous findings, suggesting that AB4 may exert a potential regulatory effect on the inflammatory response in canine pneumonia.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the investigation relied on a single drug, with a single-factor design implemented to minimize confounding variables and accurately assess the drug's therapeutic effects. Given that this plant-based drug is in the early stages of research, such an approach is essential for evaluating its efficacy. Future studies should incorporate conventional symptomatic therapies to comprehensively explore the overall therapeutic benefits. Moreover, most cases were sourced from breeding facilities and animal shelters. Future research should include a broader range of subjects, particularly client-owned dogs, to enhance the generalizability of the findings. By expanding the study population, Conducting epidemiological surveys and measuring the concentrations of inflammatory factors in blood samples, we can gain a comprehensive insight into the efficacy of AB4 across various clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>In the clinical treatment of canine pneumonia, AB4 for injection effectively alleviated symptoms of fever and dyspnea, shortened the recovery period, improved pulmonary radiographic findings, and reduced comprehensive efficacy evaluation scores, reflecting its therapeutic potential. The observed cure rates on Day 7 and Day 14 were 12.5 and 58.33%, respectively. No serious adverse reactions or mortality were observed in dogs treated with injectable AB4, demonstrated a favorable safety profile.</p><p>Future studies should stratify cases based on pneumonia etiology and incorporate conventional treatments alongside AB4 to assess their combined effects. Additionally, together with expanding the study population and inflammatory biomarker analysis, will provide comprehensive insights into AB4&#x02032;s role as a complementary treatment in diverse veterinary clinical scenarios, potentially enhancing overall clinical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the South China Agricultural University Teaching Animal Hospital for their support in the recruitment and promotion of this study.
