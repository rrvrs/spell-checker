Most studies in Ethiopia have not incorporated women&#x02019;s freedom of movement and control over finance when assessing married women&#x02019;s autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization. Previously conducted studies measured women&#x02019;s autonomy using different variables. This study aimed to measure married women&#x02019;s autonomy in contraceptive use in Kutaber district using better outcome measuring tool. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 10 to August 13, 2024. Interviews were conducted with 420 married women selected via a simple random sampling technique from the study population. Bivariable logistic regression was performed, and variables with p-values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.25 were included in the multivariable logistic regression, with a p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 considered statistically significant. Four hundred and eight (408) married women participated, resulting a response rate of 97%. About two-thirds (63.5%, 95% CI (58.3%-68.4%)) of the married women had autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization. Having household decision-making power (Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR: 6.59, 95% Confidence Interval (CI (3.82,11.36))), being &#x02265;18 years old at first marriage (AOR: 2.65, 95% CI (1.45,4.86)), having 3&#x02013;4 live children (AOR: 3.74, 95% CI (1.82,7.67)), having&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5 children (AOR: 10.78, 95% CI (3.60,32.31)), attending secondary school (AOR: 3.15, 95% CI (1.38,7.19)), and being in a marital union for 5&#x02013;10 years (AOR: 2.90, 95% CI (1.20,6.98)) were significantly associated with married women&#x02019;s autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization. The prevalence of married women&#x02019;s autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization was high. Tackling early marriage and empowering women through adult education programs are recommended to improve married women&#x02019;s autonomy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="5"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Women&#x02019;s decision-making autonomy in family planning refers to the capacity of women to decide independently, or with their husbands or others about family planning needs and choices [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For better maternal and child health outcomes, women&#x02019;s autonomy in reproductive health-care decision-making, including contraceptive use, is critical [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Globally, 164 million reproductive-age women have an unmet need for family planning, with 287,000 maternal deaths per year [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Sub-Saharan Africa region (SSA) accounted for the greatest percentage of women with an unmet need for family planning (26%) and 202,000 maternal deaths, which represents 70.38% of global maternal deaths [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, nearly one in five women in Ethiopia (22%) had an unmet need for family planning, and only 41% used modern contraceptive methods. This situation contributes to a high total fertility rate of 4.6 children per woman, which in turn leads to a high maternal mortality ratio of 412 per 100,000 live births, neonatal mortality rate of 33, infant mortality rate of 47, and under-five mortality rate of 59 per 1000 live births [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The population of Africa is currently growing faster than that of any other major region and is expected to account for 21% of the global population by 2050, up from just 9% in 1950 [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The population growth rate of Ethiopia is estimated to be 2.5%, which is still a relatively high growth rate [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Autonomous women enjoy their sexual and reproductive health rights [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and addressing unmet family planning needs could help avert approximately 7 million under-five child deaths and prevent 450,000 maternal deaths in 22 priority countries worldwide [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Throughout the world, women constitute a large proportion of the poor, underemployed, and socially and economically disadvantaged. There is widespread recognition that virtually no society provides women with equal status to men, and women generally have lower social status and autonomy than men do [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In certain nations, the husband and his parents are the primary decision-makers regarding the use of contraception by wives. In a rural communities where women&#x02019;s educational status is low and economic dependency is high, women&#x02019;s decision-making power concerning contraceptive use is limited [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, secret contraceptive use accounts for 6&#x02013;20% of all contraceptive use in SSA [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this potentially exposes them to emotional or physical violence if it is discovered. When women possess greater decision-making power in the household over their reproductive health and rights, the health of the family is better protected, which contributes to the productive forces of the country as a whole [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Highly autonomous women are more likely to use maternal health care services [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], including modern contraception [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Contraceptive use is important for preventing fetal, neonatal, and under-five deaths; avoiding high-risk pregnancies; and reducing maternal mortality [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] by preventing unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Key barriers that perpetuate gender inequality and hinder women&#x02019;s empowerment include women&#x02019;s lack of safety and mobility; women&#x02019;s lack of resources and decision-making; limited access to information, education, and technology; as well as the excessive time burden and dual responsibilities that women often face [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) outlined a broad range of initiatives that governmental and nongovernmental organizations should undertake to support gender equality and justice, as well as women&#x02019;s empowerment [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, leaders from 193 countries came together and set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Among these goals, SDG-5 specifically targets the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls worldwide. Nations across the globe, including Ethiopia, are striving to achieve SDG- 5. However, according to the United Nations SDGs progress report; there are concerns about achieving this goal due to gross inequalities in work and wages, the prevalence of unpaid women&#x02019;s work, such as childcare and domestic tasks, and discrimination in decision-making [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Except for a few studies [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], most Ethiopian research does not consider women&#x02019;s freedom of movement and their financial control when assessing married women&#x02019;s autonomy in the use of modern contraceptives [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

This finding was consistent with studies conducted in Guinea (65.47%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Mizan Aman (67.2%), and Gedeo zone (67.4%) in southern Ethiopia [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, it was higher than the results reported in studies conducted in Sub-Saharan African countries (25.28%), where the prevalence ranged from 9.9% in Burundi to 43.24% in Niger [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as well as in East African countries (18.91%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], high fertility regions of Ethiopia (17.2%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and a recent national study of Ethiopia (21.6%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, the prevalence was also higher than studies performed in Malawi (13%), Adwa town in northern Ethiopia (39.5%), Dawro Zone in southern Ethiopia (53.8%), Dinsho woreda (52%), and Dire Dawa city (55.2%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This discrepancy might be due to differences in outcome variable measurement, sample size, religion, culture, and timing of the studies. The number of questions used to measure women&#x02019;s decision-making autonomy in contraceptive utilization varied among these studies, which could contribute to the differing prevalence rates of women&#x02019;s autonomy [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, the finding was lower than those of studies conducted in Metekel Zone (71.0%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Sekota in northwest Ethiopia (77.3%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and Basoliben in northwest Ethiopia (80%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This difference may be attributed to variations in marital status, religion, and culture; for instance the study in Sekota included unmarried women. Married women often face significant cultural and partner-related constraints that limit their decision-making power regarding contraceptive use, while unmarried women typically do not encounter the same level of partner influence. This difference can lead to a higher likelihood of unmarried women making independent decisions in contraceptive use [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In this study, joint decision-making with husbands among current contraceptive users was 69% (95% CI: 63.6%&#x02013;74.4%), which was consistent with the National 2016 EDHS report (73%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the study performed in the Gedeo zone (67.4%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, this figure was higher than that reported in Adwa Town (53.4%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. About one in five women (22.1% (95% CI: 17.1%-27.1%)) used contraceptives on the basis of their husbands&#x02019; decisions alone, which was higher than the rates reported in the 2016 EDHS (5%) and Adwa Town, Northern Ethiopia (12.4%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The discrepancy arises from the fact that this study found nearly two-thirds (67%) of respondents had been in their marital unions for less than 10 years, compared to 53% in the 2016 EDHS. As the duration of marital unions increases, women&#x02019;s decision-making power regarding contraceptive use improves [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, 57.5% (95% CI: 50%-65.8%) of married women stopped contraceptive use due to their husbands&#x02019; decision alone, which was higher than the figures reported in the 2016 EDHS (10%) and in Adwa Town (28.2%) [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In general, among current contraceptive users, 77.9% of married women were involved in the decision-making process regarding contraceptive use. Similarly, among those who had stopped using contraceptives, 41.1% of married women were participated in the decision-making process to discontinue use. These figures were lower than those reported in the 2016 EDHS, which indicated that 95% and 88% were involved, respectively [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The possible explanation for this gap may be attributed to the fact that the national study examined multiple districts, as well as differences in culture, educational attainment, media exposure, and wealth index across the various settings.</p><p>The findings of this study revealed that women who attended secondary school were more likely to have autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization compared to those with no formal education. This findings is supported by previous studies [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Education empowers women to achieve independence and acquire essential knowledge for making informed decisions about their reproductive health. It also facilitates collaborative decision-making with their partners on health issues and social activities, such as visiting relatives, enabling them to share experiences and assert their reproductive and human rights [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Women who had household decision-making power were more likely to have autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization than those who did not have such power. This finding was congruent with studies conducted in Ethiopia, Zambia, and Iran [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In developing countries, most women hold inferior positions compared to their husbands in all aspects of decision-making; they often rely entirely on their male partners&#x02019; decisions regarding contraception usage and reproductive life [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Empowered women play a significant role in reducing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality by preventing unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions. The household decision-making power of women can improve their contraceptive utilization, thereby achieving better maternal and child health outcomes [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Women who were married at the age of 18 years or older in their first marriage were more likely to be autonomous on contraceptive use than those who married under the age of 18. This finding is supported by a study done in Ethiopia [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Early marriage is widely recognized as a harmful customary practice that undermines women&#x02019;s full enjoyment of their economic and social rights. It negatively impacts their sexual and reproductive health, denies them opportunities for education, autonomy, and decision-making, and exposes them to gender-based domestic violence. Conversely, women who married after the age of 18 typically have better access to education, which may empower them in the decision-making processes related to their reproductive health, including contraceptive utilization [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Compared with their counterparts, women who had lived with their current husbands for 5&#x02013;10 years were more likely to be autonomous on contraceptive utilization. This finding was supported by studies conducted in various regions of Ethiopia, South Africa, and 33 countries in SSA, utilizing recent demographic and health survey datasets [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This might be because when a couple lives together for a longer period, women may reduce their fear of their husbands, feel more confident, and develop a habit of interspousal communication or discussion about modern contraceptive needs and choices [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Study participants who had more living children were more autonomous in their use of modern contraceptives than those who had no children, as supported by various previous studies [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. When couples have more living children in the household, the decision-making autonomy of women improves. This improvement can be attributed to the educational opportunities available to their children, which in turn influences parents&#x02019; attitudes toward seeking reproductive health services [<xref rid="pgph.0004671.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><sec id="sec026"><title>Implications of the study</title><p>Programs and public health campaigns should take into account the cultural and religious contexts that affect women&#x02019;s autonomy in contraceptive use. By customizing messages to align with local beliefs, acceptance and use of family planning methods can be improved, ultimately supporting the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 5 by 2030.</p><p>Policies should promote collaborative decision-making among couples about family planning, which can be enhanced through community programs that foster discussions on reproductive health within families. Additionally, reinforcing laws against early marriage can enhance women&#x02019;s autonomy. Policymakers should support establishing the legal marriage age at 18 or older, ensuring women have improved educational and economic prospects.</p><p>Creating support groups for women can offer a space to share experiences and challenges regarding contraceptive use, promoting a sense of community and empowerment. It is crucial to continuously monitor women&#x02019;s autonomy in using contraceptives and the effectiveness of the programs in place. Furthermore, feedback systems should be implemented to adjust strategies according to the needs and outcomes of the community.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Women&#x02019;s autonomy was measured by self-reports, which are likely to be subject to social desirability bias. Qualitative data were not collected to support the findings and husbands were not included in the study. The cross-sectional nature of the study did not allow for the establishment of a causal relationship between demographic and other characteristics of study participants and decision-making autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization. This study did not take into account the role of social media in the media exposure status of married women. We also focused only on modern contraceptive method use and did not fully report on traditional contraceptive methods. While traditional contraceptive methods play a role in family planning, their limitations in effectiveness and reliability warrant a focus on modern alternatives.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, married women&#x02019;s autonomy in the utilization of modern contraceptives was relatively high compared to the recent national study in Ethiopian using the EDHS 2016 data. Women&#x02019;s educational status, household decision-making power, age at first marriage being &#x02265;18 years old, having more living children, and being in a marital union for 5&#x02013;10 years were positively associated with married women&#x02019;s autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization. Future researchers should include stakeholders in modern contraceptive use: health care providers to ensure fidelity in the use of modern contraceptives; and husbands to promote their involvement in modern contraceptive use.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all the study participants for their voluntary participation in the interview process.

</p><p>PGPH-D-24-02291</p><p>Married women&#x02019;s autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization in Kutaber district, Northeast Ethiopia</p><p>PLOS Global Public Health</p><p>Dear Dr. Bogale,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS Global Public Health. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS Global Public Health&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>==============================</p><p>Dear Authors,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript, &#x0201c;Married women&#x02019;s autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization in Kutaber district, Northeast Ethiopia.&#x0201d; This is an important and timely study that contributes to our understanding of women&#x02019;s reproductive health autonomy, particularly in the context of modern contraceptive use in Ethiopia. However, after a thorough review of the manuscript, several key revisions are necessary to improve clarity, rigor, and overall impact. Below, I provide detailed feedback on various aspects of your study, which should be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>First, I recommend placing your findings within a broader context by comparing them with similar studies from Sub-Saharan Africa and other global contexts. Additionally, clearer definitions and consistent usage of terms like autonomy, decision-making power, and empowerment are necessary to avoid ambiguity.</p><p>In terms of methodology, more detail is needed regarding the development and validation of the measures for decision-making power, freedom of movement, and financial control. How were these constructs operationalized, and were they pre-tested? Additionally, the process of data collection from illiterate participants and how privacy was maintained should be clarified. Discussing checks for multicollinearity and model fit in your regression analysis would further enhance the validity of your results.</p><p>In the discussion, a more nuanced interpretation of the discrepancies in contraceptive autonomy compared to EDHS data is needed, with an emphasis on potential cultural, religious, or regional factors. The section on empowering women could also benefit from more concrete suggestions for interventions or policies. I also suggest adding a section on the broader implications of your study for global public health and policy.</p><p>A careful review of the manuscript&#x02019;s English language and grammar is recommended. Finally, the limitations section should address the potential underreporting of non-modern contraceptive use and clarify the rationale for focusing on modern methods. In the conclusion, specify the baseline against which autonomy is measured to provide clearer context.</p><p>Kindest regards</p><p>Please ensure that your decision is justified on PLOS Global Public Health&#x02019;s&#x000a0;<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/journal-information#loc-criteria-for-publication" ext-link-type="uri">publication criteria</ext-link> &#x000a0;and not, for example, on novelty or perceived impact.</p><p>==============================</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jan 20 2025 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at globalpubhealth@plos.org.

Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;The authors stated that all modern family planning services are provided to the clients for free at public health facilities (lines 109-110); if so, studying many variables related to women's autonomy on money or income might not be relevant because they do not go with the aims of the study. It is better to use standard scoring tools rather than citing previous studies to measure some parameters such as control over finance and knowledge of modern contraceptive methods (Lines 184-195). In the data collection tool, it is stated that the authors used questionnaires as a tool. However, in the result part, 52% of the participants did not have formal education (could not read and write). How were their data obtained? please justify it. Regarding privacy, it is better to justify the mechanisms used to maintain the privacy of the study participants during data collection. What scientific standards were used to make categories of the number of children the study participants had (1-2, 3-4 or &#x0003e;5, etc)? please justify.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Introduction</p><p>-Terms like &#x0201c;LARC&#x0201d; (long-acting reversible contraceptives) and the full scope of &#x0201c;women&#x02019;s autonomy&#x0201d; are used without early clarification.Terms like "autonomy," "decision-making power," and "empowerment" are used somewhat interchangeably. Define autonomy clearly as it relates to family planning, and use consistent language to discuss this concept throughout the introduction to avoid confusion.</p><p>- The introduction touches on autonomy in a general sense but could benefit from a specific discussion of gender norms, family structures, and barriers unique to Ethiopia. This might include cultural, religious, or regional differences that shape reproductive health decision-making. Exploring recent data on how these dynamics influence contraceptive use specifically in Ethiopia would make the setting more tangible and relevant.</p><p>-lines 53-59 provide overlapping statistics on maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, and fertility rates. Summarizing or consolidating some of this information can help keep the reader focused on the core issues.</p><p>Some phrases are repeated or redundant. For example, lines 77-80 describe the benefits of autonomy in similar ways to prior sentences. Condensing these could improve flow and readability.</p><p>Method</p><p>-Selecting six kebeles from 23 using random sampling ensures representation across different sub-districts, but it is essential to specify if each kebele has a similar or varying demographic profile. If demographics vary greatly, stratifying before sampling might have ensured a more balanced representation.</p><p>-Allocating the sample size proportionally to each kebele is appropriate and helps maintain representativeness. However, it is unclear how households with eligible women were listed or verified, which may raise concerns about accuracy in the sampling frame.</p><p>-Include a citation to the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 25 for data management</p><p>-Translating the questionnaire into Amharic is excellent for local understanding, but it would be useful to mention if any back-translation process was conducted to ensure accuracy.</p><p>-The study mentions that adjustments were made based on the pre-test findings but does not specify what modifications were made. More transparency on the exact changes (e.g., specific wording modifications or sequence adjustments) would help readers understand how the tool was refined. Additionally, it would be helpful to describe how the pre-test sample was selected and whether it differed from the actual study population (e.g., in terms of socio-demographic characteristics). Furthermore, it would be valuable to report the Cronbach's alpha result to indicate the tool's reliability.</p><p>-The use of multivariable logistic regression to control for confounding is appropriate. However, the study does not mention any checks for multicollinearity between independent variables, which could affect the validity of the regression results. Including a statement on how multicollinearity was addressed (e.g., using variance inflation factors) would improve the analysis section.</p><p>_While the study uses the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to check model fit, it does not mention the goodness-of-fit results or how they influenced model selection.</p><p>-Describe the specific steps taken to protect data confidentiality, such as how data were stored and whether any identifiers were removed</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The review has been uploaded as an attachment.</p><p>This study considered autonomy in use of modern contraceptives among married Ethiopian women in a Kutaber district of Ethiopia.

</p><p>PGPH-D-24-02291R1</p><p>Married women&#x02019;s autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization in Kutaber district, Northeast Ethiopia</p><p>PLOS Global Public Health</p><p>Dear Dr. Bogale,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS Global Public Health. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS Global Public Health&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>Your revised manuscript has been assessed by two of the previous reviewers. Reviewer 3 requests a deeper comparison with existing surveys (see the reviewers' comments below).</p><p>In addition, I have some major concerns about the scoring and coding of many of the variables.</p><p>You have three groups of participants: current/ever/non-users of contraception. The autonomy score for current users is&#x000a0;calculated differently to the scores for ever and non&#x000a0;users. For current users there are three questions, each scored from 0-2 for a&#x000a0;total score range of 0-6. However, for ever and non users there is a single question, scored 0 or 1.&#x000a0;For current users, you&#x000a0;split them at the&#x000a0;mean score into "autonomous" and "not autonomous". However, we do not know what the mean was, and what level of autonomy is represented by the mean score.</p><p>For ever/non-users, a score of 1 means that decisions are made independently by the women or jointly with their husbands, whereas 0 means the decisions are made by someone else. But for current users, you have split this first category (independent&#x000a0;or joint) into two (1=joint, 2=independent).</p><p>For current users to be scored&#x000a0; in an equivalent to past/non-users, "autonomous" would be defined as women who were independent or joint decision makers:&#x000a0;This would mean a score of 1 or 2 on each question, for a total score of 3-6. However, a score of 3 may or may not reflect autonomy as this score would be given to any women who answers "joint" for all three questions (autonomous) or a women who answers 0, 1, and 2 across the three questions (not autonomous).</p><p>The issue here is that there may not be equivalence between current users categorised as "autonomous" and past/non&#x000a0;users.&#x000a0;If the majority of current users scored 0 or 1 on each of the three questions, the mean could be very low. As you used the mean score to split the current users into two groups, it could be the case that the autonomous group includes women whose decisions regarding contraceptive use were made by others. Or, if all participants answered 1 or 2 to all three questions, then the entire sample could be regarded as having autonomy, yet half of them would be categorised as having no autonomy. It would make more sense to define what set of scores indicates autonomy (e.g., a score of at least one on all three questions).</p><p>The coding of household decision making power has the same issue. What was the mean, and is it the case the categorisation accurately divides the participants into groups who do or do not have decision-making power?</p><p>The same concerns applies to the freedom of movement and control over finance variables.</p><p>As a result of the way the variables were scored and coded, the results tell us whether (for example) women who score above the mean on household decision-making power have higher odds of scoring above the mean on contraceptive autonomy than women who score below the mean on household decision-making power, *not* whether women who have household decision-making power have higher odds of having contraceptive autonomy than women without household decision-making power.</p><p>The 2016 EDHS defines participation in major household decisions as:</p><p>"Women are considered to participate in household decisions if they make decisions alone or jointly with their husband in all three of the following areas:</p><p>(1) the woman&#x02019;s own health care,</p><p>(2) major household purchases, and</p><p>(3) visits to the woman&#x02019;s family or relatives."</p><p>It is therefore essential that you revise your coding and analyses so that the categories for each of the variables more accurately reflects the meaning of that category. For example, household decision-making power should be coded as all participants who answer that they make decisions independently&#x000a0;or jointly for all of the items relating to that variable. Any participant who reports that another person makes decisions for any of the items would be categorised as not having decision-making power.</p><p>Similar definition-based categories are needed for current user autonomy in modern contraceptive utilization,&#x000a0;freedom of movement and control over finance.&#x000a0;</p><p>Could you please revise the manuscript to carefully address the concerns raised?</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Apr 04 2025 11:59PM.

The single population sample size with margin of error calculation makes sense. The final overall sample size with dropouts appears reasonable. The investigators are to be commended for the section on &#x02018;Variable measurements and definitions', which was helpful.</p><p>The analysis is simple and appropriate both univariately and the multivariate approach (non adjusted and adjusted odds ratios) for this particular endeavor. The conclusions appear to follow from the analysis&#x02019;s results. The authors noted relevant limitations which did not appear to impact the results overall.</p><p>On a minor note this reviewer is curious as to the possible reason as to why the wide (or appears to be wide) confidence interval on the adjusted odds ratio in Table 5 for the &#x0003e;= 5 children variable , AOR= 10.78, CI= (3.60-32.31).</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
