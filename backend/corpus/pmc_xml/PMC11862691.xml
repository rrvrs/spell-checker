Kirov.</p></sec><sec id="sec7337"><title>Results</title><p>The subjects had difficulty predicting the passage of time, with its adequate and rational distribution, including planning their own activities. Adolescents with musculoskeletal disorders had difficulty making a pragmatic and realistic forecast of possible events in communication with other people, as well as predicting the emotional states of interaction participants. Adolescents with movement disorders were characterized by an inadequate assessment of themselves as a subject of professional activity, fixation on the movement disorder, and high levels of anxiety and neuroticism. The subjects showed a tendency to suicidal behavior due to risk factors such as high levels of anxiety associated with self-esteem and anxiety in interpersonal relationships, high affectivity and demonstrativeness, social pessimism and negative prediction of the future.&#x000a0;During the correlation analysis, the relationship between spatio-temporal and speech-communicative anticipatory consistency with indicators of deviant behavior - delinquent behavior and deviant behavior was revealed.</p></sec><sec id="sec7338"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data obtained in the study will allow specialists to timely identify and prevent the development of deviant behavior, as well as build a route for correctional classes with each child..
