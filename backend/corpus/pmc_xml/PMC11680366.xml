The immunostimulatory dsRNA cleavage products of RNase L activity (RL RNAs) recruit diverse dsRNA sensors to activate signaling pathways to amplify interferon (IFN) production and activate inflammasome, but the sensors that promote cell death are not known. In this study, we found that DEAH-box polypeptide 15 (DHX15) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (Rig-I) are essential for apoptosis induced by RL RNAs and require mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) for caspase-3-mediated intrinsic apoptosis. In RNase L-activated cells, DHX15 interacts with Rig-I and MAVS, and cells lacking MAVS expression were resistant to apoptosis. RL RNAs induced the transcription of genes for IFN and proinflammatory cytokines by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), while cells lacking both DHX15 and Rig-I showed a reduced induction of cytokines. However, apoptotic cell death is independent of both IRF-3 and NF-kB, suggesting that cytokine and cell death induction by RL RNAs are uncoupled. The RNA binding of both DHX15 and Rig-I is required for apoptosis induction, and the expression of both single proteins in cells lacking both DHX15 and Rig-I is insufficient to promote cell death by RL RNAs. Cell death induced by RL RNAs suppressed Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) replication, and inhibiting caspase-3 activity or cells lacking IRF-3 showed that the induction of apoptosis directly resulted in the CVB3 antiviral effect, and the effects were independent of the role of IRF-3.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNase L</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Rig-I</kwd><kwd>DHX15</kwd><kwd>innate immune signaling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</funding-source><award-id>AI119980-01A1</award-id><award-id>1R15AI169398-01A1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>University of Toledo</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants AI119980-01A1 (K.M.) and 1R15AI169398-01A1 (K.M.) and funds from the University of Toledo (K.M.).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01913"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Higher eukaryotes have evolved self-defense strategies for protection against viruses. Innate immune responses are essential for the initial detection of viruses and subsequent activation of adaptive immunity. Host antiviral responses are initiated through the recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern-recognition receptors (PPRs) distributed in a cell-type-specific manner and in specific cellular compartments [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The replication of RNA viruses results in the synthesis of dsRNA replication intermediates that can be detected by PAMP receptors, like TLR3, in the endosome and RNA helicases, like Rig-I or MDA5, in the cytosol [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Rig-I and MDA5 contain a C-terminal DExD/H RNA helicase domain that binds the RNA ligand and an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) that mediates signaling by interaction with the CARD domain of the mitochondrial adaptor protein, IFN-&#x003b2; promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1/MAVS/VISA/Cardif), which is essential for triggering a signaling cascade that activates NF-&#x003ba;b and IRF-3 to induce the production of type I interferons (IFN), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Type I IFN activates intracellular signaling pathways via the engagement of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) complex, leading to the upregulation of a set of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are essential for antiviral activities [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, dsRNA is sensed by diverse RNA binding proteins and RNA helicases, resulting in the activation of stress response pathways and apoptosis, causing the premature elimination of virus-infected cells, limiting viral replication and promoting antiviral defense [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Several members of the DExD/H box RNA helicases can sense cytosolic viral RNA and play important roles in antiviral signaling. Rig-I-like receptors (RLR) Rig-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are members of cytoplasmic DExD/H RNA helicases that bind distinct types of RNAs based on preferences for the 5&#x02032; end structure, the length of dsRNA, and the secondary structure, allowing for the differential recognition of RNA viruses [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. RLR signaling is initiated by PAMP binding, the induction of ATPase activity, and changes in conformation, facilitating interaction with MAVS, which in turn, recruits TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family proteins to activate TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-kB to induce innate immune genes, including type I IFN [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to its primary role in cytokine induction, both Rig-I and MDA5 can induce apoptosis in response to viral RNA and RNA agonists in normal and tumor cells, and these effects are independent of IFN production [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying RLR-mediated apoptosis are diverse and include the transcriptional induction of proapoptotic genes, like the p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 (PMAIP1, NOXA), the activation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signaling pathways, the downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, like B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein(bcl2), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 3 (BIRC3), and IRF-3-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis by activating caspase-3 [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Besides Rig-I and MDA5, several non-RLR DExD/H helicases, like DDX1, DDX3, DHX9, DHX15, DDX21, DHX33, DHX36, DDX41, and DDX60, are involved in regulating antiviral signaling pathways. DDX3 interacts with MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1 to induce interferon &#x003b2; production upon infection with Sendai Virus and <italic toggle="yes">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and localizes to stress granules to regulate inflammasomes [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

DHX60 is an IFN-inducible RNA helicase that can sense dsRNA to promote RLR-dependent signaling [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>DHX15 is a ubiquitously expressed protein found in many cellular compartments, where it functions in pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, tumorigenesis, and innate immune responses. In HeLa cells, DHX15 was found to interact with MAVS to activate NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK signaling and not IRF-3 to induce proinflammatory cytokine expression and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, respectively [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In myeloid dendritic cells, DHX15 interacts with DHX9 and is essential for the activation of IRF-3, NF-&#x003ba;B, and MAPK pathways in response to poly I:C and RNA virus infection [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In these cells, DHX15 specifically interacts with short poly I:C and is an essential sensor for detecting RNA virus infection. In intestinal epithelial cells, DHX15 interacts with NOD-, LRR-, and Pyrin domain-containing protein 6 (NLRP6) to transduce a signal through MAVS to upregulate type I and III interferons and trigger inflammasome activation [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. More recently, DHX15 was identified as a coreceptor for RIG-I-mediated interferon signaling in response to RNA virus infection in HEK293 cells [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In other studies, DHX15 colocalized with NLRP6 and induced liquid&#x02013;liquid phase separation (LLPS) during RNA virus infection to mount an effective immune response by serving as a signaling hub [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. DHX15 contributes to carcinogenesis in breast, prostate, and leukemia and functions as a tumor suppressor in glioma and gastric cancer [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

RNase L activity, therefore, causes direct and indirect antiviral effects by activating diverse dsRNA signaling pathways, but the receptors involved in apoptotic cell death are not known. Here, we show that RL RNAs induce intrinsic apoptosis through the coordinate activity of RNA helicases DHX15 and Rig-I and downstream MAVS, JNK, and p38 activation that is independent of IRF-3/NF-kB signaling and IFN and cytokine production. RNase L restricts CVB3 replication, and premature cell death induced by RL RNAs promotes antiviral effect. Antiviral role of RNase L in virus-infected cells is the result of coordination of multiple dsRNA signaling pathways to activate innate immune and cell death pathways to clear viruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01913"><title>2.

In line with our previous findings, we observed the early activation of autophagy, as determined by the lipidation of LC3 and an increase in the cleavage of PARP, a hallmark of apoptosis, later in time, up to 24 h (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Further, the transfection of RNase L-cleaved RNAs (RL RNAs), purified as &#x0003c;200 nt RNAs from cells following RNase L activation (described in methods) but not control RNAs into HT1080 cells, resulted in similar LC3 lipidation and the cleavage of PARP (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) and were used to study the signaling pathways that promote cell death by RNase L-cleaved RNAs.

Parental and dsRNA signaling pathway sensor ablated cells were treated with RL RNAs and Ctrl RNAs, and cell survival was monitored in real time using dual dyes and an IncuCyte Live-Cell imaging system. Treatment of the WT cells with RL RNAs resulted in significant cell death, while cells treated with control RNAs remained viable over a period of time. Compared to WT cells, cells lacking Rig-I expression or knockdown for DHX15-promoted cell survival in response to RL RNA transfection, while the control RNAs had no effect, suggesting that both Rig-I and DHX15 are required for cell death.

The knockdown efficiency of DHX15 using various targeting shRNAs was determined on immunoblots and compared with increased cell viability on treatment with RL RNAs (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). Cells expressing LV1 shRNA, targeting the 3&#x02032;UTR of DHX15, showed the significant knockdown of DHX15, which correlated with increased viability in response to RL RNAs and were used in this study. These cell lines and parental HT1080 cells were analyzed for cell death in response to RL RNA transfection and compared to control RNAs by monitoring cell death using trypan blue exclusion assay (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) and the loss of cell viability using MTT cell proliferation assay (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Cells lacking Rig-I or the knockdown of DHX15 or both showed reduced cell death, while WT cells treated with RL RNAs caused significant loss of cell viability in both assays. To characterize the pathways promoting RL-mediated cell death involving Rig-I and DHX15, we measured the enzyme activity of caspase-3/7, a hallmark of apoptotic cells using a fluorescent caspase-3/7 substrate (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Caspase-3 activation by RL RNAs required Rig-I and DHX15, as cells lacking either proteins or both showed reduced activity that correlated with increased survival. Similar increase in cell death, loss of viability, the activation of caspase-3, and the cleavage of PARP on immunoblots were observed when human primary Newborn Foreskin Fibroblasts (NuFF) were transfected with RL RNAs (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>).

RNase L Signals via DHX15 and Rig-I to Promote MAVS-Dependent Apoptosis</title><p>Rig-I, MDA5, and members of DExD/H-box RNA helicases including DHX15 that recognize dsRNA and these receptors signal via MAVS which isa critical downstream adaptor in RLR signaling that drives the innate response to virus infection. To determine the role of MAVS in apoptosis by RNase L-induced RL RNAs, we first established the stable knockdown of MAVS (MAVS KD) in HT1080 cells by lentiviral-mediated shRNA. Cell death and the loss of cell viability was monitored in WT and MAVS KD cells transfected with RL RNAs and compared to control RNAs. MAVS KD cells were highly resistant to cell death by RL RNAs, while WT cells were highly susceptible (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Cell survival in MAVS KD cells was determined in real time and compared to WT cells.

The treatment of HT1080 cells with 2-5A causes dimerization and the activation of the latent ribonuclease, RNase L, resulting in the degradation of diverse RNA substrates producing intracellular RL RNAs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that DHX15 interacted with Rig-I and MAVS only in 2-5A-treated cells compared to mock-treated cells in which Rig-I levels are low and present in autoinhibited state (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). To further confirm that the interaction was promoted by RL RNAs, DHX15-Rig-I-MAVS interaction was tested by coimmunoprecipitation in cells transfected by RL RNAs.

To define the epistatic relationship between DHX15 and MAVS, we used MAVS KD cells and evaluated signaling by RL RNAs by overexpressing DHX15.

The overlap in the involvement of signaling pathways prompted us to test its activation and role in apoptosis by RL RNAs. To determine the roles of JNK and p38 in RL-induced apoptosis by DHX15 and Rig-I, WT and Rig-I KO/DHX15KD cells were transfected with RL or control RNAs in the absence or presence of JNK inhibitor (JNKi) or p38 inhibitor (p38i), and cell death and viability were measured. The inhibition of either JNK or p38 with specific pharmacological inhibitors resulted in greater survival in WT cells, while cells lacking both Rig-I and DHX15 were minimally impacted (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). Both JNK and p38 were activated by phosphorylation in response to RL RNAs and not control RNAs in WT cells, while Rig-I KO/DHX15KD cells showed significantly decreased phosphorylation (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E,F). The increased cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 by RL RNAs was accordingly reduced by JNKi or p38i in WT cells, while the cleavage of apoptotic markers was barely detectable in Rig-I KO/DHX15KD cells even in the absence of the inhibitors (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G,H). The small amount of cleavage of the apoptotic markers with the individual inhibitors could possibly be due to the residual activity of the unaffected MAPK.

Compared to control RNA and untreated cells, the viral RNA copies were significantly reduced in cells treated with RL RNAs (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>D). Cells infected with CVB3 showed the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, and the levels were increased in cells treated with RL RNAs (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>E). These data suggest that apoptosis induced by RL RNAs contributed to reduced CVB3 replication.</p><p>We tested the role of apoptosis by RL RNAs in CVB3 infection in two settings: (a) inhibiting caspase-3 activity using a specific caspase-3/7 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and (b) using IRF-3 KD cells wherein the transcriptional induction of IFN and transcription-independent cell death are inhibited. Inhibiting caspase-3 activity resulted in a dramatic increase in CVB3 RNA copies, and cells treated with RL RNA in the presence of the inhibitor showed a smaller increase compared to control RNA-treated cells. The viral titer determined by RNA copies was comparable in mock-treated and control RNA-treated cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>F). CVB3-infected cells showed an increase in the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, which was further increased by RL RNAs, and this effect was abolished in the presence of the caspase-3/7 inhibitor (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>G). The smaller increase in response to RL RNAs in the presence of caspase-3 inhibitors suggest that alternative non-apoptotic cell death may also affect CVB3 replication [<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. To rule out the effect of RL RNA-induced IFN signaling mediated by Rig-I and induced by transcription factor IRF-3, we knocked down IRF-3 in HeLa cells treated with RL RNAs or control RNAs followed by CVB3 infection and determined the impact on CVB3 pathogenesis. Knocking down IRF-3 also eliminates the IRF-3-Bax-induced apoptosis in these cells. The lack of IRF-3, as expected, facilitated robust CVB3 replication, and in these cells, RL RNAs was able to significantly inhibit CVB3 replication, indicating an IRF-3-independent effect (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>H). On immunoblots, IRF-3KD cells treated with RL RNAs and CVB3 showed an increase in caspase-3 cleavage compared to IRF-3 expressing cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>I), further supporting our observations on the dispensable role of apoptosis by IRF-3. These results suggest that inducing premature cell death by RL RNAs affects CVB3 replication, resulting in a decrease in viral titers, and inhibiting apoptosis by caspase-3 inhibitors facilitates the robust completion of CVB3 infection and the release of virions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-16-01913"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>RNase L is activated by a unique ligand, 2-5A, that is produced in virus-infected cells and exerts antiviral effects by targeting diverse RNA substrates. The cleavage of ssRNAs of viral and cellular origin, including mRNAs and rRNAs, directly eliminate viral genomes and replication intermediates or affect translation machinery that viruses require to complete the viral life cycle [<xref rid="B50-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that RNase L activity induces a ribotoxic stress response, possibly through ribosome collisions, involving ZAK &#x003b1; and stress kinases, resulting in cell death as a viral clearance mechanism [<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, the nucleolytic activity of RNase L results in cleavage products, RL RNAs, that are short dsRNAs with 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl and 2&#x02032;-3&#x02032; cyclic phosphate termini and participate in signaling events with broad antiviral effects by promoting stress granule formation to amplify IFN production, activate inflammasome in immune cells, induce autophagy, and promote switch to apoptosis by targeting Beclin-1 cleavage [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B61-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These effects of RL RNAs are mediated by dsRNA receptors that vary in expression levels and in a cell-type-specific manner, resulting in a wide spectrum of antiviral responses. For instance, RL RNAs bind to RLR helicases Rig-I and MDA5 to amplify IFN production, and they bind the RNA helicase DHX33 in immune cells to activate inflammasomes involving MAVS but independent of Rig-I. In this study, we identify the requirement of the Rig-I and RNA helicase DHX15 in inducing apoptosis by RL RNAs. Both proteins are required for inducing apoptosis, and the signals are transduced by the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS and stress kinases JNK and P38. Transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-kB, while required for producing IFN and proinflammatory cytokines by RL RNAs, are dispensable for inducing apoptosis. Using RNA binding defective mutants, we show that RNA binding by both DHX15 and Rig-I is required to induce apoptosis. Inducing premature cell death by RL RNAs exacerbates the RNase L antiviral effect in CVB3 replication. Taken together, our results suggest that the activation of RNase L in virus-infected cells promotes antiviral effects by signaling events engaging different dsRNA receptors in overlapping and intersecting pathways with distinct outcomes to produce cytokines or modulating cell death.</p><p>RNase L activity can impact apoptosis induction at multiple levels. Recent studies showed that the cleavage of mRNA in actively translating polysomes may result in ribosome collisions, activating a ZAK &#x003b1; and ribotoxic stress response involving JNK and P38 kinases, culminating in apoptosis [<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our previous studies showed the induction of autophagy as a prosurvival mechanism in response to direct RNase L activation by 2-5A [<xref rid="B63-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B76-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Inhibiting autophagy and the cleavage products of RNase L resulted in apoptosis by the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of beclin-1 [<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The requirement of JNK is a common feature in all instances and has also been reported in apoptosis by RNase L in response to chemotherapy drugs [<xref rid="B60-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B69-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. While the signaling pathways underlying apoptosis were well characterized, the dsRNA sensors that sense the RL RNAs to promote apoptosis were not defined. Using cell lines genetically deleted for dsRNA PRRs, like PKR, Rig-I, OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3, and the knockdown cells of DHX15 and MDA5, we showed that both Rig-I and DHX15 are required for apoptosis by RL RNAs. We showed previously that RL RNAs activate PKR to form antiviral stress granules to mount an IFN response; that PKR is dispensable for apoptosis was unexpected, as its role in apoptosis by synthetic dsRNA polyI:C has been widely reported [<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B77-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In tumor cells, Rig-I ligands were shown to induce apoptosis involving the OAS/RNase L pathway [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while cells ablated for OAS isoforms did not rescue cell death in response to RL RNAs. Our observations suggest that, at the biochemical level, immune signaling and apoptosis induction by RL RNAs are distinct from other dsRNA effectors.</p><p>Previous studies have identified DHX15 as a co-receptor in RLR signaling, wherein DHX15 engages in PAMP binding but does not participate in signaling events independently, as it lacks the CARD domain; instead, it interacts with RIG-I to enhance RLR signaling in response to RNA virus infection [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In our studies, DHX15 interacts with Rig-I and MAVS in response to RNase L activation by 2-5A and in cells transfected with RL RNAs, and this complex assembly can mediate RLR signaling. In the context of apoptosis, cells lacking either DHX15, Rig-I, or both show increased survival in response to RL RNAs, and the overexpression of DHX15 does not induce apoptosis in MAVS KO cells, indicating that MAVS is essential for apoptosis and functions downstream of the Rig-I/DHX15 signaling, in contrast with earlier publication that suggests DHX15 functions downstream of MAVS (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Using a panel of DHX15 mutants generated based on crystal structure, we identified amino acid residues that were critical for dsRNA binding. The expression of the RNA binding mutants of Rig-I(K858/861A) in Rig-I KO cells or DHX15(R194/195A) in DHX15 KD cells promoted cell survival in response to RL RNAs, indicating the requirement of RNA binding to effect apoptosis. More importantly, the presence of endogenous Rig-I or DHX15 in single gene ablated cells was unable to promote cell death, indicating the need of both proteins, possibly enabling a complex formation that mediates cell death. This conclusion is further supported by the expression of both RNA binding mutants of Rig-I and DHX15 in cells lacking both proteins (dKO). The cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 was significantly reduced compared to cells expressing WT proteins (<xref rid="viruses-16-01913-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>J), and cells were more viable. These observations suggest that the two receptors may share similar ligand requirements, and binding by both proteins is required for cell death. However, a small amount of cell death remained in DKO cells, possibly due to the residual activity of DHX15 in knockdown DKO cells or other alternate cell death mechanisms. Our data suggest that RNase L activation and the cleaved RNAs facilitate Rig-I/DHX15 interaction, which, in turn, recruits MAVS to activate apoptosis.</p><p>The activation of JNK and P38 has been shown in many cell types during RNase L activation, and recent studies show that ZAK &#x003b1; kinase activity is required for JNK and P38 activation [<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In RL-treated cells, we show that JNK and P38 phosphorylation is reduced significantly in Rig-I KO/DHX15 KD cells and cells where JNK and P38 activity is inhibited, which correlates with increased cell survival. In <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> cells, DHX15 was identified as an activator of JNK, P38, and NF-kB pathways in response to polyI:C and infection with an RNA virus to mediate cytokine production and apoptosis [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In myeloid dendritic cells, DHX15 was identified as a dsRNA binding protein to activate an immune response to RNA viruses by interaction with MAVS [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In line with these observations with polyI:C, our data suggest that RL RNAs activate JNK and P38 to induce apoptosis in a Rig-I- and DHX15-dependent manner.</p><p>RLR signaling activates IRF-3 and NF-kB transcription factors downstream of MAVS to produce type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. The cleavage products of RNase L bind Rig-I/MDA5 and signal through MAVS, IRF-3, and NF-kB to amplify IFN production [<xref rid="B61-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The activation of IRF-3 by dsRNA signaling induces apoptosis by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, which is independent of transcriptional activity [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, RL RNA-induced cell death is IRF-3-independent, as cells lacking IRF-3 showed no significant difference in apoptosis compared to WT cells. NF-kB is activated in HT1080 cells by 2-5A and RL RNAs as evidenced by the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit and expression of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Inhibiting NF-kB activity by expressing the IkB super-repressor did not impact apoptosis by RL RNAs, indicating that NF-kB activity, while required for expression of target genes and proinflammatory cytokines, was not required for RNase L-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, the induction of IFN&#x003b2; and proinflammatory cytokines by RL RNAs was significantly reduced in cells lacking either Rig-I or DHX15 or both proteins. These results demonstrate that IFN and cytokine production and the induction of apoptosis by RL RNAs are distinct events downstream of the recognition of RL RNAs by Rig-I and DHX15. Future investigations will address whether a subset of RL RNAs with unique features specify cytokine induction vs. apoptosis and if the effects are dictated in a cell-type-specific manner, depending on the abundance and localization of the RNA binding receptors. In that regard, we showed that RL RNAs induce apoptosis in primary human fibroblasts (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01913" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>) and that the effects are not limited to tumor cell lines.</p><p>The elimination of virus-infected cells by apoptosis is a conserved antiviral mechanism, and several viruses, including CVB3, co-opt and use apoptosis to facilitate dissemination. We examined the impact of RL RNA-induced cell death on CVB3 production. We first demonstrated that CVB3 is susceptible to the RNase L antiviral effect, and the effect correlates with increased IFN&#x003b2; production. Inducing premature apoptosis by transfecting RL RNAs in cells lacking RNase L expression significantly dampened CVB3 replication. Importantly, CVB3 titer was increased by the inhibition of apoptosis by caspase-3 inhibitor treatment. Our results suggest that the RL RNA-activated antiviral effect by inducing apoptosis early before the viral life cycle is completed and inhibiting apoptosis allows the virus to use the host cells for continued proliferation to promote a more robust infection. CVB3 infection of IRF-3 KD Hela cells allowed CVB3 replication to very high titers, as would be expected for cells lacking the antiviral effect, and RL RNA induced cell death that reduced CVB3 titers, even in cells lacking IRF-3. These results further support our observations that IRF-3, while necessary for IFN production, does not mediate RL RNA-induced apoptosis.</p><p>In summary, our observations suggest a broad impact of RNase L in virus-infected cells. RNase L activation by a unique ligand 2-5A produced only in virus-infected cells results in the direct degradation of viral and cellular RNAs activating a ribotoxic stress response pathway as an early response. The simultaneous induction of autophagy is likely a byproduct of stress imposed by infection, allowing infected cells to maintain cellular homeostasis. In addition, RNase L nucleolytic activity produces cleaved RNAs with immunostimulatory properties that can activate immune response, engaging diverse cell-type-specific receptors and biochemical features of the cleaved products. The heterogeneity in the viral and cellular cleaved products combined with the availability of PRRs results in the activation of multiple overlapping signaling pathways, expanding the scope and timeline of the antiviral effect. In our study, we show that the induction of cytokines and apoptosis induction are independent events activated by RL RNAs downstream of the binding RNA helicases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Robert Silverman and Ganes Sen (Cleveland Clinic) for providing the cells and plasmids used in this study, Saurabh Chattopadhyay (University of Kentucky) for IRF-3 KO and NuFF cells, Lindsay Whitton (The Scripps Research Institute, CA) for the CVB3 constructs, Takashi Fujita (Japan) for the Rig-I WT and mutant plasmids.
