Lack of nutrition education and access to accurate information can be large barriers to healthy eating.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this paper, we causally tested if providing participants with consumption tracking information accompanied by tailored messaging that referenced internationally recognized dietary guidelines improved their consumption patterns. To do so, we developed a smartphone application that participants used to record their consumption and that of their children. Those self-recorded data were then used to provide the participants with tailored feedback by comparing their recorded consumption against recommended consumption patterns. The causal impacts of the tailored feedback were estimated using a regression discontinuity estimation strategy and validated using alternative empirical strategies and a parallel dataset collected from the same participants by Community Health Volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We found that the informational and feedback treatments improved consumption patterns of the caregivers and their children. Specifically, once caregivers began receiving tracking information and tailored feedback on their children&#x02019;s diet, their children&#x02019;s likelihood of meeting the minimum dietary threshold increased by at least 23 percentage points. An analogous, although smaller and less precisely estimated, effect on the caregivers&#x02019; consumption was caused by providing them with tracking and feedback information on their own consumption. To verify these findings, we tested for the same effects using a parallel dataset collected by Community Health Volunteers from the same participants at the same period. The results of these analysis remained consistent with those estimated from self-recorded data but showed smaller effect sizes. Tests for persistence of the effects found no loss in impacts over the remaining months of the project.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These findings show that improving access to information on recommended consumption and providing easy methods for tracking own performance against those recommendations can improve consumption patterns while also demonstrating that low-cost, light-touch approaches can be effective for collecting related data and delivering such services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Pan African Clinical Trial Registry ACTR202407500217236.

Undernutrition increases the likelihood of mortality and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, it is estimated that poor diets led to over 12 million deaths in 2018 alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Africa has the world&#x02019;s highest average rate of undernourishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the dryland regions of Africa often face the highest rates of child malnutrition in the continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">A lack of nutritional knowledge and information can be a constraint to healthy eating. For example, studies across a variety of contexts have found that providing education on recommended consumption patterns can improve consumption behavior (e.g., in Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Information gaps can also exist in one&#x02019;s perceptions of their own behavior. For example, several studies find that exercise tracking applications can increase exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], can improve the efficacy of weight loss programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and can improve health consciousness and perceived physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While there are many candidate mechanisms by which such tracking could impact behavior, there are two that are especially relevant for this research. The first is that the tracking processes employed (e.g., pedometers, smart phone applications) ease the participants&#x02019; burden of accurately tracking their own behavior, thereby improving the likelihood that participants have accurate information on their own behavior. For example, Gustafson and Zeballos found that providing a simple automated summation of calories while ordering online food can reduce the number of calories ordered and increase the accuracy of participants&#x02019; accuracy in estimating the number of calories that they ordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The second mechanism is that the presentation of tracked behavior makes it easier for participants to observe their progress against recommendations, which then motivates greater effort to meet those recommendations, while also making them more salient. Evidence confirms that adding performance feedback to tracking significantly boosts effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the combination of tracking and feedback have been shown to be effective in changing consumption behavior in several settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a study similar to that performed by Gustafson and Zeballos, VanEpps et al., found that providing traffic light labeling (i.e. reg, green, yellow) that reflected dietary guidelines along-side aggregated calorie counts further reduced calories ordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. While many informational and feedback interventions have been successful in changing behavior in some settings, there are also many studies that find that they have no impacts. Systematic reviews studying these types of interventions highlight that context, user experience, and stakeholder engagement are likely to affect their impact. (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]).</p><p id="Par15">This research examined whether providing caregivers with improved access to performance tracking and feedback about their own and their child&#x02019;s nutrition, would improve adherence to recommended dietary behaviors. We developed <italic>Mbiotisho,</italic> a smartphone application that enabled caregivers to record health and nutrition data on both themselves and their children.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> The application processed the caregivers&#x02019; submissions in real-time and provided them with simple up-to-date tracking metrics (diet surveillance) and tailored recommendations (diet education) by comparing their behavior against internationally recognized standards for consumption. We used the caregivers&#x02019; self-recorded consumption data and data collected in parallel by a 3rd party, to test for the causal impacts of these features on participants&#x02019; consumption. Causal identification of the feature was established by taking advantage of a delayed rollout of the tracking and feedback features. We found that the tracking and feedback features improved consumption by children but that the evidence was mixed for their caretakers, especially among food groups that were already consumed at relatively high frequency.</p><p id="Par16">While prior research has established the potential behavioral effects of tracking and feedback on consumption in some settings, this study provides the first evidence of their efficacy in the rural development settings using a low-cost scalable technology. Specifically, our study takes place in the remote pastoral regions of Samburu County in northern Kenya, where malnutrition rates are high, literacy and cellular connectivity rates are extremely low, and where there is little nutritional knowledge In such settings, nutritional education, monitoring, and recommendations currently require in-person visits, which, while extremely important, are also often cost prohibitive; meaning that they rarely take place. This research shows that participants do change behavior when provided with the feedback features provided by this project and, therefore, that the application was effective in filling some of the information gaps that these households face.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and implementation</title><p id="Par17">This research used data from the study titled &#x0201c;Improving Dietary and Health Data for Decision-Making in Agriculture and Nutrition Actions in Africa&#x0201d;, which developed a smart phone application that was used by individuals to record information related to several indicators, including consumption and morbidity of themselves and their children. In October of 2019, the study recruited caregivers from four community health units in Samburu County, Kenya. The participants were randomly selected from a stratified roster of eligible caregivers that were being served by Community Health Volunteers (CHV) in those four community health units.</p><p id="Par18">Inclusion criteria for participation were as follows.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par19">The individual was currently a primary caregiver for a child between 6 and 48 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">The individual was already working with one of the 18 CHVs that the local Community Health Extension Worker designated to work on the project.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">The CHV did not have information that the caregiver was about to move outside of the county.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par22">The selected caregivers and their spouses were invited to an informational session in their region and then invited to participate in the project. Agreeing to participate meant completing a consent form that included separate sections for themselves and for their youngest child over six months old, and for receiving project property&#x02014;the smartphone and solar chargers&#x02014;for their use during the project.</p><p id="Par23">The study recruited 189 caregivers. The participants were trained on how to use smartphones, nutritional concepts, including food groups and suggested consumption for them and their children, and the application, which did not require literacy or numeracy. The trainings were done in series in the four different locations by the same trainers. Each training took 9&#x000a0;days, which included 3&#x000a0;days of home practice by the caregivers. Caregivers could begin recording measurements after their final day of training. For the remainder of the project period, participants were incentivized to use the application to record a variety of behaviors and conditions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> In this study we focused on self-recorded consumption of the 16 food groups described in FAO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] using 24-h recall. The caregivers recorded separately for themselves and the child participant. For more details on the smart phone application, sampling, and the project implementation, please see Jensen et al. (2023).</p><p id="Par24">Because the trainings were done in series, the first day of data collection was staggered by training location, ranging from October 30, 2019 to November 30, 2019. The implementation lasted 13 months. During that period, the participants recorded and submitted over 60,000 reports on their consumption and that of their participating child. During this 13-month period, CHVs also collected data each month from the participants and their children on the same indicators, including 24-h recall consumption by food group, that the participants were recording and submitting. The data were collected by the CHVs while they performed their monthly visits to the caregivers. The 24-h consumption data used in this study were collected by asking the caregiver about her consumption in the last 24 h and then asking the same set of questions to the caregiver about the participating child.</p><p id="Par25">These parallel data collected by the CHVs were used to verify the findings of analysis generated from the data collected by caregivers.</p><p id="Par26">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the project timeline, including the two data collection activities&#x02014;recording by caregivers and parallel data collected by CHVs&#x02014;and the intervention timing, which we describe in the next section.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Timeline of project events</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12937_2025_1149_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par27">To test for impacts of improved consumption information, we developed a monitoring and feedback feature in the smartphone application that participants were using as part of the project. This feature processed recent data recorded by the participant, and then provided them with customized messaging on their progress against benchmarks. The messages were communicated through a series of screens, each with images and audio in the local language. Each message described the recommended benchmarks and a simple assessment of the records submitted by the caregiver. The first feedback process focused on the participating child and provided the age-appropriate recommendations by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] on daily breastfeeding frequency and dietary diversity (example provided in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, middle panel<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref>). The second feedback process on the caregiver was later launched. This process recommended that the caregiver consume <italic>animal source foods</italic>, <italic>dark green leafy vegetables</italic>, and Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables (<italic>orange fleshed fruits and vegetables</italic>) each day and reported the caregivers&#x02019; own records on these three food groups (example provided in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, right panel).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Example of the process for recording child consumption (left panel), feedback on child consumption (middle panel), and feedback on caregiver consumption (right panel)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12937_2025_1149_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">To test the impact of the monitoring and customized feedback feature, we delayed the release of the child feedback feature until December 15 th, 2019, six weeks after data collection had started (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As stated above, this original feature only provided feedback on information submitted about children. The project participants responded positively to that original feature and requested that feedback on the caregivers&#x02019; reports be added as well. In response, the application was updated to include information on the caregivers&#x02019; consumption. The updated application was launched on June 1, 2020 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The field staff sent messages to all caregivers with instructions to update their application and CHVs were asked to reach out to their clients and assist those that reported challenges with the update process. The database tracked if and when individuals updated their software.</p><p id="Par29">There are three fundamental differences in the launch of this second caregiver-focused feature from the launch of the first feature. First, the launch was done much later in the project so that there was a longer period and more observations before it launched. Second, the launch of the second set of features required that the participants manually update the software, a process that is observable in the data collected by the application. The result was considerable variation in the date that caregivers updated their application. In some cases, the update did not happen until many weeks after the new feature was launched and, in a few cases, it never happened at all. Third, the updated app also logged when the feedback features were opened, so that we could observe when the feedback was accessed.</p><p id="Par30">These three changes are important because they created observable variation in treatment status across the sample &#x02014; starting on June 1, 2020. On any particular day, there were participants that had updated their software and accessed the caregiver-tracking feature and those that had not. We return to this detail in the section on empirical strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcomes of interest</title><p id="Par31">We tested the impact of the initial feedback feature on the likelihood that the child met the Minimum Dietary Diversity Score for Children (MDD-C), which requires eating at least four food groups from a seven- food group classification developed by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and the likelihood of women eating from three food groups&#x02014; <italic>animal source foods</italic>, <italic>dark green leafy vegetables</italic>, <italic>orange fleshed fruits and vegetables</italic>&#x02014;selected for their importance for women of reproductive age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Each indicator was calculated as a binary variable for each 24-h recall observation, where the value of one indicates that the consumption target was met, and zero indicates that it was not met.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical clearance</title><p id="Par32">This study received ethical clearance from the Institutional Research Ethics Committee at the International Livestock Research Institute (Ref no: ILRI-IREC2019-15) and the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation of Kenya (Ref: No. NACOSTI/P/19/72940/31932).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Empirical strategies</title><p id="Par33">We employed two empirical strategies to test the causal impacts of the tracking and feedback feature on the behavior of the study&#x02019;s participants. The first, regression discontinuity (RD), leverages the high frequency and longitudinal nature of the outcome observations, coupled with the precisely observed start-date of the interventions. Effectively, the strategy tests for a sudden shift in outcomes when the tracking and feedback features become active.</p><p id="Par34">Equation&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref> describes the RD model, where <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e479">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The DiD model cannot be used for testing the impacts of the child feedback feature because all participants had access to the feedback on their phones at the same time and we cannot observe who or when participants accessed it. As discussed in the Study Design and Implementation section, access to the caregiver feedback required that the caregiver manually updated the application on their phone, which generated variation in access treatment date which the updated application also allowed us to observe. While the variation in timing is not experimentally varied, it reflects an arguably arbitrary confluence of factors including which date a caregiver&#x02019;s phone had power and connectivity, when the project made data credit transfers, when their CHV communicated with them, and their attentiveness to the updating instructions.

As a form of verification, we also tested for impacts in the data collected by CHVs from the caregivers on the caregivers&#x02019; consumption and that of their child using 24-h recall. Note that the CHVs collected data at monthly intervals, which means that there are only two observations per child before treatment. Therefore, estimating the impacts while simultaneously controlling for higher order polynomial controls was not possible. Models M3 and M4 were estimated using the CHV data, controlling for a linear relationship between time and the outcome. M3 includes the two pre-treatment visits and four post-treatment visits. The estimated AME are 0.566 (<italic>p</italic>-value =&#x02009;0.003). M4 tested for robustness of this validation exercise by restricting the post-treatment analysis to the two periods after treatment and estimated the AME at 0.298, although the estimates were not statistically significantly different from zero. This loss of statistical significance is not surprising, given the loss of power due to the smaller sample.

In the robustness check in which the bandwidth was reduced and higher order polynomials of time were included, the estimates became much smaller and lost statistical significance (M2, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It may be that estimating a third order polynomial with 14 days of data is a weak empirical strategy.

We examined those concerns in the Supplementary Material. Analysis for differences between those that accessed the caregiver feedback feature within the first two weeks (78% of caregivers) after the update was launched and those that did not (22% of caregivers), are provided in the Supplementary Materials. The analysis finds that at baseline, those that updated in the first two weeks were about 2&#x000a0;years younger on average (<italic>P</italic>-value =&#x02009;0.07) than the other group but that there were no differences in education, literacy or access to smartphones (Supplementary Table 1). An analysis of caregivers&#x02019; consumption during the first 180 days of the project, before the caregiver&#x02019;s feedback feature was launched, found no difference in the consumption trends for any of the three consumption outcomes (Supplementary Table 2).

We tested for heterogenous impacts in the caregiver data across the duration of treatment and individual, using the processes suggested by Jakiela [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. That analysis, which is provided in the Supplementary Material, found that the RD estimates were unstable if analysis was restricted to a short period before and after the treatments launch, but stabilized once about 50 pre- and post-treatment days were included. Importantly, there is no evidence that heterogenous impacts biased the estimates presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>; indeed, the estimates were extremely stable across treatment period and treatment individual.</p><p id="Par57">An additional advantage of the DiD empirical approach is that we can test for the persistence of impacts over time. To do this, we change the treatment status variable to be a series of binned treatment statuses based on the duration of treatment and then re-estimate the DID model. There were insufficient observations in the CHV data for this analysis. The results using the caregiver data are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. They show that the impacts of the treatment persisted throughout the study. Indeed, there was very little indication that the impacts were declining, even 120 days after the caregivers first started accessing the feedback on their consumption, although there was a small loss in precision and a very gradual decreasing trend in the impacts on consumption of dark green leafy vegetables (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Panel B).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Estimated persistence of the impact of the feedback feature on caregiver consumption of animal source foods (Panel <bold>A</bold>), dark green leafy vegetables (Panel <bold>B</bold>), and orange flesh fruits and vegetables (Panel <bold>C</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12937_2025_1149_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par58">This study combined nutrition education with nutrition tracking and provided participants with tailored feedback on their consumption. We found strong evidence that the consumption of the children participating in the project changed in response to the tailored advice; in both the caregiver&#x02019;s self-recorded measurements and those submitted by CHVs, the children were at least 23 percentage points more likely to meet the minimum dietary diversity threshold. We also found strong evidence in both the measurements made by caregivers and by CHVs that the caregivers changed their own consumption patterns in response to the tailored advice on their own consumption patterns and that those changes persisted for the remaining months of the project.</p><p id="Par59">The main limitation of our study is that we did not collect information on intermediary outcomes that would have allowed us to unpack the mechanism by which the tracking and feedback feature impacted behavior. Those impacts could have been caused by improved awareness of the recommendations (education), by improving the participants&#x02019; own tracking of their behavior (reduced burden of tracking), or by proving tailored and actionable feedback. A second limitation is that we did not have stronger validation data. Caregivers may have adjusted their reporting in the application and to the CHVs in response to the feedback features without adjusting consumption behavior. It would have strengthened our findings if we had collected measurements based on third party (e.g. enumerator-collected) observations as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par60">Our results indicate that there is considerable promise for improving consumption by providing tailored feedback through the approaches tested by this research, especially among the millions of people living in remote locations with little access to health education and services. While ours is not the first study to show that tailored feedback on consumption can change consumption behavior, we are the first to combine self-recording and tailored feedback in a low-income and remote setting with high rates of malnutrition. That remoteness, poor access to services, and malnutrition often coincide is not coincidence; it is much more difficult and expensive to provide such services to remote locations. Those relationships also imply that the low-cost and light-touch approaches tested here are likely to hold the greatest value among those living in remote areas and/or that are often left out of existing health education and monitoring services for other reasons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
