In this milieu, the present investigation aimed at evaluating the therapeutic potential of two lytic phages, KPKp (jumbo phage) and KSKp, as potential candidates for phage treatment. Initial purification and TEM characterization revealed their family as <italic>Ackermannviridae</italic> (KPKp) and <italic>Straboviridae</italic> (KSKp). The one-step growth curve analysis divulged that KPKp and KSKp exhibit burst sizes of ~98 and ~121 and latency periods of 8 and 12&#x0202f;min, respectively. Genomic analysis unveiled linear double-stranded DNA as their genome with sizes 206,819&#x0202f;bp (KPKp) and 167,101&#x0202f;bp (KSKp) lacking virulence or lysogenic genes, signifying their therapeutic suitability. Evaluation of phages as a cocktail demonstrated a substantial improvement in lytic ability, achieving complete (100%) lysis (at MOI 1) of clinical isolates compared to individual phages, achieving 50 and 25% lysis at MOI 1. <italic>In vitro</italic> investigations demonstrated that the phage cocktail significantly decreased both planktonic and sessile cells. Additionally, the phage (cocktail)-antibiotic synergism (PAS) achieves over 90% inhibition of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, even at sub-lethal antibiotic doses. PAS treatment significantly prolongs the lifespan of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>-infected <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic>. Compared to cocktail phage therapy, PAS demonstrates a superior reduction in bacterial load. In conclusion, the combination of phages and antibiotic holds potential for addressing clinical challenges associated with MDR <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>phage therapy</kwd><kwd><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>cocktail phages antibiotic synergism</kwd><kwd>jumbo phage</kwd><kwd>whole genome sequencing</kwd><kwd><italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> histopathology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Over the last decade, the global incidence of carbapenem-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections has witnessed a substantial surge, presenting a serious cause for concern within healthcare systems globally (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Tesfa et al., 2022</xref>). The resistance of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> to carbapenems is linked to the production of remarkably potent carbapenemases and a myriad of other resistance mechanisms, including alterations in cell membrane structure and beta-lactamase activity, all contributing to the formidable challenge of carbapenem resistance (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, carbapenem-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates typically exhibit multidrug resistance (MDR), extending beyond carbapenems to include resistance against penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Ramadan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>). The emergence of MDR in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> further exacerbates the urgency of the situation, given the limited availability of alternative treatment options, thus emphasizing the critical need for effective therapeutic interventions against this superbug (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Moradigaravand et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The stagnation in the development of new antibiotics over the last two decades has shifted focus toward bacteriophage therapy as a potential solution for MDR bacterial infections (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Nikolich and Filippov, 2020</xref>). Western countries are reassessing their regulations on phage therapy due to its approach in treating MDR bacterial infections (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Venturelli, 2022</xref>). Phage therapy offers advantages over antibiotics, such as a narrower antibacterial spectrum, a safer profile and the ability to target bacteria resistant to antibiotics (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Romero-Calle et al., 2019</xref>). However, a major drawback of phage therapy, similar to antibiotics, is the rapid development of phage resistance by bacteria (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;rm&#x000e4;l&#x000e4; and Jalasvuori, 2013</xref>). The restricted spectrum of antibacterial activity associated with phage treatment poses significant challenges in clinical settings, necessitating swift therapeutic options (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, combining phages with antibiotics may offer a more effective approach to treating bacterial infections compared to phage therapy.</p><p>The synergy between cocktail phages and ciprofloxacin (CIP) is crucial in combating <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> due to their complementary mechanisms of action (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Shariati et al., 2022</xref>). CIP works by targeting a bacterial enzyme called gyrase, which is crucial for bacterial DNA replication (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Shariati et al., 2022</xref>). Its small size allows it to penetrate biofilms, which are protective layers formed by bacteria and effectively stop the growth of bacteria living within the biofilm (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Mi et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to CIP&#x02019;s action, phages directly target and kill bacterial cells, enhancing the overall efficacy of treatment against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Gordillo Altamirano et al., 2022</xref>). Combining antibiotic with phages reduces host toxicity, improves efficacy and lowers resistance development (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding how these combinations affect bacterial metabolism and resistance is essential, especially for addressing carbapenem-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, an area lacking sufficient research attention.</p><p>In this study, the synergistic killing of a cocktail of phages in combination with CIP was investigated against carbapenem-resistant MDR <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) 700603. This strain contains the blaKPC gene, which encodes the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> carbapenemase enzyme, responsible for conferring resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. This resistance poses a significant challenge in treating infections caused by the strain (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Ghasemnejad et al., 2019</xref>). The study utilized two lytic cocktail phages (KPKp and KSKp) at very least multiplicity of infection (MOI) demonstrating over 90% inhibition of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, even at sub-lethal antibiotic doses. These findings suggest that combining phages and antibiotics could be a promising strategy against MDR <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections, offering hope for improved treatment outcomes. By employing the <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae model to assess <italic>in vivo</italic> effectiveness, this research aims to provide valuable insights into therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>The reference bacterial strain <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 700,603 from the ATCC was used in the study, along with four clinical isolates of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>.

This study investigated the therapeutic potential of two phages, KPKp and KSKp, individually and in combination with CIP against MDR <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>.</p><p>Phage cocktails are developed to overcome the limitations of monophage therapies, such as the emergence of resistant mutants and narrow host range (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). The use of multiple phages increases the spectrum of bacterial targets and decreases the likelihood of bacterial resistance (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Oechslin, 2018</xref>). Our results show that the phage cocktail provided enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to individual phages, aligning with the principle that combining different phages broadens lytic activity and mitigates the development of resistance. The combination of phages with antibiotics, particularly the PAS strategy, has been recognized as a powerful therapeutic approach, offering complementary mechanisms of action. Phages typically lyse bacteria by targeting specific surface receptors, while CIP inhibits bacterial DNA replication by targeting DNA gyrase (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Rafiei and Bouzari, 2024</xref>). This dual-targeting approach significantly enhances bacterial clearance and reduces the emergence of resistance compared to monotherapy with either agent alone.</p><p>The synergistic efficacy of PAS was evident in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. CIP, known for its ability to penetrate biofilm matrices, facilitates phage access to bacteria embedded in the biofilm, thereby enhancing phage proliferation and bacterial lysis (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Holger et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics, such as CIP, can induce bacterial stress responses, such as filamentation, which may further sensitize bacteria to phage infection (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Ronayne et al., 2016</xref>). Sub-lethal concentrations of CIP were defined as those below the MIC of 4&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/mL, specifically 1&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/mL and 0.5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/mL, which demonstrated partial inhibition when used alone and showed pronounced synergistic effects when combined with phages. The use of sub-lethal doses in PAS therapy highlights the potential to reduce antibiotic usage while enhancing antibacterial efficacy, mitigating both toxicity and resistance development risks. Notably, combining CIP at 0.5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/mL with a low phage MOI (0.001) resulted in over 99% reduction of planktonic cells within 3&#x0202f;h, surpassing the efficacy of monotherapies. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that low antibiotic concentrations enhance phage penetration and replication within biofilms, as well as reduce host cytotoxicity (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Fungo et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Various antibiotics were initially tested, including carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem), cephalosporins (cefepime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime), monobactams (aztreonam), fluoroquinolones (CIP, levofloxacin), and aminoglycosides (gentamicin). Due to high resistance profiles, CIP was chosen for further PAS evaluation, showing measurable MIC (4&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/mL) and compatibility with phage therapy. When combined with phages, CIP achieved substantial reductions in bacterial growth at concentrations well below its MIC, demonstrating the clinical potential of PAS to reduce antibiotic dosages and minimize associated toxicities (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Foyle et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>PAS demonstrated enhanced antibacterial activity against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> with CIP at sub-inhibitory concentrations (0.5 and 1&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/mL), corresponding to 8-fold and 4-fold reductions from the MIC (4&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/mL). In contrast, CIP monotherapy at or below the MIC lacks efficacy and may promote resistance. Sub-inhibitory CIP exposure failed to control infection and selected for quinolone-resistant strains in an <italic>in vivo G. mellonella</italic> model (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Panis et al., 2024</xref>).

By achieving bacterial clearance at sub-MIC concentrations, PAS minimizes the selective pressure typically associated with higher antibiotic doses, thereby limiting the activation of resistance mechanisms.</p><p>Beyond pharmacological synergy, molecular and physiological differences between the two phages suggest complementary therapeutic roles. Phages from the <italic>Ackermannviridae</italic> family, such as KPKp, are characterized by larger genomes that encode a broad array of replication-related genes and structural proteins, providing greater adaptability to diverse bacterial conditions (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Hatfull, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Yuan and Gao, 2017</xref>).

Conversely, phages in the <italic>Straboviridae</italic> family, like KSKp, are efficient at adsorption, possess short latent periods, and exhibit high burst sizes, all of which contribute to rapid bacterial clearance (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Adriaenssens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Mirzaei and Maurice, 2017</xref>).

Phages with complementary kinetics and host range profiles are more likely to enhance treatment efficacy and minimize resistance development (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Forti et al., 2018</xref>). While KPKp produced plaques with surrounding halos indicative of depolymerase activity, which aids in biofilm degradation, KSKp lacked this trait.

Phylogenetic clustering and comparative genome alignments supported their classification within established <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-targeting phage groups, aligning with prior taxonomic frameworks (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Hennart et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The present study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of two lytic <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-targeting phages, KPKp and KSKp, highlighting the superior potential of KPKp as a next-generation therapeutic agent. Whole genome analysis confirmed the strictly lytic nature of both phages, with the absence of lysogeny-associated genes, ensuring their clinical safety. Notably, KPKp, classified as a jumbo phage, possesses an expansive genome encoding a suite of autonomous replication and transcriptional machinery, including consecutively organized DNA helicases (ORFs 28&#x02013;33), ligases (ORFs 34&#x02013;37), polymerases (ORFs 38&#x02013;41), primases (ORFs 42&#x02013;43), and topoisomerase (ORF 44). This structured genomic architecture allows KPKp to replicate independently of host cellular systems, thereby conferring a higher burst size, broad host range as validated by EOP &#x00026; One-step growth curve analyses Although KSKp, with a genome size of 167,101 bp, does not meet the classification threshold for jumbo phages, its genome exhibits distinct replication features, including DNA helicases (ORFs 55&#x02013;56) and a DNA primase (ORF 217), supporting a highly productive lytic cycle. The presence of DNA helicases in ORF 55 &#x00026; 56 and DNA primase in ORF 217 aids KSKp in maintaining its high burst size.</p><p>WGS and annotation studies confirmed the strictly lytic lifestyle of both phages, evidenced by the complete absence of lysogeny-associated genes, including integrase, excisionase and repressor elements, thereby eliminating the risk of prophage integration or horizontal gene transfer an essential criterion for clinical safety. These features coupled with cocktail and PAS systems validated in this study will surpass the functional limitations of conventional phage therapy, enhancing its therapeutic potential in MDR infections of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, substantial reductions in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> planktonic cell counts were observed following both phage cocktail and PAS treatments, highlighting the potential of phage-antibiotic combinations for enhancing therapeutic efficacy. The phage cocktail alone achieved a&#x0202f;~&#x0202f;12.4-log reduction in bacterial counts over 9&#x0202f;h, consistent with previous studies demonstrating potent bactericidal activity of phages in planktonic systems (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abedon, 2015</xref>). Notably, PAS treatment, even at low CIP and phage dosages, achieved similar reductions within just 3&#x0202f;h, underscoring the synergistic potential of phage-antibiotic combinations. This synergy not only enhances therapeutic outcomes but also significantly reduces the required dosages of both agents, minimizing side effects and resistance development (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In anti-biofilm assays, PAS treatment reduced biofilm density by ~93.4%, compared to ~71.4% with phage cocktail alone. This enhanced efficacy aligns with previous studies that reported superior biofilm disruption with combined phage-antibiotic treatments, which are particularly important for eradicating biofilms that are resistant to antibiotics alone (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian, 2024</xref>). Metabolic activity assays revealed minimal viability in PAS-treated biofilms, supporting its efficacy in targeting both dormant and metabolically active bacteria within biofilms. Microscopic analysis using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and CLSM revealed significant biofilm structural disintegration and a high proportion of dead cells following PAS treatment, supporting previous findings that phages can effectively penetrate and dismantle biofilm matrices (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Scherr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Amankwah et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>G. mellonella</italic> infection model served as an <italic>in vivo</italic> validation of phage safety and efficacy. Infected larvae exhibited ~90% mortality within 72&#x0202f;h, reflecting the virulence of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> in this model, which is widely used for preclinical infection studies (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2024</xref>). Phage-only treatment improved survival to 60&#x02013;70%, consistent with other studies showing therapeutic benefits of phage therapy in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Kelly and Jameson, 2024</xref>). Remarkably, PAS-treated larvae achieved 100% survival and exhibited significant bacterial clearance, further demonstrating the effectiveness of combined phage-antibiotic therapy <italic>in vivo</italic>. Histopathological analysis confirmed preserved tissue structure in PAS-treated larvae, while untreated controls showed extensive melanization, indicative of infection-related tissue damage. These findings align with previous studies showing that PAS offers robust protection in animal models (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Quansah et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Phage therapy can modulate host immune responses, with evidence indicating both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Van Belleghem et al. (2017)</xref> reported that exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to phages targeting <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> induced cytokines such as IL-1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-10, suggesting a complex immunomodulatory profile. Additionally, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Roach et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated that neutrophil activity was essential for effective phage-mediated clearance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a murine pneumonia model, emphasizing the concept of immunophage synergy. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating innate immune parameters, including macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis, to better understand the therapeutic landscape and limitations of phage-based interventions.</p><p>The observed PAS effect in this study demonstrated superior antibacterial efficacy compared to phage or antibiotic monotherapy, highlighting its therapeutic potential against MDR <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Similar results have been reported in previous studies. <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Gorodnichev et al. (2025)</xref> showed that specific phage-antibiotic combinations significantly reduced <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> viability, with the choice of experimental methodology influencing synergy outcomes. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">De Soir et al. (2024)</xref> demonstrated that PAS effectively disrupted <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilms, underlining the potential of PAS in treating biofilm-related infections. These findings support the potential of PAS as a viable strategy against AMR pathogens. In summary, this study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of lytic <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-targeting phages, KPKp and KSKp, highlighting the superior potential of combining phages with antibiotics like CIP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec47"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the combined application of PAS combinations offers a promising strategy for tackling the emergence of MDR <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains. This study highlights the efficacy of the lytic phages KPKp and KSKp, both individually and as a cocktail, in significantly reducing bacterial counts and biofilm biomass. The observed synergistic effects when phages are used in conjunction with antibiotics underscore their potential for enhancing therapeutic outcomes against MDR strains. These findings emphasize the need to further explore PAS and to select effective phages as viable alternatives in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Bioinformatics Infrastructure Facility (DBT, GOI; BT/BI/25/012/2012) for computational support.
