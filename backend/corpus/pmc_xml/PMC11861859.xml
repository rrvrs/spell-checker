In presente-day classifications, as ICD-10 and DSM-IV, an effort was made to homogenise the various regional and national concepts creating the group of &#x02018;Brief Psychoses&#x02019; (DSM) or &#x02018;Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorders&#x02019; (ICD). The marked heterogeneity and low diagnostic stability of these groups, mainly based on temporal criteria, has posed significant obstacles to further research and conceptualization. Given these difficulties, the latest revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) brought about a substantial change, restricting this diagnosis to polymorphic psychotic conditions of acute onset and rapid resolution, subgroup with greater diagnostic stability and characteristics distinct clinical features.</p></sec><sec id="sec1090"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The relevance of a better clarification for this nosological group is evident in the successive changes over the last century. ICD 11, once again, substantially changed the diagnostic criteria and the scope of this nosological entity, leaving doubts about the independent nature of this group, its connection to schizophrenia, as an attenuated form (more common in women and in developing countries), or even as a form of psychosis that is closer to affective disorders (due to its clinical evolution). Although little explored, this issue remains a source of doubt and interest, calling into question the Kraepelinian dichotomy for the so-called endogenous psychoses.</p></sec><sec id="sec1091"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
