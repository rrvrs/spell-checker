While telehealth can improve healthcare access, it may exacerbate inequities for people with disabilities. This scoping review explores the needs, experiences, and difficulties people with disabilities face when accessing telehealth services in the United Kingdom&#x02019;s (UK) National Health Service (NHS).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic search was conducted using the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The search terms included variations of &#x0201c;telehealth,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;disability,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;impairment,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;United Kingdom,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;NHS.&#x0201d; Studies published after January 2010 were included if they addressed the experiences of people with disabilities when using telehealth. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, and findings were synthesized into five key themes: patient and carer satisfaction, benefits of telehealth, healthcare provider perspectives, disability-specific barriers, and technological barriers.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>The studies highlighted varied experiences across different disabilities, telehealth technologies, and medical specialties. While patients and carers generally expressed satisfaction with telehealth&#x02019;s convenience and accessibility, a preference for face-to-face consultations remained. Key barriers included technological challenges such as poor internet connectivity, unfamiliarity with digital tools, and device access, as well as disability-specific challenges, particularly for sensory impairments. Reported benefits of telehealth included improved access to care and flexibility for patients with disabilities. However, healthcare provider perspectives highlighted concerns about the ability to build a rapport and perform thorough assessments remotely.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Telehealth should complement traditional care through a hybrid approach.

The concept has evolved significantly since its first documented use in 1879, when an anonymous writer described a doctor diagnosing a sick child over the telephone &#x02013; an invention that had just been introduced by Alexander Graham Bell (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Over time, telehealth has evolved from simple telephone consultations to more advanced digital platforms, spurred by the rise of internet and mobile technologies. Recognizing telehealth&#x02019;s potential to overcome geographical barriers in healthcare, especially in underserved regions, in 2005 the World Health Organisation (WHO) encouraged member states to enhance their information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, in order to ensure equitable, affordable, and universal access to healthcare services (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The past decade has seen remarkable advancements in technology and significant reductions in the cost of communication devices and internet services, greatly expanding telehealth&#x02019;s scope and applications (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further accelerated the adoption of telehealth solutions, particularly within the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). By March 2020, telemedicine accounted for approximately 10% of outpatient appointments in the NHS, a sharp rise from 3.5% just a year earlier (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). To support this shift, the NHS rolled out the &#x02018;Attend Anywhere&#x02019; platform for video consultations nationally, resulting in nearly 80,000 remote consultations conducted by May 2020 (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>While the surge in telehealth usage has improved healthcare access for many, it also carries the risk of deepening the existing inequities experienced by people with disabilities (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Disabilities encompass a wide range of physical, sensory, mental, or intellectual impairments that can profoundly impact individuals&#x02019; daily lives (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Globally, over one billion people live with disability, including approximately 11 million in the UK (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggest that individuals with disabilities often experience poorer access to healthcare, including primary and cancer care, due to various challenges such as difficulty attending appointments and the lack of reasonable adjustments (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Telehealth has the potential to address these barriers by allowing individuals with various impairments to receive care from the comfort of their homes. This approach empowers individuals by giving them control over their health management, while reducing the logistical challenges of physical travel (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, if telehealth solutions are not designed with the needs of end-users in mind, they risk failing to meet the specific requirements of people with disabilities, potentially widening health disparities (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In this scoping review, we aim to explore telehealth services in the UK in relation to people with disabilities. Our objectives are: (1) To examine how telehealth services are provided to people with disabilities, (2) To identify barriers, including technological and disability-specific challenges, from the perspectives of patients and healthcare providers, (3) To evaluate the experiences and views of people with disabilities and their careers regarding telehealth services, and (4) To synthesize these findings into actionable insights to guide the future design, implementation, and evaluation of telehealth services tailored to people with disabilities in the UK.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>Our search methodology followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Our review protocol was not previously published. We searched the following databases: CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane.</p><p>The search concept &#x02018;Telehealth&#x02019; considered all terms related to telehealth and remote consultations. Telehealth is defined as communications and information technology to provide healthcare services remotely, where the patient and provider are not in the same physical location (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Communication modalities include real-time interactions (for example telephone or video) and asynchronous methods (for example email, text messaging, software and mobile applications) (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Utilising the conceptual framework of telehealth taxonomic terms by van Dyk, the term &#x02018;telehealth&#x02019; was considered to include &#x02018;Mobile Health (mHealth)&#x02019;, &#x02018;Telemedicine&#x02019; and &#x02018;Telecare&#x02019; (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Telehealth is considered to be a superset of telemedicine and related applications, such as telepharmacy, teleradiology, telepsychiatry, telecare. Under van Dyk&#x02019;s conceptual framework, mHealth is considered to be a digital health technology that can contain elements from all of these areas (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). During the search process, all the subject headings under telehealth or telemedicine were included, where available. For example, the MeSH subject library included &#x02018;Mobile Health&#x02019;, &#x02018;MHealth&#x02019;, and &#x02018;Telehealth&#x02019; under the heading &#x02018;Telemedicine&#x02019;.</p><p>The search concept &#x02018;Disability&#x02019; is related to disability and is a synonym of impairment. Disability was defined as a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term negative effect on daily life. This was compatible with the internationally accepted definition of disability according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (more commonly known as ICF), which includes the dimensions of impairment, activity limitations and participation restrictions (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The type of disability was not specified or limited in order to yield as many studies as possible in the search.</p><p>Our search strategy combined the following concepts: &#x02018;Telehealth&#x02019;, &#x02018;Disability&#x02019;, &#x02018;Impairment&#x02019;, &#x02018;United Kingdom&#x02019;, and &#x02018;NHS&#x02019;. We broadened the terms for telehealth to include &#x02018;Telemedicine&#x02019;, &#x02018;Remote&#x02019;, &#x02018;Online&#x02019;, &#x02018;Video&#x02019;, &#x02018;Telephone&#x02019; and &#x02018;Digital Consultation&#x02019;.</p><p>Our search was initially conducted in October 2023, with another final search conducted in January 2025 to identify any new articles which had been published in the intervening period. We limited our search to studies from January 2010 onwards, supported by trend analyses of eHealth medical literature, which showed exponential growth in telehealth research after the year 2010 (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

Specifically, there were four cross-sectional surveys, one ethnographic study, one process evaluation within a randomized controlled trial (RCT), one internal pilot study within an RCT, one toolkit development and evaluation, one multi-methods evaluation with surveys and interviews, and one retrospective evaluation.</p><p>The telehealth services in the studies covered a wide range of medical specialties. Two studies focused on geriatrics, examining services for older patients with multiple comorbidities. Another three studies explored telehealth in psychiatry, specifically addressing intellectual disabilities. Two additional studies focused on neurology, one on motor neuron disease (MND) and the other on multiple sclerosis (MS). The other three single studies investigated telehealth applications in paediatrics [chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)], audiology (tinnitus), and rehabilitation (physical disabilities).</p><p>The telehealth technologies used were also diverse. Telephone and video consultations were the primary modes of delivery in six studies. Other studies utilized specialized platforms, such as &#x02018;Attend Anywhere&#x02019; for audiology and tinnitus care, and a custom-designed system for MND. One study employed a web-based platform to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for patients with CFS.</p><p>Importantly, all studies focused on delivering or evaluating telehealth services for patients with known chronic conditions.

Its potential to improve care and accessibility across various medical disciplines has been well documented (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In certain circumstances, telehealth may be equivalent to or even more clinically effective than the usual standard of care, depending on the context and medical specialty (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telehealth worldwide, including the UK, where it became an essential tool for maintaining healthcare delivery during lockdown (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The rapid adoption highlighted telehealth&#x02019;s ability to bridge some health disparities, particularly for those in underserved or remote areas (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, the evidence remains largely discipline-specific, and telehealth&#x02019;s broader applications and limitations require further exploration (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Despite these benefits, telehealth also has the potential to exacerbate existing healthcare inequities. People with disabilities experience barriers to accessing healthcare, work, public spaces and increasingly, digital technologies. Digital exclusion of vulnerable populations may limit the effectiveness of telehealth in reaching and providing healthcare for vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). As a result, individuals with disabilities often face poorer health outcomes (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Given the rising adoption of telehealth, it is essential to ensure that telehealth meets the specific needs of all end-users. Our scoping review contributes to this effort, shedding light on telehealth technologies as they relate to people with disabilities.</p><sec id="sec9"><label>4.1</label><title>Patient and carer satisfaction</title><p>Patient satisfaction was a prominent theme reported in the majority of the studies and has been generally positive. There were however nuanced challenges across different patient groups.</p><p>In the paediatric population, the web-based CBT for adolescents with CFS was well received (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). As the service was otherwise conventionally delivered from a specialized centre, many families valued the convenience of being able to avoid travel, although there were a minority (16%) who declined telehealth in favor of traditional consultations, due to technical barriers or a preference for in-person interaction.</p><p>In studies that focused on neurological conditions like MS and MND, telehealth was appreciated for improving independence and coordination of care (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, in the case of smartphone technology for MS patients there were concerns regarding data security and a reduction in face-to-face interaction (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). For the MND study, the high number of alerts generated by the telehealth in MND (TiM) system and communication issues led to gaps between patient expectations and the responses of the health service (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>For carers of individuals with intellectual disability, there was high satisfaction with telephone consultation, although there was still a preference for face-to face consultations (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). While telepsychiatry was seen as flexible and reduced travel time, in one study a large percentage of patients and carers (66 and 69%) still preferred face-to-face consultations, due to loss of rapport and difficulties in conducting mental state examination remotely (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In a different study conducted in 2024 on telepsychiatry, although there were no statistically significant differences between the groups who preferred face-to-face reviews to video consultations, participants who preferred face to face consultations cited a preference for being in the same room as the psychiatrist (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). A similar concern was raised in another study, where while the majority of frail older adults (86%) reported a positive experience with remote consultations, many still preferred face-to-face consultations for relationship-building and a more thorough evaluation of their needs (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>Across the studies, the consistent theme was that telehealth offered improved access and convenience, resulting in good patient satisfaction. This was similar to results from other studies examining satisfaction with telehealth services throughout different specialties in the UK (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It is still important to take a considered approach regarding what might be acceptable for patients and carers. For example, a survey of 500 patients reported that certain clinical situations are more likely to be accepted to be provided through telehealth, such as receiving and transmitting exam results and providing psychological support (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, the preference for face-to-face consultations remained strong, with these still considered critical for building rapport, thorough clinical examinations, and ensuring patient confidence in their care (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><label>4.2</label><title>Benefits of telehealth</title><p>Improved access to care was a central theme, which enabled timely communication for urgent concerns (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). For frail adults, comprehensive assessments of their home environment were possible without them having to leave their home, making healthcare more accessible for this vulnerable group (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). For specialised centres delivering unique services, accessibility was enhanced with the avoidance of physical and logistical challenges of having to travel to appointments (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Another key benefit was flexibility, especially in the context of persons with disabilities who might find traveling to appointments challenging (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Telecare devices also offered individuals greater independence and the ability to manage their health conditions remotely, provided that the technologies were tailored to their unique needs (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>For the complex management of chronic diseases like MND and MS, telehealth allowed for better care coordination and monitoring (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). For example, TiM system for MND improved monitoring of disease progression, with regular updates from patients enabling more responsive care.</p><p>The use of telehealth also facilitated family involvement. Family members and carers helped customise devices to fit the needs of older adults, or were integral in reporting health status (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). For younger patients, their family assisted them to participate with the CBT platform (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Our findings mirror those of another systematic review on access to healthcare for persons with disabilities in underserved areas, where telehealth not only made it possible to access desired interventions, but also increased contact time with healthcare providers and reduced travel time and costs (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). For children and younger adults, it has also been reported that while telehealth does improve access to care, it often requires substantial support from family members or caregivers to facilitate participation (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><label>4.3</label><title>Healthcare provider perspectives</title><p>Healthcare provider perspectives on telehealth often aligned with the concerns expressed by patients across different studies. Both groups appreciated the benefits of telehealth.</p><p>For example, general practitioners (GPs) valued the capacity for remote evaluation of frail adults, but expressed a preference for in-person visits due to difficulty in building rapport and performing thorough assessments (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Doctors also preferred face-to-face appointments for more sensitive discussions such as &#x02018;do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation&#x02019; (DNACPR) (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Interestingly, this specific study also raised concerns from healthcare providers regarding the time burden of this service, which required a long assessment process, and questioned its cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Communication gaps in digital interactions also frustrated both healthcare providers and patients, with the high number of alerts in the TiM system complicating effective communication (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Mental health assessments were also challenging through a telehealth approach (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>In line with existing literature, healthcare providers often report positive experiences with telehealth for individuals with disabilities, provided that these digital interventions deliver outcomes comparable to face-to face visits (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Reported benefits include increased patient contact time and reduced travel time and cost for patients.</p><p>A toolkit and practical guidance could serve as valuable resources for capturing and integrating both healthcare provider and patient perspectives in telehealth (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). For healthcare providers, challenges include adequate training for remote assessments, digital skills, and safety protocols &#x02013; factors which are essential for the effective delivery of remote care. Co-development of such toolkits for providers with input from individuals with disabilities would also ensure that resources are both practical and adaptable to their needs, with two-way communication enhancing mutual trust.</p></sec><sec id="sec12"><label>4.4</label><title>Disability-specific barriers</title><p>Persons with disabilities can often present with sensory impairments which could prove particularly challenging during remote consultations (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Persons with visual impairment often require accessible formats, such as audio instructions or screen readers, to help them navigate video conferencing platforms or mobile applications (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). For persons with sensory impairment, video consultations are generally preferred over telephone consultations as they allow for lipreading and non-verbal communication. However, even with video consultations challenges remain, especially for those who rely heavily on lipreading, since internet quality or camera angles could hinder this process (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>We found similar barriers in our review. Patients with MS who experienced visual impairments found it difficult to navigate smartphone-based healthcare platforms, limiting their ability to fully benefit from telehealth (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). For patients with tinnitus, although the uptake of telehealth was 80%, the subgroup with more severe tinnitus and hearing loss were more likely to decline telehealth consultations due to challenges of using the video-based conferencing platform (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p><p>For individuals with multiple morbidities, the type of disability and its impact can be heterogenous, ranging from stroke to arthritis, unsteadiness, and incontinence. While telecare technologies allow for greater independence, the key benefit reported is the ability for devices to be customised to the needs of the individual, a term is referred to as bricolage (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p><p>There were more barriers identified specific to patients with intellectual disability with many patients relying on carers due to limited digital literacy. Video consultations resulted in lower visibility of body language and non-verbal cues which are more critical to these group of patients. Additionally, there were potential safeguarding concerns in this vulnerable population, since video consultation might make the detection of individuals not acting in the patient&#x02019;s best interests difficult.</p></sec><sec id="sec13"><label>4.5</label><title>Technical barriers</title><p>There were several common technical issues reported across the different studies. There were issues with poor 3G or Wi-Fi signals in some areas which caused poor video quality, or platforms to time-out while patients were still composing lengthy responses (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Data security and information governance were also concerns that were faced by some patients (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p><p>The lack of familiarity with the technology being used could affect both healthcare provider and patients (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Difficulties in overcoming technological barriers for patients, such as setting up devices, often require support from carers or family members (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). If devices or technologies are perceived as too complex or difficult to use, with poor integration into daily life and a mismatch with personal needs, patients often abandon or misuse these technologies (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>These barriers are not unique to telehealth for persons with disabilities. A systematic review reported that commonly identified barriers to the implementation of telehealth include technically challenging staff, poor system design, bandwidth limitation, patient literacy and updated hardware (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, the WHO has recognized the challenge of ensuring accessibility in telehealth services and has published global standards to address this issue for persons with disabilities (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). For example, these standards stress the importance of providing adequate and specific guidance to individuals with various type of disabilities, in order to help them access telehealth services and reduce the impact of technical barriers (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec14"><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The studies reviewed have several limitations that may affect the generalizability and applicability of their findings. Many studies were conducted in specialist care settings (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), often utilizing purpose-built software for teleconsultations (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). While these environments provide valuable insights, they may not reflect the realities of broader healthcare systems that face disparities in resources, potentially limiting the applicability of their results to less resourced settings. One study featured a small sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;13), which may limit the representativeness of its results (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Concerns about selection bias were also noted, as many studies recruited participants who were already inclined toward remote consultations or excluded those who opted out of telehealth (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). For example, one study used online recruitment, which may have resulted in findings reflecting participants who were both willing and able to access digital services (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).
