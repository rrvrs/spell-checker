Introduction</title><p>Physical fitness during childhood and adolescence is a key factor for lifelong health, as it is closely linked to physical, psychological, and social well-being [<xref rid="B1-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that perceived physical fitness at an early age is associated with various fitness and health outcomes [<xref rid="B3-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], emphasizing the importance of continuous evaluation and monitoring. For instance, higher levels of self-perceived fitness during childhood have been linked to better physical literacy, which in turn correlates with improved health behaviors and physical activity levels [<xref rid="B4-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, adolescents who report positive perceptions of their physical fitness tend to experience fewer psychosomatic health complaints, highlighting the relevance of fostering positive fitness perceptions early in life [<xref rid="B5-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Self-reporting methodologies have been widely used as valid and reliable tools to assess multiple dimensions of physical fitness, including general fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, speed/agility, and flexibility [<xref rid="B3-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This procedure not only allows for a comprehensive assessment of fitness levels but also facilitates the comparison of self-perceived fitness across diverse populations and settings. However, the primary value of self-reported fitness scales also lies in their ability to capture subjective experiences and perceptions, which may not always align with objectively measured fitness and health parameters. This discrepancy between perceived and actual fitness is particularly relevant in adolescent populations, where social and psychological factors may influence self-assessment [<xref rid="B6-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>While many studies have focused on objective determinants of physical fitness, less attention has been given to subjective factors influencing self-perception, particularly among pediatric and adolescent populations. This gap is critical because understanding the factors that shape self-perception can inform interventions aimed at promoting realistic and positive self-assessments, which, in turn, may enhance physical activity engagement and overall health outcomes. Additionally, self-perceived fitness has been associated with psychological constructs such as self-esteem and body image [<xref rid="B7-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which further underscores the need for integrative approaches when evaluating fitness in young populations.</p><p>Sex differences in perceived physical fitness also constitute a relevant topic in current research. Previous studies have suggested that girls tend to perceive higher levels of flexibility compared to boys, while boys often report greater levels of muscular strength and agility [<xref rid="B8-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, boys consistently demonstrate higher self-confidence in their physical abilities, including strength and sport competence, compared to girls [<xref rid="B9-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This difference is partly attributed to social and psychological factors that influence how adolescents evaluate their physical capabilities, with girls showing lower self-confidence and greater insecurity related to physical self-perception [<xref rid="B9-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, anthropometric factors such as body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and lean body mass may significantly influence self-perceived fitness. In fact, self-perceived body image has been shown to correlate positively with fat mass and BMI, especially among females, highlighting the influence of adiposity on physical self-worth [<xref rid="B10-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, muscular fitness has been found to play a more significant role in boys&#x02019; physical self-perception, where absolute muscular strength positively correlates with perceived strength and overall physical self-worth [<xref rid="B11-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Likewise, biochemical parameters such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels may also play an important role, especially in the context of cardiovascular health. Elevated LDL levels have been consistently linked to increased cardiovascular risk, as oxidized LDL contributes to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and promotes endothelial inflammation. In contrast, HDL exerts cardioprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antithrombotic properties, helping maintain endothelial integrity and cholesterol efflux from artery walls [<xref rid="B12-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, given the well-established role of HDL and LDL levels in cardiovascular risk assessment, these parameters may serve as valuable variables to compare self-perceived cardiovascular health with objectively measured health status [<xref rid="B14-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite these findings, the relationship between anthropometric and biochemical variables with subjective fitness perception remains unclear, as previous studies have produced inconsistent results. Therefore, the present study aims to fill this gap by analyzing self-reported physical fitness scores according to sex, age, BMI, fat mass percentage, lean body mass, and HDL and LDL levels in primary school students. The findings are expected to provide a better understanding of the determinants of self-perceived physical fitness during childhood and adolescence, which may help design effective intervention strategies to improve health and well-being in this population.</p><p>In this context, the current study seeks to clarify how various anthropometric and biochemical indicators are associated with self-perceived physical fitness among primary school children. Specifically, the research question guiding this inquiry is as follows: To what extent do sex, age, body composition parameters (BMI, fat mass, and lean body mass), and lipid profile (HDL-C and LDL-C levels) predict self-perceived physical fitness in a population of young athletes? By addressing this question, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of how subjective fitness perceptions relate to objective health markers, providing valuable insights for health promotion during childhood and adolescence.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jfmk-10-00175"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-jfmk-10-00175"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>This study followed a cross-sectional design aimed at analyzing the relationship between self-perceived physical fitness and anthropometric and biochemical variables in primary school students. A cross-sectional study involves the observation of a population at a single point in time, allowing for the identification of patterns and relationships among variables without inferring causality. This design was selected because it is particularly well suited for estimating prevalence and exploring potential associations in large, naturally occurring populations such as school settings [<xref rid="B16-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The study was conducted within the framework of the COR-SCHOOL Project, an initiative focused on assessing cardiometabolic health indicators among school-aged children and adolescents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects" id="sec2dot2-jfmk-10-00175"><title>2.2. Participants</title><p>This study included 673 young athletes (56.2% boys) aged 6 to 12 years recruited from extracurricular sports programs located in the provinces in northeastern Spain. The study was conducted in this region based on the research team&#x02019;s institutional affiliation and established collaborations with local educational and sports organizations. This location was also chosen for its practical accessibility and sociodemographic diversity, offering both urban and rural settings aligned with the objectives of the COR-SCHOOL Project. Participants were selected through a stratified random sampling approach to ensure representativeness across different educational institutions. Inclusion criteria comprised enrollment in primary education, informed consent from parents or guardians, and the ability to complete the self-reported fitness questionnaire. Exclusion criteria included any medical condition that could significantly influence physical activity, as reported by the participants themselves. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref rid="B17-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of the Catalan Council (30/CEICGC/2020).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-jfmk-10-00175"><title>2.3.

Anthropometric Variables</title><p>Anthropometric measurements were conducted following the standards of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) [<xref rid="B21-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Body mass was measured using a digital scale (Seca 877, Hamburg, Germany; accuracy &#x000b1; 0.1 kg), and height was assessed with a portable stadiometer (Seca 213, Hamburg, Germany; accuracy &#x000b1; 0.1 cm) to calculate the BMI by dividing body mass in kilograms by the square of height in meters (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Skinfold thickness was measured using a calibrated skinfold caliper (Harpenden, Baty International, Burgess, UK; accuracy &#x000b1; 0.2 mm) at three standard anatomical sites: triceps, subscapular, and supraspinale. All measurements were performed on the right side of the body, in accordance with the standardized procedures of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK). Each measurement was taken twice, and a third measurement was taken if the first two differed by more than 5%. The final value used was the average of the closest two readings. Assessments were conducted by trained personnel certified at a minimum of ISAK Level 1. A non-elastic anthropometric tape (Lufkin W606PM, Apex Tool Group, Sparks, MD, USA) was used to measure girths when required. Estimates of fat and lean body mass percentages were derived using ISAK-approved population-specific equations appropriate for the age and characteristics of the participant&#x02019;s lean body mass [<xref rid="B21-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot3-jfmk-10-00175"><title>2.3.3.

Statistical Analysis</title><p>To assess data normality, the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test, Q-Q plot, and histogram plot of residuals were used, as they are particularly suitable for detecting deviations from normality in large samples. The combination of visual (Q-Q plot and histograms) and statistical methods ensured a robust assessment of the distributional assumptions required for subsequent analyses. Given the sample size (N = 673), the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test was deemed appropriate. Group comparisons were performed using Student&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test for normally distributed variables and the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables, providing appropriate sensitivity depending on data characteristics.

Discussion</title><p>The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between self-perceived physical fitness and anthropometric and biochemical variables in young athletes participating in extracurricular sports activities in northeastern Spain. The primary findings highlight significant associations between several dimensions of self-perceived fitness and specific anthropometric and biochemical variables, with some notable differences between sexes. These findings provide valuable insights into how physical self-perception is shaped by both physical and biological factors during childhood and adolescence.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-jfmk-10-00175"><title>4.1. Association Between Body Composition and Self-Perceived Physical Fitness</title><p>One of the most relevant findings of this study was the significant association between fat mass and self-perceived physical fitness across all fitness dimensions (i.e., general fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, speed/agility, and flexibility). Specifically, higher fat mass levels were consistently associated with lower self-perceived fitness scores, suggesting that adiposity negatively influences how young athletes perceive their physical abilities. These results are consistent with previous studies that have reported similar associations between body composition and self-perceived fitness, emphasizing the impact of excess body fat on physical self-concept [<xref rid="B10-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B28-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the inverse association between fat mass and perceived fitness was strongest for cardiorespiratory fitness, with decreasing magnitudes also observed for flexibility, speed/agility, muscular strength, and general fitness. This pattern could be explained by the biomechanical limitations imposed by higher fat mass [<xref rid="B29-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which may reduce performance in activities requiring rapid and forceful movements [<xref rid="B11-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the relationship between adiposity and perceived flexibility was less consistent, suggesting that other factors, such as joint mobility and muscle elasticity, may play a more decisive role in flexibility perception [<xref rid="B30-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>A relevant aspect of our findings is the significant positive relationship between BMI and self-perceived muscular strength, which may appear contradictory given the negative effect of fat mass on muscular strength perception. This apparent paradox can be explained by considering that BMI does not distinguish between fat mass and lean mass [<xref rid="B31-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], implying that muscle development in adolescents may contribute to higher BMI without necessarily indicating increased adiposity.</p><p>In this context, it is plausible that young athletes with greater muscle development perceive themselves as physically stronger, leading to higher scores in self-reported muscular strength. This underscores the importance of carefully interpreting BMI as an indirect indicator of body composition, particularly in physically active populations where lean mass may represent a significant proportion of total body weight [<xref rid="B32-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-jfmk-10-00175"><title>4.2. Biochemical Parameters and Self-Perceived Fitness</title><p>Regarding the association between biochemical parameters and self-perceived fitness, the results indicated a positive relationship between HDL levels and self-reported general and cardiorespiratory fitness. This finding suggests that favorable lipid profiles may enhance perceptions of cardiovascular health, as HDL has been linked to improved endothelial function and reduced cardiovascular risk through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and vasodilatory effects [<xref rid="B33-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, elevated LDL levels&#x02014;typically linked to increased atherogenic risk&#x02014;did not significantly influence self-perceived fitness scores. This finding reinforces the idea that subjective perceptions of fitness may not fully capture underlying cardiovascular risk factors. In this regard, emerging evidence indicates that the association between lipid profiles and perceived health is likely shaped more by lifestyle habits, physical activity levels, and overall cardiovascular fitness than by isolated biochemical markers [<xref rid="B34-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-jfmk-10-00175"><title>4.3. General Fitness: Effect of Sex and Fat Mass</title><p>The results of our study show a significant association between sex and self-perceived general fitness, with boys having a lower probability of reporting high scores compared to girls. The fact that both sexes of our sample participate in extracurricular sports activities likely fosters similar physical competencies and self-perceptions [<xref rid="B35-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], as the active lifestyle shared by all participants seems to contribute to minimizing the typical sex differences commonly observed in non-athletic populations [<xref rid="B37-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, the positive self-perception observed among girls in this study, particularly regarding general physical fitness, might reflect a growing emphasis on inclusive and empowering sports environments that encourage girls to develop self-esteem in their physical abilities [<xref rid="B38-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This context may partly explain the divergence from previous studies that reported lower self-perception of fitness among girls [<xref rid="B37-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B40-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], underscoring the importance of considering sample characteristics when interpreting self-perception outcomes.</p><p>Notably, no significant interaction was observed between sex and fat mass, suggesting that the negative impact of adiposity is consistent across sexes.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-jfmk-10-00175"><title>4.4. Sex Differences in Flexibility Perception</title><p>The observed differences between sexes in flexibility align with previous research indicating that girls consistently demonstrate higher levels of flexibility compared to boys. This difference is supported by studies that highlight sex-based anatomical and physiological factors, such as greater joint mobility and increased tissue elasticity among females, which may be influenced by higher production of relaxin [<xref rid="B41-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additionally, social and cultural norms that promote flexibility-related activities in girls from a young age may further reinforce these differences [<xref rid="B9-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, research has shown that girls tend to perceive themselves as more flexible compared to boys, further emphasizing the role of sex differences in flexibility perception [<xref rid="B9-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>These sex disparities in flexibility have practical implications for physical education and training programs. Recognizing the inherent variability in flexibility between boys and girls is essential for designing tailored assessments and interventions that accurately reflect their physical capabilities. A more individualized approach could help foster a positive and realistic perception of physical fitness among both sexes.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-jfmk-10-00175"><title>4.5. Sex Differences in Cardiorespiratory Fitness Perception</title><p>An intriguing observation in this study was the lack of significant differences in self-perceived cardiorespiratory fitness between boys and girls, despite evidence suggesting that boys typically exhibit greater objective cardiorespiratory capacity [<xref rid="B37-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This finding diverges from previous research that often reports a higher self-perceived cardiorespiratory fitness among boys, likely due to social and psychological factors that influence self-assessment, including societal expectations and sex norms [<xref rid="B42-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, our study&#x02019;s unique context may explain this divergence. Unlike general adolescent populations, our sample consists exclusively of young athletes who regularly participate in structured sports activities within sports clubs. This shared training environment likely contributes to a leveling of perceived cardiorespiratory fitness between boys and girls [<xref rid="B44-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], as both groups develop similar physical competencies and self-perceptions through consistent athletic practice. Such a context may mitigate the typical sex differences observed in non-athletic populations [<xref rid="B37-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], underscoring the importance of considering sample characteristics when interpreting self-perception outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-jfmk-10-00175"><title>4.6. Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This study presents several strengths, including a substantial sample size and the combination of objective anthropometric and biochemical data with subjective assessments of physical fitness. Furthermore, employing rigorous statistical methods, such as generalized linear models, guarantees a precise interpretation of the findings. However, its cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and the reliance on self-reported data may introduce biases related to social desirability or subjective interpretation. Moreover, since the sample was drawn from a single geographic region in Spain, the external validity of the findings may be limited when extrapolating results to other populations or cultural contexts. Additionally, although this study provides relevant insights based on self-perceived physical fitness, the absence of objective fitness assessments (e.g., cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, or agility tests) represents a limitation. Future studies should incorporate such measures to validate and complement subjective reports and to better capture the multidimensional nature of physical fitness in youth populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-jfmk-10-00175"><title>4.7. Practical Implications and Future Research</title><p>The results of this study have practical implications for designing interventions aimed at enhancing self-perception of physical fitness in young athletes. An integrated approach that addresses both physical and psychological aspects is essential for fostering realistic and positive self-assessments, which can ultimately promote healthier lifestyle choices. Recent research emphasizes the importance of combined interventions that consider both fitness levels and self-perception as critical determinants of long-term health outcomes [<xref rid="B45-jfmk-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to explore causal relationships and interventions that target the interplay between physical attributes and self-perception. Additionally, examining how these relationships evolve across different developmental stages could provide valuable insights for tailored intervention strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-jfmk-10-00175"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated significant associations between self-perceived physical fitness and anthropometric and biochemical variables in young athletes, with notable differences between boys and girls. The results showed that higher fat mass was consistently linked to lower self-perceived fitness dimensions. Additionally, HDL levels were positively associated with self-reported general and cardiorespiratory fitness, while LDL levels did not significantly impact perception.</p><p>Sex differences emerged in perceptions of general fitness and flexibility, with girls reporting higher self-perceived fitness despite comparable athletic involvement. This could reflect the growing emphasis on inclusive sports environments that foster confidence and self-esteem among female athletes. The lack of significant sex differences in perceived cardiorespiratory fitness, despite boys generally having higher objective capacity, suggests that regular athletic participation may help equalize self-perception between sexes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
