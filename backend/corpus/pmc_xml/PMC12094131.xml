Infant nutrition practices began with breastfeeding, but have expanded to include innovations such as the modern bottle and the use of alternatives to breast milk and formulas&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The invention of modern infant formulas arose from the need to address infant feeding challenges such as breastfeeding problems and the lack of nutritional alternatives to breast milk. Early attempts to create &#x0201c;baby foods&#x0201d; were nutritionally inadequate, as infants were fed primarily carbohydrate-rich diets consisting of mixtures of cereals, flour, and bread cooked in broth, water, or animal milk when breast milk was not available&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Over time, infant formulas evolved as scientists analyzed the composition of human breast milk, allowing animal milk, primarily cow&#x02019;s milk, to be modified to more closely resemble human milk&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the United States, organizations such as the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) promote and recommend the safe and appropriate use of infant formulas, taking into account the dietary needs of infants and chronic medical conditions&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidance to governments to prevent malnutrition among infants and young children&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In Latin America, WHO recommendations are not always followed, increasing the risk of undernutrition and child morbidity due to inadequate breastfeeding practices and inadequate introduction of complementary feeding&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Historically, the region has struggled with high rates of child undernutrition, as evidenced in the 1970s when records show that one-third of children under five years of age died from undernutrition [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Malnutrition is associated with 2.7 million infant deaths per year, accounting for about 45% of all infant deaths&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Aggressive marketing of infant formula and breastmilk substitutes, combined with social and economic changes, has had a negative impact on breastfeeding rates and has led to increased commercialization of infant formula&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;Social inequality also plays a key role in this trend, with studies indicating that formula use is higher in lower-income groups. Furthermore, in developing countries, social networks and influencers have been associated with inappropriate feeding practices, with women often relying on informal sources of information on pediatric nutrition&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>WHO and the United Nations International Children&#x02019;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) recommend exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first 6 months of life to ensure optimal development and growth&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].&#x000a0;For preterm infants, the preferred method of nutrition is the administration of breast milk through nasogastric tubes, as breast milk not only provides nutrition but also protection against infection and supports neurological development&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Premature births disrupt the development of the newborn&#x02019;s organs, including the intestines, and enteral feeding helps promote the growth and maturation of the intestinal tract&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Complementary feeding is recommended after six months. At this point, the caloric and nutritional needs of a growing infant exceed those provided by breast milk alone&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In cases where breastfeeding is not possible, appropriate infant formulas are recommended.</p><p>Given the critical role of enteral nutrition in pediatric health, a comprehensive understanding of its historical development, compositional nuances, and clinical applications is essential for informed decision-making in healthcare. This narrative review aims to examine the historical evolution of infant feeding practices, analyze the compositional differences among enteral formulas, and explore their clinical indications and considerations in pediatric care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Methodology</p><p>The bibliographic search was carried out independently by two authors in the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, covering the period from January 2000 to March 2025. The following keywords were used alone or in combination: infant formula, enteral nutrition, breastfeeding, pediatric enteral feeding, human milk substitutes, clinical considerations, nutritional composition, protein hydrolysate formulas, amino acid-based formulas, blenderized formulas, infant malnutrition, and disease-specific nutrition. Narrative and systematic review articles, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), clinical guidelines, observational studies, and consensus documents relevant to the clinical use and composition of enteral formulas in the pediatric population were included. In addition, the bibliographies of the selected articles and the references included in previous reviews were reviewed in order to identify additional relevant literature. Finally, the articles were selected by revision cross between both authors, prioritizing the studies with greater methodological rigor and clinical applicability. This strategy allowed us to integrate the most relevant and updated evidence on the historical evolution, classification, nutritional characteristics, and clinical applications of infant enteral formulas.</p><p>Although a formal assessment of the quality of evidence (e.g., GRADE) was not performed due to the narrative nature of this review, efforts were made to prioritize high-quality sources. Preference was given to systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, RCTs, and articles published in peer-reviewed journals indexed in major databases. This approach aimed to ensure the inclusion of reliable and clinically relevant information, even in the absence of a structured evidence-grading system.</p><p>History of pediatric nutrition</p><p>Breastfeeding and Wet Nurses</p><p>Breastfeeding was regarded as the best feeding option for newborns and infants. Extensive research and evidence over the years have confirmed the importance of breast milk in the development and growth of infants, as breast milk can modify the function of the immune system, gastrointestinal tract, and brain development&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there are exceptional cases in which the mother is unable to breastfeed her child, such as lactation failure related to physiological reasons or death of the mother during or after childbirth. Before the 20th century, it was understood that an infant who was not breastfed would eventually die, and that breast milk was the only option for sustaining a developing baby&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Wet nursing is considered the first alternative feeding method for infants who could not be breastfed by their own mother, and the practice quickly became key to the human societies of the time. At times, it was believed that the wet nurse could cure or sicken the baby with her breast milk. Historical documents provide information on the dietary practices of wet nurses, describing the specific foods they were encouraged to consume or avoid based on the health of the baby. In addition to dietary restrictions, wet nurses often underwent medical treatments, such as bloodletting or purging, as if they were the ones suffering from the baby&#x02019;s illness&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>First Alternatives to Breast Milk</p><p>As stated earlier, experts correctly assessed that for infants to have a healthy development, the need to find an alternative similar to human milk became a necessity. Naturally, these artificial feeding options were multiple types of animal milks, with cow&#x02019;s milk being the most common. These types of milks were fed to the infant using a variety of devices and containers made of various materials, such as cow horns, clay, pottery, and wood&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The absence of reliable alternatives to breast milk contributed significantly to infant mortality. This is exemplified by the high mortality rate in London between 1780 and 1816, where seven out of eight hand-fed infants aged two years or less did not survive&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A more recent example is provided by a study in Mexico, which estimated that inadequate breastfeeding practices are associated with between 933 and 5,796 infant deaths annually due to illnesses such as respiratory infections, otitis media, gastroenteritis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). These data reinforce the ongoing importance of breastfeeding and highlight how its absence continues to impact infant mortality, even in contemporary settings&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Animal milk is not like breast milk in terms of macronutrient composition, and this led to the creation of homemade food supplements to use in conjunction with animal milk. In Europe, mothers and caregivers fed infants and children with substances such as panada and pap&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The invention of the glass bottle in the mid-19th century played an important role in improving hygiene and infant nutrition. This innovation, combined with the availability of infant formula, made bottle feeding a more attractive alternative to wet nursing for many mothers and caregivers&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Early Infant Formulas</p><p>The focus of early research in the late 19th and 20th centuries on infant nutrition was to create an alternative that was similar to breast milk on a nutritional level. As such, scientists began researching ways to reformulate animal milk to mimic human milk as closely as possible. The first patented and sold infant formula was developed in 1864 by Justus von Liebig and used modified cow&#x02019;s milk as a base&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Known as &#x0201c;baby soup,&#x0201d; this formula consisted of a mixture of cow&#x02019;s milk, malted starch, and potassium bicarbonate&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Liebig&#x02019;s formula was a great success and was the inspiration for many other competitors, however, a lack of understanding of the composition of human milk meant that many of these new formulas failed. In the following decades, there was significant development and marketing of various general milk formulas and specialized formulas with different amounts of nutrients and components&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Early Enteral Nutrition and Feeding</p><p>Enteral nutrition (EN) consists of the administration of liquid nutritional solutions directly into the gastrointestinal tract by means of probes. Although its historical origins date back to ancient civilizations, it was not until the 16th century that its use with rudimentary instruments was formally documented&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, it was not until the 1950s that permanent nasogastric tubes were implemented, despite initial resistance from the medical community, which contributed to episodes of hypoglycemia and malnutrition in infants&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the 1960s, enteral formulas designed specifically for pediatric use began to be manufactured, marking a milestone in the nutritional management of the critically ill neonate&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Current evidence supports that early EN in preterm infants improves intestinal maturation, favors the establishment of the microbiome, and stimulates neurodevelopment, consolidating it as a key therapeutic strategy&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Infant Formulas</p><p>The design of infant formulas has evolved toward highly specialized compositions that include precise mixtures of milk proteins, carbohydrates such as lactose or other sugars, lipids of vegetable origin, micronutrients, and specific additives&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These products are adjusted to the metabolic and clinical needs of healthy infants and those with chronic pathologies&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The ability to modify the concentration of macro- and micronutrients has allowed the development of personalized formulas that optimize digestive tolerance and reduce complications associated with diseases such as renal failure, intestinal disorders, and congenital heart disease&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are different types of enteral formulas available, as well as their respective characteristics and indications (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Types of enteral formulas available worldwide, characteristics, and indications.</title><p>Source: Prepared by the authors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082692-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Composition</p><p>Fat</p><p>Fat is the main energetic macronutrient in infant formulas, especially critical in premature infants, due to its role in neurological development and maturation of the central nervous system. Essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, precursors of arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential for cognitive and motor development and modulation of inflammatory responses. Both ARA and DHA are associated with a lower incidence of bronchitis, allergies, and respiratory infections&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Current formulas also incorporate milk fat globule membranes (MFGM), which not only facilitate lipid transport but also offer immunoprotective and neurodevelopmental functions&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The inclusion of structured triglycerides, both medium-chain (MCT) and long-chain (LCT), improves lipid absorption, modulates gut microbiota, reduces inflammation, and promotes bone mineralization. Common sources include fish oil and vegetable oils for MCT and canola, sunflower or soybean oil for LCT&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Protein</p><p>Proteins are fundamental in infant nutrition, since their amino acids favor tissue growth, enzyme synthesis, and neurological development. In the infant formula industry, cow's milk is the most widely used raw material due to its availability, stability in the supply chain, and nutritional profile, being a source of proteins such as whey and casein, which also have immunomodulatory properties. However, these proteins have a lower quality than those of breast milk, due to a lower content of essential amino acids&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Protein quality in formulas is key to cover the metabolic requirements of the infant, and its regulation is strict, since an excess has been associated with a greater risk of infant obesity. Currently, alternative protein sources have been incorporated, such as soy or pea, which are useful in cases of intolerance, although their use should be evaluated with caution. Mixed formulas (animal and vegetable) are not suitable for infants with cow's milk protein allergy. In addition, soy-based formulas are contraindicated in infants under six months of age due to possible exposure to phytoestrogens and their potential endocrine effects&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Carbohydrates</p><p>Lactose is the main carbohydrate in breast milk and is used in formulas to replicate its natural concentration. However, many standard pediatric formulas use corn syrup derivatives, making them lactose- and gluten-free, while others use sources such as rice syrup, pea starch, or agave. Legislation, such as that of the European Union, also allows the use of maltose, glucose, and sucrose. Among the most relevant carbohydrates are human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), absent in animal milk, with key functions such as protection against pathogens, immune development, and promotion of a healthy intestinal microbiota&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Carbohydrates are classified into glycemic, which raise plasma glucose upon absorption in the small intestine, and nonglycemic, which reach the large intestine undigested and exert prebiotic effects. Breast milk contains more than 200 HMOs with these properties, which are essential for the intestinal biome of the infant. In an attempt to bring formulas closer to the functional properties of breast milk, many are supplemented with bovine HMOs, synthetic HMOs and probiotics, which improve intestinal colonization, reduce the incidence of diarrhea and favor gastrointestinal maturation of the infant, especially in vulnerable populations such as premature infants or immunocompromised patients&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Micronutrients</p><p>Vitamins, minerals, and trace elements are essential micronutrients that must be supplemented through diets, as the body may not be able to synthesize them. Vitamins and minerals are important supplements found in infant formulas, as both can elicit immunogenicity, a specific response that triggers the immune system to induce immune responses&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented a rule that micronutrients must be present in all infant formulas, including the following vitamins: A, B1, B6, B12, C, D, E, and K along with other components such as folic acid, niacin, iron, zinc, iodine, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, chloride, and pantothenic acid&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These ingredients have the necessary benefits not only to assimilate human milk, but also add healthy benefits to the formula, such as promoting the development of the immune system, brain functions, and antibody production, among others&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The composition of EN formulas is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Key Components in the Nutritional Composition of Infant Formulas.</title><p>Source: Prepared by the authors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082692-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Relevant aspects for formula selection</p><p>Pediatric formulas are liquid nutritional products designed for infants and children who are unable to feed conventionally due to medical, anatomical, or functional conditions. Proper selection is essential to prevent malnutrition and should take into account both the patient&#x02019;s clinical status and digestive capacity.

</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Polymeric</p><p>Polymeric formulas are considered the standard and most cost-effective option for EN in children aged 1 to 13 years who have an intact gastrointestinal function but are unable to meet their nutritional requirements through a regular diet. These formulas are designed to serve as the sole source of complete nutrition, aligning with intake recommendations for healthy individuals. Their composition includes intact macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats), although the specific sources of each macronutrient may vary by manufacturer. Carbohydrates are commonly derived from maltodextrin or corn syrup; proteins from caseinates or soy protein isolates; and fats from vegetable oils such as canola or soy. Additionally, these formulas include various types of soluble and insoluble fibers to support digestive health and intestinal transit, which is particularly beneficial for patients experiencing constipation or diarrhea related to EN support&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Blenderized Formulas</p><p>Blenderized formulas, also known as blenderized tube feeding (BTF), are composed of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, meats, and legumes processed into a pur&#x000e9;ed or liquid form. They are perceived by caregivers as a more natural alternative, aligned with the trend toward minimally processed food consumption. Although these formulas can be commercially prepared or homemade, guidance from a registered dietitian is recommended to ensure nutritional adequacy and microbiological safety. Due to their high viscosity, adjustments are needed depending on the route of administration&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>These formulas offer greater variability in nutrient sources and fiber content, which may promote a more diverse gut microbiome. They have been associated with reduced gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain) and higher caregiver and patient satisfaction. Additionally, they allow for dietary customization in cases of specific allergies or intolerances, such as lactose or soy. Some manufacturers encourage rotating blends to simulate a balanced and varied homemade diet&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Elemental Formulas</p><p>Elemental formulas, also known as amino acid-based formulas, are composed exclusively of free amino acids without peptide bonds, making them the most hypoallergenic option available for infants and children. As they contain no intact proteins or lactose, they are especially indicated for patients with galactosemia, severe lactose intolerance, multiple food allergies, or immune-mediated reactions, since their components are not recognized by T cells, thereby avoiding allergic responses&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>These formulas differ from hydrolyzed formulas in that their protein source is completely broken down, and they typically have a higher proportion of MCTs, which enhances intestinal absorption. Although they are a vital therapeutic tool in cases of severe malabsorption, short bowel syndrome, or other complex digestive disorders, their use may be limited by cost, as they can be twice as expensive as polymeric formulas&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Hydrolyzed Protein Formulas</p><p>Hydrolyzed formulas, also referred to as semi-elemental or peptide-based formulas, contain partially digested proteins broken down into short-chain peptides and free amino acids, facilitating digestion and absorption. They are indicated for infants and children with malabsorption or gastrointestinal intolerance to polymeric formulas. The proteins used may be derived from whey, casein, or pea protein, allowing for selection based on the individual patient&#x02019;s tolerance&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>As for carbohydrates, these formulas often include maltodextrin, cornstarch, sugar, or combinations thereof. Additionally, many peptide-based formulas are enriched with essential antioxidant micronutrients (such as vitamins C, D, and E, selenium) and omega-3 fatty acids like DHA, which support immune and neurological development. Although some authors group hydrolyzed and elemental formulas together due to the shared hydrolysis process, in clinical practice, they are typically distinguished, as elemental formulas contain only free amino acids and no peptides&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Considerations for proper formula selection</p><p>Formula Preparation</p><p>Certain considerations regarding each formula form include preparation requirements. Powdered formulas are not considered sterile and are more prone to mixing errors, whereas ready-to-feed formulas are stable until opened, have a shorter shelf life, and require refrigeration&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The water used to reconstitute powdered or dilute liquid formulas is also important; the temperature should not exceed 40&#x000b0;C to prevent denaturation and destruction of proteins&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Consumption Considerations</p><p>In pediatric EN, formula viscosity and consistency are critical factors-especially when using small-bore feeding tubes such as nasogastric or jejunostomy tubes. Formulas that are too thick may clog the tube, whereas appropriate viscosity reduces that risk. However, thicker formulas tend to be better tolerated in patients with gastroesophageal reflux&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Palatability also influences formula selection when administered orally. Polymeric formulas are generally the most palatable and are available in a variety of flavors. In contrast, elemental formulas tend to have poor palatability due to their high content of branched-chain amino acids, which are known for their bitter taste. Some manufacturers include additives such as citric acid to improve flavor. However, when the formula is administered via direct enteral feeding (e.g., prolonged tube feeding), palatability becomes irrelevant, and some formulations are intentionally bland for such use&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Osmolality and Caloric Density</p><p>Osmolality is a key parameter in enteral formulas, as it reflects the concentration of solutes per kilogram of solvent. High osmolality can lead to adverse effects such as osmotic diarrhea-especially in infants-by drawing water into the intestinal lumen due to unabsorbed osmoles. This risk increases in hospitalized patients who receive high-osmolality medications alongside enteral feeding. Moreover, hypercaloric formulas tend to have higher osmolality due to their greater nutrient concentration&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, caloric density is a crucial factor in pediatric nutrition, as it directly affects growth and development. There are low-calorie formulas designed for infants with low metabolic demands; however, these may require additional supplementation to meet essential micronutrient needs. Balancing osmolality, gastrointestinal tolerance, and energy density is fundamental in selecting the appropriate formula for each patient&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Disease-Specific Considerations</p><p>A brief summary can be seen below (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), highlighting the different diseases, nutritional considerations, and recommended formulas, which will be explored in greater detail.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Clinical Conditions and Recommended Enteral Formulas in Pediatric Patients.</title><p>Source: Prepared by the authors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082692-i03" position="float"/></fig><p>Obesity</p><p>The first months of life represent a critical window for preventing future metabolic, cardiovascular, and obesity-related diseases. Growth trajectory and weight gain during the first year of life are strongly correlated with the risk of obesity later in life. Therefore, in pediatric hospital settings, systematic nutritional screening is recommended to identify patients who require a comprehensive nutritional assessment and an individualized care plan&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Animal studies have shown that formulas with a high carbohydrate content can lead to hyperinsulinemia and adult-onset obesity. In this regard, certain formulas developed for adults with obesity-characterized by reduced carbohydrate content and a higher protein proportion-may be considered for children with low energy requirements, always under professional supervision. In preterm infants requiring EN, breast milk should be initiated as early as possible. Furthermore, early introduction of infant formulas (before 3 months of age) has been associated with accelerated growth and a higher body mass index (BMI) in adulthood&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Cow&#x02019;s milk allergy (CMA)</p><p>Cow&#x02019;s milk protein allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy in infants and can be classified into IgE-mediated forms (with immediate onset) and non-IgE-mediated forms (with delayed onset, often mimicking other gastrointestinal disorders). Standard infant formulas contain proteins derived from cow&#x02019;s milk and should be avoided in patients with a confirmed CMA diagnosis. In some cases, soy-based formulas are used as alternatives, although their use should be medically supervised, particularly in infants under 6 months of age&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Extensively hydrolyzed formulas are the first-line treatment for infants with mild to moderate allergies, as they contain low-molecular-weight peptides with reduced allergenicity, potentially promoting the development of oral tolerance. However, their poor palatability and high cost may limit caregiver acceptance. In cases of severe CMA or multiple food allergies, amino acid-based formulas are the safest option, as they are completely free of dairy proteins. As a preventive measure, breastfeeding mothers may also be advised to eliminate cow&#x02019;s milk from their own diets. Finally, although partially hydrolyzed formulas have shown some preventive potential, breastfeeding remains the optimal feeding option for all infants, including those at high allergy risk&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Crohn&#x02019;s disease</p><p>Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD) is a chronic and recurrent form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly affecting the terminal ileum and colon. In pediatric patients, clinical presentation can differ from adults, with isolated colonic inflammation being more common. The disease impairs nutrient absorption and, along with abdominal pain and reduced appetite, significantly increases the risk of malnutrition and weight loss&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In this context, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is recommended as the first-line treatment for inducing remission in children, proving to be more effective and safer than corticosteroid therapy in achieving mucosal healing. Polymeric formulas are preferred due to better palatability and ease of administration, including oral intake. Elemental formulas may be used in patients with associated food allergies, such as CMA, although no significant differences in efficacy have been observed between the formula types in inducing remission. The therapeutic goals include improving nutritional status, controlling symptoms, and maintaining clinical remission of active disease&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Eosinophilic esophagitis</p><p>Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus with an immunologic origin, characterized by eosinophilic infiltration that leads to esophageal dysfunction. In pediatric patients, it may present with dysphagia, odynophagia, food impaction, and feeding disorders. Given its association with non-IgE-mediated food allergies, nutritional treatment typically focuses on eliminating specific allergens from the diet&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Elemental diets, based on free amino acid formulas, are an effective therapeutic option as they are completely allergen-free. However, poor palatability may hinder adherence, and therefore, enteral administration is often used, especially in patients with feeding resistance or high nutritional risk&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)</p><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe and potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects premature newborns due to the immaturity of their digestive, immune, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. NEC is characterized by severe intestinal inflammation that may progress to intestinal necrosis. Given the high risk in this population, EN must be managed with extreme caution&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Current recommendations promote the exclusive use of the mother&#x02019;s own breast milk, and when unavailable, pasteurized donor human milk. This approach has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of NEC due to the immunologic and protective components found in breast milk. Minimal EN (trophic feeding) is advised to begin within the first 48 hours of life and should be progressively increased in volume and frequency based on the infant&#x02019;s clinical tolerance&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Once tolerance is established, feeding should be advanced over 3 to 7 days. Transitioning to full enteral feeding may involve the use of preterm infant formulas as well as hydrolyzed, semi-elemental, or elemental formulas, which offer benefits in digestion, absorption, and reduction of allergic reactions. Nevertheless, concerns remain among some clinicians about the potential increased risk of NEC with formula use in preterm infants, highlighting the need for further research and clinical trials on specialized formulas in this vulnerable population&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Short bowel syndrome (SBS)</p><p>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is the leading cause of intestinal failure in the pediatric population and is characterized by a significant reduction in the length or function of the intestine, which prevents adequate nutrient absorption through conventional oral feeding. This condition may result from extensive surgical resections or congenital malformations of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to complications such as malnutrition, diarrhea, malabsorption, growth delay, and fluid-electrolyte imbalances&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>EN is a cornerstone in the intestinal rehabilitation process and should be initiated as early as possible to promote functional adaptation of the remaining bowel. In infants, human milk is the preferred option. For older children or those with feeding intolerance, enteral formulas such as whole protein formulas, extensively hydrolyzed formulas, or amino acid-based formulas may be used, depending on the degree of malabsorption, intestinal tolerance, and clinical needs. Formula selection should take into account the length and location of the resected intestinal segment, as this directly influences the type and severity of nutritional deficiencies&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF)</p><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects chloride transport at the cellular level, resulting in thick mucus production that compromises both respiratory function and pancreatic and intestinal function. In the digestive context, this leads to fat malabsorption, weight loss, and malnutrition-especially in children under two years of age-where enteral feeding becomes a critical intervention&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Nutritional management should focus on a high-calorie, high-fat diet, supplemented with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy to enhance nutrient absorption. While there is no specific formula designed exclusively for CF, high-energy polymeric formulas are generally recommended as a first option. In cases of gastrointestinal intolerance, hydrolyzed or elemental formulas may be considered. The use of immobilized lipase cartridges in patients receiving EN has been associated with reduced gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal distension, steatorrhea, and gastrointestinal discomfort, thus improving adherence to nutritional therapy&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>International regulations on enteral formulas</p><p>EN formulas are classified as medical foods by the USFDA and are not subject to the same stringent regulatory standards as pharmaceutical products. This means they do not require premarket review or approval, as medications do. According to the FDA, a medical food is defined as a food formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under medical supervision, and intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements are established by recognized scientific principles and evaluated by a healthcare professional&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>In the European context, the European Medicines Agency&#x000a0;(EMA) classifies EN products as foods for special medical purposes (FSMP) and dietary supplements (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As in the USA, these products are not formally registered as medicinal drugs, which impacts the level of regulatory oversight, patient access, and reimbursement policies. Nevertheless, they are subject to specific regulations that ensure their safety, nutritional composition, and labeling, guaranteeing that they meet the individual nutritional needs of their target users&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Regulatory Contrast Between U.S. and European Standards for Enteral Infant Formulas.</title><p>FSMP: foods for special medical purposes</p><p>Source: Prepared by the authors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082692-i04" position="float"/></fig><p>Regarding infant nutrition, foods intended for infants and young children are regulated by specific directives from the European Commission. These directives mandate that products be safe, possess specialized nutritional composition, be clearly distinguishable from conventional foods, and meet the specific nutritional requirements of this population. As such, the strict regulation of infant formulas used during the first months of life is crucial to ensure adequate and safe nutrition during infancy&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Infant nutrition has undergone remarkable progress, evolving from traditional practices to modern, scientifically formulated approaches. While breastfeeding remains the ideal method of feeding for infants, infant formulas serve as a crucial alternative for those with specific medical or nutritional needs, or in contexts where breastfeeding is not feasible. Current formulations are designed to closely replicate the composition of human milk, offering safe and effective nutritional support through the integration of advanced scientific knowledge. However, the selection of an appropriate formula must be individualized, considering factors such as the infant&#x02019;s age, clinical condition, digestive tolerance, osmolality, and caloric density.</p><p>Although enteral infant formulas are not regulated as pharmaceutical drugs, agencies such as the USFDA and the EMA have established frameworks to ensure product safety, quality, and appropriate labeling, especially for formulas intended for vulnerable populations. As the science of nutrition continues to evolve, there is a growing need for sustained research and innovation aimed at enhancing the functional and personalized aspects of infant formulas. Future developments should strive to address the dynamic and complex nutritional demands of infants, particularly those with chronic diseases or high-risk conditions, through increasingly specialized and evidence-based formulations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Esteban Zavaleta-Monestel, Noelia Chaves-Romero, Jorge Mart&#x000ed;nez-V&#x000e1;zquez, Ernesto Mart&#x000ed;nez-Vargas, Josu&#x000e9; Murillo-Cubero, Sebasti&#x000e1;n Arguedas-Chac&#x000f3;n, Jeaustin Mora-Jim&#x000e9;nez</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Esteban Zavaleta-Monestel, Noelia Chaves-Romero, Ernesto Mart&#x000ed;nez-Vargas, Josu&#x000e9; Murillo-Cubero, Sebasti&#x000e1;n Arguedas-Chac&#x000f3;n, Jeaustin Mora-Jim&#x000e9;nez, Jonathan Garc&#x000ed;a-Montero</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Esteban Zavaleta-Monestel, Noelia Chaves-Romero, Jorge Mart&#x000ed;nez-V&#x000e1;zquez, Ernesto Mart&#x000ed;nez-Vargas, Josu&#x000e9; Murillo-Cubero, Sebasti&#x000e1;n Arguedas-Chac&#x000f3;n, Jeaustin Mora-Jim&#x000e9;nez, Jonathan Garc&#x000ed;a-Montero</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Esteban Zavaleta-Monestel, Noelia Chaves-Romero, Ernesto Mart&#x000ed;nez-Vargas, Josu&#x000e9; Murillo-Cubero, Sebasti&#x000e1;n Arguedas-Chac&#x000f3;n, Jeaustin Mora-Jim&#x000e9;nez</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Esteban Zavaleta-Monestel</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>A history of infant feeding</article-title><source>J Perinat Educ</source><person-group>
