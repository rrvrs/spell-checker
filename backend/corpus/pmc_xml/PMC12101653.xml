Moreover, 83.3% believed that EBM could enhance patient health outcomes, 80.0% were willing to learn, and 35.9% believed that EBM focuses solely on research without considering clinical experience. Time constraints (34.0%) were a major barrier, and 46.1% of the participants lacked appropriate training. EBM education was correlated with higher knowledge and attitude scores; however, it had no significant impact on practice scores. Significant barriers identified were the difficulty in conveying technical terms (16%) and limited access to adequate training opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite positive attitudes toward EBM, many pharmacists perceive it as a potential threat to good clinical practice.

EBM integrates scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values to improve medical decision-making [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, pharmacy practice has focused on the dispensing of medications, both prescription and over the counter, with pharmacists providing drug-focused services. However, pharmaceutical care shifts this focus toward a more collaborative pharmacist-patient relationship, actively involving the pharmacist in the treatment process [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>EBM in pharmacy practice is essential to deliver pharmaceutical care, as demonstrated by multiple studies showing its significant impact on clinical decision-making accuracy and improved patient outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Research has shown that implementing EBM can lead to more rational drug use, enhance patient safety, and reduce medication errors [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>However, adopting an EBM is not without challenges. Pharmacists and other healthcare professionals often encounter barriers such as time constraints, limited access to resources, difficulties in understanding statistical terminology, and gaps in the knowledge and skills needed to search for and appraise evidence [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, the application of EBM must be balanced with individual patient circumstances and preferences.[<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Saudi Arabia has examined the perceptions, attitudes, and use of EBM among healthcare professionals, including pharmacists. These studies consistently revealed a positive attitude toward EBM, with professionals recognizing its potential to enhance patient care. Nonetheless, significant organizational, professional, and interprofessional barriers continue to hinder the widespread implementation [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Hospital pharmacists typically work in structured environments that foster professional development and facilitate the integration of EBM into their practice. They often collaborate within multidisciplinary teams, which enhances opportunities for knowledge sharing and the practical application of EBM principles [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, community pharmacists face distinct challenges, such as high workloads and limited access to continuing education programs, which can hinder their ability to incorporate EBM into daily practice [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Chun and Anwer added that, unlike their hospital counterparts, community pharmacists often work independently, necessitating tailored strategies and targeted support to adopt EBM in their professional routines effectively [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>While previous research has examined EBM adoption among hospital pharmacists in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], there is a significant lack of studies investigating EBM implementation in community pharmacy settings. This significant research gap is particularly concerning given that community pharmacists serve as primary healthcare providers for many patients [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, no studies have directly compared EBM knowledge, attitudes, and practices between hospital and community pharmacists, limiting our understanding of how different practice settings influence evidence-based practice implementation. To bridge this gap, this study aimed to address the existing research gap by comprehensively assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding EBM among hospital and community pharmacists in the Madinah region of Saudi Arabia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and settings</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted among community and hospital pharmacists in the Madinah region of Saudi Arabia from September to November 2023 to collect data on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of EBM using a self-reported online questionnaire created with Google Forms.</p><p>The study included licensed community and hospital pharmacists with a bachelor&#x02019;s degree or higher who were working full-time in the Madinah region of Saudi Arabia. Pharmacists employed in other sectors, such as pharmaceutical companies, manufacturing, or academia, were excluded as they are typically not involved in direct patient care or clinical decision-making where evidence-based medicine is applied. Moreover, those practicing outside the specified region, pharmacy technicians, individuals who declined to participate, or respondents who did not complete the full survey were also excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study sampling and response rate</title><p>Hospital pharmacists were recruited using convenience sampling from various government and private hospitals across the Madinah region. Eight trained research assistants obtained recruitment and consent in person, having received comprehensive training on standardized data collection protocols and ethical research practices before study commencement.</p><p>For community pharmacists, convenience sampling was the primary recruitment strategy, supplemented by snowball sampling. The study was promoted through internal distribution lists at several local independent and chain pharmacies, and participants were encouraged to share the invitation with eligible colleagues. This approach was necessary due to the absence of a comprehensive and accessible sampling frame for pharmacists in the Madinah region.</p><p>A total of 540 pharmacists were invited to participate in the study, of whom 276 completed the questionnaire in whole or in part, yielding an initial response rate of 51.11%. After excluding incomplete and ineligible responses, 206 valid questionnaires were retained for analysis, resulting in a final valid response rate of 38.15%.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Data collection</title><p>An online validated questionnaire was used for data collection, which the researchers developed based on the Noor EBM questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The questions on EBM barriers and practices were adapted with input from experts and relevant literature [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The questionnaire was reviewed by three academics and two community pharmacists and piloted for clarity. Pharmacy graduates (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32) completed the survey twice within 30 minutes to 1 hour, with score stability tested using the test-retest method. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation showed significant score stability (r&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.94, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), exceeding the acceptable threshold of 80% [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Internal consistency was confirmed with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 91.2% and domain-specific alphas of 90.0%, 93.0%, and 91.0% for EBM knowledge, attitude, and practice, respectively.</p><p>The survey contained 40 questions across four areas: (1) professional traits, (2) self-assessed EBM knowledge, (3) attitudes and actions toward EBM, and (4) experiences with EBM, mainly statistical terms. Responses were collected using a 5-point Likert scale and grouped into Agree, Neutral, and Disagree categories. Net agreement scores were calculated by subtracting disagreement from agreement percentages, ranging from -100% to +100%, where positive scores indicated agreement. Similarly, a net frequency score was computed by subtracting low-frequency (&#x0201c;Never&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Rarely&#x0201d;) from high-frequency (&#x0201c;Frequently&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Very Frequently&#x0201d;) responses, with positive values reflecting higher reported behavior frequency. Comparable net scoring methods have been employed in survey research to efficiently summarize ordinal responses and enable meaningful comparisons across groups or time periods [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The total scores for each section&#x02014;knowledge, attitude, and practice&#x02014;were converted into percentage scores by dividing the raw scores by the maximum possible score and multiplying by 100. Classification was based on Bloom&#x02019;s cut-off points, a widely used method in KAP studies. Scores of 60&#x02013;79% were categorized as moderate knowledge, neutral attitudes, and adequate EBM practices, while scores above 79% indicated excellent knowledge, positive attitudes, and proficient practices. Scores below 60% reflected limited knowledge, negative attitudes, and poor practices [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This approach provides a standardized and interpretable framework for assessing EBM-related competencies, consistent with previous health research [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data collected via Google Forms was transferred to an Excel spreadsheet and coded for statistical analysis. IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 was used for the analysis. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, total scores, frequencies, and percentages, were calculated. Due to non-normal data distribution, non-parametric tests were used. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were applied, followed by Dunn&#x02019;s test for multiple pairwise comparisons. The significance level (&#x003b1;) for all statistical tests was set at 0.05, and two-tailed tests were employed throughout the analysis. Effect size was evaluated using Cohen&#x02019;s d. Based on Cohen&#x02019;s guidelines, an effect size of 0.2 indicates a small effect, 0.5 a medium effect, and 0.8 or greater a large effect. A small effect (d&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;0.2) reflects a modest difference between groups that, although potentially statistically significant, may have limited practical relevance [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Pharmacists&#x02019; characteristics</title><p>The mean age was comparable between hospital (31.58&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.4 years) and community pharmacists (31.06&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.15 years).

Our research extends previous work by providing the first direct comparison of EBM implementation between practice settings, revealing significant differences in adoption patterns. Building upon earlier hospital-focused studies [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the study findings demonstrate the impact of practice environment on EBM implementation, with hospital pharmacists showing higher knowledge scores compared to community pharmacists. The findings reveal a generally positive attitude toward EBM but highlight areas for improvement and potential barriers to its implementation. The results indicate a moderate to high level of knowledge about EBM principles among pharmacists. The majority of pharmacists (84.4%) correctly identified EBM as involving the critical appraisal of research for clinical decision-making, aligning with Tebala&#x02019;s seminal definition of EBM [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, there was some confusion regarding the role of clinical experience in EBM, with 41.7% of the participants believing that EBM focuses solely on research evidence. This misconception suggests a need for clarification on the integration of research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values, as Wieten emphasized in their discussion of EBM principles [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The high agreement (81.1%) that EBM improves the understanding of research questions and methodology is encouraging, as it suggests that pharmacists recognize the value of EBM when enhancing their professional skills. This finding is consistent with those of Landey and Sibbld, who reported similar perceptions among healthcare professionals [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The study revealed generally positive attitudes toward EBM, with 83.3% agreeing that EBM can improve patient health outcomes. This is consistent with the findings of Abu Farha et al., who reported positive attitudes toward EBM among Jordanian pharmacists [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The high willingness to learn and practice EBM (80.0%) indicates a receptive environment for further EBM education and implementation initiatives. However, the perception of EBM as a potential threat to good clinical practice by 51.2% of respondents is concerning. This could stem from misunderstandings about EBM&#x02019;s role in clinical decision-making or concerns about the devaluation of clinical experience. Similar concerns have been noted in other studies, such as those by Haynes et al., highlighting the need for education that emphasizes EBM as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, clinical expertise [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The EBM practice among pharmacists showed room for improvement. Although 51.4% frequently reported applying EBM in practice, only 41.7% regularly used the PICO format to translate clinical questions. This gap between knowledge and practice is common and has been observed in other healthcare settings [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The high frequency of systematic reviews on multiple search engines (85.5%) is encouraging, suggesting that pharmacists actively seek evidence. However, the reported time constraints (34.0% frequently lacking time for EBM) repeat findings from other studies and highlight a significant barrier to EBM implementation [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The study identified significant differences between hospital and community pharmacists regarding their EBM-related knowledge and practice. Hospital pharmacists demonstrated marginally higher scores, which may be attributed to the structured hospital environment that fosters continuous professional development and collaboration with other healthcare professionals [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, the lower EBM scores among community pharmacists cannot be explained solely by differences in practice settings.</p><p>Several additional factors likely contribute to this disparity. Community pharmacists often face limited access to evidence-based resources, lack formal clinical support systems, and experience greater time constraints due to higher workload demands [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Unlike hospital pharmacists, who typically work within multidisciplinary teams and benefit from access to institutional guidelines and electronic databases, community pharmacists may lack the infrastructure necessary to support regular engagement with EBM practices [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>To bridge this gap, targeted interventions are needed. Improving access to clinical resources, reducing workload burdens, and providing structured EBM training tailored to community pharmacy settings could significantly enhance the uptake of EBM [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Strengthening these areas may help support the broader and more consistent application of EBM practices across both hospital and community pharmacy sectors.</p><p>The influence of experience on EBM adoption reveals an interesting paradox: pharmacists with less than one year of experience scored higher in knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) compared to their more experienced counterparts. One possible explanation is that recent graduates may have received more formal and updated training in evidence-based medicine (EBM) due to changes in pharmacy curricula. In contrast, pharmacists with more years of experience may not have had the same level of EBM emphasis during their initial training, which may explain the lower practice scores among this group [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Another contributing factor could be that younger pharmacists generally show greater interest in applying EBM compared to older pharmacists, as previous research suggests that both age and years of experience can influence EBM implementation in practice [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This trend is consistent with findings in other health professions, where integrated EBM curricula have been shown to significantly improve information literacy and evidence application skills among students and recent graduates [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>The positive impact of EBM training on knowledge and attitude scores, but not on practice scores, suggests a gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. Studies have indicated that although healthcare professionals often demonstrate improved knowledge and positive attitudes following EBM training, the translation of this knowledge into practice remains insufficient due to barriers such as time constraints, lack of access to resources, and insufficient integration of EBM into daily routines [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>The study also identified a significant barrier: 41.7% of pharmacists mistakenly believed that EBM disregards clinical experience. This misconception reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of EBM&#x02019;s core principle, which emphasizes the integration of clinical expertise, the best available research evidence, and patient values. Therefore, addressing this misunderstanding is essential to promote a more accurate and balanced perception of EBM among pharmacists and to support its broader adoption in practice.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Recommendations for enhancing EBM adoption among pharmacists</title><p>Overcoming the barriers to EBM adoption identified in this study requires a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach that addresses both individual competencies and systemic support structures. One recommended approach is the implementation of blended learning models that combine face-to-face workshops with online modules, focusing on key competencies such as evidence appraisal, database searching, and the application of research findings to clinical scenarios [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, short, targeted workshops and flexible, self-paced online courses could better accommodate the busy schedules of practicing pharmacists. Mentorship programs, in particular, offer an additional layer of continuous, real-world support, helping pharmacists to translate EBM principles into their daily routines [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Beyond individual training, institutional support plays a vital role in facilitating EBM adoption. Organizations can embed clinical decision-support tools into pharmacists&#x02019; workflows, provide protected time specifically for EBM-related activities, and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. By implementing these multi-faceted strategies, institutions can help build both the confidence and competency required for pharmacists to consistently apply EBM in everyday practice [<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324620.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, the study design, which utilized Google Forms&#x02019; branching logic to exclude diploma-holding pharmacy technicians, non-participants, and incomplete responses, prevented the collection of comparative data, thereby limiting the ability to assess selection bias. Second, the achieved response rate of 38.15% and the relatively young average age of participants may impact the representativeness of the findings. Third, the focus on pharmacists within the Madinah region, coupled with the use of a convenience sampling method, restricts the generalizability of the results to other regions of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the self-administered nature of the questionnaire may have introduced social desirability bias, potentially leading to an overestimation of EBM knowledge and practices. Finally, the cross-sectional study design precludes the assessment of temporal changes in EBM adoption patterns over time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reveals significant variations in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) implementation between hospital and community pharmacists in the Madinah region, with hospital pharmacists demonstrating slightly higher knowledge and practice scores. Despite generally positive attitudes toward EBM, with 83.3% believing it improves patient outcomes, significant barriers persist, including time constraints and insufficient training. The findings suggest that EBM education positively influences knowledge and practice, though its impact on attitudes remains limited. These results highlight the need for targeted interventions, particularly for community pharmacists, focusing on practical EBM application and addressing workplace-specific barriers. Future initiatives should emphasize continuous professional development, workplace support systems, and integrated EBM training programs that bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.</p><p><bold>Acknowledgments</bold>The authors of this study acknowledge the contribution of the pharmacists who participated in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0324620.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lehane</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Leahy-Warren</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>O&#x02019;Riordan</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Savage</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Drennan</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>O&#x02019;Tuathaigh</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>. <article-title>Evidence-based practice education for healthcare professions: an expert view</article-title>. <source>BMJ Evid Based Med</source>. <year>2018</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0324620.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sackett</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Haynes</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>. <article-title>Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn&#x02019;t</article-title>. <source>BMJ</source>. <year>1996</year>:<fpage>71</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>2</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0324620.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Sackett</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name>, editor. <source>Evidence-based medicine.

It is suggested to supplement the overall number of research subjects that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as compare the basic information of the sample obtained from this sampling with the overall population.</p><p>2) In addition, the research topic is a comparison between hospital and community pharmacists, and there is a lack of corresponding KAP comparison data in the results. Suggest adding baseline data comparison between hospitals and community pharmacists; Comparison of KAP survey results between hospital and community pharmacists.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold> &#x000a0;The manuscript titled "Adoption of Evidence-Based Medicine: A Comparative Study of Hospital and Community Pharmacists in Saudi Arabia" is well-structured and presents valuable insights into pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding EBM. The study is methodologically sound, with clear objectives, a well-defined methodology, and a thorough statistical analysis. The discussion effectively interprets the results, comparing them with existing literature. However, some areas require improvement before recommending the manuscript for publication.</p><p>Major recommendations</p><p>Clarity and Consistency in Writing</p><p>&#x02022; The manuscript is generally well-written, but some sections contain redundancy. For instance, in the introduction, the definition of EBM is repeated in multiple ways. Consider merging these statements for conciseness.</p><p>&#x02022; Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them harder to follow. For example, in the introduction: "It combines the best available scientific evidence with the clinician's expertise and the patient's values to guide medical decisions effectively." This could be revised for better flow: "EBM integrates scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values to improve medical decision-making."</p><p>Research Justification and Novelty</p><p>&#x02022; The study&#x02019;s importance is well-stated, but there is limited emphasis on the novelty of the research. Consider explicitly stating how this study fills a gap in previous research. For example:</p><p>o Does this study provide the first comparative analysis of hospital vs. community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>o How does it add to previous research findings on EBM adoption in pharmacy practice?</p><p>Strengthening this section will help establish the study's significance.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>&#x02022; The response rate (38.15%) is relatively low. Was there any effort to mitigate potential non-response bias?</p><p>&#x02022; The use of convenience and snowball sampling raises concerns about selection bias. While this is acknowledged, a stronger justification is needed to explain why this method was chosen over random sampling.</p><p>&#x02022; The exclusion criteria are mentioned briefly. Were there any specific reasons for excluding pharmacists from the pharmaceutical industry or academia?

</p><p>Reviewer's Responses</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>1. Comments: The response rate after sampling in this study was only 38.15%, and the average age of the participants was relatively young (31 years old), so the representativeness of the research results is limited and there may be selective bias. It is suggested to supplement the overall number of research subjects that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as compare the basic information of the sample obtained from this sampling with the overall population.</p><p>Responses: Thank you for this valuable comment. We acknowledge that the response rate of 38.15% and the relatively young average age of participants may limit the representativeness of our findings and introduce potential selection bias. We have addressed this limitation in the revised manuscript under the "Study Limitations" section.</p><p>Regarding the suggestion to supplement the number of research subjects and compare the basic characteristics of the sample with the overall population, we appreciate the recommendation. However, due to the design of our online survey using Google Forms' branching logic, we automatically excluded pharmacy technicians holding diploma degrees, a vital segment of the healthcare workforce in Saudi Arabia, along with individuals who declined participation or submitted incomplete surveys. The survey system immediately terminated responses for diploma holders after the education level question, and incomplete surveys were not stored in our database. Similarly, we have no demographic or comparative data for non-respondents. Therefore, while we recognize this as a significant limitation, we are unable to perform the suggested comparison between respondents and non-respondents or analyze potential differences between complete and incomplete survey responses. We have highlighted this limitation and recommended that future research use stratified sampling and larger, more inclusive datasets to enhance representativeness and allow for more detailed comparisons.</p><p>2. Comment: In addition, the research topic is a comparison between hospital and community pharmacists, and there is a lack of corresponding KAP comparison data in the results. Suggest adding baseline data comparison between hospitals and community pharmacists; Comparison of KAP survey results between hospital and community pharmacists.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your constructive feedback. We have addressed your concerns as follows:</p><p>1. Baseline Data Comparison:</p><p>We have expanded Table 1 to include detailed baseline demographic characteristics comparing hospital and community pharmacists.</p><p>2. KAP Survey Results Comparison:</p><p>We have enhanced our results section, which provides a detailed comparison of KAP scores between hospital and community pharmacists as follows:</p><p>a. Knowledge Domain:</p><p>Hospital pharmacists demonstrated significantly higher knowledge scores (M = 3.84, SD = 0.52) compared to community pharmacists (M = 3.70, SD = 0.57), with statistical significance (p = 0.03).</p><p>b. Attitude Domain:</p><p>No significant difference was observed in attitude scores between hospital pharmacists (M = 3.83, SD = 0.50) and community pharmacists (M = 3.76, SD = 0.53; p = 0.60).</p><p>c. Practice Domain:</p><p>Hospital pharmacists showed significantly higher practice scores (M = 3.89, SD = 0.51) compared to community pharmacists (M = 3.76, SD = 0.58; p = 0.02).</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>Clarity and Consistency in Writing</p><p>1. Comment: The manuscript is generally well-written, but some sections contain redundancy. For instance, in the introduction, the definition of EBM is repeated in multiple ways. Consider merging these statements for conciseness.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We have revised the introduction to be more concise by removing redundant definitions of EBM and streamlining the content.</p><p>2. Comment: Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them harder to follow. For example, in the introduction, "It combines the best available scientific evidence with the clinician's expertise and the patient's values to guide medical decisions effectively." This could be revised for better flow: "EBM integrates scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values to improve medical decision-making."</p><p>Response: Thank you for your feedback. We have revised the sentence as suggested.</p><p>Research Justification and Novelty</p><p>3. Comment: The study&#x02019;s importance is well-stated, but there is limited emphasis on the novelty of the research. Consider explicitly stating how this study fills a gap in previous research. For example:</p><p>a. Does this study provide the first comparative analysis of hospital vs. community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>b. How does it add to previous research findings on EBM adoption in pharmacy practice?</p><p>Strengthening this section will help establish the study's significance.</p><p>Response: We appreciate your feedback. Thank you for your input. We have revised our manuscript to emphasize the significance of our study, particularly highlighting its status as the first comparative analysis of EBM adoption between hospitals and community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia, in both the concluding paragraph of the introduction and the opening section of the discussion. In addition, we have revised the discussion section to illustrate what our study adds to previous research.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>4. Comment: The response rate (38.15%) is relatively low. Was there any effort to mitigate potential non-response bias?</p><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable comment. While our response rate of 38.15% is lower than ideal, it aligns with similar pharmacy practice surveys conducted in Saudi Arabia. For instance, Al-Jazairi and Alharbi reported a 20% response rate among hospital pharmacists when assessing evidence-based practice [1]. Another cross-sectional study targeting hospital pharmacists yielded a response rate of 14.8% [2]. Additionally, the &#x0201c;National Survey of Drug Information Centers Practice in Saudi Arabia&#x0201d; reported a 40% response rate, involving pharmacists in drug information centers, which may include community pharmacists [3]. This limitation has been explicitly addressed in the revised manuscript, highlighting its potential implications for the generalizability and interpretation of the study findings.</p><p>5. Comment: The use of convenience and snowball sampling raises concerns about selection bias. While this is acknowledged, a stronger justification is needed to explain why this method was chosen over random sampling.</p><p>Response: While random sampling would be ideal, convenience and snowball sampling were employed due to several context-specific challenges. First, there was no comprehensive, accessible sampling frame of pharmacists in Saudi Arabia. For instance, Fathelrahman conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study assessing medical device-related counseling practices among community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia [4]. They employed convenience sampling due to the lack of a national registry or contact database for pharmacists, which prevented the use of probability sampling methods and stratification by geographical region. This limitation underscores the challenges in obtaining a representative sample of pharmacists in specific regions like the Madinah region of Saudi Arabia. Consequently, our study utilized convenience and snowball sampling techniques to reach pharmacists across diverse practice settings, particularly community pharmacists who are typically harder to access through institutional channels. While this approach may introduce selection bias, it aligns with established practices in pharmacy research where complete listings of the target population are unavailable. The Study Sampling and Response Rate section has been updated to reflect this rationale.</p><p>6. Comment: The exclusion criteria are mentioned briefly. Were there any specific reasons for excluding pharmacists from the pharmaceutical industry or academia? Clarifying this will strengthen the study's rigor.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your observation. Our study specifically focused on hospital and community pharmacists, as they are the primary healthcare professionals actively involved in patient care and clinical decision-making informed by evidence-based medicine (EBM). This choice is supported by prior research indicating that these pharmacists are key users of EBM in daily practice, particularly in medication therapy management, clinical interventions, and patient-centered care [5, 6]. Pharmacists working in industry and academia were excluded, as they typically do not hold active patient care licenses and are not routinely engaged in clinical decision-making that necessitates EBM application. This exclusion aligns with the methodology of similar studies investigating EBM use among frontline healthcare providers, which have similarly omitted participants from non-clinical sectors [7-9]. By targeting licensed pharmacists involved in direct patient care, our study offers a more accurate reflection of EBM implementation in routine pharmacy practice. We have clarified this rationale in the revised Study Population subsection of the Methods section to enhance transparency and methodological rigor.</p><p>Statistical Analysis - Additional Clarifications</p><p>7. Comment: The manuscript states that Bloom's threshold was used to categorize knowledge, attitude, and practice scores. While this is a reasonable approach, it would be beneficial to justify why this method was chosen over other classification methods.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this thoughtful comment. The use of Bloom's threshold in categorizing knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores is a common methodological approach in cross-sectional studies, as demonstrated by multiple sources, particularly in the absence of standardized benchmarks [10-13]. While none of the provided studies explicitly justify why Bloom&#x02019;s cut-off was selected over other classification methods, their consistent application of this method supports its validity as a standardized tool in KAP research. We have added a brief justification in the Methods section to clarify the rationale for this choice.</p><p>Comment: The use of net agreement and net frequency scores is well-documented, but some readers may not be familiar with these terms. Consider adding a brief explanation or reference in the Methods section.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your helpful comment. We have added a short explanation and supporting reference in the Methods section to define these measures and their relevance in KAP studies.</p><p>8. Comment: The effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s d = 0.15 - 0.16) is interpreted as "small." This should be explicitly stated in the Results section, as some readers may not be familiar with effect size thresholds.</p><p>Response: Thank you for the comment. Cohen&#x02019;s d is a commonly used measure of effect size that indicates the standardized difference between two means. According to Cohen&#x02019;s (1988) guidelines, an effect size of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 is medium, and 0.8 or above is large. A small effect (d &#x02248; 0.2) suggests a modest difference between groups that, while statistically significant, may have limited practical significance [14]. We have revised the Methods and Results sections to clearly state that the observed effect sizes fall within the small range.</p><p>Interpretation of Findings</p><p>9. Comment: The results indicate that pharmacists with less than one year of experience had higher EBM practice scores than more experienced pharmacists. This is an interesting finding but needs further exploration. Could it be that recent graduates receive better EBM training? If so, how can this be addressed in continuing education programs?</p><p>Response: Thank you for this thoughtful and insightful comment. We agree that the finding warrants further exploration. One possible explanation is that recent graduates may have received more formal and updated training in evidence-based medicine (EBM) as part of evolving pharmacy curricula [14-16]. In contrast, pharmacists with more years of experience may not have had the same level of EBM emphasis during their initial training, which may explain the lower practice scores among this group. This trend is consistent with findings in other health professions, where integrated EBM curricula have been shown to significantly improve information literacy and evidence application skills among students and recent graduates [17]. This highlights a potential gap in ongoing professional development and underscores the importance of integrating targeted EBM content into continuing education and professional development programs. We have expanded the Discussion section to include this interpretation and its implications.</p><p>10. Comment: Community pharmacists had lower EBM scores than hospital pharmacists. The manuscript attributes this to differences in professional settings, but other factors (e.g., lack of access to resources, workload differences) should be discussed in more depth.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We do agree that the observed differences in EBM scores between community and hospital pharmacists may be influenced by a broader range of factors beyond the practice setting alone. Community pharmacists often face barriers such as limited access to clinical resources, lack of institutional support, and higher workload and time constraints, which may hinder their ability to engage with EBM regularly. In contrast, hospital pharmacists may have better access to multidisciplinary teams, structured protocols, and clinical decision-support tools. We have expanded the Discussion section to reflect these considerations and provide a more comprehensive interpretation of the findings.</p><p>11. Comment: The misconception that EBM ignores clinical experience was reported by 41.7% of participants. This is a crucial barrier and should be highlighted in the discussion as a key area for intervention.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your observation. We have emphasized this point in the revised Discussion section and identified it as a key area for educational and institutional intervention.</p><p>Practical Implications and Recommendations</p><p>12. Comment: The manuscript does a good job of discussing barriers to EBM adoption, but the recommendations for overcoming these barriers are somewhat vague.</p><p>a. What specific training strategies should be implemented?</p><p>b. Would workshops, online courses, or mentorship programs be more effective?</p><p>c. How can institutions support pharmacists in overcoming time constraints?</p><p>Response: We appreciate your comment. We have expanded the Discussion section to include evidence-based strategies for overcoming key barriers to EBM adoption. For training, structured continuing education programs that combine interactive workshops, case-based learning, and evidence retrieval exercises are recommended. Online courses and webinars offer flexibility and broad accessibility, especially for community pharmacists. Mentorship programs led by experienced clinical pharmacists can also provide personalized guidance and reinforce practical application. To address time constraints, institutions can support EBM practice by integrating clinical decision support tools into pharmacy workflows, allocating protected time for professional development, and fostering a culture that values evidence-based care. These enhancements have been added to the revised manuscript to provide a more comprehensive roadmap for improving EBM uptake.</p><p>Minor Changes</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>13.
