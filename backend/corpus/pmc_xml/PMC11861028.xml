Introduction</title><p>Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) has become a fundamental element in contemporary aesthetic medicine, extending its applications beyond the initially approved indications. The expanding reliance on this neurotoxin for cosmetic procedures in Korea reflects the increasing emphasis on non-surgical facial enhancement [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2013, a panel of Korean experts established a consensus on the cosmetic use of BoNTA [<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which became a standard reference for aesthetic medicine and surgery in Korea. However, over the past decade, the need to update this guideline has arisen due to the significant research progress made in cosmetic BoNTA applications and the availability of new BoNTA products on the market. Given the distinct properties of different BoNTA formulations, using a specific BoNTA product according to its specific recommendations is crucial, as supported by clinical evidence and practical experience [<xref rid="B3-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This paper provides comprehensive and up-to-date expert recommendations to guide aesthetic healthcare professionals in safely and effectively using BoNTA for a wide range of aesthetic concerns related to facial expression muscles, focusing on the clinical use of a newly developed BoNTA formulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-17-00061"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.1. Glabellar Frown Lines</title><p>BoNTA is a well-recognized and widely utilized treatment for managing dynamic glabellar lines in Korea [<xref rid="B4-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as evidenced by a recent survey indicating that Korean dermatologists most frequently target the glabella region for the cosmetic application of this neurotoxin [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, side effects, including ptosis and altered eyebrow positioning, may arise after injection due to insufficient knowledge of the detailed facial anatomy of the glabella area [<xref rid="B5-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1dot1-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.1.1. Anatomy and Patient Selection</title><p>The corrugator supercilii and procerus muscles are the primary muscles responsible for glabellar frown lines. The corrugator supercilii muscle is located at the medial portion of the eyebrow, while the procerus muscle extends from the nasal bridge to the glabella. Additionally, the superomedial fibers of the orbicularis oculi, known as the depressor supercilii [<xref rid="B5-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], are interconnected with the corrugator and procerus muscles. These glabellar muscles are not independent; rather, they are closely interconnected. As a result, BoNTA injected into the corrugator supercilii may affect the nearby muscles [<xref rid="B5-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Ethnic considerations: Studies have found ethnic differences in the size and shape of the corrugator muscles responsible for glabellar frown lines. For example, researchers observed that the corrugators were significantly smaller in 18% of Japanese cadavers compared to Caucasian cadavers [<xref rid="B6-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Patient selection: Patients of younger age with greater skin elasticity often demonstrate more favorable responses to BoNTA injections for managing glabellar lines. However, the efficacy of this treatment is not necessarily constrained by a patient&#x02019;s age, as beneficial outcomes can be achieved across various age groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.1.2. Recommended Standard Injection Technique</title><p>Inject BoNTA into the medial and lateral parts of the corrugator muscle, followed by an injection into the center of the procerus muscle (the &#x0201c;five-point injection&#x0201d; technique: <xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). An intramuscular injection is recommended for the corrugator head, while a subdermal placement is preferable for the corrugator tail and the procerus. Proceed with the injections slowly to prevent the spread of the toxin. Avoid injecting too close or deep to the orbital rim, which may result in eyelid ptosis. It is also recommended that the frontal notch be pressed with the fingers during injection to avoid the inflow of the toxin into the orbital cavity. When the extent of the corrugator contraction is limited, only the corrugator head portion may be injected (the &#x0201c;three-point injection&#x0201d; technique: <xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). A typical protocol for Korean female patients involves injecting 3 BoNTA units (U) into each corrugator head, 1.5 U into each corrugator tail, and 6 U into the procerus to treat moderate glabellar lines.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot3-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.1.3. Changes from the 2013 Guideline</title><p>The panel recommended the five-point injection approach as the standard technique, moving away from the more conservative, three-point injection technique suggested in the 2013 guideline. The panel&#x02019;s consensus was that the five-point injection technique provides a more comprehensive and reliable treatment of glabellar frown lines. Targeting the corrugator muscle&#x02019;s head and tail may lead to more complete paralysis, potentially improving overall efficacy [<xref rid="B5-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The panel acknowledged that some patients may need higher doses, up to 20 units, to achieve the desired result, compared to the more conservative 12-unit recommendation in the previous guideline. The rationale for using higher doses is based on recent findings that a 2&#x02013;4-fold increase in the BoNTA dose for glabella leads to a longer duration of clinical effects while maintaining patient satisfaction and a natural appearance [<xref rid="B7-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot4-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.1.4. Expert&#x02019;s Opinions</title><p>Anatomical diversity: A recent Korean cadaver study [<xref rid="B8-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] revealed diverse fiber extensions and varied trajectories and lengths of the corrugator supercilii muscle, which extends towards the upper face and midface. Additionally, the lower fibers of the corrugator supercilii muscle were found to connect to important structures like the orbicularis oculi, the malaris, and the superficial musculoaponeurotic system. These findings emphasize the importance of a precise BoNTA injection technique to avoid unintended effects, as the anatomy must be carefully considered.</p><p>Age and gender: The panel agreed that a patient&#x02019;s age and gender should be factored into the selection of injection technique and dosage. Younger female patients, who typically present with less severe glabellar lines and weaker muscle activity, could benefit from the three-point injection approach [<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, aged patients, regardless of gender, often require the five-point injection technique due to the increased prominence of glabellar lines and potentially stronger muscle activity. Additionally, male patients, who generally exhibit stronger corrugator muscles than their female counterparts, may require higher dosages to achieve comparable results.</p><p>Identifying the contraction pattern: Understanding individual variation in muscle use is key to achieving natural, personalized results when treating glabellar wrinkles with botulinum toxin. Classifying each patient&#x02019;s wrinkle patterns helps guide the dosage to target the specific muscle regions contributing most to their wrinkle formation [<xref rid="B9-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The panel emphasized meticulously observing each patient&#x02019;s muscle movement patterns during frowning (<xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Relying solely on standard anatomical landmarks might not suffice for optimal outcomes. Some experts suggested that identifying the specific locations of &#x0201c;eyebrow dimples&#x0201d; formed during frowning can provide a more precise guide for deciding the injection point.</p><p>On the other hand, a recent anatomical study has found that glabellar contraction patterns do not strongly correlate with the underlying muscle anatomy, suggesting that relying solely on contraction patterns to guide BoNTA treatment algorithms may not always be clinically optimal [<xref rid="B10-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this context, it is paramount to closely evaluate the patient&#x02019;s treatment response after the initial BoNTA injections. The panel strongly emphasized that using ultrasound imaging during the injection procedure can substantially aid in overcoming anatomical variations and enhance the overall efficacy of glabellar injections, a rapidly growing application in aesthetic medicine and surgery [<xref rid="B11-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The &#x0201c;Eyebrow Illusion&#x0201d;: The panel cautioned against being misled by the resting position of a patient&#x02019;s eyebrows, particularly in individuals with eyebrow makeup or tattoos. Patients with &#x0201c;drawn&#x0201d; eyebrows characterized by high arches can make an illusion when identifying the location of corrugator tails. This could lead to injecting BoNTA too superiorly and unintentionally suppressing the lower part of the frontalis muscle. The panel stressed the importance of carefully assessing the &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; eyebrow position concerning muscle activity to avoid such complications. Special care should also be taken when treating patients with a high insertion of the corrugator supercilii muscle, as they may be at an increased risk of developing brow ptosis following the glabella injection.</p><p>Benefits of subdermal injections: In the context of safety, the panel concurred that subdermal injections have advantages when treating the glabellar complex with BoNTA. Although deep injection is required to paralyze the corrugator supercilli completely, injecting too deeply increases the risk of diffusion to the surrounding structures, potentially leading to eyelid ptosis. The panel suggested that the injections can target the subcutaneous tissue or, at most, the superficial layers of the muscle to minimize the risk of diffusion and optimize the precision of treatment.</p><p>Further anatomical considerations for the procerus muscle: Unlike corrugator injections, injections targeting the procerus muscle pose a relatively low risk of eyelid ptosis. Given that the procerus originates from both superficial and deep layers [<xref rid="B12-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a combination technique involving subdermal and intramuscular injections into the procerus muscle may help achieve optimal outcomes for certain patients. Another anatomical consideration regarding the procerus injection is that while it is often described as a single pyramidal muscle, detailed dissections have shown that the procerus actually consists of bilateral muscle bundles [<xref rid="B13-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These bilateral components originate from the nasal bones on each side and are inserted into the skin of the glabella. In patients with a divided procerus muscle, it may be more appropriate to administer the injection at two points rather than a single midline injection.</p><p>Forehead injections: The &#x0201c;quizzical&#x0201d; raised eyebrows complication is not a direct result of treating the glabella area but rather due to the close anatomical connection between the corrugator and frontalis muscles. Injecting the glabella can impact the adjacent frontalis muscle, particularly in patients with brow ptosis or strong brow activity, leading to an elevation of the eyebrow tails. While the recommended guideline focuses on the procerus and corrugator supercilii muscles for the glabellar lines, the panel suggested additional injections into the inferolateral part of the frontalis muscle to prevent this complication in certain patients.</p><p>Management of ptosis: A flow chart illustrating practical solutions for BoNTA-related ptosis is provided in <xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> to serve as a quick reference guide for clinicians.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.2. Horizontal Forehead Lines</title><p>The frontalis muscle plays a pivotal role in forehead aesthetics. As the primary muscle responsible for forehead expressions, it enables a range of movements, notably raising the eyebrows. The activity of this muscle leads to the formation of horizontal lines across the forehead. These lines are not merely a universal sign of aging but vary significantly in their appearance and depth, influenced by individual factors such as genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and habitual facial expressions [<xref rid="B14-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. BoNTA injections are a widely accepted non-surgical approach for treating dynamic forehead wrinkles, representing the second most common indication for BoNTA injections among Korean dermatologists [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.2.1. Anatomy and Patient Selection</title><p>The occipitofrontalis muscle, situated beneath the forehead and occipital region, is divided into the frontal and occipital bellies. The frontal belly, commonly referred to as the frontalis muscle, originates from the galea aponeurosis; interacts with adjacent muscles such as the corrugator supercilii, procerus, and orbicularis oculi; and attaches to the skin above the superciliary arch. The muscle belly is characterized by a bifurcated, V-shaped configuration, with the superomedial portion comprising aponeurosis [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These anatomical features exhibit a high degree of individual variation [<xref rid="B16-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Ethnic considerations: Research suggests that Europeans generally exhibit more pronounced facial expressions, particularly in the forehead region, compared to Asians [<xref rid="B17-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This finding is supported by a study that compared wrinkle scores related to facial expressions between Caucasian and Japanese women [<xref rid="B18-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results indicate that Caucasians may have higher frontalis muscle contractility than Asians. Ethnic variations exist in the relative length of the forehead. For instance, Korean women often exhibit relatively longer foreheads than their white North American counterparts [<xref rid="B19-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Patient selection: Younger patients with high skin elasticity and no pre-existing eyelid or brow drooping usually experience better treatment outcomes and minimal post-injection discomfort. Conversely, older patients may face a higher risk of complications like eyelid/eyebrow ptosis, especially if they have a weakened orbital septum.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.2.2. Recommended Standard Injection Technique</title><p>Inject BoNTA at 8&#x02013;10 sites across the forehead in a &#x0201c;zigzag&#x0201d; fashion, approximately 1.5&#x02013;2 cm above the brow (<xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Injections should target the central and lateral portions of the frontalis muscle, with typical doses ranging from 7.5 to 15 U in total. Injections are recommended to be administered in the superficial layers, preferably within the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The doses should be adjusted based on the patient&#x02019;s age, muscle activity, and desired outcome. For instance, the starting dosage can be as low as 5&#x02013;6 U for young female patients seeking a natural-looking facial appearance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot3-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.2.3. Changes from the 2013 Guideline</title><p>The current guideline highlights the need for a more customized approach, moving away from the rigid, predetermined injection points and dosages outlined in the 2013 guideline. The panel emphasized that forehead anatomy and muscle activity can vary significantly from one individual to another and that a &#x0201c;one-size-fits-all&#x0201d; approach may not be optimal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot4-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.2.4. Expert&#x02019;s Opinions</title><p>Individualized approaches: The expert panel unanimously emphasized that achieving a true consensus on specific injection techniques and dosages for BoNTA injections in the forehead is inherently challenging. This challenge stems from the wide range of individual variations in patient anatomy, aesthetic goals, and responses to treatment. The panel strongly advocated developing individualized treatment plans beyond the present guideline based on a comprehensive assessment of each patient&#x02019;s unique characteristics. This may involve considerations such as the depth and pattern of forehead wrinkles, the patient&#x02019;s age, gender, and skin laxity, as well as the clinician&#x02019;s experience and preference for specific BoNTA formulations. The panel generally agreed that the fundamental principles of injection point location remain consistent across genders. In contrast, dosage should be adjusted to achieve comparable results between the males and the females.</p><p>Superficial approaches: Although the term &#x0201c;intramuscular&#x0201d; is commonly used to describe injections into the frontalis muscle, the panel acknowledged that the actual injection depth should be superficial. Administering BoNTA in the subdermal plane allows the injected toxin to be easily distributed to the frontalis muscle, producing effects comparable to direct intramuscular injection [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Research has shown that intradermal administration of BoNTA in the forehead achieves wrinkle reduction outcomes similar to intramuscular injection, while the intradermal approach preserves the natural brow position [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Determining the &#x0201c;no-injection&#x0201d; zone: A significant portion of the panel discussion centered on establishing a clearly defined &#x0201c;no-injection&#x0201d; zone to minimize the risk of brow ptosis. While many guidelines recommend avoiding injections within 1.5 cm above the eyebrow, the panel emphasized that this distance should not be considered absolute. The appropriate no-injection zone should be determined based on the patient&#x02019;s reliance on the frontalis muscle to open the eyes. Patients with greater lower frontalis engagement necessitate a more extensive zone to spare, sometimes exceeding 2 cm (<xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). To ascertain the appropriate no-injection area, clinicians should instruct patients to fully open their eyes to assess the degree of frontalis compensation. The initial dosage of BoNTA should be tailored according to the patient&#x02019;s ability to open the eyes without excessive frontalis muscle dependence.</p><p>Upper frontalis injections: Recent research has found that 40% of Korean study participants exhibited bidirectional forehead skin displacement, with the lower portion moving upward and the upper portion moving downward [<xref rid="B21-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In cases where patients exhibit pronounced muscle contraction in the upper part of the frontalis muscle, the panel recommended locating injections to a more superior part of the frontalis (<xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B).

The panel acknowledged the variability in aging and wrinkle severity among patients and recommended increasing the number of injection sites for older individuals to address wrinkles that extend with age. One example of such variation is a &#x0201c;2-line injection technique&#x0201d;, which involves administering additional injections further along the orbicularis oculi muscle to target wrinkles that extend beyond the typical treatment area or are associated with specific muscle movement patterns [<xref rid="B26-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While a precise dosage for this technique was not established, the panel generally suggested that the total dosage should be comparable to or 2.5 U to 5 U higher than the classic three-point injection approach, with adjustments made based on the patient&#x02019;s response and desired aesthetic outcome.

According to a recent analysis by Yi et al. [<xref rid="B32-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the dynamic wrinkles of the nasal skin can be attributed to three main components: (1) midline vertical lines, (2) lateral oblique lines, and (3) horizontal radix lines (<xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).

Anatomy and Patient Selection</title><p>Three principal muscles that form nasal wrinkles include the nasalis, procerus, and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi (LLSAN). The nasalis muscle has two parts: the transverse and the alar. The transverse part is triangular, originating from the maxillary canine fossa and inserting into the lateral cartilage of the nose, which wrinkles the nose horizontally. However, other nearby muscles, including the LLSAN, the procerus, and even the medial aspect of the orbicularis oculi muscle, are also involved and should be considered when treating nasal wrinkles [<xref rid="B32-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The LLSAN is a long muscle that originates from the maxillary frontal process and inserts into the nasal ala and upper lip. The oblique component of the dynamic nasal wrinkles is primarily caused by the LLSAN, which elevates the upper lip, and partly by the medial muscular band of the orbicularis oculi. The procerus muscle pulls down the medial portion of the eyebrow while creating a transverse wrinkle between the glabella and the sellion.</p><p>Patient selection: Individuals with dynamic wrinkles on the nasal dorsum, particularly those exhibiting &#x0201c;bunny lines&#x0201d; or oblique nose furrows, are appropriate candidates for treatment.

Recommended Standard Injection Technique </title><p>To address midline vertical wrinkles, a dose of 2 U is injected into the superior ala of the nose on both sides, with the recommended injection point being the midpoint between the rhinion and the medial end of the supra-alar crease, targeting the transverse part of the nasalis muscle. For lateral oblique lines, 2 U of BoNTA is injected into the upper part of the LLSAN muscle on each side, with the recommended injection point being the crossing point of the horizontal line at the level of the rhinion and the vertical line at the level of the medial canthus. For horizontal radix lines, 2 U of BoNTA is injected into the nasal dorsum. The injection point is between the glabella and the sellion to target the procerus muscle.

Expert Opinions</title><p>Precise targeting of the nasal muscles: In the lateral aspect of the lower nasal area, cadaver dissections consistently identify a triangular area that is uncovered by muscular structures, surrounded by the borders of the procerus, nasalis, orbicularis oculi, and LLSAN muscles [<xref rid="B31-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This finding suggests that BoNTA injections on the oblique nasal lines in situ may inadvertently target connective tissue rather than the underlying muscles, frequently leading to suboptimal clinical results. It highlights the importance of precisely targeting the responsible muscles with BoNTA injections while avoiding unnecessary toxin diffusion into areas lacking muscle tissue. Accordingly, the panel recommended that BoNTA injections should ideally target the contributing muscles, such as the nasalis and LLSAN, rather than relying solely on the appearance of the external nasal wrinkles.</p><p>Minimizing the toxin spread: The panel emphasized the need for gentle and slow injection to prevent the spread of BoNTA to nearby tissues. This is crucial when treating nasal wrinkles, as unintended paralysis of the inferior or medial rectus muscles could lead to significant problems, such as diplopia [<xref rid="B33-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Many panel members recommended manually blocking the inner boundary of the orbital rim during injection to prevent the spread of BoNTA. The panel also cautioned that injecting into the LLSAN could alter smile dynamics.

Expert Opinions</title><p>Patient selection: Patients with mild to moderate gummy smiles, characterized by excessive gingival display without significant skeletal discrepancies, are generally considered ideal candidates for BoNTA treatment. In severe cases, surgical corrections might be necessary to address the underlying skeletal issues contributing to the gummy smile. The expert panel advised careful consideration when treating patients with an elongated philtrum since BoNTA injections into upper lip elevators may slightly lengthen the cutaneous upper lip. This side effect could be exaggerated in individuals with a pre-existing long philtrum, potentially resulting in an old, sad-looking appearance.</p><p>Distance from the alar base: The panel discussed the optimal distance from the alar base for BoNTA injections to treat a gummy smile. Most panelists generally advocated maintaining a 1 cm distance from the alar base as the standard recommendation. This approach was deemed more effective for treating severe gummy smiles with significant gingival exposure, as it targets a broader range of muscles involved in upper lip elevation. However, some experts recommended injecting closer to the alar base, as this allows for more precise targeting of the LLSAN, potentially reducing the risk of affecting nearby muscles. This approach was considered suitable for milder cases, where weakening the LLSAN alone may be sufficient.</p><p>Additional injection points: The expert panel further discussed the potential benefits of incorporating additional injections into the LLS and DSN to achieve a more harmonious and balanced outcome in treating gummy smiles. Nevertheless, opposing viewpoints highlighted that the potential risks associated with injecting these additional muscles may outweigh the benefits, particularly for less experienced injectors. The panel concluded that the decision to include additional injection points should be based on the specific pattern and severity of the gummy smile presentation and a thorough assessment of the potential risks and benefits for the individual patient.</p><p>Injection depth: Some panel members favored intramuscular injections, highlighting that a deep injection helps ensure the toxin effectively reaches the target muscle fibers, particularly for deeper muscles like the LLSAN. Other members highlighted the technical challenges of intramuscular injections in the perioral region, where injecting too deeply could lead to the toxin being deposited in the deep medial cheek fat pad rather than the intended muscle, potentially reducing its efficacy. The panel generally agreed that the location of the injection point is more important than the injection depth, whether the injection is made subcutaneously or intramuscularly, to maximize the diffusion of the toxin into the target muscle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.7.

Expert Opinions</title><p>Safety precautions: The expert panel consistently emphasized the importance of avoiding unintended effects on adjacent perioral muscles when targeting the DAO. Clinicians must possess comprehensive knowledge of the perioral anatomy and the potential risks associated with BoNTA injections, particularly lip asymmetry. Precise injection techniques, appropriate dosage selection, and meticulous attention to detail are essential for minimizing the risk of complications.</p><p>Individualized adjustment: While the landmark-based approach provides a starting point, the panel emphasizes the importance of individualizing the injection point. Injectors are strongly encouraged to observe the patient&#x02019;s dynamic facial expressions, particularly during frowning or pouting, to identify the area of maximum DAO contraction.</p><p>Dosage: The expert panel recommends a dosage range of 2&#x02013;3 U of BoNTA for each DAO. This range balances efficacy and safety, minimizing the risk of overtreatment. The panel advocates a conservative approach, starting with 2 U for the initial injection. This allows for assessing the patient&#x02019;s response and minimizing the risk of unwanted side effects. A follow-up injection can be administered after 2 weeks to enhance the results. Injecting more than 4 U for each DAO is generally discouraged due to the increased risk of toxin diffusion to adjacent muscles, particularly the DLI, which could lead to muscle weakness, asymmetry, and an unnatural appearance.</p><p>Platysma injections and combination with fillers: While 3 U of BoNTA injection has been demonstrated to increase the height of the DAO significantly, it may not always correlate with patient satisfaction when only the DAO is injected [<xref rid="B44-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The panel suggested combining DAO injections with adjuvant treatments could enhance clinical efficacy and achieve more comprehensive and satisfactory outcomes. They recommended considering injections into the platysma muscle when additional correction is needed, as this muscle also contributes to the downward pull of the mouth corners. The panel notes that the dosage for platysma injections can be more flexible than DAO injections. The dosage should be determined based on the degree of platysmal activity and the desired aesthetic outcome. In addition, combining BoNTA injections and dermal fillers can provide more comprehensive results for addressing downturned mouth and marionette lines. BoNTA relaxes the underlying muscles, while fillers add volume and smooth out static wrinkles.

The typical total dose is 5&#x02013;6 U, distributed evenly across the three injection sites (<xref rid="toxins-17-00061-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot8dot3-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.8.3. Changes from the 2013 Guideline</title><p>The 2024 guideline retains the general principles of the previous recommendations but provides more conservative guidance on injection dosage. The maximal total dosage has been reduced significantly from 15 U to 5&#x02013;6 U. In addition, the 2024 guideline emphasizes the importance of administering BoNTA injections directly into the mentalis muscle using the intramuscular approach, moving away from the previously recommended optional intradermal injections.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot8dot4-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.8.4. Expert Opinions</title><p>Labiomental crease: The panel discussed the inclusion of the labiomental crease, the groove between the lower lip and chin, in the injection area. Concerns were raised about the potential diffusion of the neurotoxin beyond the intended treatment area, which could affect the orbicularis oris and the DLI muscles. As the orbicularis oris is responsible for general lip movement and the DLI lowers the lower lip, unintended paralysis of these muscles could lead to side effects like mouth drooping, speech difficulties, or asymmetry. To mitigate these risks, the panel recommended avoiding injections into the labiomental crease area. Targeting the inferior part of the chin directly and focusing on the mentalis muscle belly minimizes the risk of toxin diffusion while effectively addressing the cobblestone appearance.</p><p>Deeper injections: In Korea, intradermal injections have become more common in addressing superficial irregularities of the chin. However, the panel reached a consensus favoring intramuscular injections, regardless of the severity of the cobblestone appearance. This shift is grounded in the understanding that directly targeting the mentalis muscle bellies yields more predictable and long-lasting results. While intradermal injections might improve surface irregularities, they may not effectively address the root cause of the issue&#x02015;the mentalis muscle contraction itself.</p><p>Post-surgical patients: Mentalis muscle function and lower lip position alterations can occur in patients who have undergone mandible surgeries. BoNTA injections in these patients require careful consideration of the altered anatomy and muscle dynamics. In such cases, the injector should thoroughly assess the patient&#x02019;s mentalis muscle activation pattern and appropriately adjust the injection sites and depths, deviating from standard protocols when necessary.</p><p>Adding volumes: A combined approach involving dermal fillers and BoNTA benefits patients with retruded chins. Fillers can address underlying skeletal deficiencies in these patients, complemented by BoNTA injections to relax the musculature. This integrated approach optimizes aesthetic outcomes by addressing the structural and functional components of the soft tissue framework. According to a recent randomized, controlled study, the combined therapy achieved comparable improvements in chin retrusion measurements while requiring a lower overall filler volume, indicating superior treatment efficacy for patients with chin retrusion [<xref rid="B46-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The panel recommended waiting at least one week after the BoNTA injection to assess whether the clinical results are sufficient with only the toxin injection. The decision to use supplemental filler injection and the required filler volume is left to the discretion of the injector and the patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot9-toxins-17-00061"><title>2.9. Decision-Making Framework for BoNTA Dosage</title><p>The panel suggested using a decision-making framework (<xref rid="toxins-17-00061-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to determine the appropriate BoNTA dosage for targeting facial expression muscles. This framework considers various patient-specific factors to ensure a tailored treatment approach based on the panel&#x02019;s experience.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec3-toxins-17-00061"><title>3. Conclusions</title><p>The updated consensus guideline provides a comprehensive update from Korea on the current recommendations, changes, and comments for using BoNTA to improve various cosmetic concerns caused by facial expression muscles. It also reflects on an evolution in the treatment patterns observed in Korea over the past decade, with some recommendations modified, others excluded, and a subset still being followed. However, it is acknowledged that there is ample room for improvement, as not all recommendations in the present guidelines are directly supported by strong evidence. A primary limitation of this paper is the lack of high-quality scientific evidence supporting the recommendations and suggestions presented. The consensus recommendations presented are primarily based on expert opinions and consensus, clinical case series, and anatomical studies, which may largely be evaluated as &#x0201c;weak&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;conditional&#x0201d; according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for practice guidelines [<xref rid="B47-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], giving the paper a descriptive and qualitative nature. Future guideline development in this field may benefit from leveraging current consensus recommendations, including the present one, insights from domestic and international round-table discussions, and evidence-based systematic reviews. Additionally, further research and prospective studies are needed to strengthen the scientific foundation of these guidelines and ensure they are aligned with the latest advancements in aesthetic medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-toxins-17-00061"><title>4. Materials and Methods</title><p>On 4 February 2024, a panel of ten multidisciplinary Korean experts in dermatology, plastic surgery, aesthetic medicine, and clinical anatomy met to update and formulate consensus recommendations for cosmetic uses of BoNTA. Prior to the convening of the expert panel, the members reviewed previously published consensus guidelines or recommendation papers on the facial cosmetic uses of BoNTA, including the 2013 Korean consensus guideline, which was developed by a group of dermatologists, some of whom were involved in the development of the current updated consensus paper. During the meeting, the panel thoroughly reviewed the standard adult Korean facial photos, pinpointed the preferred injection sites on detailed anatomical diagrams, and shared comprehensive recommendations on the most effective injection techniques and appropriate dosages to be utilized. Potential complications were also discussed, along with their prevention strategies, based on the panel&#x02019;s professional experience and relevant scientific literature. The discussion topics were limited to cosmetic conditions associated with facial expression muscles. Recommendations excluded high-risk injection sites and applications requiring significant expertise to provide straightforward, practical advice for the safe and effective use of BoNTA, reflecting the best practices of average aesthetic healthcare professionals.</p><p>The recommendations were developed using a Delphi-based consensus framework [<xref rid="B48-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The Delphi survey presented participants with five response options: (1) Agree, (2) Strongly Agree, (3) Neutral, (4) Disagree, and (5) Strongly Disagree. Participants selected one response and provided comments and feedback to facilitate discussion. Consensus was reached if at least 80% of participants chose either &#x0201c;Agree&#x0201d; and/or &#x0201c;Strongly Agree&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;Disagree&#x0201d; and/or &#x0201c;Strongly Disagree&#x0201d;. Items that did not achieve consensus were omitted from the next round. However, if participants provided feedback regarding the clarity of the questions or their clinical relevance, the questions were rephrased for clarity and re-evaluated in the subsequent round. This process involved a total of four rounds of iterative discussion.</p><p>The suggested dosage guideline pertains to a novel BoNTA product (NEWLUX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>: NUMECO, Seoul, Republic of Korea), which is used routinely by panel members in their current practice. The NEWLUX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> product has been demonstrated to be generally comparable to the BOTOX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA) formulation, with a 1:1 dose conversion ratio [<xref rid="B49-toxins-17-00061" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. <xref rid="toxins-17-00061-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the formulation details of NEWLUX and other widely used BoNTA products in the Korean market. The recommended injection techniques were illustrated by a skilled medical artist who specialized in clinical facial anatomy and had extensive experience in depicting the intricate musculature and structures of the human face. To further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the illustrations, they were meticulously reviewed by another clinical anatomist with expertise in the facial anatomy of adult Korean patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the invaluable contributions of Professor Hye Won Huh (Yonsei University College of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea), whose beautiful and anatomically accurate illustrations have enhanced this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
