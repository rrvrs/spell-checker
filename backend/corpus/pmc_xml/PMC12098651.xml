Visual, auditory, and tactile systems are the most common sensory systems used by human beings to perceive information about the external environment, facilitated by organs such as the eyes, ears, and skin, making it convenient and natural to interact with the outside world. The integration of virtual tactile feedback technology with audiovisual technology can further enhance the richness of interaction and achieve better immersion experience. Among the many tactile feedback technologies, electrical stimulation tactile feedback stands out due to its performance advantages such as device portability, high refresh frequency and precise control. However, electrical stimulation technology lacks a mature three-dimensional human tissue electrical stimulation conduction model with multipoint stimulation in theoretical research; the variety of virtual tactiles implemented in the research is limited, and there is a gap with real life; and there are fewer audio-visual tactile feedback fusion control models and equipment development problems. Based on these challenges, this paper combs through the latest research progress of microcurrent stimulation-based virtual tactile feedback technology in the field of human-computer interaction. &#x0201c;Microcurrent&#x0201d; here refers to the application of low-intensity electrical currents, specifically under 10 milliamperes, which provide precise and adjustable stimulation for enhancing tactile experiences in virtual and augmented reality applications. This summary outlining the technical characteristics and current research status of this research direction. Finally, the current problems and future development trends in this field are discussed in depth, and how to improve them in order to develop a broader application space is analyzed. By clarifying the potential value of tactile feedback in human-computer interaction, it is hoped to promote the future development of electrically stimulated tactile feedback technology in human-computer interaction, and to help develop a more natural, realistic, efficient and immersive human-computer interaction experience. This study uniquely integrates a systematic analysis of electrotactile perception mechanisms with emerging microcurrent stimulation technologies, providing practical guidelines and a novel reference framework for future research in virtual haptics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human-computer interaction</kwd><kwd>electrotactile feedback</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd><kwd>virtual tactiles</kwd><kwd>audiovisual-tactile integration</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn1">National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn1">2022YFB4500600</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn2">Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn2">2023B0303040001</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

This fast pace has fostered virtual-reality fusion technologies, while the human-centered trend has increased demand for personalized information applications. As a result, virtual reality (VR) technology and the metaverse have become focal points in the information application industry due to their outstanding personalized experiences. Human-computer interaction (HCI) technology has gained significant attention for enabling virtual-reality integration and meeting personalized user needs.</p><p>HCI involves the communication and exchange of information between users and machines, including computers, mobile devices, and software systems, to facilitate task completion. The evolution of HCI has progressed through distinct stages, from manual operations and command-line interfaces to graphical user interfaces, web-based interfaces, and the current phase characterized by multi-channel and intelligent interaction. In the contemporary era, HCI is advancing towards multimodality and intelligence, enabling more natural and efficient interactions through the integration of visual, auditory, and tactile modalities.</p><p>In multimodal human-computer interaction, virtual tactile technology allows users to experience interaction targets in real time by simulating tactile features such as texture, vibration, and temperature. This enhances operational efficiency (<xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Dangxiao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2022</xref>). In recent years, the field of virtual tactile feedback in HCI has made significant progress thanks to the efforts of many research workers. For example, through the integration of wearable gloves and other devices, tactile feedback can provide a better immersion experience (<xref rid="ref123" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). In clinical medical training, critical equipment operation training and other professional fields, tactile feedback can strengthen the operator&#x02019;s &#x0201c;hand-eye coordination&#x0201d; ability (<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2022</xref>). In general-purpose scenarios like smartphones and computers, HCI has evolved rapidly. It has shifted from keyboards and mice to multi-touch and from voice interaction to multimodal systems. However, challenges remain, such as the high complexity of input interactions and the limited feedback confined to visual and auditory senses. These limitations reduce immersion and telepresence. Introducing tactile feedback is essential to meet the growing demand for personalized and immersive experiences. Recent advancements such as high-resolution electrotactile arrays (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2022</xref>) and adaptive tactile rendering based on physiological feedback (<xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2022</xref>) have significantly improved the realism and adaptability of virtual tactile systems (<xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In the field of HCI, traditional tactile feedback devices often rely on piezoelectricity, airbags, or similar modalities to achieve tactile feedback. However, these devices are typically large, bulky, inconvenient to operate, and complex to wear (<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">Pylatiuk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">Varga, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Perret et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, virtual tactile rendering technology based on microcurrent stimulation offers several advantages, including simplicity of implementation, lightweight and flexible design, ease of wear, and precise control of stimulation parameters (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref107" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">Strbac et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, this technology effectively stimulates a broader range of skin receptors, enabling the generation of diverse tactile sensations. As a result, it holds significant potential in applications such as virtual reality, teleoperation, medical care, entertainment, and education (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Al-Ayyad et al., 2023</xref>). In this paper, we will describe the basic operating procedures and applications of the microcurrent stimulation technique, outline the application cases in this field in recent years, and discuss the areas that need to be improved in the process of research and use. Through this work, this paper aims to introduce this emerging technology, promote its integration and application in related fields, and provide new perspectives and ideas for various researchers in research and innovation in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><p>This review is conducted as a systematic review and strictly adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, a systematic search was conducted across five databases to retrieve studies related to the field of electrotactile research. After screening based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 126 out of an initial 527 articles were ultimately selected for in-depth analysis and synthesis. The screening process was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, titles and abstracts were independently screened to exclude irrelevant or duplicate records. In the second stage, full texts were reviewed to determine eligibility. Disagreements during either stage were resolved through team discussion, and a third team member was consulted when necessary to reach consensus. To ensure quality, only studies with demonstrable methodological soundness and clear relevance to the research objectives were included, as further detailed in section 2.2.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Literature statistics. <bold>(a)</bold> Study selection using PRISMA flowchart. <bold>(b)</bold> statistical distribution of topics in electrotactile research literature.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnins-19-1519758-g001" position="float"/></fig><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Search strategy</title><p>A total of 527 articles were collected from databases such as IEEE Xplore, dblp, Elsevier, Springer, and Google Scholar.

In addition to database searches, reference lists of selected papers were checked to identify studies potentially missed in the initial search.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>2.2</label><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Articles were considered from three perspectives: studies on the mechanisms of electrotactile feedback, technology development, and practical applications. In the first screening stage, duplicates and irrelevant articles were excluded. Full texts were reviewed after assessing titles and abstracts, excluding papers that were not focused on electrotactile research, to ensure the inclusion of studies analyzing the physiological and psychological effects of electrotactile interaction in human-machine interfaces. In the second stage, reliable studies were selected by prioritizing publications from peer-reviewed journals, with a focus on author credibility, methodological rigor, and result consistency. These criteria were applied to ensure the inclusion of reliable, high-quality sources. However, given the specific scope of the selected literature, primarily focusing on studies published in peer-reviewed journals and prominent conferences, there might be inherent limitations regarding the representativeness of the selected sample. Particularly, studies involving cutting-edge experimental setups or those published in less accessible venues could have been underrepresented, potentially affecting the generalizability of this review.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>3</label><title>Virtual tactiles research</title><p>Research in the field of virtual haptics has been attracting a lot of attention, especially in the research direction closely related to electrically stimulated tactile feedback technology. In this paper, we will explore several key areas of electrostimulation tactile feedback technology, ranging from the mechanisms of electrotactile perception to the design and application of related devices. Firstly, we will focus on the perception and physiological mechanisms of electrotactile sensation in the human body, a fundamental knowledge that is essential for understanding how electrotactile feedback works and its effects. Subsequently, we will analyze key factors such as the perceived quality, intensity and comfort of electrically stimulated haptics. Further, this paper will review the current state of research on virtual haptic messaging and resolution. Additionally, it will explore recent advancements in haptic interaction devices (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Boldt et al., 2014</xref>). Comprehensive research in these areas provides important guidance for the development of more natural and efficient human-computer interaction technologies. Next, we will explore the current research status of each of these key areas in depth.</p><sec id="sec6"><label>3.1</label><title>Research on the physiological and psychological mechanisms of electrotactile sensation</title><sec id="sec7"><label>3.1.1</label><title>Current research on physiological mechanisms of electrotactile sensation</title><sec id="sec8"><label>3.1.1.1</label><title>Research on skin and receptors</title><p>Skin, one of the largest and most regenerative structures in the human body, performs essential functions such as protection, sweating, and sensing external stimuli like heat, cold, and pressure. As the body&#x02019;s primary sensory organ, the skin contains various types of receptors that detect both internal states and external stimuli. These receptors convert sensory signals into nerve impulses, which are transmitted via the nervous system to the brain&#x02019;s cortical areas, forming corresponding perceptions.</p><p>The human body&#x02019;s sense of touch is generated through the mechanoreceptors within the skin in response to external stimuli. The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues contain four main types of mechanoreceptors, namely: Meissner&#x02019;s tactile corpuscles, Merkel&#x02019;s tactile discs, Pacinian annular lamellipodia, and Ruffini&#x02019;s corpuscles. These receptors are distributed in the tissues of the skin at different depths.</p><p>Meissner&#x02019;s corpuscles, located in the superficial layers of the skin, have a spatial resolution of 3&#x02013;5&#x0202f;mm. They are highly sensitive to skin deformations (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Folgheraiter et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanoreceptors distributed at the base of the epidermis are Merkel tactile discs, which are connected in a disc-like fashion, often adjacent to Meissner tactile corpuscles. Merkel tactile discs have a very good perception of the surface properties of the skin, such as thickness, texture, and tensile changes. Although their response frequency is not high, their high spatial resolution of 0.4 to 0.6&#x0202f;mm makes them extremely responsive to dynamic stimuli (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Kajimoto et al., 2004</xref>). Deeper into the skin tissue, the mechanoreceptors distributed in this location are Pacinian annular lamellipodia, whose ring-type structure is responsive to stimuli at 60&#x02013;80&#x0202f;Hz and very sensitive to deformation of skin such as vibration and friction of the skin (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Folgheraiter et al., 2008</xref>). And the mechanoreceptors distributed in the dermis of the skin are Ruffini&#x02019;s corpuscles, and these receptors respond at frequencies similar to those of Merkel&#x02019;s tactile discs, with a wide range of sensory areas but low precision. Each mechanoreceptor corresponds to a specific tactile experience, and only when multiple receptors are activated at the same time can the human body obtain rich tactile sensations (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Based on the physiological characteristics of human skin receptors, the four skin receptors mentioned above can be grouped into two main categories (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Delmas et al., 2011</xref>): rapidly adapting receptor (RA or FA) and slowly adapting receptor (SA). Rapidly adapting receptors include Meissner tactile corpuscles and Pacinian annular layer corpuscles, while slowly adapting receptors consist of Merkel tactile discs and Ruffini&#x02019;s corpuscles (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Kajimoto et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, each type of receptor can be further subdivided into type I and type II. Specifically, Meissner tactile corpuscles are classified as RA type I, Merkel tactile discs are SA type I, Pacinian annular lamellipodia belong to RA type II, and Ruffini&#x02019;s corpuscles are SA type II. The main difference between these two major types of receptors is the duration of their response to a stimulus. Fast-adapting receptors adapt to stimuli quickly but briefly, while slow-adapting receptors adapt slowly and persistently.</p><p>In the current electrotactile research, since the contribution of Ruffini&#x02019;s corpuscles to tactile perception is relatively small, researchers have mainly focused on the response of the other three receptors to external stimuli (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Butikofer and Lawrence, 1979</xref>), which are figuratively referred to as &#x0201c;tactile primary colours&#x0201d; by <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Kajimoto et al. (2004)</xref>. This nomenclature implies that there is a similarity between the formation of tactile sensation and the mixing of colours. Just as a variety of colours can be produced by different combinations of the three primary colours of red, green and blue, a wide variety of tactile experiences can be created by stimulating different combinations of these three receptors, thus providing a rich variety of tactile perceptions.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><label>3.1.1.2</label><title>Research on neurons</title><p>Electrical stimulation activates tactile receptors, generating bioelectrical signals that trigger sensory nerve fibres to transmit information. Additionally, it can directly stimulate sensory neurons, inducing nerve impulses. These signals are further transmitted to the brain&#x02019;s central nervous system. The human brain contains nearly 100 billion neurons, interconnected through synapses to form complex neural networks. These networks perform essential functions, including information transmission, processing, integration, and computation. The basic structure of neurons, comprising dendrites, axons, and soma, is illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Neuronal structure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnins-19-1519758-g002" position="float"/></fig><p>The relationship between electrotactile physical stimulation, peripheral nerve activity, central nerve activity, and electrotactile perception was first investigated by <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Kaczmarek et al. (2000)</xref> using recording of action potentials from three RA fibres innervating primate fingerpad. The study designed two experiments in which mechanical stimulation was coupled with electrical stimulation. In the first experiment, the current intensity was gradually increased from 0 to the threshold value and beyond, while recording three RAI neuron discharges. The results showed a sudden increase in neuron discharge rates at the threshold value. However, further increases in current intensity did not significantly alter the discharge rate. The second experiment applied electrical stimulation with a 20&#x0202f;&#x003bc;s pulse width and sinusoidal mechanical stimulation at 30&#x0202f;Hz simultaneously. The differences in RA neuronal discharge were recorded before and after the electrical stimulation. The results showed that single mechanical stimulation induced neuronal discharge of about 10 AP/s. When superimposed on electrical stimulation, the same neuronal discharge abruptly changed to 30 AP/s. Experimental results show that electrical stimulation plays an important role in tactile perception, both independently triggering neuronal responses and synergistically with mechanical stimulation to significantly enhance neural activity. Kaczmarek&#x02019;s study provides key evidence for understanding the physiological mechanisms of electrotactile sensation, demonstrating the potential and benefits of electrical stimulation in the optimisation of tactile feedback devices and the enhancement of user experience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec10"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Research on the modelling of electrotactile bioelectrical signals</title><p>Research on the biological model of electrotactile perception provides valuable insights into its underlying mechanisms. These models allow researchers to study how electrical stimulation propagates through the skin and nerves, offering a deeper understanding of the core principles of electrotactile technology. This knowledge is crucial for guiding the design and optimisation of electrotactile systems. Based on the generation mechanism of electrotactile sensation, this section categorises bioelectric signal modelling into three areas: skin impedance modelling, electrode-skin contact modelling, and neuron conduction modelling.</p><sec id="sec11"><label>3.1.2.1</label><title>Skin impedance modelling</title><p>Early research on skin impedance models mainly focused on the measurement of skin impedance, such as <xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr">Schwan (1968)</xref> studied the polarization impedance and measurement of electrodes in biomaterials. Further research revealed that the skin&#x02019;s resistive properties under electrical stimulation are primarily attributed to hair follicles and sweat glands, while its capacitive properties are associated with lipid bilayers. This dual nature gives skin impedance distinct resistance-capacitance characteristics. Consequently, researchers developed standard electrical equivalent models of the skin by simulating its impedance using resistance-capacitance (RC) circuits. For example, <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">van Boxtel (1977)</xref> had already started to use resistive-capacitive parallel networks for the equivalent of skin resistance in his research to more closely reflect the electrical behavior of the skin under the action of a 1&#x02013;10&#x0202f;mA square wave electrical pulse.</p><p>Considering that the skin can be divided into several tissue layers, each of which can be divided further into sublayers. Therefore, further layering is needed on the basis of the original RC model, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. All three skin models are designed considering the hierarchical structure of the skin, i.e., the skin is considered to be a layered structure, and these layers are referred to as the extracellular medium, the intracellular medium, and the lipid bilayer. Each sublayer is represented as an RC network; therefore, the entire skin impedance model is represented as a complex cascaded RC circuit.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>(a)</bold> Motague electrical model for skin impedance. <bold>(b)</bold> Skin impedance model provided by <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">Tregear (1966)</xref>. <bold>(c)</bold> Skin impedance model provided by <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Lykken (1970)</xref>.

Recent studies have used dynamic impedance models and memristor circuits to describe the skin&#x02019;s response to electrical stimulation. However, several challenges remain. The complexity of models increases computational burden, reducing efficiency in real-time applications. Additionally, individual variations in skin properties limit their generalizability.

Kaczmarek&#x02019;s et al. model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>) pioneered the conceptualization of skin-electrode interactions under low-frequency, low-current conditions, offering simplicity and foundational insights. However, its exclusion of time-varying parameters and nonlinear behaviors limited its applicability to dynamic physiological systems. Dorgan&#x02019;s et al. model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>) addressed these gaps by incorporating nonlinearity and time dependence, better aligning with real-world skin impedance variations under stimulation. Yet, while it advanced physiological relevance, its lack of a parameterized electrode-specific framework hindered precise practical implementation. Saadi et al. introduced critical parameterization via EIS, explicitly characterizing Ag/AgCl electrode-skin impedance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>), thereby enhancing model specificity for targeted applications. Nevertheless, their focus on static parameterization left room for refinement in addressing dynamic, stimulus-dependent impedance shifts. Cameron et al. advanced this further with a double parallel resistive/constant-phase element model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>), combining robust parameter estimation via lease-squares optimization with adaptability to single-electrode configurations. While their approach improved accuracy and generalizability, the increased model complexity may pose challenges in real-time applications or scenarios requiring rapid parameter recalibration. Collectively, these models demonstrate a trajectory from conceptual simplicity to physiological fidelity and practical precision, though trade-offs persist between dynamic adaptability, parameterization granularity, and computational tractability.

They are primarily used to investigate the relationship between external physical stimuli and tactile perception. Current psychophysical approaches place a major emphasis on the use of non-invasive means to study different sensory modalities and biological sensory mechanisms. The advancement of signal detection theory has enabled researchers to design robust experiments. By integrating statistical models, they can describe psychological activities such as decision tendencies, preferences, and response biases during tactile perception.</p><p>Compared with subjective physiological and psychological factors, the effects of physical factors on electrotactile perception are easier to quantify and thus more suitable for research. Stimulation mode covers factors like contact frequency and duration. Electrode characteristics include material, shape, and size (contact area). Power source factors encompass waveform, frequency, and strength. Due to the strong coupling between these factors, the effect of a single factor can be quantified, but the combined effect of multiple factors is more difficult to describe. Therefore, researchers have mostly used psychophysical experimental means to examine these factors qualitatively or semi-quantitatively, and to analyze and assess the relationship between these factors and electrotactile perception by detecting threshold values at different levels.</p><p>The main stimulus modalities that affect electrotactile perception include contact pressure, contact frequency and contact duration.

Studies demonstrate that current amplitude directly determines perceptual intensity, with higher amplitudes enhancing subjective tactile strength but requiring careful balancing between DT and PT to avoid discomfort. Frequency influences perception through dual mechanisms: high-frequency stimuli (&#x0003e;50&#x0202f;Hz) tend to evoke smoother sensations, while low-frequency ranges (&#x0003c;50&#x0202f;Hz) may induce &#x0201c;rough&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;vibratory&#x0201d; qualities due to frequency-dependent skin impedance. Frequency also correlates with the JND, necessitating precise tuning to optimize perceptual discrimination. Pulse width interacts nonlinearly with amplitude and frequency: wider pulses (e.g., &#x0003e;200&#x0202f;&#x003bc;s) enhance perceived intensity, but their combination with frequency (e.g., high-frequency narrow pulses vs. low-frequency wide pulses) significantly shapes spatiotemporal tactile attributes, such as roughness or continuity. Furthermore, spatiotemporal modulation of multi-channel parameters (e.g., interleaving time) expands the dimensionality of tactile encoding. Crucially, these parameters do not act in isolation; instead, they interact through the skin&#x02019;s frequency-varying electrical properties (e.g., impedance) and neural encoding mechanisms (e.g., activation function thresholds), forming a multidimensional perceptual space. Optimizing electrotactile technology requires integrating psychophysical metrics (e.g., DT, PT, and JND) with coupled parameter models (e.g., amplitude-frequency-pulse width response surfaces) to balance perceptual strength, quality, and safety, ultimately enabling user-customizable high-fidelity tactile feedback.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies provide valuable insights into how different stimulus power factors shape electrotactile perception. They offer a theoretical and experimental foundation for optimizing electrotactile technology. This knowledge enables developers to fine-tune stimulus parameters, enhancing both the technology&#x02019;s performance and user experience.</p><p>After a large number of studies on the influencing factors of electrotactile sensation, researchers began to focus on how to enhance the perceived quality and comfort of electrotactile sensation. For example, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Gregory et al. (2009)</xref> developed a customised electrotactile display terminal for data acquisition and an individual bioimpedance parameter identification method based on the Cole&#x02013;Cole skin-electrode circuit model. Using this approach, the parameters of the skin-electrode interface circuit model were characterized. Psychophysical experiments confirmed that the method enhanced the consistency and comfort of tactile rendering. <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Alonzo et al.

(2019)</xref> found that the mechanoreceptors would be fatigued when subjected to electrical. To address this, they developed a system that adjusted microcurrent parameters to stabilize tactile rendering. This approach ensured consistent tactile feedback for different individuals and varying locations on the same individual. <xref rid="ref117" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2020)</xref> proposed a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator with online skin impedance measurement. Through psychophysical experiments on subjects, it was verified that the method could adaptively adjust the stimulation intensity according to the change of impedance, thus improving the safety and applicability of the electrotactile feedback system.</p><p>These studies mentioned above have made significant progress in improving the quality and comfort of electrotactile feedback, but there are some limitations or shortcomings.</p><p>Firstly, the generalizability of the models and methods, most of the current studies are based on specific experimental groups or individuals, and there are significant differences in skin properties and neural responses among different populations, so the methods mentioned above may have limitations in terms of generalization. At the same time, environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, etc. have a significant effect on the electrical properties of the skin and neural responses, and the above studies may not be comprehensive enough in controlling these environmental variables, which may lead to pure bias of the results in practical applications.</p><p>Secondly, there is the complexity of the technical implementation, which can be divided into two types: the limitations of hardware devices, and the difficulty of algorithm optimization. The limitation of hardware devices such as the Cole&#x02013;Cole model-based electrotactile display terminal developed by Gregory et al. may suffer from excessive hardware implementation complexity and high cost, which is not conducive to large-scale promotion and application. Algorithm optimization difficulties such as the online skin impedance measurement function proposed by Yang et al. require complex algorithmic support, and these algorithms are difficult to optimize and debug, and may be interfered with by a variety of factors in practical applications.</p><p>Finally, the inherent limitations of psychophysical experiments, psychophysical experiments mainly rely on the subjective feelings of the subjects, and this subjectivity may lead to bias in the experimental results. At the same time, there may be differences in feelings between different subjects and between the same subject at different points in time, which increases the difficulty of reproducibility of experimental results. These findings collectively highlight the complexity of electrotactile sensation modulation and emphasize the need for standardization in psychophysical protocols to ensure consistent cross-study comparability. Moreover, understanding how different stimulation factors interact to affect perceptual outcomes is crucial for guiding the design of adaptive feedback systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec15"><label>3.2</label><title>Virtual tactile technology and its equipment</title><sec id="sec16"><label>3.2.1</label><title>Wearable non-invasive electrode arrays</title><p>Wearable non-invasive electrodes are mainly composed of two parts: the stimulating electrode and the grounding electrode.

The position of the grounding electrode, as the negative electrode, affects the position, density, depth, and degree of diffusion of the entire current pathway. Since both parts are in direct contact with human skin in the process of providing tactile feedback, the selection of electrode materials and the electrode settings for the tactile feedback modality of electrical stimulation have become an important criterion in addition to indicators such as positioning accuracy and induced sensory intensity. The common electrode settings in the literature can be divided into concentric electrodes and separated electrodes, and the common separated electrode settings applied to the finger area can be subdivided into transducer dorsum, phalangeal ring, palmar, and dorsum of the finger, and so on (<xref rid="ref122" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">Tezuka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> describes in detail the advantages and disadvantages of different placement positions of grounding electrodes under the separated electrode setup for finger application scenarios.

These flexible circuits are widely used in wearable devices such as gloves or motion-capture suits to ensure flexibility and comfort for real-world applications. These electrode materials are usually derived from those used in electrophysiological recordings, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), electromyograms (EMGs) and electroencephalograms (EEGs) (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2020</xref>).

They both directly act on human skin or nerves, and the resulting electrical stimulation can activate the tactile receptors under the skin, thus triggering the brain to process the incoming stimulation signals and produce corresponding tactile sensations. The effect of electrotactile feedback is not only related to the design of the electrode array and the location of the grounded electrodes as mentioned in the previous section, but is also influenced by a series of stimulation signal parameters. Stimulus signals are usually delivered in the form of electrical pulses, which can be categorised as constant voltage source stimulation and constant current source stimulation. The stimulation current applied to the human body from a constant voltage source can fluctuate dramatically due to individual variability, the actuator-body interaction interface, and the instability of the impedance of the electrical stimulation circuit. The tactile perception of the human body is closely related to the current size, and the current fluctuation will greatly affect the human body&#x02019;s tactile perception, so the constant-current source stimulation is more effective. In the microcurrent-based tactile feedback modal research, the main focus on the current amplitude, frequency and pulse width of the three parameters on the tactile feedback. As shown in <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, researchers have determined some relationships between human tactile perception and current parameters through a large number of experiments: <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Fei et al.

This method enables users to have a tactile experience in interacting with virtual or real objects. Conventional prostheses lack tactile feedback, and this lack of sensation interrupts the sensory closure loop between the brain and the hand, leading to the abandonment of the prosthetic hand by the residual limb user. Therefore, early virtual tactile research focused on restoring tactile feedback to amputees through sensory substitution (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Bach-y-Rita and Kercel, 2003</xref>). With the advancement of technology, the application scenarios of virtual tactile sensation have gradually expanded to the fields of virtual reality and teleoperation, aiming to provide users with more realistic tactile sensations.</p><p>Tactile feedback techniques can be divided into two main categories: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive feedback provides lower stimulation thresholds by implanting electrodes into the nervous system in direct contact with afferent nerves. For example, <xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Raspopovic et al. (2014)</xref> were able to decode different grasping tasks in real time by stimulating the median and ulnar nerves with transverse multichannel intra-bundle electrodes, helping amputees to obtain tactile feedback and improve prosthetic control. However, invasive electrodes still have limitations in terms of durability and neural interface technology, which have affected their diffusion in practical applications (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Fallahian et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, non-invasive feedback is more widely used due to its non-invasive nature, especially in the fields of virtual reality, teleoperation and texture communication (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">Pamungkas and Ward, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Altinsoy and Merchel, 2012</xref>). There are two main modalities of non-invasive feedback: vibrotactile and electrotactile. Vibrotactile transmits physical forces mechanically, while electrotactile stimulates the neural afferent system in the skin through electrodes. Vibrotactile was early used in prosthetic control, such as the force feedback system developed by <xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">Pylatiuk et al. (2006)</xref> which feeds back grip force information through vibrating motors to enable more precise gripping of prosthetic limbs.</p><p>Although vibrotactile sensing has been used earlier in prosthetic control, electrotactile sensing has gradually received more attention as the need for high-resolution, low-latency haptic feedback has increased. As shown in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figures 12a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, commercial vibrotactile-based devices, such as the H-glove, Dexmo glove, and HaptX glove, tend to have actuators that are bulky, limiting the spatial resolution for integration into portable or wearable devices (<xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">Varga, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Perret et al., 2017</xref>). Electrotactile stimulators, due to their small size and flexibility, are able to provide multi-channel feedback and support closed-loop control of complex devices with higher resolution and response speed (<xref rid="ref107" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">Strbac et al., 2016</xref>). These advantages make electrotactile ideal for virtual tactile rendering, especially in portable and wearable device applications. To further optimize the performance of electrotactile sensing, <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Kajimoto (2012)</xref> proposed a real-time impedance feedback with pulse-width modulation technique for reducing the variation of tactile sensory intensity during stimulation. Despite the success of this technique in coping with impedance changes, the consistency of the model was still insufficient. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Akhtar et al.

The system is not only able to cover the entire range of human tactile intensities, but also solves the safety concerns of previous electrotactile reliance on high-voltage pulses. Although electrotactile devices show many advantages in virtual tactile rendering, they still face some limitations. Electrotactile sensation is difficult to stimulate slow-adaptive (SA) mechanoreceptors alone, leading to limitations in simulating sustained pressure perception. In addition, further miniaturisation of electrotactile devices and their integration with other tactile feedback technologies in the future will open up new possibilities for providing more realistic tactile sensations. The combination of these technologies is expected to enhance the accuracy and immersion of virtual tactile sensation, thereby providing a richer tactile feedback experience.</p><fig position="float" id="fig14"><label>Figure 14</label><caption><p><bold>(a)</bold> Diagram of stimulator connections. <bold>(b)</bold> Chart of percentage correct responses for electrode size and interelectrode spacing (<xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al., 2008</xref>). <bold>(c)</bold> Stimulation conditions in the effect of stimulus spacing on two-point discrimination. <bold>(d)</bold> Stimulation conditions in the effect of stimulus sequence length on two-point discrimination (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Boldt et al., 2014</xref>). <bold>(e)</bold> Illustration of the 5&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;5 electrotactile device rendering resolution (left) and the top view of simulation results of current density under the different distribution of stimulation electrodes (right) (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).

Tactile interaction devices, as a technology closely related to computing platforms, have also gone through three evolutionary phases: desktop tactile, surface tactile, and wearable tactile (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Dangxiao et al., 2019</xref>). In the desktop tactile stage, the interaction mainly relies on multi-joint force feedback devices. The user interacts with the virtual environment by operating a robotic arm, and the force feedback is transmitted to the hand so that the user feels the virtual tactile sensation of the object. Typical representatives of such devices include Force Dimension and SensAble.</p><p>With the development of tactile technology entering the surface tactile stage, electrotactile interaction is beginning to receive more attention. Surface tactile aims to simulate the direct contact between the finger and the object, and the user can feel the texture and shape of the virtual object by sliding the finger on the touch screen and performing gesture operations such as zooming, panning, and rotating. Most current surface tactile devices use rigid printed circuit boards (PCBs) to build electrode arrays, with research focusing on spatial recognition, materials and surface texture roughness. For example, <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2010)</xref> from Shanghai Jiaotong University designed a system that generates tactile feedback through electrical stimulation for delivering Braille information. The user can perceive Braille by touching the electrode array (<xref rid="ref115" ref-type="bibr">Xin-yu, 2009</xref>). In addition, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Germani et al. (2013)</xref> developed a novel tactile display capable of obtaining material roughness and texture feedback by touching the panel. However, surface tactile devices require the user to concentrate and actively apply some pressure to make contact with the display. This interaction is limited to a two-dimensional plane, making it difficult to meet the demands of complex hand movements in free space. With the rise of VR technology, surface tactile is no longer able to fully support multi-degree-of-freedom hand tracking.</p><p>Nowadays, wearable tactile devices have become the main research direction of tactile interaction devices. By wearing a tactile glove, the user can achieve a variety of gestures such as grasping, pinching, etc. to control the virtual hand-shaped avatar. <xref rid="ref123" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al.

In addition, <xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">Pamungkas and Ward (2013)</xref> developed an electrotactile glove applied to the dorsal region of the hand for teleoperation and virtual haptic feedback, and <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al.

These wearable electrotactile interaction devices show great potential in areas such as education, rehabilitation therapy, and commercial activities. Importantly, by addressing critical issues such as electrode stability, stimulation uniformity, and adaptive feedback modulation, these technologies not only enhance user comfort and realism but also significantly expand the practical applicability of electrotactile systems, paving the way for broader commercialization and adoption.

Among the available systems, the da Vinci Surgical System is the most successful commercially available surgical robotic system. The latest model, shown in <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16c</xref>, has integrated tactile feedback to improve operating accuracy.

However, current electrotactile systems face limitations in replicating the nuanced force gradients encountered in real tissues. Traditional methods, such as cadaveric training, provide direct haptic feedback with high fidelity but are constrained by ethical concerns and limited availability. Additionally, the high cost of advanced systems like the da Vinci Surgical System (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16c</xref>) limits accessibility, particularly in low-resource settings.

The study specifically highlights the potential of the WTSA system in rehabilitation training, providing more efficient and accurate tactile recovery compared to traditional methods. The manufactured WTSA not only replaces severely impaired tactile function with biocompatible materials, but also promotes skin wound healing and regeneration using collagen and fibronectin-based artificial skin (CFAS). In addition, the hydrogel coating on the neural interface electrodes helps to minimise foreign body reactions, further enhancing the system&#x02019;s clinical application prospects. In a broader application, the integration of wireless tactile systems with virtual reality environments can also be used to simulate a variety of realistic scenarios and complex operations, enabling patients with impaired tactile senses to be better equipped to cope with the real world (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Dibben et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig17"><label>Figure 17</label><caption><p>Overall schematic and converted tactile signal transfer process to stimulate the sciatic nerve (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Dibben et al., 2023</xref>). <bold>(a)</bold> An exploded schematic illustration of the WTSA, consisting of artificial skin, a crack-based tactile sensor, a WPPFM circuit, neural interface electrodes, and a fibrin coating designed to reduce foreign body reactions. <bold>(b)</bold> A rapid skin regeneration process facilitated by an ECM-inspired artificial skin made of collagen and fibrin.

For example, a clinical trial by <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Demeco et al.

Hand rehabilitation is an important application area of electrotactile technology (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2020</xref>), and by providing interactive tactile feedback, patients can perform a variety of motor exercises in a virtual environment, thereby facilitating recovery. A robotic system incorporating virtual reality technology developed by <xref rid="ref1001" ref-type="bibr">Riener et al.

Compared to conventional physical therapy, electrotactile feedback enables personalized and adaptive training through real-time adjustments. However, prolonged use of wearable electrodes often causes skin irritation due to prolonged current exposure, and inconsistent contact impedance leads to unstable feedback during dynamic movements. Traditional rehabilitation tools, such as mechanical resistance devices, offer robust durability but lack the flexibility to simulate complex virtual scenarios. Moreover, the integration of multimodal feedback (e.g., combining electrotactile and vibrotactile) remains computationally intensive, resulting in latency (&#x0003e;50&#x0202f;ms) that disrupts the closed-loop sensory-motor cycle.

This type of training significantly improves the cardiovascular health and functional capacity of cardiac patients. It also increases their motivation to recover. Real-time tactile feedback allows patients to more precisely control the intensity and pace of their training, thus optimizing rehabilitation outcomes. In addition, virtual tactile technology has shown value in developing assistive tools for visually impaired patients, improving their independence and quality of life through real-time electrotactile feedback. Notably, virtual tactile technology also has potential in the field of psychosocial rehabilitation, where virtual reality combined with tactile feedback can create immersive therapeutic environments that can help to alleviate patients&#x02019; pain and anxiety (as shown in <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Figure 18</xref>) (<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Mohan et al., 2021</xref>). While virtual tactile systems enhance engagement in cardiac rehabilitation, their effectiveness is highly dependent on user compliance and adaptability. Traditional supervised exercise programs ensure direct clinician oversight but lack the scalability of virtual solutions. A critical limitation lies in the oversimplification of tactile cues for cardiovascular feedback; current systems primarily modulate intensity rather than mimicking physiological nuances like arterial pulsatility. For psychosocial applications, although immersive VR environments reduce anxiety, the absence of thermal and proprioceptive feedback in electrotactile systems diminishes the realism of therapeutic scenarios. Future systems needintegrate multisensory modalities to bridge this gap.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec24"><label>3.3.2</label><title>Immersive entertainment and interactive experience</title><p>Virtual tactile plays an important role in immersive entertainment and interactive applications such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

It is worth noting that compared with traditional mechanical tactile devices (such as systems that rely on vibration and electric stimulation to generate touch), although microcurrent-based virtual tactile technology shows obvious advantages in resolution and response speed, it still has significant technical limitations in terms of long-term stability, individual skin resistance differences, and insufficient stimulation of slow adaptive receptors.

Its mapping of thresholds for different electrical parameters allows for personalized threshold data to be used to reproduce virtual touch sensations in the hand with optimized stimulus intensities to avoid causing pain. By precise control of sensory levels, time and spatial perception, it can provide personalized and precise electrotactile feedback when the user interacts with virtual objects (<xref rid="fig20" ref-type="fig">Figure 20b</xref>).

This intuitive perception helps to reduce the cost and time of trial and error in design, thus speeding up the time to market. We can also note the relative frequency of participants in the VR2A benchmark test in different scenarios, and the enhancement of the experience and experimentation brought by virtual tactiles to the participants is evident with continuous training and adaptation (<xref rid="fig23" ref-type="fig">Figure 23</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig23"><label>Figure 23</label><caption><p><bold>(a)</bold> Rendering of open virtual environments with six different sized cubes. <bold>(b)</bold> Overview of two standard experimental designs in VR environments with independent variables: size and gap. <bold>(c)</bold> Relative frequencies of participants in different scenarios of the VR2A benchmark test (<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">Otto et al., 2019</xref>).

For example, several studies have explored how tactile feedback systems can be utilised to assess the user-friendliness and operational comfort of control panels in car interiors (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Breitschaft et al., 2019</xref>). By simulating the sensation of the user&#x02019;s fingers on the control buttons, researchers were able to analyze the impact of different design options on user perception and operational efficiency, thereby optimizing the layout and functional design of the control panel. In addition, virtual tactiles can provide important feedback in the early stages of product design. By combining it with virtual reality technology, designers can explore and modify product concepts directly in a digital environment without relying on traditional physical prototyping (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Dangxiao et al., 2019</xref>). This approach not only saves material and manufacturing costs, but also significantly shortens the product development cycle, allowing designers to be more flexible and responsive to changes in market demand. Compared with traditional physical prototype testing and manual design, virtual tactile rendering technology can shorten product design cycles and reduce material costs through real-time feedback. However, the current system still has obvious deficiencies in real touch reproduction, response delay, and multi-point tactile feedback consistency. For example, compared with traditional groping physical prototype testing, the fineness and dynamic changes of touch in the virtual environment have not yet met users&#x02019; expectations of the feel of real products, which to some extent affects designers&#x02019; intuitive judgment of product details.</p></sec><sec id="sec28"><label>3.3.4.2</label><title>Remote operation and control</title><p>The application of virtual tactile rendering technologies is of great importance in the field of industrial automation and teleoperation. These technologies enable remote operators to sense and manipulate complex machines and equipment over a network while maintaining a high degree of control and feedback over the operating environment (<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2022</xref>). For example, in the medical field, doctors can perceive and manipulate surgical robots in real time via virtual tactile systems to accurately perform minimally invasive surgical operations, while minimizing surgical risks and errors.</p><p>Teleoperation is a technology that enables remote interaction between humans and machines, where the control end is local and the execution end is somewhere in remote space that cannot be directly perceived locally (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Aiguo, 2013</xref>). In teleoperation systems, commands are given by a local human user to control the physical application of a remote machine ontology (<xref rid="fig24" ref-type="fig">Figure 24a</xref>). As opposed to intelligent programming, teleoperation systems construct realistic and reliable human-machine interaction scenarios that facilitate the control of robots to handle complex, urgent, or extreme tasks. In contrast, in traditional teleoperation techniques, fine manipulation control is challenging due to the lack of tactile feedback information, which prevents the local user from sensing the contact between the engineering robot and the ground or obstacles, which can easily lead to the tipping over of the real engineering robot. By realising realistic and delay-free tactile feedback, it is possible to realize more delicate robotic dexterity operations, such as pouring water, unscrewing bottle caps, opening cardboard boxes, spinning Rubik&#x02019;s cubes, writing, helping people with headphones, and even human massage. In the field of human-computer interaction, <xref rid="ref106" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al.

The results show no significant differences in terms of performance time and operational errors. However, users believe that a TPD interface supporting passive tactile feedback can significantly improve the user experience of remote experts in VR. From the perspective of traditional remote operation, which relies on direct manipulation of physical models to obtain real tactile feedback, although virtual tactile technology has achieved real-time interaction across regions, its feedback accuracy and response delay issues cannot be ignored. The current tactile feedback system is prone to errors under high-load conditions, and it is difficult to fully simulate the actual tactile experience caused by subtle changes in finger movements, which to a certain extent limits its practicality in industrial high-precision operation and equipment maintenance.</p><fig position="float" id="fig24"><label>Figure 24</label><caption><p><bold>(a)</bold> Proof-of-concept diagram for TPD and MFD. <bold>(b)</bold> Shows the entire system architecture including hardware, software and overview of key data flows including SAR and VR sites. <bold>(c)</bold> Evaluating the performance of the difficulty level of the A/B model (<xref rid="ref106" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Reproduced with permission.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnins-19-1519758-g024" position="float"/></fig><p>In general, virtual tactile presentation technology has shown advantages over traditional methods in terms of high efficiency, low cost and safety in the field of product design and industrial remote control, but it also faces technical bottlenecks such as insufficient hardware stability, poor tactile feedback authenticity and insufficient response to complex interactive environments. Future research needs to make breakthroughs in material innovation, feedback algorithm optimization and multimodal fusion to achieve complementary advantages between virtual tactile technology and traditional industrial practices and promote the widespread application of this emerging technology.</p><p>In addition, virtual tactiles technology can enhance engineers&#x02019; ability to operate during remote facility maintenance and troubleshooting. With real-time tactile feedback, engineers can remotely identify and address equipment faults and adjust operational strategies in a timely manner, thereby reducing maintenance time and costs (<xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">Rastogi and Kumar Srivastava, 2019</xref>). This capability is particularly important for companies that operate and maintain facilities across geographies and on a large scale, and can effectively improve overall operational efficiency and responsiveness. Nowadays, the application of virtual tactile rendering technology in the field of industry and design demonstrates a broad development prospect and important application value. As technology continues to advance and application scenarios expand, we can expect these technologies to continue to contribute to industrial production efficiency, product design innovation and remote operation safety in the future.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec29"><label>4</label><title>Trends for the future</title><p>In the future, the development of virtual tactile technology will be centered around several key directions to improve its accuracy, portability, and user experience, thereby facilitating broader applications across multiple fields. The novelty of this review lies particularly in its comprehensive synthesis of physiological and psychophysical mechanisms, advanced electrotactile rendering technologies, and emerging trends in device integration, providing an integrated theoretical and practical framework to guide future research and development efforts. Specifically, the establishment of more precise three-dimensional human tissue electrical stimulation conduction models will substantially enhance the accuracy of electrotactile feedback and multi-point stimulation, thereby expanding its utility in more complex tactile interaction scenarios.</p><p>Furthermore, addressing demanding application requirements, such as those found in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments, necessitates the development of lightweight, flexible, and highly responsive electrotactile devices. Emphasis should be placed on miniaturizing microcurrent generators and selectors, optimizing electrode materials, and refining ergonomic designs to ensure comfort and long-term usability. Real-time impedance feedback combined with pulse-width modulation techniques will dynamically stabilize stimulation intensity, mitigating perceptual inconsistencies caused by impedance variability, and thus significantly enhancing the reliability and realism of tactile interactions.</p><p>Enhancing user experience further calls for robust advancements in multimodal integration techniques, especially in developing fusion control models and innovative audio-visual-tactile systems. Such integrated feedback mechanisms promise to yield richer, more immersive interaction scenarios. Practically, virtual tactile technologies are poised to see expanding applications within education and training, industrial design, medical rehabilitation, and related areas, highlighting the need for tailored solutions addressing sector-specific requirements.</p><p>Moreover, future studies could benefit from deeper exploration into the fundamental mechanisms underlying microcurrent-based tactile rendering, including the differences between physical and electrically induced tactile sensations, and the integration of multi-physical stimulation modes such as ultrasonic and mechanical interactions. Research into adaptive rendering techniques, leveraging individual physiological parameters to optimize tactile experiences, will be particularly valuable in creating personalized and contextually responsive feedback systems. Finally, the development and validation of advanced, wearable audio-visual-tactile platforms represent an essential frontier, encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers in neuroscience, material science, computational modelling, and human-computer interaction.</p><p>Advancing along these specific, targeted research trajectories will help virtual tactile technology mature further, ultimately enabling more natural, immersive, and effective human-computer interactions, with substantial implications for both theoretical research and practical innovation in diverse application domains.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec30"><title>Author contributions</title><p>QX: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
