It is a rare autoimmune neuropathy generated by cellular and humoral immune responses. It can present as a chronic progressive, monophasic, or relapsing-remitting form, with proximal and distal muscle weakness that develops for at least two months [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>The diagnosis of CIDP is mainly based on clinical and electrophysiological criteria used by the European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, CIDP can be classified into typical CIDP and atypical variants, such as distal acquired-demyelinating polyneuropathy (DADS), multifocal-acquired demyelinating sensory and motor polyneuropathy (MADSAM), also referred to as Lewis-Sumner syndrome (LSS), and acute-onset CIDP (A-CIDP). However, some patients, such as those with severe early axonal damage, do not fulfill the criteria [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Misdiagnosis in CIDP and inappropriate therapy is still widespread, particularly in those classified as CIDP variants&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In a cross-sectional quantitative survey study performed in the United States, 87% of the respondents declared they needed to become more familiar with the 2021 EFNS/PNS guidelines. Further, variability in treatment approaches existed regarding the dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) used, the length of&#x000a0;IVIg&#x000a0;therapy before determining response, the outcome measures used to determine IVIg response, and the protocol for weaning off therapy&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Given the scarcity of integrative information, this article briefly summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical phenotypes, diagnostic tools, and diagnostic criteria to provide a systematic diagnostic approach to avoid misdiagnosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>A general search on PubMed and Google Scholar was done&#x000a0;using the mesh terms&#x000a0;(CIDP) AND (Typical CIDP)&#x000a0;AND (Atypical CIDP) AND (Diagnosis), including articles from 2018 to 2023. We selected articles written in English and considered only systematic reviews, guidelines, cohort studies, and clinical trials related to adult patients.&#x000a0;</p><p>The results are presented as a narrative review, in accordance with the recommendations of the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guidelines. The thematic analysis of the literature search helped identify several key topics for structuring the review. These topics include the epidemiology of CIDP, which examines the prevalence and demographic distribution of the condition. Another critical area of focus is the clinical phenotypes, which describe how CIDP can manifest among patients. The pathophysiology of CIDP is also discussed, highlighting the immune-mediated mechanisms involved in the disease's progression.</p><p>Diagnostic evaluation is significant in detailing the approaches used to confirm the condition. The supportive diagnosis is further explored, emphasizing the role of additional tests in reinforcing the diagnosis. Lastly, the review covers the treatment of CIDP, describing various therapeutic strategies and their effectiveness.</p><p>Epidemiology</p><p>According to a meta-analysis in 2019, the prevalence of CIDP ranges from 0.67 to 7.7 per 100,000, with different prevalence rates in various geographical regions&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CIDP is most common in men and usually occurs between 40 and 60 years of age; however, it can also affect children&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>More than half of the patients are considered to have a typical variant. Nevertheless, the frequency of presentation of atypical variants differs in the literature. The Italian CIDP database study group analyzed 460 patients with CIDP, and they found that 82% of them had typical CIDP and the remaining 18% had atypical CIDP; the atypical presentations of CIDP included DADS (7%), LSS (4%), pure motor CIDP (4%), and pure sensory CIDP (3.5%). In a Japanese study, 100 patients with CIDP were classified as having typical CIDP (60%); the rest had MADSAM (34%), DADS (5%), or pure sensory CIDP (1%).&#x000a0;</p><p>Crude CIDP incidence rates vary between 0.15 to 10.6 cases per 100,000 person-years&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Clinical phenotypes&#x000a0;</p><p>CIDP diagnosis implies a combination of clinical, electrodiagnostic, and laboratory features that resemble alternative diagnoses and even syndromes that fulfill the criteria for typical CIDP&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].&#x000a0;In general, CIDP results in damage to peripheral nerve myelin, and heavily myelinated fibers are the most susceptible to injury. Patients typically present with numbness, weakness, and sensory ataxia. However, the clinical presentation varies from one patient to another&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p><italic>Typical CIDP</italic>&#x000a0;</p><p>More than half of CIDP patients present with a progressive course of paraesthesia, weakness in the distal limbs, and difficulty walking for more than eight weeks, but can be relapsing-remitting. It is more common in males and can occur at any age, but it is most common&#x000a0;between 40 and 60 years. The clinical examination shows progressive symmetric proximal and distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Treatment response: IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange are effective&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>A-CIDP</p><p>Typical CIDP may present acutely (A-CIDP) in up to 13% of patients, who rapidly progress within four weeks and initially may be diagnosed with Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome&#x000a0;(GBS). A-CIDP patients differentiate from those with GBS because they continue to deteriorate more than eight weeks after the onset or even relapse at least three times after initial improvement. Furthermore, A-CIDP patients can walk independently, are less likely to have facial weakness or respiratory or autonomic nervous system involvement, and are more likely to have sensory signs. It is essential to know that there are no specific clinical features or laboratory tests that can distinguish GBS from A-CIDP in the acute stage of the disease&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Treatment response: The practical treatment possibilities are IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p><italic>Sensory CIDP</italic>&#x000a0;</p><p>Sensory symptoms are predominant, including ataxia, but without weakness and in a polyneuropathic distribution, excluding a length-dependent pattern (included under DADS). Patients can also present neuropathic pain, fatigue, tremor, and facial sensory symptoms. The clinical course can be either relapsing or progressive and, more rarely, monophasic&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].&#x000a0;The 2021 EFNS/PNS criteria subclassify pure sensory CIDP in a subform with normal motor nerve conduction studies (&#x0201c;pure sensory CIDP&#x0201d;) and another with abnormal motor nerve conduction studies (&#x0201c;sensory-predominant CIDP&#x0201d;)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Treatment response:&#x000a0;IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange are effective [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Chronic Immune Sensory Polyradiculopathy (CISP)</p><p>It is not considered part of the CIDP spectrum as per the 2021 EFNS/PNS criteria.&#x000a0;CISP is generally regarded as pure sensory CIDP, with its distinct features being the selective involvement of the preganglionic root, as evidenced by normal sensory nerve conduction studies, increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, and thickened spinal roots at MRI&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Treatment response: IVIg and corticosteroids are effective&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>CISP-Plus</p><p>It is a recently described variant in which the disease extends beyond dorsal roots to involve motor and postganglionic sensory nerve fibers, resulting in mild distal weakness and mild abnormalities in nerve conduction studies. Its symptoms and response to therapy seem very similar to those of CISP&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Although experts traditionally proposed all these rare forms as part of the CIDP spectrum, the 2021 EFNS/PNS criteria only mention&#x000a0;CISP. They specified that it cannot still be considered CIDP as there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is demyelinating or related to sensory CIDP&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Motor CIDP&#x000a0;</p><p>Motor symptoms are predominant, including weakness, cramps, fatigue, and tremors, in a polyneuropathic distribution. Motor cranial nerve palsy could be present&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].&#x000a0;The 2021 EFNS/PNS guidelines subclassifies pure motor CIDP in a subform with normal sensory nerve conduction studies (&#x0201c;pure motor CIDP&#x0201d;) and in another with abnormal sensory nerve conduction studies (&#x0201c;motor-predominant CIDP&#x0201d;)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Treatment response: IVIg is effective; patients' conditions may deteriorate after corticosteroids&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>MADSAM</p><p>The first description of an asymmetric CIDP variant was LSS, a chronic asymmetric sensorimotor neuropathy with focal involvement of individual nerves&#x000a0;with persistent conduction block&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since this first report, multiple other terms have been introduced. However, in the actual guidelines, MADSAM is preferred.</p><p>It usually affects the upper limbs first. Lower limbs may become involved later or sometimes are affected from the onset. Cranial nerves, including oculomotor, trigeminal, facial, vagal, and hypoglossal nerves, are probably more frequently involved than in other CIDP forms&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, it can be presented with sensory symptoms, with or without weakness, in a multifocal distribution. Symptoms may start anywhere in the body&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Treatment response: IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange are adequate, with an overall response rate of 70%. Rituximab could be considered as a second-line agent&#x000a0;in refractory cases&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>DADS</p><p>DADS is defined by a symmetrical presentation of sensory and sensorimotor symptoms starting distally in the lower limbs. There is no proximal limb nor cranial nerve involvement&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].&#x000a0;Patients present with sensory loss in the distal upper and lower limbs and gait instability. Weakness may occur and is usually distally accentuated in the lower more than upper limbs&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other possible symptoms include ataxia, neuropathic pain, cramps, fatigue, autonomic symptoms, and tremors. Upper-limb distal sensory or sensorimotor symptoms and signs may occur&#x000a0;later (at least one year from onset)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>DADS could be divided into idiopathic DADS (DADS-I) and DADS with elevated monoclonal protein (DADS-M). Approximately 50-70% of patients with DADS-M have antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Distal neuropathy with an IgM paraprotein and anti-MAG antibodies, anti-MAG neuropathy, is considered outside the span of CIDP as most of these patients have specific electrodiagnostic and pathologic findings and do not respond to IVIg or corticosteroids.&#x000a0;</p><p>Treatment response: Patients with DADS-I respond similarly (reaching 70-80% response) to conventional treatment with IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange. On the other hand, rituximab is preferred for patients with DADS-M who need hematological follow-up&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>An overview of the phenotypes of typical CIDP and atypical CIDP variants is provided in Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of features of CIDP and its variants</title><p>CIDP, Chronic inflammatory demyelination polyradiculoneuropathy; A-CIDP, acute-onset CIDP; CSF: Cerebrospinal fluid; DADS, Distal acquired demyelinating and symmetric neuropathy; dmL, Distal motor latencies; GBS, Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome; IVIg, Intravenous immunoglobulins, LLS, Lewis-Summer syndrome; MADSAM, Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy; MAG, Myelin-associated glycoprotein; NCV, Nerve conduction velocity; NF155, Neurofascin 155; CNTN1,&#x000a0;Contactin 1 [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CIDP variant</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage of CIDP cases</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical features</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment response</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Electrophysiological hallmarks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Additional information</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1">Typical CIDP</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Typical CIDP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;50%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symmetric proximal and distal weakness, sensory loss, areflexia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange effective</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demyelination</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical nadir reached after eight weeks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A-CIDP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Around 13%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symmetric proximal and distal weakness, sensory loss, areflexia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange effective</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demyelination</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Progress within four weeks. 5% of patients initially diagnosed with GBS are later reclassified as A-CIDP; might resemble patients with NF155 and CNTN1 antibodies</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="6" rowspan="1">Atypical CIDP variants</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sensory CIDP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5-15%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symmetric sensory- predominant presentation, sensory ataxia, generalized hyporeflexia/ areflexia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange effective</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Normal motor NVC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Distinguished from idiopathic sensory polyneuropathy by early ataxia, younger age, early upper extremity symptoms</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Motor CIDP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4-10%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symmetric proximal and distal motor deficits</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IVIg effective; patients&#x02019; condition might deteriorate after corticosteroids</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">May have electrophysiologic evidence of sensory involvement</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Motor CIDP with sensory conduction abnormalities in two nerves is diagnosed as motor-predominant CIDP.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MADSAM</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8-15%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asymmetric distal more than proximal sensory and motor deficits; affects upper more than lower extremities</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange effective</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multifocal distributed sensory and motor symptoms and nerve conduction studies frequently show conduction blocks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Also known as LSS.
