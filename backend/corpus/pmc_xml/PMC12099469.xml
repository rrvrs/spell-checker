This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combined approach compared with CA alone. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 10, 2025. Studies comparing CA plus LAAC with CA alone were included. Of 1,066 identified articles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up duration ranged up to 24 months, with reported CHA&#x02082;DS&#x02082;-VASc scores ranging from 2.2 to 4.3 and HAS-BLED scores from 2.0 to 3.7. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in thromboembolic events between the combined and control groups (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.83, I&#x000b2; = 0%), and no significant difference in arrhythmia recurrence (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84-1.24, I&#x000b2; = 28%). However, the combined approach was associated with a significantly higher risk of procedural complications (RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.01-2.59, I&#x000b2; = 0%). These findings suggest that adding LAAC to CA does not reduce thromboembolic events or arrhythmia recurrence but may increase the risk of procedural complications. Given the predominance of observational studies and limited randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, larger high-quality trials are needed to more definitively assess the role of combined CA and LAAC in AF management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>atrial fibrillation</kwd><kwd>catheter ablation</kwd><kwd>left atrial appendage closure</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>stroke prevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting millions worldwide and contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Its clinical consequences include an increased risk of stroke, systemic embolism, heart failure, and impaired quality of life [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The management of AF is multifaceted, encompassing strategies for rate control, rhythm control, and thromboembolic risk reduction [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among these, catheter ablation (CA) has emerged as a cornerstone in rhythm control for patients with symptomatic AF refractory to or intolerant of antiarrhythmic drugs [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. By targeting ectopic foci and modifying atrial substrate, CA aims to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, thereby improving symptoms and cardiac function [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, despite its efficacy, CA alone does not eliminate the thromboembolic risk associated with AF, particularly in patients with a high CHA&#x02082;DS&#x02082;-VASc score.&#x000a0;</p><p>Simultaneously, percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has gained recognition as a viable alternative for stroke prevention in AF patients who are unsuitable for long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the predominant site of thrombus formation in non-valvular AF, and its occlusion has demonstrated efficacy in reducing stroke risk while mitigating bleeding complications associated with OAC [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Devices such as the Watchman and Amulet have shown promising results in clinical trials and real-world studies, paving the way for LAAC to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Combining CA and LAAC in a single procedural approach represents an innovative strategy to address both rhythm control and stroke prevention in AF patients, particularly those with high thromboembolic and bleeding risks [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The synergistic benefits of this combined approach lie in its potential to achieve arrhythmia suppression through ablation while simultaneously mitigating thromboembolic risk via appendage closure [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This dual therapy approach is especially appealing to patients with complex clinical profiles, including those with contraindications to OAC or recurrent AF after initial ablation [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the integration of CA and LAAC in routine clinical practice raises important questions regarding its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness compared to standalone strategies [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Procedural considerations, such as the timing and sequence of interventions, device selection, and operator expertise, also play a pivotal role in determining outcomes [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, long-term data on stroke prevention, arrhythmia recurrence, and quality of life are essential to substantiate the benefits of this combined approach.&#x000a0;</p><p>This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of CA combined with LAAC in treating AF. By synthesizing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, this analysis seeks to provide evidence-based insights into the clinical utility of this novel strategy, guiding clinicians in optimizing management for AF patients with complex therapeutic needs.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Methodology&#x000a0;</p><p>Literature Search&#x000a0;</p><p>&#x000a0;A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of databases to 10 January 2025. The search strategy was designed to identify studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of CA combined with LAAC in patients with AF. Keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to "catheter ablation," "left atrial appendage closure,"&#x000a0;"atrial fibrillation,"&#x000a0;&#x0201c;combination,&#x0201d;&#x000a0;"stroke prevention," and "thromboembolic risk" were used. No language restrictions were applied. Bibliographies of relevant articles were also screened for additional eligible studies.&#x000a0;</p><p>Study Selection&#x000a0;</p><p>Studies were included if they met the following criteria: RCTs&#x000a0;or observational studies evaluating the combined use of CA and LAAC in adult AF patients; reporting outcomes such as death, thromboembolic events, bleeding events, and peri-procedural complications; and providing sufficient data for extraction. Studies focusing solely on CA or LAAC without combining both interventions were excluded. Studies lacking control or comparison groups were also excluded. Additionally, we excluded reviews, case reports, case series, animal studies, and editorials. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for eligibility, followed by a full-text review for final inclusion. Any disagreement between the two authors was resolved through discussion.</p><p>Data Extraction&#x000a0;</p><p>Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardized form developed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). The form was initially reviewed by two authors before approving it for use. Extracted data included study characteristics (author, year, design, and sample size), patient demographics, and reported outcomes. The outcomes assessed were death, thromboembolic events, bleeding events, and peri-procedural complications. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through discussion or, if necessary, consultation with a third reviewer.</p><p>Quality Assessment&#x000a0;</p><p>The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs&#x000a0;and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Assessment criteria included selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias for RCTs, as well as selection of participants, comparability of study groups, and ascertainment of outcomes for observational studies.&#x000a0;Studies scoring 7-9 stars were considered to have good quality, those with 4-6 stars had a&#x000a0;fair quality, and those scoring &#x02264;3 stars were classified as having a low quality. Quality assessment was performed by two authors. Any disagreements between the two were resolved through discussion.</p><p>Data Analysis&#x000a0;</p><p>Data were synthesized quantitatively using meta-analytic techniques. Pooled estimates of outcomes were calculated using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity among studies. To compare outcomes between the two groups, the risk ratio (RR) was calculated along with 95% CI. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I&#x000b2; statistic, with values &#x0003e;50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were performed based on study design, patient characteristics, and procedural details. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger&#x02019;s test. All statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager version 5.4.1 (Cochrane Collaboration, London, England).</p><p>Results&#x000a0;</p><p>We identified 1,066 articles through online database searching. After removing duplicates, 978 articles were initially screened using their abstract or title based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We removed irrelevant or repetitive records and 28 articles were further screened in details using their full-text. Ultimately, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and included in the meta-analysis.

The findings revealed no significant difference in arrhythmia recurrence between the two groups, but a higher risk of thromboembolic events and procedural complications was observed in the combined CA plus LAAC group compared to the ablation-only group.</p><p>Similarly, the meta-analysis by Junarta et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found no significant differences in the risk of arrhythmia recurrence or stroke/systemic embolism between the two groups. However, their findings on procedural complications differed from ours, as they reported no difference in complication rates. In contrast, a meta-analysis by Wang et al. [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported a higher complication rate in the combined group, consistent with our findings. Differences in study populations, operator experience, and procedural protocols may account for these discrepancies. Notably, the recruited patients in these studies were at moderate to high risk for bleeding events, as indicated by their HAS-BLED scores.</p><p>Our meta-analysis reported that thromboembolic events, including stroke and systemic embolism, were significantly higher in the CA plus LAAC group compared to CA alone. Generally, the stroke risk in patients with AF is significantly greater compared to patients without AF [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One crucial step in preventing thrombosis is anticoagulant therapy. However, certain patients are at high risk for stroke yet are not candidates for long-term anticoagulation. According to the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of AF and the 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines, LAAC is a class IIb recommendation for such patients [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that the addition of LAAC may not reduce&#x000a0;and may even increase&#x000a0;the risk of thromboembolic events compared to CA alone. This finding challenges the presumed protective role of LAAC in patients undergoing ablation, particularly among those eligible for anticoagulation. Importantly, our meta-analysis did not address the discontinuation rates of anticoagulation therapy after the procedure, as none of the included studies reported long-term anticoagulation usage post-procedure. Future studies should investigate whether combining LAAC with CA safely facilitates anticoagulation discontinuation.</p><p>CA has been widely recommended in multiple guidelines as an effective treatment for AF. Recently, several studies explored combining CA with LAAC [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the current meta-analysis, the combined strategy was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events, contrasting with previous findings such as the meta-analysis by Wang et al. [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which found no significant advantage or disadvantage regarding thromboembolic events. Notably, our meta-analysis included two RCTs; one RCT reported no thromboembolic events in either group, while the other did not assess this outcome. Therefore, although our findings raise concerns, they are primarily derived from observational studies and should be interpreted with caution. Larger, high-quality RCTs are urgently needed to fully assess the efficacy of combining CA and LAAC for thromboembolic prevention.</p><p>A prior meta-analysis reported that LAA&#x000a0;isolation could significantly reduce AF recurrence rates [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, our analysis showed no significant difference in arrhythmia recurrence between the combined and ablation-only groups. This discrepancy may be due to the incomplete electrical isolation of the LAA during the LAAC procedure. Evidence from a dual approach combining LAA electrical isolation and CA showed higher freedom from AF at 12 months compared to CA alone (95% vs. 63%, P = 0.036) [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although the study had limitations, including a small sample size and a non-randomized design. None of the studies in our analysis assessed procedural endpoints such as complete LAA isolation, which could explain the lack of effect on arrhythmia recurrence.</p><p>The higher complication rates observed in the CA plus LAAC group may be attributed to the combined procedural complexity [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Performing both procedures concurrently increases procedural duration and technical demands, which could raise the risk of complications like vascular injury, bleeding, or cardiac perforation [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, LAAC involves deploying occlusion devices, which themselves carry risks such as device-related thrombus, embolization, or pericardial effusion [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The specific LAAC device types (e.g., Watchman vs. Amulet) were not stratified in our analysis. Future studies should explore whether device selection affects complication rates and procedural outcomes.</p><p>Additionally, procedural complications could be influenced by patient characteristics (e.g., CHA&#x02082;DS&#x02082;-VASc and HAS-BLED scores) or operator experience. It is plausible that higher-risk patients were selected for the combined procedure, potentially confounding the results. The included studies did not provide subgroup analyses based on procedural volumes or center experience. Outcomes might also improve over time with better operator proficiency and advances in procedural techniques.</p><p>It is also important to note that our findings are primarily based on non-randomized studies, except for two RCTs with limited reporting on thromboembolic outcomes. Therefore, the observed increased risk of thromboembolic events and procedural complications should be considered hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. Larger, well-designed RCTs with long-term follow-up are urgently needed to refine patient selection criteria and better understand the safety and efficacy of combining CA with LAAC in AF management.</p><p>Study Limitations&#x000a0;</p><p>The present study has several limitations. First, the number of included studies was limited, and the majority were observational in nature. The absence of RCTs&#x000a0;makes it challenging to interpret the findings in a generalized context, as observational studies are more prone to biases and confounding factors like selection bias. Second, variations in the CA techniques and the types of occlusion devices used across the included studies may have introduced heterogeneity and potential bias in the results. Additionally, due to the lack of granular data from individual studies, we were unable to perform subgroup analyses to explore the impact of specific factors, such as patient characteristics, procedural variations, or device types, on the outcomes. Finally,&#x000a0;our meta-analysis may be affected by publication bias, as evidenced by the asymmetry in the funnel plots because several studies reported no incident in outcomes potentially due to shorter follow-up duration. These limitations underscore the need for well-designed RCTs and standardized reporting in future research to provide more robust evidence.&#x000a0;</p><p>The findings of this study highlight several important directions for future research. First, the limited number of included studies and the predominance of observational designs emphasize the urgent need for well-designed RCTs&#x000a0;to provide more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of combined CA and LAAC strategies. Second, the variability in ablation techniques and occlusion devices used across studies suggests the importance of standardizing procedural protocols to minimize heterogeneity and bias. Future studies should also focus on reporting granular data to enable subgroup analyses with longer follow-up duration, which could help identify specific patient populations or procedural factors associated with better outcomes.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on our meta-analysis of 11 studies including 38,432 participants, the combination of CA and LAAC showed no significant advantage over CA alone in preventing thromboembolic events or reducing arrhythmia recurrence in AF patients. However, the combined approach was associated with a higher risk of procedural complications. These findings suggest that careful patient selection and risk stratification are essential when considering this dual intervention strategy. Given the limitations of current evidence, primarily derived from observational studies, there is an urgent need for well-designed randomized controlled trials to definitively establish the role of combined CA and LAAC in AF management, particularly focusing on long-term outcomes and specific patient populations who might benefit most from this approach.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Neelum Ali, Anurag Rawat, Syed Ali Ahsan</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Neelum Ali, Anurag Rawat, Sanjay Eda, Abdallah A.
