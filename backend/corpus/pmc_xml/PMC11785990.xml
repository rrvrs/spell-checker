After initial programming, clinicians are tasked with fine-tuning DBS parameters through repeated in-person clinic visits. We aimed to evaluate whether DBS patients achieve clinical benefit more rapidly by incorporating remote internet-based adjustment (RIBA) of stimulation parameters into the continuum of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted a randomized controlled multicenter study (ClinicalTrails.gov NCT05269862) involving patients scheduled for de novo implantation with a DBS System to treat Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease. Eligibility criteria included the ability to incorporate RIBA as part of routine follow-up care. Ninety-six patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using automated allocation, blocked into groups of 4, allocation concealed, and no stratification. After surgery and initial configuration of stimulation parameters, optimization of DBS settings occurred in the clinic alone (IC) or with additional access to RIBA. The primary outcome assessed differences in the average time to achieve a one-point improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change score between groups. Patients, caregivers, and outcome assessors were not blinded to group assignment. Most of the data collection took place in the patient&#x02019;s home environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Access to RIBA reduces the time to symptom improvement, with patients reporting 15.1 days faster clinical benefit (after 39.1 (SD 3.3) days in the RIBA group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) and after 54.2 (SD 3.7) days in the IC group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;48)).

After DBS implantation, the first programming session establishes the therapeutic window for each electrode contact and preliminary therapeutic settings. Subsequent personalization of therapy (by adjusting parameters including contact configuration, pulse width, amplitude, and frequency) can take several weeks through repeated, in-person clinic visits with patients. Clinical symptoms, disease severity, electrode lead placement, and concomitant pharmacological therapy can influence adjustment of stimulation parameters. Once the stimulation parameters are optimized, maintenance visits occur once or twice a year to adjust for disease progression.</p><p id="Par8">The need for frequent travel to optimize DBS poses challenges, particularly for older adults who face mobility challenges, such as walking difficulties and an increased risk of falls, as seen in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD), and the burden on caregivers who accompany patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The scarcity of centers specializing in DBS for movement disorders can lead to long travel times to attend outpatient visits for DBS management. A recent study showed that patients often travel hundreds of kilometers and several hours to receive DBS treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A survey on the availability and accessibility of DBS specialists revealed that more than one-third of patients with PD cannot easily get to a clinic due to long waiting times for an appointment or difficulty scheduling an appointment, and more than one-quarter reported difficulty contacting their clinic for advice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, an analysis of the Medicare claims database has shown that non-white races/ethnicities may be disproportionately affected in accessing DBS therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">In recent decades, telemedicine has emerged as a viable healthcare option that could reduce the burden of travel and improve patients&#x02019; access to care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Despite the introduction of telemedicine into healthcare since the 1990s, its integration into the DBS standard of care has been challenging. Patients with PD report access to telemedicine as a desirable, patient-centered option, and while solutions have been implemented that require the assistance of remote nurses to make physical adjustments to stimulation parameters, these involve costly trade-offs and an overall increase in the burden of care on the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Advances in technology allow clinicians to use telemedicine to remotely adjust DBS parameters for patients, which was first introduced and widely adopted in China during the COVID-19 pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The COVID-19 public health emergency not only disrupted clinical practice, but also clinical trials where data collection is conducted on-site at research facilities. This accelerated the adoption of study designs that use virtual tools, including telemedicine, as well as sensory technologies and wearable devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">The aim of the Remote Optimization, Adjustment and Measurement for DBS (ROAM-DBS) study was to investigate the effect of access to remote internet-based adjustment (RIBA) of stimulation parameters on DBS optimization during the early post-implantation period and to determine the practical utility of remote DBS stimulation parameter adjustment in patients with PD. The study compared two groups: patients who receive stimulation optimization after the initial on-site programming session, either in the clinic alone or with the addition of RIBA.</p><p id="Par11">Patients in the RIBA group report a shorter time to achieve a patient-reported minimal clinically important improvement. Clinically important improvements in quality of life are also reported earlier in the RIBA group.

During the start of the study, there was a delay in obtaining the home monitoring kits for 3 patients.</p><p id="Par15">Patients diagnosed with PD undergoing DBS were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio according to a predefined randomization scheme, blocked into groups of 4, concealed allocation, and no stratification. An independent statistician was responsible for creating the automated randomization schedule and this was blinded from the statistical team conducting the analyses. Assignment of patients to a cohort was not based on characteristics of the patient, or the judgement of the enrolling site personnel. The randomization scheme allocated patients on a first-come, first-served basis, so sites were not guaranteed to receive consecutive randomization entries for their patients. This, in addition to the blocking schedule, prevented the prediction of randomization assignment. After surgery and initial on-site stimulation parameter configuration, the intervention involved adjustment of DBS settings either in-clinic only (IC) or through additional access to the RIBA program. Randomization after the initial programming ensured that there was no bias in the initial programming based on the expected treatment group. No blinding was performed after randomization and patients, caregivers, and clinicians were aware of the assigned treatment arm. All procedures in this study were in accordance with the standard of care of each participating center and the medical necessity for each patient. The design of the investigational PRO applications on the mobile device enabled push notifications timed to the endpoints of the study, allowing for high, on-time response rates.

PGI-C is a 7-point scale depicting a patient&#x02019;s rating of overall improvement. Patients rate their change as 1: very much improved, 2: much improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: much worse, or 7: very much worse. Patients were asked to complete the PGI-C survey within 48&#x02009;hours of the titration session. The predefined primary endpoint entailed assessing the duration until symptom amelioration, quantified by a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of one-point improvement (minimally improved) on the PGI-C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for the primary endpoint included all randomized patients. A per-protocol (PP) analysis included patients who received the treatment (i.e., stimulation optimization format) as randomized. Patients in the RIBA group who did not receive a remote titration session were excluded from PP analysis. Patients in the IC group who received a RIBA session were excluded from PP analysis.</p><p id="Par17">The ROAM-DBS study had about 90% power to detect a 2-week (14 days) time difference between two arms to achieve a one-point improvement in PGI-C with &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 when at least 48 patients participated in the follow-up of 90 days. This was based on a two-sample t-test that allowed for unequal variance at a two-sided significance level of 5%. We assumed that one additional titration session would be required to achieve a one-point improvement in PGI-C score after initial programming. In addition, the mean time between initial programming and the time at which the patient achieved a one-point improvement on the PGI-C scale was estimated as four weeks (28 days) with a standard deviation of four weeks (28 days) for in-clinic only sessions, and one week (7 days) with a standard deviation of one week (7 days) for the group who had access to RIBA. Under these assumptions, the expected effect size Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> between the study groups to achieve a one-point improvement on the PGI-C scale was calculated to be 1.03.

Secondary endpoints included the daily global assessment of symptom severity (Patient Global Impression of Severity; PGI-S).

The safety endpoint of the ROAM-DBS trial was the rate of stimulation optimization-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in the two study arms and was not powered due to the low expected rate of adverse events&#x000a0;(AEs). AEs were considered serious if they resulted in death, chronic disease, hospitalization, life-threatening illness or injury, permanent impairment to a body structure or function, or a medical or surgical intervention to prevent these. Three independent qualified clinicians adjudicated safety events. Clinicians assessed changes in global impression of the patient&#x02019;s symptom severity and improvement relative to the initial programming (Clinician Global Impression of Severity; CGI-S and Clinician Global Impression of Change; CGI-C) after each titration session. Scoring was done in the same way as for PGI-S and PGI-C.</p><p id="Par19">Patients completed the PDQ-39 assessment of their quality of life monthly. While the PGI and CGI are one-dimensional assessments of symptoms, the PDQ-39 provides a multidimensional assessment of the patient&#x02019;s quality of life, providing additional information about the impact of therapy beyond changes in symptoms.

Patients with in-clinic stimulation parameter adjustment after initial programming were asked: &#x0201c;About how long (in hours and minutes) did it take you to have your DBS system programmed in person? This may include travel to and from the clinic, parking, time in the clinic etc.&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;About how far do you travel (in miles or km) to have your DBS system programmed in person?&#x0201d;.

program</title><p id="Par30">After 90 days of DBS therapy, patients from both arms completed a custom survey about the burden of stimulation parameter adjustment and their acceptance of the RIBA program. Patients in the IC group reported traveling an average of 102.5 (SD 158.0) km to attend titration sessions at the clinic. Consequently, the time required to optimize the DBS system (including preparation, travel, and any overnight stays) in person was considerably longer, as patients in the IC group reported 15.2 (SD 39.3) hours to complete the adjustment of stimulation parameters in the clinic. This contrasted with a mean time of 0.8 (SD 1.3) hours to complete stimulation optimization through RIBA, including preparatory activities such as patient controller setup. Regarding the acceptance of RIBA, when asked to rate the statement &#x0201c;I would use the virtual clinic system again&#x0201d;, the mean response score was 1.7 (SD 0.7), which came closest to the answer &#x02018;Agree&#x02019;. A total of 96% of patients responded Strongly Agree or Agree to this question. Similarly, most patients agreed that the virtual clinic system was easy to use; mean response score was 2.0 (SD 0.8). A total of 84% of patients responded Strongly Agree or Agree to this question. Finally, clinicians indicated that remote stimulation parameter adjustment was an adequate substitute for in-clinic stimulation optimization after 88% (44/50) of RIBA sessions, because they were able to complete the necessary steps for analysis and stimulation parameter adjustment. This question was asked after each titration visit conducted remotely and the data were analyzed for clinicians who adjusted stimulation parameters in-clinic and remotely in the study to avoid bias in the responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Duration of RIBA sessions</title><p id="Par31">The mean duration of RIBA sessions in this study was 14&#x02009;minutes and 05 seconds (SD 08&#x02009;minutes and 03 seconds), and the median duration was 11&#x02009;minutes and 37 seconds (range 05&#x000a0;minutes and 01&#x02009;seconds and 40 minutes and 44&#x02009;seconds), for a total of 78 titration sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par32">The number of AEs reported was consistent with the expected rate for DBS (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

Similarly, five SAEs were reported in three patients in the IC group. One patient had an infection requiring Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) replacement, developed acute psychosis, and had reported cardiac dysfunction for which a pacemaker was implanted. The latter event was considered unrelated to the procedure or device. One patient fell shortly after increasing the stimulation amplitude using the patient controller and was taken to the emergency department where he reported feeling dizzy and lightheaded. A CT scan of the brain was unremarkable for cerebral hemorrhage or acute intracranial pathology. One patient was admitted to the hospital with fever symptoms; this patient was not part of the PP cohort because he was not optimized during the study. No AE, serious or non-serious, was reported in association with RIBA. In the IC group, two non-serious AEs were reported in one patient.

Patients with PD treated with DBS achieved MCID in the primary patient-reported outcome more than two weeks earlier when therapy optimization was done through RIBA compared with IC adjustment of stimulation parameters. Both groups had patients who reported no additional improvement after initial programming, although the proportion of patients reporting clinical benefit on PGI-C at 90 days was higher in the RIBA group (92% vs 77%). These findings suggest that the integration of RIBA into the standard of care program for DBS patients reduces the time needed to optimize therapy by facilitating access to care.</p><p id="Par34">Specifically, the RIBA arm received an average of 1.3 additional titration visits after initial programming. Initial programming sessions averaged approximately 1&#x02009;hour but lasted up to 4&#x02009;hours in some patients, consistent with reports in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In our clinical experience, follow-up titration sessions in the clinic last twenty minutes to one hour appointment blocks. RIBA sessions in this study lasted an average of 14&#x02009;minutes. This short duration indicates that, despite a higher number of titration visits, the total patient-clinician interaction time will be comparable to or even less than IC stimulation optimization. Furthermore, an assessment of the total number of titration visits (and associated use of healthcare resource) cannot be made until at least one year after the initial programming. It is conceivable that patients may experience clinical benefit earlier due to improved access to care, but the number of interactions (including maintenance visits) may ultimately be comparable to conventional in-clinic adjustment of stimulation parameters. The additional travel burden associated with in-clinic stimulation optimization was also assessed. Patients (and caregivers) reported traveling an average of 103&#x02009;km (64&#x02009;mi) and 15&#x02009;hours to prepare, travel, and attend titration sessions at the clinic. As with the distance traveled, the total time was highly variable, with the 95% CI ranging from 2.5 to 28&#x02009;hours. Patients who indicated that titration in the clinic took 24&#x02009;hours or more required an overnight hotel stay due to long-distance travel or were patients who required at least one night in the hospital for observation, at the discretion of the investigator. These findings are consistent with previous observations that patients and clinicians experience fewer barriers to scheduling and attending sessions with remote stimulation parameter adjustment, as reflected in both the short duration of RIBA sessions and the patient-reported time burden associated with remote versus in-person visits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">At 30 days after implantation, the percentage of patients and clinicians reporting an improvement of at least one point on the global impression scale was numerically higher in the RIBA group than in the IC group. At this timepoint, the percentage difference between the two groups was even greater in the clinician&#x02019;s assessment of improvement, reaffirming that RIBA leads to faster optimization in DBS patients. This difference remained at 60 and 90 days for patient assessment of improvement but was no longer the case for clinician assessment of improvement at these later timepoints. Previous research across disease states has shown relatively poor agreement between patient and clinician responses when assessing quality of life and disease severity, although to our knowledge no data have been collected for PD or other neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The clinician&#x02019;s evaluation of improvement should be considered complementary to the patient&#x02019;s evaluation.</p><p id="Par36">Two clinically important observations provide additional context to these results. First, although any observed differences between the groups are due to chance, there was a higher proportion of PD patients with a tremor-dominant phenotype in the IC group. Motor symptom scores improve more in tremor-dominant PD patients than an akinetic-rigid phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In-clinic and remotely, tremor is a consistent symptom (compared to bradykinesia or gait) that responds within seconds of a parameter change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Second, the three patients receiving unilateral STN stimulation differed from the overall rate of improvement on PGI-C, with one patient experiencing MCID improvement at the end of the 90-day period (in the IC group) and one patient not improving within 90 days after implantation (in the RIBA group). The three patients who received bilateral GPi stimulation reported time to at least minimal clinical benefit consistent with the overall rate. More patients with these types of stimulation are needed to substantiate these results, as our study is representative of patients receiving bilateral STN stimulation.</p><p id="Par37">In addition to the effects observed on the global impression scales, DBS was associated with a substantial improvement in quality of life, as evidenced by a mean PDQ-39 improvement of approximately 6 to 7 points at 90 days in both groups, which surpasses the clinically relevant change on this scale of 5-points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Consistent with other assessments, patients in the RIBA group reported this improvement in quality of life earlier. Analysis of individual PDQ-39 domains revealed no differences in improvement from baseline between groups, although a trend was noted for the communication domain, which improved more than 5 points more in the RIBA group at 90 days; in line with expected responses to improved access to care for these patients.</p><p id="Par38">The rate of adverse events related to DBS was low in both groups. One serious adverse event related to stimulation or stimulation parameter optimization occurred in the IC group; one patient fell after stimulation adjustment. These findings suggest that RIBA does not carry a risk beyond that of DBS therapy. These results are consistent with the known safety profile of DBS and confirm that serious adverse events in this cohort are generally related to the implantation procedure rather than to stimulation or optimization effects. This is an important finding as there is relatively little experience with remote DBS stimulation parameter adjustment, and concerns about emerging patient risks may influence whether RIBA is used. In addition, significant efforts have been made to protect RIBA sessions and patient data. The remote care platform is configured with multiple layers of security and meets internationally recognized security standards. Full technical details of the security architecture of the remote care platform have been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par39">This study, conducted in patients with advanced PD, was designed as an EMA, a type of research that uses applications on smart devices to send notifications at prespecified intervals to prompt patients to answer questions or questionnaires. EMAs study the thoughts and behavior of patients in their daily lives by repeatedly collecting data in their normal environment and are often more accurate than data collection methods that require patient recall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. EMA and telemedicine applications could also be useful in the assessment and treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders. For example, EMA has led to new insights into the temporal patterns of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, OCD and some forms of depression are associated with agoraphobia, where patients experience anxiety when leaving familiar surroundings or using public transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Digital health tools that can be accessed from home may be an important first step toward better treatment.</p><p id="Par40">Li et al. (2017) compared remote stimulation optimization of DBS with sham stimulation in patients with PD and found remote adjustment of stimulation parameters to be effective, but the study lacked a comparison with an active control of stimulation according to standard in-clinic optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. A retrospective study by Chen and colleagues (2022) compared in-clinic stimulation parameter adjustment, remote adjustment, and a combination of in-clinic and remote adjustment, and found similar results in all arms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Because this study was conducted retrospectively, patients and clinicians were able to choose the most attractive optimization option, which could potentially introduce a bias that limits the generalizability of the results. To our knowledge, our prospective, randomized controlled trial is the first to report level 1 clinical data on the effects of remote adjustment of stimulation parameters in a PD patient population treated with DBS.</p><p id="Par41">Remote monitoring of PD patients is another telemedicine application that has gained interest in recent years. This usually involves smartphone applications that enable remote motor symptoms and cognitive assessments. Two feasibility studies have reported generally high levels of compliance with smart device applications for remote monitoring among PD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. This is consistent with the current study in which we achieved 80% compliance for the PGI-C assessment within 48&#x02009;hours of the titration visit (and greater than 90% compliance when the 48-hour restriction is lifted) and the monthly PDQ-39 assessment. Patients completed on average two-thirds of the daily symptom severity assessment. Non-compliance in Motolese et al.&#x02018;s study was generally related to loss of interest, psychological distress, absence of a caregiver, the presence of falls, and a higher level of clinical disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In both studies, clinicians were able to correlate the remotely collected data with clinical outcomes and individual PD profiles, suggesting their usefulness in daily practice and in combination with other digital health tools such as remote optimization of stimulation, although studies with larger sample size and for longer periods are warranted.</p><p id="Par42">Temporary reimbursement policies were in place for some regions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Centers for Medicaid &#x00026; Medicaid Services (CMS) has classified remote DBS stimulation optimization as a category 3 service that is likely to have a clinical benefit when delivered via telehealth, but there is not yet sufficient evidence to justify permanent coverage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/final-policy-payment-and-quality-provisions-changes-medicare-physician-fee-schedule-calendar-year-1">https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/final-policy-payment-and-quality-provisions-changes-medicare-physician-fee-schedule-calendar-year-1</ext-link>). According to CMS, an example of clinical benefit includes a more rapid beneficial treatment response, which is consistent with the results we present in this study. Barriers to adopting remote care still exist in several countries, including digital literacy, acceptance, and cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in the US, insurance can require a clinician to be licensed to practice medicine in the state where the patient resides, which can be a deterrent to the use of telemedicine. The results presented will hopefully motivate supranational unions, federal states, and individual regions to implement telemedicine-friendly policies, for the benefit of these vulnerable patient populations.</p><p id="Par43">Further work is needed to investigate long-term outcomes beyond the 90 days evaluated in this study. The ROAM-DBS patients will continue in the ADROIT study, which will follow patients for up to 5 years, allowing for long-term evaluation of outcomes and safety with remote optimization of stimulation parameters. In addition, future additional data may complement the findings presented here, including objective digital data from wearables collected during the ROAM-DBS study period. Finally, research is underway to investigate the relationship between factors such as distance to the clinic, access to the internet, patient technical skills, and PROs.</p><p id="Par44">There are limitations worth noting. First, the patients and providers were not blinded. This allowed the study to capture how patients and clinicians adjusted the frequency of adjustments in response to randomization. Although it is possible that patients or clinicians were more highly motivated when they were randomized to the RIBA arm, patients reported on average an additional 14&#x02009;hours to attend the stimulation optimization in the clinic, compared to RIBA sessions performed at home, suggesting that other factors are responsible for the results presented. Second, PD patients undergoing DBS are typically highly motivated and represent a younger, less cognitively impaired PD population. A requirement for inclusion was that the patient had to be able to work with the remote care application (or have a caregiver to support) and have access to a stable and reliable internet connection. These factors limit the generalizability of the results to telemedicine applications within the overall PD population. In contrast, a strength of this study was the inclusion of a substantial number of patients from 17 sites in different geographical locations. Third, while this study evaluated the time patients spent attending the titration sessions, comparable clinician time was not collected. A recent study evaluated over 40 million specialty visits and, of the 24 specialties evaluated, 16 had more in-person follow-up after an office visit than after a telehealth visit, including pain medicine, which uses similar hardware and stimulation optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Further work is needed to determine how the incorporation of remote adjustment of stimulation parameters might affect hospital workflows.</p><p id="Par45">In conclusion, this randomized controlled trial demonstrated that the clinical benefits of DBS were seen earlier in patients receiving internet-based adjustments compared to the current standard of care in-clinic stimulation optimization, with a comparable safety profile. Patients in the RIBA group reported good acceptance of remote adjustment of stimulation parameters and had easier access to their treating clinician, while the total time required for optimization was comparable to in-clinic visits due to the short duration of the sessions. Without the need to travel, the time burden associated with DBS stimulation optimization is considerably reduced. This remotely accessible, scalable digital care intervention could lead to a paradigm shift in DBS care by providing access to care at home and helping to overcome treatment barriers.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Inclusion and ethics</title><p id="Par46">The investigators participating in this study were all experts in movement disorders, balancing gender and geographic region as much as possible. The ROAM-DBS study addressed two of the commonly cited critical barriers to inclusion: logistical resources (time, caretaking responsibilities, and transportation limitations), and a lack of infrastructure in underserved areas. The RIBA program and PROs used in this study were direct ways to increase diversity by eliminating the need to come to the clinic to participate in clinical research. The ROAM-DBS study also enabled deeper penetration into traditionally underserved populations, such as rural or economically disadvantaged communities that may lack traditional clinical research infrastructure. However, internet access is less common in low-income households, especially among older people in poverty, which remained a barrier for more inclusion and diverse patient populations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/263601/Internet_Access_Among_Low_Income.pdf">https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/263601/Internet_Access_Among_Low_Income.pdf</ext-link>). With the further deployment of Edge, 3&#x02009;G, 4&#x02009;G, and 5&#x02009;G networks worldwide, we expect that cellular connections stable (and affordable) enough to enable RIBA will only increase in the future. The results presented can help increase access to care and reduce barriers to inclusion in the real world.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
