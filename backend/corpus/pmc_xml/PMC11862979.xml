Postoperative complications, particularly upper limb lymphedema [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], represent intricate challenges that demand nuanced solutions. Upper limb lymphedema, characterized by arm swelling and discomfort [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], emerges as a significant concern for breast cancer survivors. This complication typically stems from the disruption of the lymphatic system during surgery, particularly when lymph nodes are removed or radiation therapy is administered [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Such interventions, while crucial in treating breast cancer, can impede the normal flow of lymphatic fluid, leading to its accumulation in the arm. Compromised lymphatic drainage results in the characteristic swelling and discomfort associated with upper limb lymphedema. The severity of this condition can vary, and its onset may not be immediate, often manifesting weeks, months, or even years after surgery [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Factors such as the extent of lymph node removal, the type of surgery, and the use of radiation therapy contribute to the risk of developing lymphedema [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Beyond its physical manifestations, lymphedema&#x02019;s potential to impede daily functioning and compromise the overall quality of life underscores the urgency of unravelling its complexities [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The challenges posed by upper limb lymphedema extend far beyond its visible symptoms. Beyond the physical discomfort, this complication can impact the emotional and psychological well-being of breast cancer survivors [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Daily tasks, once taken for granted, may become daunting, and the overall quality of life may be compromised. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of these challenges [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], our research aims to provide a detailed understanding of the factors influencing lymphedema development and the subsequent nuances in its management.</p><p>In the dynamic world of breast cancer care, Jeddah, situated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, stands out as a lively hub [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As this city becomes a central place for breast cancer treatment, it&#x02019;s crucial to thoroughly understand how lymphedema develops and how to manage it. Jeddah&#x02019;s special mix of cultural diversity and healthcare complexities requires a deep exploration to customize interventions effectively. Age, nationality, educational background, and marital status play roles in shaping the varied experiences of breast cancer survivors [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our study, aware of this diversity, aims to uncover how these demographic factors connect with the occurrence and seriousness of upper limb lymphedema.</p><p>We sought data on the participants&#x02019; handedness, the duration since breast cancer onset, and the specific treatments undergone post-surgery, seeking to identify subtle associations that may impact the development and management of lymphedema. Beyond addressing the physical aspects of lymphedema, our goal is to contribute to the development of tailored interventions, educational programs, and support mechanisms that holistically enhance the well-being of individuals navigating the aftermath of breast cancer surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design and setting</p><p>A descriptive quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the level of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) awareness among women in Saudi Arabia. The study took place in King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, a tertiary healthcare center providing comprehensive cancer care.</p><p>Participants and sampling</p><p>Participants were recruited over a three-month period using a convenience sampling method. Inclusion criteria consisted of women aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with breast cancer, who had undergone unilateral breast cancer surgery with lymph node excision at least six months prior to recruitment, completed all chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments, showed no current evidence of cancer, and were able to answer the questionnaire and provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria included male patients, individuals with serious systemic illnesses (e.g., kidney failure, hepatic dysfunction), neurological or psychological impairments, abnormalities or vascular diseases in the upper extremities, bilateral breast cancer due to loss of comparison between the two limbs, and inability to consent or respond.</p><p>Recruitment process</p><p>Eligible participants were identified through hospital medical records and oncology departments. Informed consent was obtained electronically and verbally before participants completed the survey, ensuring voluntary participation. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Biomedical Institutional Review Board of King Abdulaziz University (approval number: HA-02-J-008).</p><p>Study instrument</p><p>Data were collected through a structured electronic questionnaire designed to capture demographic information, medical history, and BCRL awareness. The questionnaire was adapted from a validated Korean study which was provided in English [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The questionnaire was then translated into Arabic for a better understanding. The final version consisted of 23 multiple-choice and yes/no questions divided into four main sections: demographic data (age, education level, occupation, marital status, and dominant hand), medical history (breast cancer diagnosis, treatments received, and current treatment status), BCRL education (prior education and sources of information), and BCRL awareness (knowledge of risk factors, preventive activities, and treatment options).</p><p>To ensure reliability, the questionnaire was pilot-tested with 10 participants to confirm clarity, cultural relevance, and ease of understanding. Necessary adjustments were made before full deployment.</p><p>Ethical considerations</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the King Abdulaziz Biomedical Institution of Review Board and the patients were informed about the study&#x02019;s objectives, the confidentiality of their responses, and their right to withdraw at any time. Informed consent was collected electronically before the survey commenced. All collected data were stored securely and accessed only by the research team.</p><p>Data collection</p><p>The questionnaire was distributed electronically using Google Forms. This platform allowed for efficient data collection, automated response tracking, and anonymity. Data collection took place over a three-month period, ensuring sufficient participant engagement.</p><p>Sample size justification</p><p>The sample size of 76 participants was determined based on prior studies with similar methodologies and findings. Although convenience sampling was used, efforts were made to ensure representation across age groups, education levels, and treatment experiences.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic data, awareness levels, and responses to individual questions. Quantitative data were expressed as frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations (Mean &#x000b1; SD). For inferential analysis, the chi-square test (&#x003c7;2) was applied to assess the association between awareness levels and demographic or clinical variables. A p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Missing data were handled through pairwise deletion to maintain the integrity of the analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that 42.1% of the participants were 41-50 years of age, 63.2% had Saudi nationality and 73.7% were homemakers.

Approximately 38.2% of participants were diagnosed with lymphedema. This underscores the significant prevalence of this complication post-breast cancer surgery, consistent with the study conducted in 2018 [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Encouragingly, a substantial majority of those with lymphedema proactively sought medical advice upon noticing symptoms like redness, swelling, itching, pain, or elevated temperature [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This suggests a positive trend in prompt healthcare-seeking behavior [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>More than half of the participants showed awareness of lymphedema, indicating a reasonable level of general knowledge within the studied population. Regarding upper limb lymphedema, participants displayed varying levels of awareness [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The observation that 52.6% of participants correctly recognized the role of hygiene in infection prevention shows a moderate level of awareness of this crucial aspect [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The heightened awareness regarding the increased risk of injury with any arm damage reflects a commendable understanding of the potential consequences associated with such incidents.</p><p>Furthermore, the substantial knowledge demonstrated by participants about specific risk factors, including the impact of tight shirt pressure and straining the arms, suggests a nuanced understanding of potential triggers for lymphedema [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The recognition of the association between being overweight and an elevated risk of lymphedema by over half of the participants is noteworthy, emphasizing the importance of weight management in lymphedema prevention [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>However, the study also highlights areas for improvement in overall awareness, indicating that there are specific aspects of upper limb lymphedema that may require targeted education. These findings underscore the significance of tailored interventions to enhance general awareness and address specific knowledge gaps identified in the study, ultimately contributing to better preventive practices and management of upper limb lymphedema within the studied population [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The overwhelming majority recognized that lymphedema should be treated, reflecting a positive attitude toward addressing this condition. Around 10.5% believed that lymphedema cannot be treated. This misconception presents an opportunity for targeted education to improve understanding and dispel myths surrounding the manageability of lymphedema [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The study indicates a need for more awareness among participants regarding activities that help reduce the risk of lymphedema. This highlights a crucial area for targeted education, as informed lifestyle choices can play a significant role in mitigating the risk of this post-operative complication [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Approximately half of the participants correctly identified the physical therapy and rehabilitation department to be responsible for treating lymphedema [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests a moderate level of awareness about the appropriate healthcare resources for managing this condition.</p><p>The mean awareness score indicates a moderate overall level of awareness within the study population. While there is room for improvement, it suggests a baseline awareness that can be built upon through targeted educational interventions. Only a small proportion of participants demonstrated a good awareness level about upper limb lymphedema. On the positive side, the majority had a fair awareness level. However, it is concerning that a significant portion had poor awareness. This underscores the need for focused educational efforts to enhance understanding, particularly among individuals with lower awareness scores [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>A significant association was found between a good level of awareness about upper limb lymphedema and participants with a university-level education. This underscores the role of higher education in fostering awareness and suggests that educational interventions may benefit from tailored approaches for individuals with varying educational backgrounds [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>A longer duration since breast cancer onset was significantly correlated with a higher awareness level. This suggests that over time, individuals may gain a deeper understanding of post-operative complications and the importance of lymphedema awareness [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Participants who underwent lymphadenectomy and received chemotherapy or radiation therapy after the operation also demonstrated a significantly higher level of awareness. This could be attributed to increased exposure to healthcare information and heightened awareness due to the nature of their treatment experiences [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Certain limitations should be acknowledged. The cross-sectional nature of our research design restricts our ability to establish causal relationships between demographic factors and awareness levels. The reliance on self-reported data introduces the potential for recall bias, as participants may not accurately recall specific details of their postoperative experiences. Additionally, the study&#x02019;s single-center focus may limit the generalizability of findings to a broader population. The survey&#x02019;s reliance on closed-ended questions may have constrained the depth of responses, potentially overlooking nuanced perspectives that could influence postoperative care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The prevalence of lymphedema, coupled with proactive healthcare-seeking behaviour, underscores the need for targeted educational interventions. While the majority recognized the importance of treatment, awareness gaps persisted, especially regarding risk-reduction activities. This highlights the influence of education and treatment history on awareness levels. These findings emphasize the importance of tailored educational programs to enhance overall awareness, facilitate early intervention, and optimize postoperative outcomes for breast cancer patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Sarah Alyamani and Reem Alghamdi contributed equally to the work and should be considered co-first authors.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
