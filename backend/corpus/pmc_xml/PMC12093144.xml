For this reaction to occur, these sites must be in proximity. Inverted repeat sequences, such as Alu elements, if positioned in the upstream and downstream introns, can base&#x000a0;pair and represent one mechanism for inducing proximity. Here, we investigate the pre-mRNA structure of the human <italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic> gene at exon 2, which forms a circular RNA via backsplicing. We leverage multiple chemical probing approaches, including the recently developed SHAPE-JuMP (selective 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and juxtaposed merged pairs) strategy, to characterize secondary and tertiary interactions in the pre-mRNA that govern backsplicing. Our data confirm that the antisense Alu elements AluSz(&#x02212;) and AluSq2(+), in the upstream and downstream introns, form a highly&#x000a0;paired interaction. Circularization requires formation of long-range Alu-mediated base pairs but does not require the full-length AluSq2(+). In addition to confirming long-range base pairs, our SHAPE-JuMP data identified multiple long-range interactions between non-pairing nucleotides. Genome-wide analysis of inverted repeats flanking circular RNAs confirms that the presence of these elements favors circularization, but with modest predictive power. Together, our study suggests that secondary structure considerations alone do not fully explain backsplicing and that additional interactions are involved.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p>

Backsplicing is a spliceosome-catalyzed process where a downstream splice donor (5&#x02032; splice site) is linked to an upstream splice acceptor (3&#x02032; splice site), covalently joining together one or more exons in a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; phosphodiester linkage to form a circle [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CircRNAs are often flanked by intronic inverted repeats, which have been proposed to drive backsplicing based on inter-intron RNA base&#x000a0;pairing via sequence complementarity [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Inverted repeats were first implicated in backsplicing over 30 years ago in a circRNA from the mouse <italic toggle="yes">Sry</italic> gene [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In humans, 88% of circRNAs are flanked by intronic Alu elements [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Alu elements are non-autonomous retrotransposons that comprise &#x0223c;10% of the human genome [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although Alu elements can be categorized into distinct familial lineages, the sequence similarity between any two Alu elements is typically&#x000a0;&#x0003e;80% [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The high degree of sequence similarity between Alu elements leads to a high degree of complementarity between inverted repeat Alu elements, which can base pair to form double-stranded RNA as evidenced by high degrees of ADAR editing in inverted repeat Alu elements in close genomic proximity [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The long-range Alu&#x02013;Alu interaction induced by a novel Alu insertion has been proposed to cause an exon-skipping event responsible for tail loss during the evolution of humans [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Others have also shown that novel Alu insertions can alter splicing and potentially cause disease through mis-splicing [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A leading hypothetical mechanism for backsplicing is that sense and antisense Alu elements, as inverted repeats, form inter-intronic structure across exons and drive backsplicing via sequence complementarity and long-range RNA structure that bring splice sites into proximity in three-dimensional space [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The human homeodomain interacting protein kinase 3 (<italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic>) gene produces a single-exon circRNA from exon 2 that has been previously studied to decipher the sequence components required for backsplicing [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The <italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic> exon 2 circRNA is flanked by intronic sense and antisense Alu elements, AluSz(&#x02212;) and AluSq2(+), which are essential for backsplicing [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, regional deletions within these Alu elements can either ablate or retain backsplicing, suggesting that some portions of the Alu elements are essential for backsplicing whereas others are dispensable [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, when applying <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> energy minimization to predict Alu element structures, the thermodynamic stability of the truncated hairpin is not predictive of backsplicing, suggesting that multiple structural conformations or more complex structural interactions beyond simple base&#x000a0;pairing enable backsplicing [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Distance requirements for backsplicing suggest that&#x000a0;there may be complex interactions at play. For example, moving the downstream AluSq2(+) up to 1500 nucleotides away from the exon does not affect backsplicing, whereas moving the upstream AluSz(&#x02212;) only 500 nucleotides away from the exon ablates backsplicing [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, based on sequence and predicted base-pairing considerations alone, it is difficult to predict whether&#x000a0;a given set of Alu elements will favor backsplicing. Furthermore, certain RNA binding proteins, such as ADAR and DHX9, specifically act on long double-stranded RNAs, such as paired inverted repeat Alu elements, and regulate backsplicing by targeting these structures [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One aspect of pre-mRNA that remains understudied is its structure, and here we leverage novel chemical probing approaches to investigate the secondary and tertiary structures of the <italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic> pre-mRNA.</p><p>The size of human pre-mRNAs, where median intron lengths are over 1400 nucleotides [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], makes structural studies challenging. Chemical structure probing coupled with next-generation sequencing is one approach that can routinely probe structures of large RNAs [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, most chemical structure probing techniques detect whether a nucleotide is paired [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but do not directly identify the pairing partner. SHAPE-JuMP (selective 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and juxtaposed merged pairs) leverages a highly processive reverse transcriptase coupled with a bivalent cross-linking reagent to identify paired and proximal nucleotides [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Here we leverage this strategy, coupled with conventional per-nucleotide chemical probing, to understand the structural determinants of backsplicing in the <italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic> circRNA. Integration of these data supports a complex structural model in which noncanonical base-pairing interactions in the pre-mRNA are as important in favoring backsplicing as inverted repeat base&#x000a0;pairing. Taken together, our data begin to reveal unexplored three-dimensional features of pre-mRNA structure and its role in regulating splicing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Construct design</title><p>HIPK3 constructs were initially designed based on [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

To directly measure the Alu&#x02013;Alu interaction, we used SHAPE-JuMP [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]&#x000a0;to obtain nucleotide resolution information on long-range interactions in the WT, &#x00394;157AluSq2(+), &#x00394;189AluSq2(+), &#x00394;AluSz(&#x02212;), and &#x00394;AluSq2(+) constructs. In SHAPE-JuMP experiments, a chemical cross-linker&#x000a0;(here, a psoralen cross-linker) covalently links nucleotides that are in close three-dimensional proximity. The cross-links are then &#x0201c;read&#x0201d; using a highly processive reverse transcriptase that &#x0201c;jumps&#x0201d; across the cross-links, recording the cross-linked interaction as a deletion. The resulting cDNA is sequenced and deletion rates for specific nucleotide pairs are counted by massively parallel sequencing [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We used an amplicon-based strategy to capture long-range interactions using short-read sequencing and to specifically capture inter-intron jumps.</p><p>We first evaluated the cumulative ranked distribution of observed reverse transcriptase jump frequency (deletions normalized to read depth) for the five probed constructs (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The highest jump frequency is observed for the WT and &#x00394;157AluSq2(+). The &#x00394;189AluSq2(+) construct has an intermediate level of jumps, whereas both &#x00394;AluSq2(+) and &#x00394;AluSz(&#x02212;) have very few jumps that are comparable to background noise. The jump frequency for each construct is consistent with its circularization efficiency, suggesting that the structures detected by -JuMP are important for circularization. We performed -JuMP experiments with circularizing constructs in replicate (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;S10</xref>); in subsequent analyses, both replicates have been combined into a single dataset.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>JuMP, SHAPE, and DMS data are in agreement.

Several important features of the SHAPE and DMS informed structural models for the WT construct are clear when superimposed and colored by pairing probability (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Most of the structures observed (dots representing base pairs) are short-range local structures, as indicated by their positions near the top of the graph. Among these small local structures, there is some variance between structures that are SHAPE-supported, DMS-supported, or both. However, almost all the dots representing the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) interaction are black (near the bottom point of the triangle diagram), confirming that the SHAPE and DMS informed base-pairing probabilities are both in agreement and very high (&#x0223c;1.0) (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, enlarged in Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We observe no alternative base paring in either the SHAPE or DMS informed structures in proximity to the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) pairs (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Importantly, there are no long-range base-pairing interactions connecting the splice sites or near where the ends of the exon would come together for backsplicing (the tip of the orange triangle), suggesting that base pairing near the backsplice junction is not occurring; instead, the only predicted long-range base pairing is the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>JuMP data of circularizing constructs mapped to WT coordinates show broad structural agreement.

The most prominent jumps are observed at both ends of the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) hairpin (labeled as J2 and J3) in the WT construct (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These experiments exhibit very few inter-Alu cross-link jumps inside the hairpin; most jumps are concentrated in non-paired regions (J1) and at the very ends of the paired region (J2 and J3) (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). These observations are consistent with the ability of SHAPE-JuMP to detect both secondary structures and tertiary (non-base-pairing) interactions [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The detection of jumps at both ends of the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) hairpin provides direct evidence for the existence of this long-range interaction.</p><p>When comparing the three constructs that circularize [WT, &#x00394;157AluSq2(+), and &#x00394;189AluSq2(+)]&#x000a0;by mapping the deletion mutants to WT coordinates, there is a consistent pattern of jumps that directly detect and further support the existence of the Alu&#x02013;Alu hairpin (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). All three structures show nearly identical JuMP interactions that directly indicate Alu&#x02013;Alu pairing (J3) (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The construct with the shortest Alu&#x02013;Alu interaction [&#x00394;189AluSq2(+)]&#x000a0;shows the most internal Alu&#x02013;Alu hairpin jumps (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), suggesting that the lack of inter-Alu jumps deep in the Alu&#x02013;Alu hairpin in the WT construct is likely due to the extremely high level of cross-linking and significant base pairing of two full-length inverted Alu elements, as these factors limit the processivity of the reverse transcriptase resulting in fewer sequencing reads deep into the hairpin.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Maximum expected accuracy secondary structure diagrams of the Alu&#x02013;Alu interaction of WT, &#x00394;157AluSq2(+), and &#x00394;189AluSq2(+) constructs.

Specifically, there is a very similar pattern of density at the bottom of the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) for all three constructs (J3) extending beyond the hairpin and representing the areas nearest the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the constructs (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). All three also show a similar pattern of jumps on the exon-proximal side of the Alu elements (J1) (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These regions lack sequence complementarity and are not predicted to be paired in any of the structure models, suggesting the cross-link jumps are reporting three-dimensional spatial proximity in these regions.</p><p>The same data can also be visualized on more traditional secondary structure diagram models of each circularizing construct [WT, &#x00394;157AluSq2(+), and &#x00394;189AluSq2(+)]&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These secondary structure diagrams reveal the extent to which many of the observed jumps are not between canonically base-paired regions. Interestingly, despite the removal of 157 nucleotides in AluSq2(+), the J2 interaction at the exon-proximal end of the Alu elements is maintained across WT and &#x00394;157AluSq2(+). The removal of an additional 32 nucleotides in &#x00394;189AluSq2(+) abolishes this J2 interaction;&#x000a0;however, -JuMP still detects the base pairing at both ends of the truncated AluSq2(+) in &#x00394;189AluSq2(+) (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In effect, the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) hairpin brings into close three-dimensional proximity two intronic regions (J1 and J3) causing them to interact spatially. These interactions are preserved across all three circularizing constructs [WT, &#x00394;157AluSq2(+), and &#x00394;189AluSq2(+)]. Thus, our data suggest that the ability of inverted repeats to lock two introns together is spatially orienting the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites, which facilitates backsplicing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inverted repeats like the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) interaction in <italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic> exon 2 appear to form highly stable, fully paired interactions, even though they are over 2000 nucleotides apart. In our study, these long-range interactions are directly supported by extensive chemical probing data. These extended pairing interactions, in turn, create sufficient proximity between intronic structured elements that they are detectable by chemical cross-linking and SHAPE-JuMP. This spatial proximity is sufficient to facilitate backsplicing. This work represents the first direct experimental detection and structural description of a long-range Alu&#x02013;Alu interaction at single-nucleotide resolution.</p><p>As implemented in this study, SHAPE-JuMP utilizes gene-specific reverse transcription followed by a targeted amplicon-sequencing approach, which limits detection to sites that are suspected to interact <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic>. Here, we used our knowledge of the well-studied HIPK3 system to design a priming strategy that targeted these regions and produced amplicon products that are of an appropriate size for short-read Illumina sequencing. This is a key step because SHAPE-JuMP creates a deletion where the RNA is cross-linked, which affects the size of the amplicon. Future development of the SHAPE-JuMP approach could support in-cell cross-linking followed by -JuMP reverse transcription, opening the door for improved sequencing strategies that would allow for transcriptome-wide analysis of long-range through-space RNA structure. Such development would enable the evaluation of the potential regulatory roles of Alu&#x02013;Alu interactions in determining splicing outcomes, including alternative splicing and backsplicing. Targeted priming in Alu-rich regions in pre-mRNA is still a significant challenge,&#x000a0;however, due to the sequence complexity of and around Alu repeats, coupled with the low cellular abundance of pre-mRNA.</p><p>Previous studies using reporter systems analogous to the one used here have found that overexpression can generate various unexpected trans-spliced RNAs [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our splicing assays, we do not observe off-target splicing (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S8B</xref>). Furthermore, our SHAPE-JuMP experiments were performed on IVT&#x000a0;RNAs that were verified to be a single product by gel electrophoresis. The very low abundance of pre-mRNAs in cells would not allow us to perform these experiments on endogenous systems. We cannot exclude that some of our findings will not precisely recapitulate endogenous structures. However, given the high thermodynamic stability of inverted repeat Alu&#x02013;Alu interactions, it is likely that the structures measured here are present in the endogenous pre-mRNA.</p><p>Splicing and backsplicing are governed by the same splicing code, which primarily consists of short sequence motifs. As in linear splicing, backsplicing requires the essential splice site sequence motifs [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Notably, backsplicing can be extensively regulated by splicing regulatory elements (SREs), as is linear splicing; however, the effects of the same SREs on backsplicing are variable and sometimes even opposite that of linear splicing [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. RNA secondary structure also contributes to splicing [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, a combination of both key sequence motifs and local RNA structure is a stronger prediction of alternative splicing outcomes than either factor alone [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here, we describe long-range tertiary structural interactions and extensive Alu&#x02013;Alu base pairing that could potentially increase the initial efficiency of spliceosome formation around the initial exon definition step and thereby facilitate backsplicing [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with a complex, three-dimensional RNA structure scaffold that can influence spliceosome assembly [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42&#x02013;44</xref>]. Overall, our results emphasize that the Alu&#x02013;Alu interactions notably enhance backsplicing, but do not directly speak to the effects of other splicing factors. Future work could further examine how the structural modulation of the pre-mRNA can influence outcomes of linear versus backsplicing.</p><p>In this work, we experimentally explored the pre-mRNA structures that facilitate backsplicing in the <italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic> exon 2 circRNA. Minimized Alu elements of the HIPK3 system as short as 31 nucleotides for AluSz(&#x02212;) and 141 nucleotides for AluSq2(+) are sufficient for circularization [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Here, we explored the RNA structure in the WT&#x000a0;Alu context of the HIPK3 pre-mRNA, as well as truncations of AluSq2(+) modeled after previous studies [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, instead of minimizing both the Alu elements, we maintained the native upstream AluSz(&#x02212;) to better mimic the natural system. Truncating AluSq2(+) to its minimized 141-nucleotide length [&#x00394;157AluSq2(+)] and beyond [109 nucleotides in &#x00394;189AluSq2(+)] still permitted circularization when paired with its full-length AluSz(&#x02212;) partner and maintained both Alu&#x02013;Alu interactions and&#x000a0;complex tertiary interactions beyond the Alu elements. We coupled this experimental work with genome-wide analyses that further support a complex, and likely structural, explanation of backsplicing beyond inverted sequence complementarity. Genomic analyses suggested that the presence of exon-flanking inverted repeat Alu elements is only modestly predictive of exon circularization, as the log-likelihood of circularization is only marginally larger for exons flanked by inverted repeats versus not (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Furthermore, the length of the predicted Alu&#x02013;Alu interaction is insufficient to identify those exons capable of circularizing (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Combined with the structural data presented here, the presence and length of inverted repeat Alu elements are not strong predictive features of circularization alone. Our experimental data reveal a more complex induced proximity that is conserved in all circularizing constructs.</p><p>Although this work focuses on RNA structure as a contributing factor to backsplicing, there are other factors that could contribute or interact with RNA structure and remain unexplored. For example, inverted repeat Alu elements around circularizing exons that are predicted to pair have been shown to have higher frequencies of ADAR editing; however, knocking out ADAR1 and ADAR2 proteins has been shown to increase backsplicing, suggesting that ADAR editing functions to limit backsplicing [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, DHX9 specifically binds to inverted repeat Alu elements and represses backsplicing [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ADAR editing and DHX9 act to recognize long double-stranded RNA structure, features we did not examine in our experimental system.</p><p>The structures of inverted repeats present a unique challenge in structure prediction. Inverted repeat Alu elements are highly complementary and are predicted by traditional thermodynamic modeling to form large hairpins even when separated by long stretches of sequence. In the WT&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">HIPK3</italic> construct, the AluSz(&#x02212;)/AluSq2(+) interaction occurs in the minimum free energy structure and has 100% base-pairing probability in the Boltzmann suboptimal ensemble. The high degree of complementarity drives an enormous thermodynamic favorability that disfavors the possibility of alternative (plausible) structures, even if there are large distances between inverted repeats.</p><p>Alu elements comprise &#x0223c;10% of the human genome [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; nonetheless, the abundance of repetitive sequences in the human genome has only recently been characterized fully, as part of the telomere to telomere&#x000a0;genome [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Given that a majority of the genome is also transcribed, the potential for inverted repeat base pairing in the transcriptome is enormous. These inverted repeat interactions have the potential to bring diverse RNA sequences, nominally kilobases apart in primary sequence, into physical proximity. Determining the specificity with which two inverted repeats form a long-range interaction is challenging for repetitive sequences. In our experiments, we leveraged the unique ability of the JuMP-RT, coupled with specific priming outside of the repetitive sequences, to directly measure this interaction. Our experiments also revealed persistent non-base-pairing interactions outside complementary Alu sequence regions. These data suggest that noncanonical through-space interactions in a pre-mRNA may be common and imply that secondary structure considerations alone are insufficient to understand, or ultimately predict, specific aspects of splicing regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>gkaf433_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="gkaf433_supplemental_files.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank William F.
