However, its inherent instability renders it susceptible to degradation. Given the imperative for RNA integrity in such applications, proper storage and biobanking of blood samples and successful subsequent RNA isolation is essential to guarantee optimal integrity for downstream analyses. Especially for larger collections, it would be particularly beneficial if these methods would additionally offer affordability, minimal blood volume requirements and also long-term storage. In this study, RNA of high quality, suitable for transcriptomics, has been successfully isolated from 400&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of EDTA and citrated whole blood samples in Boom&#x02019;s lysis buffer stored at &#x02212;85 &#x000b0;C for 10 years. Isolation was carried out using a modified Zymo Research Quick-RNA kit protocol. This isolation method showed significant improvement in RNA integrity when compared to RNA extracted using the original Boom method. RNA Sequencing provided high-quality data comparable to that of other studies using recently frozen blood in RNA stabilisation tubes. Additionally, sequencing data from blood collected in citrate and EDTA anticoagulants also showed excellent correlation.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-80287-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Biobanking</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>Multi-omics</kwd><kwd>RNA isolation</kwd><kwd>Long-term storage</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>Biological techniques</kwd><kwd>Gene expression analysis</kwd><kwd>Isolation, separation and purification</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001867</institution-id><institution>Malta Council for Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R&#x00026;I-2008-006</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a fundamental molecule involved in protein synthesis, gene regulation and cellular functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which serves as a cornerstone for various techniques aimed at unravelling biological complexities, in both diagnostic and research settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

At the heart of this multidimensional approach lies transcriptomics, which occupies a central position in deciphering the intricate interplay between genes, transcripts and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Maintaining quality is especially important when considering RNA&#x02019;s innate susceptibility to degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Degraded RNA leads to skewed results, false positives, and compromised data integrity, hindering the interpretation of experimental findings and undermining the validity of downstream analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, meticulous attention to RNA quality control measures, from sample collection and preservation to RNA isolation, is paramount, especially for large sample collections and long-term storage scenarios.</p><p id="Par19">The scope of our article is to provide a protocol for RNA isolation, which has been validated for long-term RNA storage and has shown success even for RNA sequencing applications. By focusing on this isolation protocol, we aim to provide researchers with a well-tested method for reliable RNA preservation over extended periods, as there is a growing demand for such protocols in the field. Other recently published protocols, like that of Nguyen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, have demonstrated effective RNA extraction from frozen EDTA blood; however, their protocol was limited to blood samples stored for only 2&#x02013;3 months.</p><p id="Par20">In this study, RNA was isolated from 400 &#x000b5;L of whole blood in Boom&#x02019;s lysis buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> that was frozen at &#x02212;85 &#x000b0;C for 10 years. The resulting RNA yield and RIN were suitable for RNA-Seq library preparation, which usually require at least 500 ng and RIN&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7. Besides preserving RNA for many years, this method is also cost-effective and suitable for large collections. One of the primary drawbacks associated with RNA stabilisation tubes is their considerable cost. While these tubes offer the advantage of preserving RNA integrity during sample collection and storage, their procurement can inflate the overall expenses of research projects during the initial research subject recruitment phase, particularly when dealing with large sample sizes or long-term studies. RNA stabilisation tubes also require a specific draw volume, which is usually a relatively large sample volume of at least 2.5 mL. The volume of 400 &#x000b5;L of whole blood used as a starting material in this study makes the protocol feasible for multi-omic studies where many different sample types are required from the same blood sampling, as well as for studies with limited sample availability.</p><p id="Par21">RNA from a total of 400 &#x000b5;L of citrated and EDTA whole blood in Boom&#x02019;s lysis buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> was isolated using two different protocols: the Boom RNA isolation method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and a modified protocol of the Zymo Research Quick-RNA Whole Blood kit. The Boom method is based on the principle of adsorption of nucleic acids onto silica particles in the presence of high concentrations of chaotropic salts. Following binding, the nucleic acids are washed to remove contaminants, and then eluted in a low-salt buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This method gave good RNA yield but very poor RNA integrity, indicating RNA degradation during the isolation process which might be caused by the large amount of vortexing in the protocol. This protocol also does not include a deoxyribonuclease DNase step, which resulted in the presence of contaminating DNA in the final elution. The Boom method was noted to be quite labour-intensive and time-consuming, and provided limited scalability when compared to silica-based kits such as the Quick-RNA Whole Blood kit.</p><p id="Par22">A high yield of RNA with excellent integrity that was suitable for RNA-Seq was extracted from both citrated and EDTA whole blood using the modified Zymo Research Quick-RNA kit protocol. The modifications that we applied included the addition of several centrifugation steps aiming to optimise the isolation protocol to increase RNA yield. An initial centrifugation step aided sample flow through the silica filter via a vacuum manifold by pelleting any cell debris. Recovery and elution centrifugation steps were also doubled to maximise the RNA yield. The RNA isolation kit protocol also offers several advantages over traditional RNA isolation methods including convenience, consistency and scalability, making it suitable for high-throughput applications. The method allows for the possibility of a DNase step which we included to eliminate DNA contamination. It is of note that this RNA isolation protocol requires that samples are stored in Boom&#x02019;s lysis buffer.</p><p id="Par23">The median gene expression from RNA isolated using the modified kit protocol was found to be comparable to that obtained from whole blood samples from the Kopp study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which were stored in RNA stabilisation tubes and frozen for up to two years. This finding is indicative of the robustness and long-term stability of the RNA samples obtained through the modified kit protocol, affirming its suitability for preserving RNA integrity for at least one decade. Moreover, it highlights the feasibility of utilising this protocol as a cost-effective alternative to RNA stabilisation tubes for long-term storage of RNA samples without compromising sample or data quality in downstream analyses.</p><p id="Par24">An excellent correlation was also observed in the median gene expression of RNA isolated from citrated and EDTA whole blood. This correlation likely stems from the meticulous management of preanalytical variables, notably the immediate pipetting of blood into Boom&#x02019;s lysis buffer at the phlebotomy location and subsequent freezing at &#x02212;85 &#x000b0;C within one hour of sample collection. This robust correlation underscores the importance of stringent sample handling procedures in preserving RNA integrity and minimising variations introduced during sample processing. Additionally, it further validates the reliability and reproducibility of the standardised experimental protocol employed, affirming its suitability for accurate gene expression analyses across different sample types and conditions. Furthermore, multiple researchers in our lab have successfully utilised this protocol for RNA isolation and high throughput RNA sequencing of another 972 samples throughout a span of a year.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, this protocol for long-term whole blood storage, coupled with the successful isolation of high-quality RNA after a decade, represents a significant advancement in biobanking. The ability to preserve RNA integrity over extended periods opens doors to new possibilities in longitudinal studies, transcriptomics, biobanking, and clinical applications, where sample stability is paramount. The consistently excellent quality of the isolated RNA underscores the robustness and reliability of this protocol, ultimately advancing our understanding of biological systems and facilitating the translation of research findings into clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par26">All samples used were collected as part of the Maltese Acute Myocardial Infarction (MAMI) study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Written informed consent was obtained from all research participants involved in this study. The study was carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations approved by the University of Malta Research Ethics Committee (UREC Ref No MD 32/2010, FHS031/2014, Ref No 15062020 5549 6231).</p><p id="Par27">Several aliquots were prepared by adding 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of EDTA or citrated whole blood to pre-pipetted 900&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of Boom&#x02019;s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> lysis buffer (120&#x000a0;g guanidine thiocyanate, 100 mL Tris hydrochloride, 22&#x000a0;mL 0.2&#x000a0;M EDTA pH 8.0, 2.6&#x000a0;g Triton-X-100) in Micronic tubes with TPE push caps and mixed by inversion on-site immediately after phlebotomy. The tubes were labelled with cryogenic labels. Whole blood aliquots in lysis buffer were transported to the laboratory in portable coolers pre-chilled at at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C and frozen at &#x02212;85 &#x000b0;C in Micronic racks within 1&#x000a0;h of blood collection.</p><p id="Par28">Isolation of RNA was carried out ten years later from four pooled aliquots of whole blood and lysis buffer using two different silica-based methods: the original Boom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> method and the Quick-RNA Whole Blood kit (Zymo Research), both with modifications. The original Boom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> method was modified slightly based on previous work to include an extra 70% ethanol wash. Furthermore, a volume of 33 &#x000b5;L, instead of 40 &#x000b5;L, of silica suspension was used, and DNA was eluted in nuclease free water instead of low salt buffer. The Quick-RNA Whole Blood kit protocol was modified by including (1) an initial centrifugation step to pellet any cell debris which may hinder the passage of the large sample volume through the silica filter, (2) double recovery, and (3) double elution centrifugation steps to maximise the RNA yield.</p><p id="Par29">The modified Quick-RNA Whole Blood kit protocol is summarised in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and a detailed description is as follows. A volume of 4 mL of DNA/RNA Shield&#x02122; and 160 &#x000b5;L of Proteinase K were added to four pooled thawed aliquots of blood in lysis buffer in a 50 mL sterile and RNase-free tube, and incubated at room temperature for 30&#x000a0;min. An initial centrifugation step was added to the kit protocol, whereby the mixture was centrifuged at 3000&#x000a0;rpm for 10&#x000a0;min. A volume of 8 mL of isopropanol was then added to the supernatant and mixed by vortexing. The mixture was then passed through a Zymo-Spin&#x02122; IIICG Column by the use of a vacuum pump and manifold. The column was placed on a collection tube and centrifuged at 16,000&#x000a0;g for 30&#x000a0;s at room temperature. All centrifugations after this step were carried out at this speed and for this amount of time. The protocol was modified slightly by including double recovery of the RNA. To elute the RNA from the column, 100 &#x000b5;L Recovery Buffer was added and the column centrifuged with the eluent recovered in a tube. This step was then repeated with another 100 &#x000b5;L Recovery Buffer which eluted into the same tube. An equal volume (200 &#x000b5;L) of absolute ethanol was added to the eluent. The RNA solution was then passed through the Zymo-Spin&#x02122; IC Column by centrifugation. The column was incubated with 40 &#x000b5;L of the kit DNase I mixture at room temperature for 15&#x000a0;min. A volume of 400 &#x000b5;L of RNA Prep Buffer was added followed by centrifugation. The flow-through was discarded and two washes were conducted, one with 700 &#x000b5;L of RNA Wash Buffer, and the second with 400 &#x000b5;L RNA Wash buffer, both followed by centrifugation and discarding of the flow-through. The column was transferred to a clean 1.5&#x000a0;mL tube. To improve RNA recovery, the single elution step was increased to two elutions in which 12 &#x000b5;L of nuclease-free water were added to the column which was then centrifuged. This step was repeated with another 12 &#x000b5;L water which was collected in the same 1.5&#x000a0;mL sterile and RNase free snap-lock tube. The tube was mixed by gentle flicking. A 2.5 &#x000b5;L aliquot was placed in a fresh 1.5 mL RNase-free tube for assessment of RNA quantity and quality which was carried out on 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L aliquots using Qubit&#x02122; RNA Broad Range kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA ScreenTape kit (Agilent) respectively. This tube and the rest of the RNA were immediately frozen and kept at &#x02212;85 &#x000b0;C until use.</p><p id="Par30">
