Each type of aneurysm has&#x000a0;associated epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic protocols, management strategies, and prognoses. Optimization of clinical outcomes requires an in-depth understanding of each of these factors for a given aneurysm type, in combination with a tailored approach for each patient. This review will encompass six different types of intracranial aneurysms: saccular, fusiform, dissecting, mycotic, marantic and blister aneurysms. The clinical presentation of each aneurysm type varies based on its underlying etiology as well as its rupture status, and may range from asymptomatic to hemorrhage. Diagnostic tools generally include imaging with some combination of computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography, in addition to investigations appropriate for the underlying cause. Management consists of a combination of medical and possible surgical interventions tailored to the unique characteristics of each aneurysm and patient. Lastly, prognosis varies widely and is dependent upon a number of factors, including but not limited to aneurysm type, rupture status, intervention modality, development of complications, and patient demographics and comorbidities. While abundant literature on the more common cerebral aneurysmal types of saccular, fusiform, and mycotic exists, little is available on the remaining three. Additionally, the six subtypes have rarely been summarized together in one review paper with succinct differentiations and comparisons. Having an in-depth understanding of each cerebral aneurysm type, their similarities and differences, and the interplay of patient specific factors will help guide medical and surgical intervention and allow providers to more accurately disseminate patient prognosis. We aim to summarize the current literature on cerebral aneurysms in order to inform clinical decision making and optimize patient outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>aneurysm</kwd><kwd>cerebral aneurysm</kwd><kwd>cerebral berry aneurysm</kwd><kwd>cerebral blister aneurysm</kwd><kwd>cerebral fusiform aneurysm</kwd><kwd>cerebral marantic aneurysm</kwd><kwd>cerebral mycotic aneurysm</kwd><kwd>cerebral saccular aneurysm</kwd><kwd>dissecting cerebral aneurysm</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>Intracranial aneurysms develop from a&#x000a0;weakened segment of a cerebral vessel wall resulting in abnormal focal dilation [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are present in an estimated 3.6% to 6% of the general population, with a rupture rate of approximately 0.01% annually [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Individuals who have&#x000a0;two or more relatives with brain aneurysms have a higher incidence, which is between 8% and 9% [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cerebral aneurysms are most common between 35 and 60 years of age and are more prevalent in women than in men by a 3:2 ratio [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When compared to their Caucasian counterparts, African American and Hispanic populations are at two times the risk for aneurysm development [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are numerous risk factors for cerebral aneurysms, including inherited conditions and lifestyle or other factors. These include but are not limited to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disorders, smoking, drug use, head trauma, female gender, and age greater than 50 years [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>While saccular aneurysms account for 90% of all cerebral aneurysms, there are other subtypes that providers should be familiar with [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Each has a distinct etiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, management, and prognosis. Additionally, each aneurysm type has unique characteristics such as size, location, and morphology that dictate appropriate intervention measures and help predict anticipated outcomes and complications. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current literature on each of these six types of intracranial aneurysms to help inform clinical decision making.

A&#x000a0;literature search was conducted using PubMed and Medline databases to identify relevant studies published. We selected filters for English language, human subjects, and a publication type of "article in press" or "review." Search terms included &#x0201c;saccular aneurysm&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;fusiform aneurysm&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mycotic aneurysm&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;marantic aneurysm&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;non-bacterial thrombotic aneurysm&#x0201d;, blister aneurysm&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;dissecting aneurysm&#x0201d;.&#x000a0;In addition, references from relevant literature were manually&#x000a0;reviewed to select for appropriate studies. They were considered for inclusion in the literature review if their primary focus was on cerebral aneurysmal factors such as general characteristics, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutic strategies for a given aneurysm type. Each pre-selected paper underwent a screening process by our authors for appropriate credibility in addition to quality of research methods and data analysis/presentation. Relevant data such as pathophysiology, presentation, imaging findings, risk of rupture, and treatment methods were extracted and synthesized systematically. Our exclusion criteria were any studies not focusing on these variables of interest, those restricted to a particular age group, animal and laboratory studies, novel diagnostics or therapeutics, clinical trials, publications requiring payment for access, and non-scientific publication types such as editorials and opinion columns. As with any literature review, there is some degree of possible selection bias, but our authors minimized this through predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as crosschecking of final paper selections.&#x000a0;</p><p>Saccular (berry) aneurysms</p><p>Definition and Epidemiology</p><p>Saccular aneurysms, also referred to as berry aneurysms, are the most common type of cerebral aneurysm, accounting for approximately 90% of all intracranial aneurysms [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They are present in 3% to 5% of the population, with a mean age of 50 at time of diagnosis and a predominance in females. Between 0.7% and 1.9% of saccular aneurysms rupture, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Nearly 90% of saccular aneurysms are located in the Circle of Willis, with the remaining 10% predominately found at vessel bifurcation points [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Common sites within the anterior circulation include the junction points between the anterior communicating artery (AComm) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the posterior communicating artery (PComm) and internal carotid artery, and the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. AComm aneurysms have the highest chance of rupturing, accounting for approximately 35% of ruptured saccular aneurysms. They are also typically more complex given that they have a dual inflow and two to three&#x000a0;outflow branches [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Within the posterior circulation the most common locations are at the top of the basilar artery, the junction between the basilar artery and superior cerebellar artery (SCA) or anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the junction between the vertebral artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Pathophysiology</p><p>Saccular aneurysms are generally the result of a weakened segment in the blood vessel wall, and typically form at vessel branch points where the impact of hemodynamic stress is high [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A more specific theory for the pathophysiology of berry aneurysm formation is the Coanda Effect, which describes the propensity of blood to adhere to a vessel wall opposite from a convex structure such as a cholesterol plaque [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The resulting decrease in flow resistance at the affected vessel wall creates a concavity. As blood is continually directed through the vessel concavity, a saccular aneurysm ensues [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Repetitive trauma or shearing forces at the vessel&#x02019;s weak point causes aneurysmal enlargement [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>There are various genetic and environmental factors that may increase one&#x02019;s propensity for developing a saccular aneurysm. Genetic factors include various connective tissue disorders that weaken blood vessel walls, polycystic kidney disease, presence of arteriovenous malformations, hypercholesterolemia, and a history of aneurysm in two or more first degree family members [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Environmental risk factors include hypertension, smoking, stimulant drug use, and heavy alcohol consumption [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Clinical Features&#x000a0;</p><p>The clinical presentation of saccular aneurysms varies depending on rupture status, ranging from asymptomatic to SAH&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;For unruptured aneurysms, most are diagnosed incidentally, but approximately 5% to 6% of patients are diagnosed based on mass effect symptomatology [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This most frequently includes oculomotor nerve palsy from aneurysms located in the PComm or visual disturbances secondary to optic nerve compression by carotid paraclinoid saccular aneurysms [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Patients with ruptured aneurysms will present with signs and symptoms of SAH common to all aneurysm types. This may include a myriad of clinical signs including a characteristic thunderclap headache that the patient may describe as the &#x0201c;worst headache of my life&#x0201d;, altered level of consciousness, focal or general seizures (present in up to 25% of SAH), meningeal signs such as neck pain or stiffness, focal neurological deficits, or visual impairment [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;There are numerous cited risk factors that increase the risk of saccular aneurysm rupture. These include prior aneurysm rupture, smoking, hypertension, large size, aneurysms located in the posterior circulation, high rate of growth during the surveillance period, family history of aneurysms, and aneurysms which are irregularly shaped [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Diagnosis and Imaging</p><p>Diagnosis of saccular aneurysms is typically made via a sequence of cerebral imaging techniques (dependent on clinical presentation). Non-contrast head computerized tomography (NCCT) will detect SAH and will often prompt vessel imaging. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are both highly sensitive non-invasive tests for detecting brain aneurysms. CTA is faster to obtain, more readily available, and more cost effective. MRA is useful in patients who have kidney disease or any other contraindication to iodine-based contrast (which is used for CTA but not MRA).&#x000a0;The gold standard diagnostic modality is a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to evaluate&#x000a0;exact aneurysm size, location, and morphology [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DSA is more invasive and time consuming but superior to the other vascular imaging studies due to its ability to evaluate cerebral blood flow in real time. In rare cases where patients have a negative NCCT but SAH is highly suspected, lumbar puncture may be considered to check for the presence of xanthochromia, a yellow tint to the cerebrospinal fluid as a result of the enzymatic breakdown of blood products [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Management Strategies</p><p>The two mainstay interventions for the management of saccular aneurysms include endovascular coiling and surgical clipping.&#x000a0;Coiling is an endovascular technique whereby the aneurysm sac is densely packed, thereby inducing rapid coagulation that will isolate the aneurysm from active cerebral circulation [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;Clipping is a microsurgical technique that involves placing a clip across the neck of the aneurysm while maintaining patency of the parent vessel. The decision-making process for which method to employ is complex, with providers taking into account both patient and aneurysm-specific factors.&#x000a0;Patient factors may include symptomatic vs asymptomatic status, medical comorbidities, lifestyle risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use, patient age, and individual vascular anatomy. Aneurysm based factors may include size, location, neck width, and other morphological features [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Management approach will also vary depending on rupture status.&#x000a0;</p><p>Generally, for coiling, an unassisted approach may be used for aneurysms with favorable anatomical features such as narrow neck width and a favorable relationship with branching vessels [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Less anatomically favorable or more complex saccular aneurysms may require assisted coiling methods or flow-diverting stents [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;Wide-neck saccular aneurysms, those with a neck-width greater than 4 mm or a dome-neck ratio less than 2, require special management considerations. These typically necessitate more complex clipping operations or the use of endovascular adjuncts such as stents or flow-diverters to avoid coil protrusion [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>For small unruptured aneurysms, those less than 3 mm in diameter, current guidelines advise observation as only 13% of SAH are attributable to this subset [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Location also plays a role in management of unruptured aneurysms, with posterior circulation and AComm aneurysms typically treated endovascularly, and MCA aneurysms classically treated surgically [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Unruptured distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms are shown to be safe and effective candidates for both surgical and endovascular approaches, and providers commonly use more specific anatomical factors, such as location relative to the genu of the corpus callosum, to determine intervention modality [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Those that lie above the genu are preferentially treated surgically, while those that lie below the genu are treated endovascularly due to their accessibility [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other anatomical considerations make patients with unruptured saccular aneurysms a better candidate for one approach over the other. The presence of a partial thrombosis, vessels branching from the aneurysm neck, and atypical extracranial vasculature make patients more suitable for surgical clipping, while atherosclerotic plaques at the aneurysm neck, perforating arteries, or difficult surgical access make patients more suitable for endovascular coiling. Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a flow diagram demonstrating surgical vs endovascular management of unruptured saccular aneurysms for the above-mentioned sizes, complexities, and locations.&#x000a0;</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Management flowchart for unruptured saccular aneurysms.</title><p>Blue: size; Purple: complexity; Green: location; Pink: location relative to the corpus collosum; Grey: management modality.</p><p>mm: millimeters.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000080223-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>For the management of ruptured saccular aneurysms, large and giant aneurysms (&#x0003e;10 mm and &#x0003e;25 mm respectively) typically require adjunct endovascular methods such as stenting or flow-diversion, or complex clip reconstructions or bypass surgery [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ruptured aneurysms will also often require a ventriculostomy in the case of hydrocephalus [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With increased size, where both clipping and coiling are difficult and high-risk interventions, morphology and location must be considered in conjunction [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].&#x000a0;In the setting of a wide-necked ruptured aneurysm, endovascular adjuncts such as stent-assisted coiling (SAC) or flow diverters may be employed to help divert flow away from the aneurysm&#x02019;s neck.&#x000a0;To avoid the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) necessitated by these interventions, which increases ventricular drain-related bleeds from 9% to 20.9%, wide-necked ruptured saccular aneurysms may also be managed using intrasaccular flow disrupters such as Woven EndoBridge (WEB) [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given that these devices avoid protrusion into the parent vessel, DAPT is not always required post-operatively, helping to mitigate bleeding risk [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With regards to location, posterior circulation aneurysms, including basilar apex, PICA, and PComm aneurysms are typically managed endovascularly. The reasoning for this is that the deeper location of these aneurysms, important perforators, and surrounding cranial nerves, bring a higher surgical risk. The exception to this is when the endovascular approach entails more than just coiling for PICA aneurysms, in which case clipping may be the preferred intervention [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For ruptured AComm aneurysms, orientation is an essential consideration for management approach, with those which are oriented anteriorly being more readily accessible via clipping [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Posteriorly oriented AComm aneurysms are typically coiled, as clipping has been associated with subsequent vessel ischemia [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As with unruptured saccular DACA aneurysms, those that are ruptured can be managed via either coiling or clipping, with many surgeons taking the relative position of the genu of the corpus callosum into consideration. For ruptured MCA aneurysms there is currently mixed consensus on optimal management approach. Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x000a0;provides a flow diagram demonstrating surgical vs endovascular management of ruptured saccular aneurysms for the above-mentioned locations and complexities.&#x000a0;</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Management flowchart for ruptured saccular aneurysms.</title><p>Green: location; Yellow: location within the posterior circulation; Orange: endovascular complexity; Red: orientation; Pink: location relative to the corpus collosum; Grey: management modality.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000080223-i02" position="float"/></fig><p><italic>Prognosis</italic>&#x000a0;</p><p>Patient outcomes vary based on the rupture status of the aneurysm and any number of the above discussed patient and aneurysmal factors. The majority of unruptured aneurysms discovered incidentally won't ever rupture or become problematic [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As mentioned previously, only 0.7% to 1.9% of patients with existing saccular aneurysms will experience a rupture. When aneurysm rupture occurs, prognosis is influenced by a myriad of factors including age, medical comorbidities, aneurysm location, Fisher grade, Hunt-Hess grade, and treatment success [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among those with ruptured berry aneurysms, 25% of patients will die within the first 24 hours. Of those who survive past 24 hours, another 25% will pass away within the next six months from the development of complications [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Complications include rebleeding, hydrocephalus, vasospasm, seizures, cardiac stress, and hyponatremia which all influence overall prognosis [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Fusiform aneurysms</p><p>Definition and Epidemiology</p><p>Fusiform aneurysms are a subtype of non-saccular aneurysm characterized by circumferential dilation of an entire vessel wall for a short distance [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Those encompassing a relatively longer vessel distance are termed &#x0201c;cylindrical&#x0201d; [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fusiform aneurysms are a rare subtype of aneurysm, accounting for between 3% and 13% of all intracranial aneurysms. They are most commonly seen in the vertebrobasilar system [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a retrospective study by Park et al. encompassing 2,458 aneurysms, the mean age of patients at time of diagnosis was 45, with a male:female ratio of 1.4:1 [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is consistent with numerous other studies previously conducted, supporting the notion that spontaneous fusiform aneurysms are more common in men and are typically found in younger patients [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Pathophysiology</p><p>The pathophysiology of fusiform aneurysms is most commonly secondary to atherosclerosis or vessel dissection [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An essential feature of these aneurysms is the communication between the true lumen and the pseudo-lumen via a disruption in the internal elastic lamina [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;The initial inciting event is lipid accumulation within and beneath the intima in the case of atherosclerosis, or dissection of the internal elastic lamina in the case of vessel dissection. This then results in disruption of the internal elastic membrane and invasion of the muscular wall with resulting intramural hemorrhage or formation of an intramural hematoma respectively [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This is followed by transmural expansion of the thrombus which thickens the intima to create a fusiform shaped aneurysm [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. From here there are five main evolution patterns including further expansion of the intramural hematoma, enlargement of the hematoma with resulting circumferential vessel enlargement, the formation of serpentine channels, aneurysm rupture outward, or aneurysm rupture into the arterial lumen [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This may then progress to SAH or ischemia depending on the location of the dissection caused by the resulting hematoma from bleeding into the arterial wall [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Their etiology may less commonly be attributed to disorders of collagen or elastin, infection, or very rarely by a neoplastic invasion of the vessel wall [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Each of these causes weakening of the arterial wall and allows for aneurysm formation, with a similar sequela of events as described above.&#x000a0;</p><p>Clinical Features</p><p>These aneurysms may present in a variety of ways depending on morphology, ranging from asymptomatic to transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke to hemorrhage. Patients may demonstrate symptoms of vessel occlusion presenting as ischemic stroke of the brainstem, arterial rupture, or mass effect from compression of the brainstem, cerebellum, or cranial nerves [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most commonly, they will present as an ischemic stroke or as mass effect [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This may present with symptoms including but not limited to aphasia, ataxia, diplopia, dizziness, cranial nerve deficit, and hemiparesis [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. If the tunica adventitia is disrupted, then the aneurysm may rupture and progress to a SAH [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Alternatively, if the aneurysm remains contained by the tunica media, there will be enlargement of the aneurysm towards the vessel lumen, with ischemia or stenosis of the artery ensuing [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Diagnosis&#x000a0;</p><p>As with other types of aneurysms, non-invasive diagnostic imaging is typically first employed with CTA and/or MRA. However, DSA remains the gold standard. The shape of these aneurysms helps clinicians differentiate them from saccular aneurysms, as they will demonstrate circumferential as opposed to one-sided ballooning of the vessel wall [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Fleming&#x02019;s classification system can be used to differentiate non-saccular vertebrobasilar circulation aneurysms, such as fusiform, based on their radiographic appearance [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Generally, the presence of the non-saccular aneurysm is defined when dilation of the vessel is greater than 1.5 times the normal diameter and there is absence of an aneurysm neck [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. From there the aneurysm may be categorized as (1) fusiform: aneurysmal dilation involving a portion of the vessel with no clearly defined neck, (2) dolichoectasia: uniform dilation of the entire vessel and associated tortuosity, (3) transitional: uniform dilation of the entire vessel with superimposed&#x000a0;dilation of a portion of the arterial segment,&#x000a0;or (4) indeterminate [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Management</p><p>Nearly all ruptured fusiform aneurysms will require invasive intervention.

Interventions instead require more advanced microsurgical techniques to reduce or reverse blood flow, or newer interventions such as endovascular&#x000a0;flow diversion [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Microsurgical technique via clipping is typically reserved for aneurysms which cannot be managed endovascularly. If employed, flow reduction or bypass/trapping is used in the setting of poor collateral blood supply, flow reversal is used in the setting of sufficient collateral supply, and trapping may be used to decompress aneurysms with associated mass effect [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Management over the last decade has evolved to endovascular techniques with the use of SAC or flow diversion instead, which has shown to have acceptable outcomes in the majority of patients [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Patients undergoing this intervention will require post-operative DAPT for a minimum of three to six months, followed by aspirin for life [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p><italic>Prognosis</italic>&#x000a0;</p><p>Prognosis of fusiform aneurysms varies depending on ruptured vs unruptured status and characteristics of the aneurysm. For unruptured aneurysms, those less than 7 mm in maximum diameter and not associated with atherosclerosis have a low risk of rupture or becoming symptomatic for several years after discovery [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Those that are greater than 7 mm in maximum diameter or are symptomatic have an increased risk of enlargement and possible rupture [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Unruptured fusiform aneurysms with associated atherosclerosis have a worse prognosis given their challenging management [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For patients with ruptured fusiform aneurysms, rebleeding rates range from 30% to 85% [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. When ruptured fusiform aneurysms are managed conservatively (without surgical intervention), mortality rate is around 38% over a follow-up period of 18 months [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Mycotic aneurysms&#x000a0;</p><p>Definition and Epidemiology</p><p>A mycotic aneurysm is a dilation in a blood vessel wall that develops in response&#x000a0;to an infectious etiology, secondary to infective endocarditis (IE) from a bacterial pathogen in nearly 90% of cases [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The term &#x0201c;mycotic&#x0201d; was created by William Osler as he described the fungal appearance of multiple aneurysms in a man with valve vegetations [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The incidence of such aneurysms is fairly rare, accounting for 0.7% to 3% of all cerebral aneurysms [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They are more commonly found in men than women, presumably due to higher rates of atherosclerosis, smoking, and diabetes, which are all associated risk factors [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The median age of affected patients is 65 years [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Common infectious pathogens include <italic>Staph. aureus</italic> and <italic>Strep. viridians</italic> [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Fungal or viral pathogens may be implicated in immunocompromised patients. In patients with IE, 2% to 10% of patients will develop cerebral mycotic aneurysms, more commonly seen with left-sided IE [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Pathophysiology</p><p>The etiology of mycotic aneurysms is secondary to either local infectious invasion of a vessel wall in a patient with a pre-existing aneurysm or atheromatous plaque, or in the setting of systemic infection with bacteremia. The bacterial invasion of the blood vessel weakens the arterial structure and leads to a resulting dilatation [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Once the infection seeds the vessel intima, the deeper layers of the vessel are rapidly degraded as well. Additionally, the vessel infection stimulates recruitment of pro-inflammatory cytokines which attract neutrophils that subsequently cause further breakdown of the vessel wall via activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>There are multiple factors implicated in the pathogenesis of mycotic aneurysms, including bacteremia, local injury, local spread, and septic emboli. In patients with pre-existing aneurysms or atherosclerosis, such as the elderly, bacterial seeding in the setting of sepsis or bacteremia is facilitated by existing vessel injury [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Local injury to a blood vessel wall via means such as intravenous drug use, trauma, or iatrogenic causes allows for invasion of bacteria into the vessel wall and resulting aneurysm formation [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Local spread may result from intracerebral pathologies such as meningitis, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis, or orbital cellulitis [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For cerebral mycotic aneurysms, the most commonly implicated etiology is septic emboli from IE, accounting for 90%&#x000a0;of cases [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].&#x000a0;These typically result in multi-focal dilations (present in up to 25% of patients) and are commonly located at peripheral branch points within the cerebral vasculature if of bacterial origin [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When located peripherally, the MCA is commonly implicated (specifically the M2 segment and beyond) [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. If of fungal origin, aneurysms are more commonly located in long proximal segments of the Circle of Willis [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Based on these etiologies, patients who are intravenous drug users, or those with immune compromised states, are at a higher risk for aneurysm development.</p><p>Clinical Features</p><p>A patient&#x02019;s clinical presentation will vary depending on the site of the aneurysm, the severity of the infection, and patient comorbidities [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Common initial presentation for unruptured aneurysms includes fever, weight loss, and headache [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given the relatively non-specific nature of this presentation, many patients remain undiagnosed until the aneurysm progresses and causes more severe symptoms. The natural progression may include expansion, pseudoaneurysm formation, rupture, hemorrhage, sepsis, and multiorgan failure [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. After progression, patients may present with neurologic deficits, stroke, or SAH [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In patients who present with a ruptured mycotic aneurysm, they will exhibit symptoms of intracranial hemorrhage [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Diagnosis&#x000a0;</p><p>A combination of clinical, laboratory, imaging, and intraoperative findings are used for diagnosis. Clinical findings include the above-mentioned symptoms, in combination with known patient risk factors. General laboratory findings will indicate the presence of an infection [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Blood cultures are also typically used to aid in diagnosis, with a positive culture in&#x000a0;50% to 85% of cases [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As mentioned, commonly implicated bacterial organisms include <italic>Staph. aureus</italic> and <italic>Strep. viridians</italic>, accounting for up to 90% of cases. While fairly rare, fungal or viral organisms may be responsible in immunocompromised patients such as those with diabetes, HIV, or those undergoing chemotherapy [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Imaging findings using head CT with contrast, MRA with contrast, and DSA are the most sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for these aneurysms. On initial examination of imaging findings, mycotic aneurysms can often be differentiated from saccular aneurysms based on their typically peripheral location within the vasculature [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].&#x000a0;Highly suggestive imaging findings include a saccular lesion with lobulated contours, soft tissue inflammation around the vessel wall, air collection surrounding or within the vessel wall, or fluid collection around the aneurysm [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. If operative samples of the aneurysms are taken and sent to pathology, transmural inflammation with abscesses, necrosis, and thrombosis will be present in the tissue [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Management</p><p>Given its infectious etiology, all patients require antibiotic therapy. While awaiting blood culture results, patients are typically started on an empiric regimen of vancomycin with ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam for broad spectrum coverage. Once the pathogen and sensitivities result, patients will receive tailored antibiotics for a baseline duration of six to eight weeks [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;Patient therapeutic response is continually monitored via laboratory studies and patient clinical status [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While surgical resection is the definitive management for mycotic aneurysms, patients with unruptured aneurysms or those who are not suitable surgical candidates may receive conservative management with antibiotics alone [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When implemented in suitable candidates, the conservative approach results in the complete resolution of approximately 30% of aneurysms, decreased size in 20%, no significant change in size in 15% to 30%, and an increase in size in 20% of patients [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This approach requires serial angiographic follow-up for aneurysm monitoring [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Surgical intervention in conjunction with antibiotic therapy may be implemented for either unruptured or ruptured aneurysms. This entails debridement of all infected tissue with subsequent revascularization through either an open (clipping) or endovascular (coiling) approach [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Endovascular technique is shown to be a suitable option for patients with a high perioperative risk or as a temporary bridging intervention for those with severe sepsis [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> provides a flow diagram demonstrating management of mycotic aneurysms for the above-mentioned presentations.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Management flowchart for mycotic aneurysms.</title><p>Purple: rupture status; Blue: surgical steps and details; Grey: surgical vs endovascular management modality.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000080223-i04" position="float"/></fig><p>Prognosis&#x000a0;</p><p>Even for patients who undergo appropriate management, prognosis is poor [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unruptured aneurysms have an overall mortality rate of up to 30%, and their ruptured counterparts up to 80%. Mycotic aneurysms have a very high perioperative mortality rate [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Perioperative mortality can be attributed to prolonged operating times with resulting distant ischemia causing a cerebrovascular accident [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;For patients who undergo open surgery, the perioperative mortality rate is roughly 20%, thus increasing interest in employing endovascular techniques for management [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is worth noting however that the long-term outcomes for patients who survive surgical intervention are comparable [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;Post-operatively, patients with grafts placed may suffer from reinfection or graft failure, with infections having a 100% mortality rate within two years if the implicated graft is not removed [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Post-operative complications may occur in up to 60% of patients. Patients who go untreated have a rupture risk of approximately 60%, and are also at risk for complications including sepsis, thrombosis, stroke, and multiorgan failure [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As discussed previously, MMP are implicated in the pathogenesis of mycotic aneurysms through their role in vessel breakdown. Given their key role, higher levels in patients may be used as a prognostic indicator for risk of rupture [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, patients with multiple intracerebral mycotic aneurysms have a poorer prognosis [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Marantic (non-bacterial thrombotic) aneurysms</p><p>Definition and Epidemiology</p><p>Marantic aneurysms are associated with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) or systemic conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. The hypercoagulability of these diseases contributes to sterile thrombus formation that leads to aneurysm development. The incidence of these aneurysms is extremely rare, making their diagnosis and management a challenge [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Pathophysiology</p><p>The pathogenesis of marantic aneurysms involves vessel wall weakening secondary to systemic factors, including malignancy or autoimmune disorders. One suggestion of how malignancies cause aneurysms is that tumor embolus invades the vessels and causes dilatation, leading to an aneurysm formation [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In both malignancy and autoimmune disorders, endothelial injury promotes thrombus formation along arterial walls [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Over time, these thrombi contribute to vascular dilation leading to aneurysm formation.&#x000a0;</p><p>Clinical Features&#x000a0;</p><p>Marantic aneurysms are often undetected until complications such as rupture occur. Depending on the type of disease and neoplasm, the chance of rupture varies. For example, all choriocarcinoma aneurysms presented with SAH, while only 19.6% of the cerebral marantic aneurysms secondary to cardiac myxoma presented with SAH [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Diagnosis and Imaging&#x000a0;</p><p>Imaging studies play a critical role in the diagnosis of marantic aneurysms. Similar to other types of aneurysms, CTA&#x000a0;or DSA&#x000a0;can be used to visualize the aneurysm [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Coagulation studies, autoimmune markers, cancer markers, and, in select cases, biopsy can aid in identifying underlying systemic conditions and ruling out infectious causes [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Management&#x000a0;</p><p>Marantic aneurysms are such a rare type of cerebral aneurysm that a definitive treatment has yet to be established. Possible treatment options include addressing the underlying systemic disease to reduce the hypercoagulable state, and anticoagulation therapy, using agents such as warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Invasive surgical interventions such as aneurysm clipping or stenting can be considered in cases of large or symptomatic aneurysms [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Prognosis</p><p>The prognosis of marantic aneurysms depends heavily on the underlying systemic disease, as well as the size and location of the aneurysm. Complications, including rupture, embolism, and ischemia, significantly impact outcomes. Prognosis is often poor in patients with malignancy, whereas those with autoimmune or hypercoagulable conditions tend to have a better outlook when both the aneurysm and the systemic condition are adequately treated [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Blister aneurysms</p><p>Definition and Epidemiology</p><p>Blister aneurysms are small, fragile lesions that typically form at non-branching points of major intracranial arteries. These aneurysms often appear as sidewall lesions with hemispheric or broad-based morphologies, lacking an identifiable neck [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. They are most commonly found in the supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery. They go through rapid morphological changes on angiographic follow-up, and their high fragility makes them prone to rupture or regrowth. Blister aneurysms account for 0.3% to 1% of all intracranial aneurysms and 6.6% of ruptured cases [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Pathophysiology</p><p>The etiology of blister aneurysms is poorly understood, but several mechanisms have been proposed. These lesions may result from defects in the arterial wall combined with hemodynamic stress, with ruptured cases often linked to underlying internal carotid artery&#x000a0;dissection [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Surgical observations have revealed proximal intramural hematomas in some cases, suggesting a pathophysiological mechanism involving retrograde formation and progression of these lesions. Other potential contributors include mechanical stress, acute inflammation, increased cell apoptosis, and elevated levels of cellular proliferation [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p><italic>Clinical Features</italic>&#x000a0;</p><p>Preexisting intracranial atherosclerosis and elevated wall shear stress (WSS) or wall shear stress gradients (WSSG) may predispose individuals to blister aneurysm development [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Unique morphological features, such as a platelet plug overlying thin adventitia that lacks a collagen layer, are thought to contribute to their propensity for rapid size and shape changes and high rupture risk [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Diagnosis</p><p>Blister aneurysms are challenging to diagnose due to their small size, unusual morphology,&#x000a0;and atypical locations. Patients often present with SAH, rapidly evolving clinical courses, and imaging findings that reveal small, broad-based irregularities in the vessel wall. Noninvasive imaging modalities, such as CTA and MRA, may fail to detect these lesions due to adjacent bony structures and atypical locations [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. DSA remains the gold standard for diagnosis, often revealing features such as wide necks, diverse shapes, and parent artery involvement near the aneurysmal neck. Changes in morphology over short periods and stasis of contrast within the aneurysm are also characteristic findings [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Management&#x000a0;</p><p>Treatment of blister aneurysms is challenging due to their high fragility and susceptibility to rupture during intervention. Surgical options include wrapping, clipping, suturing, and trapping with or without bypass procedures, but these approaches are associated with significant risks of intraoperative rupture and postoperative rebleeding [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Endovascular strategies, such as coiling, stenting, or the use of flow-diverting stents, have gained favor due to lower morbidity and mortality rates when compared to open surgery [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Flow-diverting stents have shown promise with fewer perioperative complications and comparable functional outcomes.

Outcomes are highly dependent on early diagnosis, appropriate management, and the ability to mitigate risks during treatment.</p><p>Dissecting aneurysms</p><p>Definition and Epidemiology</p><p>Dissecting aneurysms result from arterial wall dissection, which leads to the formation of pseudoaneurysms. Cranio-cervical dissections are implicated in 15% to 20% of strokes among young individuals [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These aneurysms often occur in the carotid or vertebral arteries and can be bilateral in up to 15% of cases [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The most common sites include the MCA (41%), vertebrobasilar circulation (23%), internal carotid artery (21%), and ACA (13%) [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Individuals with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan&#x000a0;syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, are at an elevated risk due to structural abnormalities in the extracellular matrix, including defects in collagen and proteoglycans, which weaken the vessel walls [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Pathophysiology</p><p>Dissecting aneurysms may result from trauma or underlying connective tissue disorders. Intraluminal blood penetrating the vessel wall creates an intramural hematoma, which, depending on its extension, may cause ischemia, embolization, or a dissecting aneurysm [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].&#x000a0;The dissection begins between the intima and media layers of the vessel wall, leading to the destruction of all layers.

Common presentations include headache, neurological deficits, and ischemic symptoms due to vessel occlusion or embolization. Rarely, bleeding into adjacent structures, cranial nerve paresis, or Horner&#x02019;s syndrome may occur. Intradural internal carotid artery dissection presents with unilateral headache followed by stroke symptoms; less commonly, SAH. MCA and ACA dissections present with stroke symptoms.

Other diagnostic signs include the "pearl and string" sign and intramural hematomas visible as thick, ring-like enhancement on contrast imaging or double-lumen signs.

Most stenosis caused by extradural dissections resolve with anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin). However, surgical or endovascular treatment is indicated for persistent ischemic symptoms or cases with a high risk of rupture.&#x000a0;Options include clipping, wrapping, or bypass procedures for diseased segments and coiling, stenting, or balloon dilatation for acute or recurrent strokes unresponsive to pharmacological treatment [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p><italic>Prognosis</italic>&#x000a0;</p><p>The prognosis of dissecting aneurysms varies based on the dissection&#x02019;s location and the chosen treatment approach.

Future research directions focus on improving diagnostic precision, optimizing treatment strategies, and developing preventative measures.</p><p>The differentiation of various aneurysm types remains a significant challenge due to overlapping imaging features, particularly for rarer forms such as blister, mycotic, and marantic aneurysms. Emerging imaging technologies, including high-resolution vessel wall imaging (HR-VWI) with MRI, hold promise for visualizing aneurysm wall composition, inflammation, and stability [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. HR-VWI can evaluate vessel wall and detect pathological changes that could be hard to identify on conventional imaging [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Such advancements could aid in identifying aneurysms at higher rupture risk and distinguishing between infectious or noninfectious etiologies. Similarly, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms in imaging analysis has the potential to improve detection accuracy, predict rupture risk, and guide treatment planning [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These innovations may allow for earlier identification of aneurysms, particularly those with atypical or subtle presentations, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.</p><p>Treatment modalities for intracranial aneurysms continue to advance, particularly in endovascular techniques. Flow-diverting stents, which have already revolutionized the management of complex aneurysms, are being refined to improve safety and efficacy, particularly for small, distal, and wide-necked aneurysms. Innovations such as bioresorbable scaffolds and advanced coatings to reduce thrombogenicity and inflammation are under investigation [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For surgical treatments, the development of robotic-assisted microsurgery offers the potential to improve precision in complex cases while minimizing complications. These technologies could expand the scope of surgical clipping, particularly for aneurysms in challenging locations.</p><p>Further research is needed to understand the underlying genetic and molecular causes of aneurysm formation and progression. Studies exploring the role of specific genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and biomarkers could help identify individuals at higher risk for aneurysm development or rupture, paving the way for targeted surveillance and preventive strategies.</p><p>Additionally, the exploration of preventative approaches, such as lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions (e.g., antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapies), and novel vascular protective agents, is critical. Trials assessing the long-term efficacy of such strategies in high-risk populations could transform current management standards.</p><p>Lastly, longitudinal studies to better define the natural history of unruptured aneurysms are necessary to refine risk stratification tools and improve clinical decision-making. Expanding data on aneurysms in specific populations, such as pediatric patients and individuals with connective tissue disorders, will also enhance personalized management approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intracranial aneurysms represent a diverse group of cerebrovascular pathologies, each with unique epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment considerations. Saccular aneurysms are the most common type, while rarer forms such as fusiform, mycotic, marantic, blister, and dissecting aneurysms require specialized approaches to diagnosis and management. This review highlights the distinct characteristics and challenges associated with each type, emphasizing the importance of understanding their unique features to optimize patient outcomes. Early identification of aneurysms, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, is crucial for preventing catastrophic complications such as rupture. Advances in imaging modalities have significantly improved the ability to detect and characterize aneurysms, but further development in techniques such as high-resolution vessel wall imaging and artificial intelligence-based analysis is needed to enhance diagnostic precision. Tailored management strategies, ranging from endovascular interventions to surgical techniques, are critical to addressing the anatomical and physiological complexities of different aneurysm types. Incorporating patient-specific factors into decision-making ensures optimal outcomes and minimizes treatment-related risks. By addressing existing knowledge gaps and leveraging technological breakthroughs, the field can move closer to precise diagnostics, safer interventions, and effective preventative measures for this life-threatening condition.</p><p>In conclusion, the management of intracranial aneurysms requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates cutting-edge technology, personalized care, and ongoing research. By advancing our knowledge and tools, we can improve the prognosis and quality of life for patients with these complex and life-threatening conditions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Tyler E.
