The mention is contained in a wide&#x02013;ranging address to the British Medical Association in Oxford, in 1868, in a section devoted to abdominal diseases. Gull refers shortly and obliquely to a disorder of weight loss with no apparent gross peripheral organic disease. Gull initially referred to this condition as &#x02018;Hysteric Apepsia&#x02019;.</p><p>Gull was considered an eminent physician in his time and in 1871 was credited with saving the life of the Prince of Wales, becoming both a Baronet and one of Queen Victoria's Physicians&#x02013;in&#x02013;Ordinary.</p><p>In 1873, William Gull presented two cases (Miss A and Miss B) &#x02018;as fair examples of the whole&#x02019; (subsequently published in 1874), and in an addendum, he added a further case (Miss C) referred by a Dr Anderson and quotes from three letters he received from him in April 1873 (Gull,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1874</xref>). In the published collection of his works (1896), a further case of AN (Miss K R) was added with a note from the editor; &#x02018;The following case was Sir William Gull's last contribution to the study of clinical medicine&#x02019; (Gull,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">1896</xref>, <xref rid="erv3139-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>, reprinted).</p><p>This article aims to analyse the cases described by William Gull in the context of modern&#x02010;day presentations/clinical features, the demographic features of patients with feeding and eating disorders, compare the changes in management and prognosis of these patients and also analyse the nosological status of the patients described by Gull according to recent classification systems.</p></sec><sec id="erv3139-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>METHODOLOGY</title><p>The cases described by William Gull were reviewed in terms of the language used by Gull himself.

<p>&#x02018;No account could be given of the exciting cause&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;It will be observed that all the conditions in this case were negative, and may be explained by the anorexia which led to starvation, and a depression of the vital functions. In the stage of greatest emaciation one might have been pardoned for assuming that there was some organic lesion&#x02019;.</p>
</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02018;Brought to me&#x02026;as a case of latent tubercle&#x02019;</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02018;I believe it to be essentially a failure of the powers of the gastric branches of the pneumogastric nerve. It differs from tuberculosis, though that state may subsequently arise, by the pulse, which I found to be 64, by the breathing, 16, the cleanness of the tongue, &#x00026;c. In fact, the disease will be most correctly interpreted if it is remembered that no symptom more positive than emaciation is presented in and throughout its course&#x02019;.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02018;An illustration of most of these cases, perversions of the &#x0201c;ego&#x0201d; being the cause and determining the course of the malady&#x02019;.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1">General comments: &#x02018;The want of appetite is, I believe due to morbid mental state, I have not observed in these cases any gastric disorder to which the want of appetite could be referred. I believe, there, that its origin is central and not peripheral&#x02026;. We might call the state hysterical without committing ourselves to the etymological value of the word, or maintaining that the subjects of it have common symptoms of hysteria. I prefer, however, the more general term &#x0201c;nervosa,&#x0201d; since the disease occurs in males as well as females, and is probably rather central than peripheral. The importance of discriminating such cases in practice is obvious; otherwise prognosis will be erroneous, and treatment misdirected&#x02019;. &#x02018;The subjects of this affection [AN] are mostly of the female sex, and chiefly between ages of 16 and 23. I Have occasionally seen it in males at the same age&#x02019;. &#x02018;To illustrate the disease I may give the details of two cases, [case A and B] as fair examples of the whole&#x02019;.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<p>&#x02018;Her emaciation was very great. Amenorrhoea for nearly a year. No cough. No vomiting nor diarrhoea. Slight constipation. Complete anorexia for animal food, and complete anorexia for everything else. Abdomen shrunk and flat. The condition was one of simple starvation&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;The patient complained of no pain, but was restless and active. This was in fact a striking expression of the nervous state for it seemed hardly possible that a body so wasted could undergo the exertion which seemed agreeable&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;Occasionally for a day or two the appetite was voracious, but this was very rare and exceptional&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;was restless and active&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;It will be noticeable that as she recovered she had a much younger look&#x02026; the photographs taken when she was 17, give her appearance of being near thirty&#x02019;.</p>

<p>&#x02018;Pulse 50, resp 16. Physical examination of the chest and abdomen discovered nothing abnormal. Notwithstanding the great emaciation and apparent weakness, there was a peculiar restlessness, difficult I was informed, to control. The mother added, &#x0201c;she is never tired.&#x0201d; Amenorrhoea since Christmas 1866.&#x02019;</p>
<p>Pulse 56, resp, 12; January 1868, pulse 54. But little change occurred in the case until 1872, when the respirations became 18&#x02013;20, pulse 60.</p>
</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>&#x02018;The clinical history was that she had been ailing for a year and had become extremely emaciated. The catamenia had never appeared. Pulse 64, resp. 16. Very sleepless for 6&#x000a0;months past. All the viscera healthy. Urine normal. Lower extremities oedematous&#x02019;</p>
<p>&#x02018;Great restlessness&#x02019;</p>
</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>&#x02018;The patient, who was a plump healthy girl until the beginning of last year (1887), began early in Feb, without apparent cause, to evince a repugnance to food, and soon afterwards declined to take any whatever except half a cup of tea or coffee&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;She was then extremely emaciated and persisted in walking through the streets to my house, though an object of remark to the passers&#x02013;by&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;As part of the pathological history, it is curious to note, as I did in my first paper, the persistent wish to be on the move, though the emaciation was so great and the nutritive functions at an extreme ebb&#x02019;.</p>
<p>&#x02018;She was then extremely emaciated&#x02019;</p>

When the emaciation is at the extremest, oedema may supervene in the lower extremities, the patient may become sleepless, the pulse quick, and death approached by the symptoms of feeble febrile reaction&#x02019;. &#x02018;Death apparently followed from the starvation alone&#x02019;. This is the clinical point to be borne in mind, and is, I believe, the proper guide to treatment. &#x02018;It being often necessary to supply external heat as well as food to patients&#x02019;.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mental health symptoms</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02018;There was some peevishness of temper, and a feeling of jealousy&#x02019;.</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02018;The medical treatment probably need not be considered as contributing much to the recovery.

I Must only urge the necessity of nourishment in some form. With the nourishment I would conjoin a dessert&#x02013;spoonful of brandy every two or 3&#x000a0;hours. Whilst the present state of weakness continues, fatigue must be limited, and if the exhaustion increases beyond its present degree the patient should for a time be kept in a warm bed.

The illustrations show the patients in what appears to be quality clothing with ornamentation and jewellery (and elaborate hairstyling) which along with Gull's eminent position at the time and the lack of an established public health service strongly suggests that these patients were from a high socioeconomic position and that Gull was seeing them in his private practice.</p><p>As is common with many presentations of AN, Gull's cases all presented with an already significant degree of weight loss. Gull mentioned amenorrhoea and in one case infrequent binging episodes as symptoms in his patients. Tuberculosis, which often presented with weight loss, was considered a differential diagnosis in these cases, however, there was no supporting evidence for tuberculosis in the patients presented. Any physical abnormalities such as low pulse rate seemed related to nutritional compromise with Gull concluding that anorexia had led directly to starvation. As regards aetiology, no direct cause could be found, and Gull concluded that the anorexia was &#x02018;due to morbid mental state&#x02019;. In summary, his view was that it was the significant weight loss and lack of discernible organic pathology which marked out the diagnosis of AN.</p><p>Gull mentions some background factors in two of his patients like the loss of a sibling, a potentially significant death, nervous symptoms, epilepsy in the family members of one of them and nervous symptoms in a family member of the other patient. Restlessness and significant activity, even in states of severe weight loss, were noted in all the cases and seemed to have made a significant clinical impression. Where mental health symptoms were present, they were primarily the reluctance to eat and subsequent loss of weight, though some temperamental problems were noted in two of his patients.</p></sec><sec id="erv3139-sec-0050"><label>3.2</label><title>Treatment and prognoses of William Gull's cases of AN</title><p>As regards the treatment that Gull outlines, it consisted of the following: an approach that recognised that this was a disorder over which the patient had little control. He also emphasised that the wishes of the patient should not be taken into consideration and that relations and friends might be countertherapeutic.</p><p>The main direct treatment Gull emphasised was nutritional rehabilitation. However, his advice &#x02018;Food should be administered at intervals varying inversely with the exhaustion and emaciation&#x02019; suggests a knowledge of the dangers of refeeding syndrome. This should not be a surprise for this danger had been known since classical times. Gull tried several common medical remedies at use at that time but concluded that they were ineffective. In one of his patients a nurse from Guy's Hospital, London, where Gull practised, was procured to assist with the treatment. The length of time in the treatment of the four cases, as far as can be discerned, was between 6&#x000a0;months and approximately 40&#x000a0;months. As for prognosis of the cases he was seeing in his clinical practice, he was generally positive though adding he had seen one fatality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="erv3139-sec-0060"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="erv3139-sec-0070"><label>4.1</label><title>150&#x000a0;years on&#x02013;The current situation &#x02010; What have we learnt?</title><sec id="erv3139-sec-0080"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Clinical presentations: Comparison with Gull's cases</title><p>In many ways, the cases discussed by Gull are quite familiar to the modern psychiatrist and his work continues to be influential (Madden,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Demographically, Gull's description of a preponderance of young females with occasional males fits with more contemporary research (Lock,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Petkova et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Familiar also is the late presentation to medical services with significant emaciation, amenorrhoea, and activity out of keeping with the degree of emaciation. Others reviewing Gull's cases speculated that this activity might not, as commonly assumed, be just to do with weight control and could be something much more fundamental to AN (Casper,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Gull mentioned no clear, consistent, or specific precipitating factors, though he was aware of some of the psychological aspects, mentioning as he did some background factors which might be considered as nonspecific factors and stressors. He was also familiar (in discussing the etymology of AN) with the then&#x02013;contemporary view of &#x02018;hysteria&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="erv3139-sec-0090"><label>4.1.2</label><title>Gull's cases and the fear of weight gain&#x02013;The possibilities</title><p>Gull did not describe the fear of gaining weight or disturbed body image. This might reflect the fact that the symptoms were not reported/absent by the patients or differing 19th&#x02010;century sociocultural influences (Habermas,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, it might also underscore the inherent symptomatic heterogeneity contained in the DSM&#x02010;5&#x02010;TR AN definition (e.g., fat&#x02010;phobic vs. non&#x02010;fat phobic) (Dalle Grave et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Korn et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lee et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, <xref rid="erv3139-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Mustelin et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Gull appears to have had a keen interest in mental health as in 1868 he wrote a paper on hypochondriasis and later described adult hypothyroidism commenting on its effect on the mind.</p><p>Writing around the same time as Gull an eminent French physician, Lasegue also described the syndrome of anorexia (anorexia hysterica) but only in females perhaps reflecting the strong French historical tradition associated with the concept of hysteria. Lasegue likewise did not describe any cases which might be considered &#x02018;fat phobic&#x02019;. The fact that these two extremely experienced clinicians did not mention any of these symptoms makes it far less likely that they missed any &#x02018;fat phobic&#x02019; symptoms. Weight phobia was described in patients by later contemporaries (Habermas,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and modern research supports the idea that both Gull and Lasegue may have seen patient groups which some have labelled &#x02018;non&#x02010;fat phobic&#x02019; that is, those low weight eating disorders who deny fear of weight gain (Dalle Grave et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lee et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, <xref rid="erv3139-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In one recent study up to a third of hospitalised patients with AN failed to score significantly on standardised eating disorder questionnaires, one possibility being that &#x02018;the existing measures do not capture the full range of AN presentations, such as non&#x02013;fat phobic AN&#x02019; (Vanzhula et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>, p. 796). This raises some very important questions about AN itself. Control of feeding is a highly complex system integrating peripheral neurohormonal, substantial vagal and other peripheral neuronal connections and a complex array of central systems (Andermann &#x00026; Lowell,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Stover et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>Control of eating behaviour in patients with eating disorder has been linked to their personality styles where patients with AN and a typical AN have been found to show overcontrol (characterised by rigidity, perfectionism, and inhibition of feelings) in their personality as compared to other eating disorder like bulimia bervosa (Isaksson et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However other authors prefer the term &#x0201c;coping&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; as a central factor as they argue eating disorder could be a result of life events or environmental factors (Branley&#x02010;Bell et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>AN has been conceptualised recently as having multiple possible aetiologies (Gorwood et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Could the heterogeneity of symptoms reflect differing processes of pathophysiology, that is, are different forms of anorexia nervosa (perhaps with differing aetiologies) hidden in our current diagnostic category?</p><p>Does the &#x02018;non&#x02010;fat phobic&#x02019; variety apparently seen by Gull represent the true basic form of the disorder or is it the &#x02018;forme fruste&#x02019;, that is a partial or attenuated form of the &#x02018;fat&#x02010;phobic&#x02019; disorder? The apparent low levels of &#x02018;fat&#x02013;phobic&#x02019; variety found in non&#x02010;western samples in the past might support the former view. In that case, could the &#x02018;fat phobic&#x02019; symptom cluster be a culturally determined additional perpetuating factor for an underlying basic form of anorexia perhaps with more biological origins? Might the explanations for weight loss given by some sufferers of AN be attempted cortical rationales for unconscious subcortical pathology? Gull's cases therefore continue to raise important questions about how this disorder should be understood while Gull's observations on the restless activity (and subsequent activity&#x02013;based animal models) along with Gull's suggestion of the use of heat in treatment suggest other avenues of enquiry and show the continuing influence of Gull's work even now (Carrera &#x00026; Guti&#x000e9;rrez,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Moncrieff&#x02010;Boyd,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Spadini et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="erv3139-sec-0100"><label>4.1.3</label><title>Nosology&#x02014;The status of Gull's cases&#x02014;The journey through the time</title><p>The DSM&#x02010;IV criteria, which largely followed the diagnostic and statistical manual third edition (DSM&#x02010;III, published 1980) and the diagnostic and statistical manual third edition&#x02010; revised (DSM&#x02010;III&#x02010;R, published 1987), excluded cases like those described by Gull, resulting in a substantial number of eating disorders being classified as eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) rather than AN (Fairburn &#x00026; Bohn,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).

All the four diagnostic clusters require the DSM&#x02010;5&#x02010;TR &#x02018;A&#x02019; criteria to be met, however, having met this criterion, as the table suggests, it is possible to have (1) A fear of weight gain/fatness B(i) and disturbance of body image (weight/shape) C(i); (2) Fear of weight gain/fatness B(i) and a lack of recognition of the seriousness of low weight C(ii); (3) Behaviour that interferes with weight gain B(ii) and lack of recognition of seriousness of low weight and C(ii); (4) Behaviour that interferes with weight gain B(ii) and disturbance of body image (weight/shape) C(i). All four types of theoretical diagnostic clusters can also have either Restricting&#x02013;type or a Binge&#x02013;eating/purging type leading to eight possible clusters of symptoms admitted under the AN diagnosis.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="erv3139-tbl-0003" content-type="TABLE"><label>TABLE 3</label><caption><p>Illustration of symptom heterogeneity within current DSM&#x02010;5&#x02010;TR anorexia nervosa diagnosis.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" span="1"/><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

It is possible that a historical perspective, which was cognisant of Gull's and his contemporary's work, might have avoided the necessity of the diagnostic criteria change from DSM&#x02010;IV to DSM&#x02010;5.</p></sec><sec id="erv3139-sec-0110"><label>4.1.4</label><title>Gull's management of anorexia nervosa: The progress we have made</title><p>The treatment approaches that Gull advised are also familiar, with weight restoration as the prime treatment offered and an acknowledgement that medications were generally unable to alter the primary pathology, a situation that has continued. Gull mentioned some important general principles regarding the approach to these patients, such as a framework that challenged the eating disorder within the young person, &#x02018;The inclination of the patient must be in no way consulted&#x02019; and emphasised the need for supervision of the nutritional rehabilitation which appears a necessary but often not a sufficient treatment. Gull's admonition of the family and friends as poor attendants is also familiar. Gull's contemporary, Charcot's observation, that &#x02018;Prayers, entreaties, violence, are unable to overcome their resistance&#x02019; (Silverman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) reflects the inadequacy of behavioural or psychological interventions, patients with AN cannot generally be &#x02018;talked&#x02019; out of their condition. In more modern times differing treatment strategies have been developed including family based treatment (FBT) which is a manualized treatment for Anorexia with the first phase being weight gain (Lock,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and the active involvement of the family and patient, drawing on the experience of family dynamics (especially helped by the insights from family therapy) along with targeted psychological therapies like CBT. In adults, the Maudsley Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults model has also been shown to have efficacy with nutrition a core component (Startup et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) Nursing support was also mentioned by Gull and sometimes the family and wider system seem to become the equivalent of the nurse procured from Guy's hospital to help in one of Gull's cases. Today good working relationships with paediatrics and nursing can often be essential, especially in the early stages of treatment. However, fundamentally the supportive treatments as in Gull's time remain focused on restoration and maintenance of weight gain. The more recently developed intervention for ED, Specialist Supportive Clinical Management, for instance, takes a similar pragmatic approach of clinical management along with supportive psychotherapy (Kiely et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Unfortunately, more modern interventions can in no way be seen as &#x02018;magic bullets&#x02019; and there remains, in the 21st century, still no definitive or curative treatment for AN. Also familiar from Gull's cases is the often&#x02010;prolonged clinical course sometimes over years, even with eventual recovery. Gull mentioned a generally favourable prognosis of his cases (though he may have seen, as discussed, a selected non&#x02010;fat phobic group) while today AN continues with a moderate outcome for adolescent anorexia with the proviso of significant morbidity during its often&#x02010;chronic course and with the threat of future mortality if treatment is unaddressed (Lock,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="erv3139-sec-0120"><label>4.1.5</label><title>Gull's cases&#x02010;The search for answers continue</title><p>As to the causation of AN, this appears to be complex and multifactorial with biological, psychological and socio&#x02010;cultural factors all appearing to play a part. Although many theories abound as to possible aetiological processes (Gorwood et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Lock,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) like Gull, modern researchers are still searching for answers. However, unlike in the 19th&#x02010;century there are many more scientific tools available today to analyse the myriad of potential aetiological models. Our understanding of for instance genetics (Paolacci et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and the neurobiology of feeding is certainly becoming more sophisticated (Andermann &#x00026; Lowell,&#x000a0;<xref rid="erv3139-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). General advances in our understanding of both medical and mental disorders can only help in the search for answers to a condition that remains in many ways as puzzling and challenging a century and a half from Gull's original publication on AN.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="erv3139-sec-0140"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.
