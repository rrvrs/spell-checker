OBs are mainly composed of the viral product polyhedrin (POLH), and the extremely high-level transcription of the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> gene has been exploited to express foreign proteins in insect cultured cells, larvae, and pupae. This <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> hyper-transcription requires the &#x0201c;burst sequence&#x0201d; located between the transcriptional start site and the initiation codon. Here, we focused on the roles of the A-rich region within the burst sequence. We generated Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus mutants whose burst sequence contained &#x0201c;A-to-T&#x0201d; mutations in the A-rich region. Some mutants exhibited levels of <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> promoter-driven reporter expression lower than or comparable to that of the wild type, whereas the mutants with TTT mutations at positions &#x02212;16 to &#x02212;14 in the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> upstream region showed a four- to fivefold increase in it. Most cases of single or double A-to-T mutations at &#x02013;16 to &#x02013;14 of the upstream region had small but significant effects on the expression level, while the triple mutation was the most effective. This enhancement was also observed in the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus-based vector system, which is more commonly used for foreign protein expression. We also found that this triple mutation enhanced the accumulation of <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> mRNA and POLH protein even in an OB-producing virus. These results indicate that specific mutations in the burst sequence have the potential to increase baculoviral protein expression at the transcriptional level and may improve foreign protein expression by baculoviruses.</p><sec><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>The most notable characteristic of alphabaculoviruses is that they produce many proteinaceous occlusion bodies (OBs) during the very late stages of infection. The main component of these OBs is virus-encoded polyhedrin (POLH). The high expression of the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> gene led to the development of the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Currently, this system is widely used for the production of vaccines, veterinary medicines, and reagents. Despite this background, the mechanisms by which baculoviruses ultimately produce large quantities of OBs remain largely unexplained, even after approximately 40 years since the BEVS development. Here, we discovered that three nucleotide substitutions in the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> burst sequence markedly increased the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> expression levels in both BmNPV- and AcMNPV-based BEVSs, regardless of the vector type. This discovery can be easily introduced into the currently used BEVS, possibly contributing to further improvements for achieving even higher expression of foreign proteins.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>polyhedrin</kwd><kwd>baculovirus</kwd><kwd>BEVS</kwd><kwd>burst sequence</kwd><kwd>BmNPV</kwd><kwd>AcMNPV</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group award-type="grant" id="award-1"><funding-source>

Alphabaculoviruses produce two types of virions: occlusion-derived virus (ODV) and budded virus (BV) during their infection cycle (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). ODVs are embedded in occlusion bodies (OBs), the main component of which is a viral protein called polyhedrin (POLH). OBs are thought to protect ODVs from environmental stresses to which they are exposed under natural conditions, such as UV light and high temperatures. Nucleocapsids are common in ODVs and BVs, but the envelope components are specific to each virion type for establishing the virus infection cycle: ODVs are essential for larva-to-larva viral transmission via oral infection, whereas BVs are used for cell-to-cell infection within an insect host (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Alphabaculoviruses produce a huge amount of OBs in the nuclei of infected cells during the late stage of infection (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which is accomplished by hyperexpression of the <italic toggle="yes">polyhedrin</italic> gene (<italic toggle="yes">polh</italic>). Deletion experiments have revealed that <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> is not essential for virus replication and can be replaced by a heterologous gene under the strong <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> promoter in cultured cells (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) was developed in the 1980s using Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedovirus (BmNPV) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) for the expression of foreign proteins in cultured cells and larvae (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>A 50 bplong region located between the transcriptional start site (TSS) and the translational initiation codon of <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> is called the &#x0201c;burst sequence,&#x0201d; which is essential for the burst of <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> transcription. Because mutations or deletions in the burst sequence significantly decrease the expression of <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the inclusion of the full length of the burst sequence in the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic>-based transfer/donor vectors used in BEVS has been considered essential. Although the baculovirus protein very late factor 1 (VLF-1) is known to bind to the burst sequence and activate <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> transcription (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the nucleotides that are essential for the burst of <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> expression have not been comprehensively identified. To bridge this knowledge gap, we here focused on the role of the A-rich region within the burst sequence (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that specific nucleotide substitutions in the A-rich region markedly enhanced <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> expression in both BmNPV and AcMNPV. Because the A-rich region is present in most BEVS vectors, this finding may help to improve the currently used BEVS vectors to achieve even higher expression of foreign proteins.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="F1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Effects of mutations in the A-rich region of the BmNPV <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> burst sequence on <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> promoter-driven activity.

Using these viruses, we measured Luc activity in BmN-4 cells. When a single A was substituted, T1 showed almost no change (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.7450) compared with the WT virus, while T2 and T3 showed activity approximately double that of the WT virus (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). When two nucleotides were substituted, T12 and T13 showed approximately fivefold activity of the WT virus, and T23 showed approximately double that of the WT virus.

T12 and T13 showed approximately three to four times mRNA level of the WT virus, and T23 showed mRNA level approximately double that of the WT virus. The increase in mRNA in these mutants was lower than that in TTT (T12, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0582 in <italic toggle="yes">luc</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0002 in <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR; T13, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0016 in <italic toggle="yes">luc</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 in <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR; T23, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 in <italic toggle="yes">luc</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 in <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR).

Luckow and Summers reported that AcMNPV-derived vectors containing 34 or 35 bases of the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> CDS achieved higher expression (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Based on this finding, donor vectors (e.g., pFastBac1) for the Bac-to-Bac system were developed and are now widely used.

Since the results of <xref rid="F1 F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 and 2</xref> were based on vectors with a long spacer and without the CDS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>), we investigated whether the TTT mutation would contribute to increased expression even when using a high-level expression vector containing the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> CDS with a seamless connection to the reporter gene. We used Luc-30, which includes 30 bp of the BmNPV <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> CDS (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), as a control and generated Luc-30-TTT by introducing the TTT mutation into the genome of Luc-30 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

In this study, we focused on the A-rich region within the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> burst sequence because a study on other viruses suggested that A-rich (poly-A) sequences upstream of viral genes contribute to their translation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> burst sequences of AcMNPV and BmNPV contain an identical A-rich sequence, and linker scanning mutagenesis at positions &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;14 of the burst sequence (with substitution of six out of nine nucleotides of the A-rich region) completely diminished the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic>-driven reporter activity in AcMNPV (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), indicating the importance of this region. In this study, we showed that the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic>-driven reporter expression decreased in Mut4, supporting the importance of the burst sequence in <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> expression. Conversely, mutations of nucleotides AAA to TTT at positions &#x02212;16 to &#x02212;14 of the burst sequence were found to increase reporter expression by four- to fivefold. This increase was observed in both BmNPV and AcMNPV, regardless of the vector type, and surprisingly, it was also observed in an OB-producing BmNPV. Given these findings, there is a need to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of this triple mutation in wild-type viruses in the wild, although we did not observe any disadvantages of them under <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> conditions (cultured cells).</p><p>In this study, we have not yet elucidated the cause of the increase in <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> mRNA levels achieved by introducing the TTT mutation. It is known that VLF-1 binds to the burst sequence, which is considered essential for the high-level expression of <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the TTT mutation increases the binding affinity of VLF-1 to the burst sequence, thereby increasing the <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic> transcription level. In future work, it will be necessary to examine this possibility using methods evaluating DNA&#x02013;protein binding, such as gel shift assay or modified chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.</p><p>Currently, almost all available BEVs employ either BmNPV or AcMNPV, and their transfer vectors and donor vectors contain burst sequences. While a previous study reported the introduction of multiple copies of burst sequences into transfer vectors (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), there have been no reports of an increase in <italic toggle="yes">polh</italic>-driven reporter expression resulting from simple nucleotide substitutions within the burst sequence. The A-rich sequences are present in almost all BEVS, and the TTT mutation can be easily introduced into the currently used BEVS. Although we have not examined whether the TTT mutation also enhances recombinant protein production in larval insects, this discovery may contribute to further improvements in productivity using BEVS, which is applied industrially for producing vaccines and veterinary medicines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Rina Hamajima for discussion, Ryuhei Kokusho for technical support, and Ryoichi Sato for providing Sf-9 cells.</p><p>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 24H02290 and 24K21831, Nagase Science and Technology Foundation, and Noda Institute for Scientific Research Grant to S.K.</p><p>S.K. conceived, designed, and performed most of the experiments.
