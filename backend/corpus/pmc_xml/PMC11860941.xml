Introduction</title><p>Porcine circovirus (PCV) belongs to the genus circovirus within the family Circoviridae. It has no envelope and contains covalently closed single-stranded circular negative-sense DNA. Currently, four serotypes of porcine circovirus have been identified, namely PCV1, PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4 [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 1991, a Canadian scholar, Clark, isolated a circovirus from diseased pigs suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Subsequently, Meehan et al. named this pathogenic circovirus porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). PCV2 is the smallest single-stranded circular DNA virus known to infect mammals, and the replication of PCV2 is heavily dependent on host cellular mechanisms [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PCV2 is also a major pathogen causing dermatitis and nephrotic syndrome, porcine interstitial pneumonia, sow reproductive disorders, infectious congenital tremors in piglets, etc. [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since its discovery in the late 1990s, PCV2 has become a major pathogen causing porcine circovirus disease (PCVD) in pig production worldwide, thus leading to huge economic losses to the global pig industry [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the pathogenic mechanism of PCV2 is still unclear, and the main natural transmission route remains oronasal contact [<xref rid="B7-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lymphocyte exhaustion and histiocyte replacement in lymphoid tissues are the hallmark lesions of PCV2 infection [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. PCV2 infection and replication in lymphoid tissues can disrupt the structure of lymphoid follicles, leading to lymphocyte exhaustion and subsequent replacement by histiocytes [<xref rid="B10-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, lymphoid follicle destruction and leukopenia associated with PCV2 infection can lead to immunosuppression in pigs. In addition, studies have demonstrated that PCV2 can replicate in bronchial and inguinal lymph nodes, the tonsils, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and thymus tissue [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown that when PCV2 infects cells, the expression of cellular genes is generally altered, including the regulation of cellular signaling pathways, the induction of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy, the enhancement of the expression of inflammation-related genes, etc. [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the widespread use of commercial vaccines has reduced the subclinical symptoms of viral infections, the rate of antigen positivity remains high in the face of mixed infections with different PCV2 genotypes, constant genotypic variation, and different clinical manifestations of infection [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, it is clear that vaccination cannot provide complete protection for the host against PCV2 infection.</p><p>Nowadays, a number of drugs with antiviral effects have been explored and developed. Natural products are a rich source of bioactive molecules and bear potential pharmaco-therapeutic functions. It has been shown that natural extracts of scopoletin, artemisinin B, and artemisinic acid (a single fraction isolated from Artemisia annua) can interfere with the viral insertion and replication process by interacting with the 3CLpro and Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which can help to combat the SARS-CoV-2 variant and other possible coronaviruses [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has also been shown that polyphenol-rich sugarcane extract (PRSE), an extract from sugarcane treated with PRSE in influenza a virus (IAV)-infected cells, can inhibit the early stages of infection and reduce viral genome replication, mRNA transcription, and viral protein expression [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, PRSE treatment also attenuates the replication of multiple H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of IAV strains [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As a result, various plant extracts and natural components are continuously being exploited for their potential value and become novel antiviral agents. However, there are still relatively few studies on PCV2 at present; this lack of in-depth research has hindered the development of more targeted and efficient strategies to deal with PCV2-related issues.</p><p>Paeoniflorin (PF) is a monoterpene glycoside compound, which is the main bioactive component of <italic toggle="yes">Paeonia lactiflora</italic> [<xref rid="B19-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During the cultivation of medicinal paeonies, the above-ground parts are often discarded as waste, resulting in a huge waste of resources. It has been recorded that PF, as an important active ingredient in paeonia lactiflora, has the ability to regulate immunity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, inhibit tumor cells, and carry out other pharmacological activities [<xref rid="B20-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Studies have shown that PF also has some therapeutic effects on viral infections. For example, some researchers have investigated the effects of PF on myocardial injury in coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis (VMC) mice and its possible mechanism of action. The results showed that PF attenuated the inflammatory response of cardiomyocytes in VMC mice, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and ameliorated the myocardial tissue injury caused by CVB3 by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Food rich in PF would be potential health-oriented foods, while natural plant extracts such as PF also have the prospect of applications as functional feed additives for livestock and poultry. As the main therapeutic component of paeonia lactiflora, PF has a wide range of applications and is a drug with great market prospects. However, studies on the effect of paeoniflorin on PCV2 are scarce, and its mechanism of action remains unclear, thus urgently awaiting our exploration.</p><p>To elucidate the role and underlying mechanism of PF in PCV2 replication, we use porcine kidney cells (PK15) as a model to investigate the effect of PF on PCV2 infection. This study first confirmed that PF significantly inhibited PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells. We then verified that the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is closely associated with PCV2 replication. Finally, we investigated the regulation of the AKT/mTOR pathway by PF and elucidated the role of PF in regulating PCV2 replication through the AKT/mTOR pathway. Herein, this study facilitates the use of PF in the treatment of PCV2 infection in the future and provides a basis for further research on the mechanism of PCV2 replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-12-00117"><title>2.

Construction of PCV2-Infected PK15 Cell Model</title><p>In order to detect the proliferation pattern of PCV2 (MOI = 1) on PK15 cells and to determine a time point for the subsequent collection of samples, we used qPCR, Western blot, and the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect the expression of the PCV2 <italic toggle="yes">CAP</italic> gene at different time points. As is shown in <xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, after the PCV2 infection of PK15 cells, the replication level of the PCV2 <italic toggle="yes">CAP</italic> gene in PK15 cells from 0 to 48 h showed an increasing trend with time. However, the expression of the PCV2 <italic toggle="yes">CAP</italic> gene in PK15 cells slightly decreased over a 48&#x02013;72 h period (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A).

Thus, we successfully established a model of PCV2-infecting PK15 cells and determined that 48 h is the peak time point for PCV2 replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-vetsci-12-00117"><title>3.3. Effect Analysis of PF on PCV2 Replication</title><p>To investigate whether PF inhibits the replication of PCV2 in PK15 cells, qPCR, Western blot, and IFA were employed to detect the expression of the PCV2 <italic toggle="yes">CAP</italic> gene. The experiment was designed with different concentrations (0 mM, 5 mM, 15 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM) and treatment methods (pre-treatment (PF was added 24 h before PCV2 addition), simultaneous treatment (PF was added simultaneously with PCV2), continuous treatment (pre-treatment + simultaneous treatment), and post-treatment (PF was added 24 h after PCV2 addition)), and the conditions at the same time points (24 h, 48 h, 72 h) were compared. In the concentration experiment, the addition of PF reduced the expression of the PCV2 <italic toggle="yes">CAP</italic> gene, suggesting its inhibitory effect on PCV2. Moreover, it was found that the inhibitory effect of paeoniflorin on PCV2 replication was enhanced with the increase in treatment concentration, showing a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). The Western blot results were consistent with the quantitative results (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). Subsequently, cells infected with PCV2 were treated with the same concentration of PF but with different treatment methods. The results indicate that when the treatment method was not used post-treatment, the expression of the PCV2 CAP gene in the PF-treated group was significantly reduced compared with that in the negative control group (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C), and the Western blot results were consistent with the quantitative results (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). In particular, the PF pre-treatment had the most obvious inhibitory effect on PCV2, suggesting the great potential of paeoniflorin as a drug for preventing PCV2. When the concentration and treatment method of PF were the same, the inhibition rate of the PCV2 <italic toggle="yes">CAP</italic> gene expression was the highest at 48 h (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E), and the Western blot results were consistent with the quantitative results (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). Samples were collected after the specified treatment time and subjected to IFA experiments. The results showed that the fluorescence expression in the PF-treated group was significantly lower than that in the negative control group (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G). Therefore, PF has a significant anti-PCV2 replication effect in PK15 cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-vetsci-12-00117"><title>3.4. Transcriptome Analysis of PK15 Cells with PF Treatment and PCV2 Infection</title><p>To explore potential regulators associated with the cellular responses to PF (200 mM) treatment, cell samples treated by PF for 48 h and corresponding controls were collected for transcriptome analysis with the RNA-seq technique. After quality control, an average of 48.9 million clean reads per sample was obtained (<xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>). Differential expression analysis was then performed to identify transcriptomic differences between the two groups. The principal component analysis plot showed a high degree of similarity between the samples and a high degree of reliability in the sequencing results (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Hierarchical clustering analysis was then performed based on expression levels to show the differences in the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes between the two groups. Differential gene grouping cluster plots showed significant differences between the blank-treated group and the PF-treated group (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Differential gene expression analysis showed that a total of 1787 differentially expressed genes were detected, with 742 differentially upregulated and 1045 differentially downregulated genes (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>). KEGG enrichment analysis of all the differentially expressed genes in the combined analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in cytokine&#x02013;cytokine receptor interactions and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D).</p><p>We then used the previous sequencing results of the subject group [<xref rid="B26-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and jointly analyzed the negative control group, the PF-treated group, and the PCV2 infection group. Differential expression analysis was then performed to identify transcriptomic differences between the two groups. We found that a total of 455 genes co-increased, 489 genes co-decreased, and 31 genes showed different trends in the comparison between the two groups. In addition, the results showed that gene expression underwent similar changes in these two groups. (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Table S4</xref>). The KEGG enrichment analysis of all the differentially expressed genes in the combined analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in cytokine&#x02013;cytokine receptor interactions, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and the MAPK signaling pathway (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Table S5</xref>). After reading the relevant literature and conducting preliminary experiments, we selected the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which ranks second in KEGG, to complete the subsequent verification and further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-vetsci-12-00117"><title>3.5. PF Modulates the AKT/mTOR Pathway to Inhibit Autophagy to Suppress PCV2 Replication</title><p>To test whether PF (200 mM) can regulate the AKT/mTOR pathway, we examined the activity of the AKT/mTOR pathway by Western blot and performed a rescue experiment utilizing the autophagy activator rapamycin. The results indicated that the addition of PF probably contributed to the activity enhancement of the AKT/mTOR pathway, while RAPA effectively inhibited this effect (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,B and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). However, the addition of RAPA diminished the efficacy of PF, resulting in a rescue of PCV2&#x02019;s inhibitory effects (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C,D and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). To further validate the results regarding the activity of the AKT/mTOR pathway, we conducted a detection of the autophagy level downstream of this pathway. The samples were divided into four groups: the blank control group, the PF-treated group, the autophagy activator RAPA-treated group, and the group treated with both PF and rapamycin. Western blot was employed to determine the expression levels of the P62 and LC3 proteins. The results demonstrated that in the PF-treated group, the expression of the LC3-II protein was significantly reduced. Conversely, in the rapamycin-treated group, the expression of the LC3-II protein was elevated. When cells were treated with both PF and rapamycin, the effect of PF on decreasing the expression of the LC3-II protein was diminished (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). For the purpose of obtaining a more comprehensive understanding, we further explored the impact of PCV2 infection on the level of cellular autophagy. Specifically, we utilized Western blot to analyze the expression levels of P62 and LC3 proteins in four distinct groups: the blank infection group, the PF-treated group after infection, the autophagy activator RAPA-treated group after infection, and the group co-treated with PF and RAPA. The results demonstrated that after PCV2 infection, the expression of the LC3-II protein was significantly enhanced. However, when PF treatment was applied, the expression of the LC3-II protein was markedly reduced. When RAPA was added to the PCV2-infected cells, the increase in LC3-II protein expression was further aggravated. When PCV2-infected cells were treated with both PF and RAPA simultaneously, the inhibitory effect of PF on the expression of the LC3-II protein was neutralized by RAPA (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F and <xref rid="app1-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>To further validate the aforementioned results, we opted to monitor autophagy flux using the lentiviral LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 vector. It should be noted that red LC3 spots represent autophagosomes and autolysosomes, while green LC3 spots only represent autophagosomes. The obtained images presented a clear pattern. PF treatment led to a decrease in yellow and red spots. Conversely, autophagy activator RAPA treatment resulted in an increase in yellow and red spots. Notably, when these two treatments were combined, the reduction in yellow and red spots was effectively attenuated (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that PF inhibits the production of intracellular autophagy by promoting the phosphorylation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. This finding not only deepens our understanding of the underlying mechanisms but also paves the way for further research and potential therapeutic applications in the context of PCV2 infection and autophagy regulation.</p><p>In order to verify the above results, we further conducted experiments on PF (200 mM) and autophagy activator RAPA-treated groups and detected the expression level of PCV2 <italic toggle="yes">CAP</italic> by Western blot and qPCR. The results indicated that PF had a significant inhibitory effect on PCV2. When we added the autophagy activator RAPA to the treatment, the results showed that the replication of the virus was promoted when RAPA was added alone, and the inhibitory effect of PF on the virus was attenuated when PF and RAPA were added together. It can be seen that RAPA counteracted the inhibitory effect of PF on virus replication. Taking the above results together, we can clearly speculate that PF reduces the replication of the virus through the inhibition of autophagy (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). Meanwhile, the results of indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot also proved this (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>B,C).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vetsci-12-00117"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In this research, we investigated the antiviral impact of paeoniflorin on PK15 cells infected with PCV2. In previous studies, paeoniflorin has been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on several human and mammalian viruses, which is assumed to be a broadly active antiviral plant extract [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The results indicated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect, highlighting a significant relationship between paeoniflorin and PCV2 infection. Upon treating PCV2-infected cells with paeoniflorin, alterations in the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were observed, implying that this compound may target this pathway. Additional experimental results revealed that the inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway by paeoniflorin promotes autophagy, which, in turn, curtails the replication and spread of PCV2 in PK15 cells. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of paeoniflorin in managing PCV2 infections post-onset and suggest its promising role as a therapeutic agent against PCV2.</p><p>To clarify the mechanism by which PF inhibits PCV2 replication, it can be stated more accurately as follows: When PF enters the cell, it targets the AKT/mTOR pathway and promotes this pathway. This promotion leads to an inhibition of autophagy. Since autophagy has been shown to be a critical process that supports PCV2 replication, the enhancement of autophagy by the inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway actually works to suppress PCV2 replication. Thus, PF effectively reduces PCV2 replication by inhibiting autophagy through the promotion of the AKT/mTOR pathway (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00117-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, there exists a close connection between the AKT/mTOR pathway and viral replication. The AKT/mTOR pathway is a significant signaling pathway that participates in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism [<xref rid="B29-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. When a virus infects a cell, it utilizes the host cell&#x02019;s signaling pathways to create favorable conditions for its own replication and survival [<xref rid="B30-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The AKT/mTOR pathway has a crucial regulatory function in viral replication. Some viruses can activate this pathway to enhance their replication. For instance, by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway, viruses like the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can modify the metabolic state of the host cells, thereby providing sufficient energy and raw materials to support viral replication [<xref rid="B31-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. During the infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is capable of elevating the viral load and the extent of liver fibrosis [<xref rid="B32-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway assumes a critical role. It regulates T-cell and mitochondrial functions, promotes HIV replication, re-activates latent HIV, and sustains the viral reservoir [<xref rid="B33-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the contrary, other viruses, such as the influenza A virus and adenovirus, choose to inhibit the AKT/mTOR pathway to take advantage of the host cell&#x02019;s antiviral mechanisms [<xref rid="B34-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Adenoviruses utilize the E1A protein to bind to transcriptional co-activators such as p300/CBP. This binding impedes the interaction between these co-activators and the transcription factors associated with the AKT/mTOR pathway. Meanwhile, the E1A protein down-regulates the expression or activity of PI3K, reducing AKT phosphorylation and thereby suppressing the AKT/mTOR pathway [<xref rid="B35-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway activates cellular autophagy. Adenoviruses take advantage of this to induce moderate autophagy, supplying essential nutrients like amino acids for viral replication and assembly. Moreover, autophagosomes can serve as sites for viral replication, enabling the virus to evade recognition and clearance by the host immune system [<xref rid="B35-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Influenza A viruses make use of the interaction between the NS1 protein and the regulatory subunit p85 of PI3K. This prevents the interaction between PI3K and AKT, inhibits AKT phosphorylation and activation, and further suppresses the AKT/mTOR pathway, thus interfering with the host cell&#x02019;s immune response [<xref rid="B36-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In doing so, these viruses can restrict the growth and proliferation of host cells and maintain their own stable state, thus evading the host&#x02019;s immune attack. In this study, we have shown that the inhibitory effect of paeoniflorin on PCV2 is achieved through activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. It is implied that the PCV2 infection inhibits the AKT/mTOR pathway to utilize the host cell&#x02019;s antiviral mechanisms to assist its own replication. Paeoniflorin, however, can attenuate this inhibition, activating the AKT/mTOR pathway to regulate the replication of PCV2.</p><p>Appropriate autophagy is a necessary condition for the host&#x02019;s defense and immune responses [<xref rid="B38-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Specifically, autophagy can serve as an effective defense mechanism against various viruses by degrading viral components or particles [<xref rid="B38-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Meanwhile, numerous studies have demonstrated that multiple viruses can induce autophagy to facilitate their replication [<xref rid="B40-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These findings indicate that autophagy has a dual role in the host&#x02019;s antiviral responses. There is growing evidence suggesting that PCV2 infection can trigger autophagic processes in both PK-15 cells and 3D4/21 cells, which promotes PCV2 replication through different mechanisms [<xref rid="B41-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Consequently, it is of great significance to investigate the mechanism of action of PF in inhibiting PCV2. In this study, it was found that not only is the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway closely related to the inhibition of PCV2 replication, but autophagy, which is downstream of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, also plays an important role [<xref rid="B43-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The research results show that PF reduces the generation of intracellular autophagy by inhibiting the autophagy induced by PCV2, thereby reducing the replication of PCV2, which takes advantage of autophagy. To conclude, the results of this study show that PF significantly inhibits PCV2 replication in PK15 cells. Specifically, PF inhibits the intracellular autophagy induced by PCV2 by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to suppress virus replication. These research findings suggest that PF could be a promising and effective drug for preventing and treating PCV2 infections.</p><p>Although this study has obtained certain achievements in investigating the mechanism of PF against PCV2 infection, it is nonetheless accompanied by several limitations. The current research is principally restricted to the cellular level, which implies a lack of comprehensive verification within a whole animal model. Consequently, this shortcoming renders it extremely challenging to conduct a thorough assessment of the therapeutic efficacy and potential side effects of PF in intricate in vivo environments during PCV2 infection. Furthermore, the detailed molecular mechanisms through which PF activates the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway suppresses autophagy and, subsequently, the impact of PCV2 replication remains inadequately elucidated. In particular, the alterations in the modification of key proteins within the pathway and their interactions with viral proteins demand further in-depth exploration.</p><p>In future studies, it is of the utmost importance to establish appropriate animal models. In doing so, a comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic properties, and safety of PF in vivo can be carried out. This evaluation can, in turn, ensure a more dependable foundation for its clinical application. Additionally, a meticulous analysis of the precise mechanism by which PF acts on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy-related molecules is indispensable [<xref rid="B45-vetsci-12-00117" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Such an analysis will permit accurate targeting and regulation of virus replication. Concurrently, delving into and capitalizing on the potential of paeoniflorin as an antiviral agent is expected to initiate new trials and introduce novel and efficient strategies for the prevention and treatment of PCV2 infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vetsci-12-00117"><title>5.
