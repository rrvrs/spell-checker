This issue poses significant challenges by decreasing the number of participants in the study population, hence lowering its statistical power, and can raise doubts about the validity of the data and outcomes derived from it (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Thygesen and Ersb&#x000f8;ll, 2014</xref>). For studies relying on patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs/PREMs), most of the data loss is attributed to non-respondents, which can lead to bias (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2022</xref>). This non-respondent bias may skew interpretations and ultimately produce unreliable conclusions (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Parai et al., 2020</xref>). How low a response rate is acceptable depends on the randomness of possible differences in baseline characteristics between respondents and non-respondents (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Kristman et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">A study based on the Norwegian nationwide spine register addressed non-respondent bias after cervical spine surgery, suggesting that while differences in baseline characteristics between non-respondents and respondents may exist, differences in patient reported outcome measures were not significant (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ingebrigtsen et al., 2023</xref>).

We extracted all purchases of drugs containing opioids made by patients from the FinSpine ACDF population. To match each patient with one surgery date in order to calculate correct time difference between drug purchase and the date of the surgery, we had to separate patients who had no previous ACDF surgery (Primary ACDF), and those who had (Non-primary ACDF). We included drug purchases containing Morphine, Hydromorphone, Oxycodone, Buprenorphine, Codeine and Tramadol as those are the opioid drugs commonly prescribed in Finland. Opioid dosages were converted to Morphine milligram equivalents (MME) using conversion factors provided by CDC in 2022 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Dowell et al., 2022</xref>). As for Buprenorphine, conversion factors were removed in 2017. We used prior factors of 12.6 and 30 for transdermal (&#x003bc;g/hr) and oral Buprenorphine MME, respectively.

Before interpreting outcome measure results and differences between respondents and non-respondents at 12 months, we studied their purchases of prescribed opioids during first post-operative year in order to validate outcome results using a large sample size, objective variable data that was not previously linked to FinSpine and found no difference between patients who had responded to FinSpine post-operative self-assessment surveys at 12 months and those who had not. We further analyzed a subpopulation of a single center, consecutive patients who underwent ACDF surgery and found no differences in outcome measures at 12 months between the same groups. Whether individuals responded to follow-up or not, their return-to-work rates were comparable, and there was no notable difference in the regular use of pain medication. Similar improvements in upper-extremity radicular pain and functional capacity were observed across the entire subcohort. The findings from the subcohort indicate that satisfied patients do not disproportionately represent the data in FinSpine, as while non-significant, all outcome measure results in subcohort lean towards respondents reporting marginally less favorable results.</p><p id="p0155">While there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes at 12 months, some differences in baseline variables were observed. In the FinSpine population, non-smoking patients, as well as those who initially reported less severe upper limb or neck pain, were more likely to respond to the surveys. It was also observed that respondents more frequently suffered from post-operative complications or had a history of cervical spine surgery. Although there was a slight variation in age among the groups, the slight difference in age could be interpreted as negligible, as the mean age for all groups fell within a 2-year range, with partial respondents being the oldest, and patients who completed all questionnaires being the youngest.</p><p id="p0160">Smoking and male gender have been previously associated with non-responding in spine register studies (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Parai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ingebrigtsen et al., 2023</xref>). The higher response rates among patients with prior cervical spine surgery could be due to increased awareness of the surveys. Additionally, patients who suffered complications after surgery might have been more inclined to respond due to the ongoing effect of the surgery on their daily lives, particularly if the resulting outcome was unfavorable.</p><p id="p0165">To our knowledge, only one study has been previously published addressing non-respondent bias in cervical spine surgery using data from national, clinical-quality register. In this Norwegian spine register (NORSpine) study, Ingebrigtsen et al. described a similar study setting for a smaller subpopulation cohort, comparing respondents and non-respondents. While their cohort was larger, they did not manage to interview 34.3% of non-respondents (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ingebrigtsen et al., 2023</xref>). Findings in the cervical spine NORSpine study and three other Nordic national clinical quality register studies focusing on lumbar spine surgery suggest similar results with no significant differences in outcome measures between respondents and non-respondents (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Elkan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f8;jmark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Solberg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0170">While a total response rate to post-operative 12-month PROM and PREM questionnaires for the FinSpine ACDF population was 39.6%, yearly average response rates have been steadily climbing year-by-year, being currently at 54&#x02013;58%. Different approaches have been reported to improve completion compliance. In 2019, in the United Kingdom, a tariff was introduced to encourage data completion in the British Spine Registry, but the tariff didn't extend to cover PROM/PREM questionnaires (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Habeebullah et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="p0175">Response rates within FinSpine vary significantly among participating centers. A few centers began participating in FinSpine without immediately implementing the PROM/PREM section, resulting in data that contained solely non-respondents from that period. Currently, to address lower response rates, more centers are appointing dedicated research coordinators to oversee the PROM/PREM response process. These efforts have led to an impressive increase in response rates, with the top-performing centers achieving 90% pre-operative and 80% post-operative response rates (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Marjamaa et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="p0180">The main strength and novelty of the current study is the use of the prospective national prescription drug register. Opioid purchases can be used as an objective surrogate outcome measure, that has no loss to follow-up and combined with the national dataset of FinSpine, covers all Finnish hospitals performing ACDF surgery. However, we must acknowledge the limitation that while the prescription drug data is complete, it does not allow us to differentiate the specific reasons for each drug purchase. Another key strength of this study is the integrity of data from the single center subcohort. Despite its relatively small size, all non-respondents were reached and interviewed, enabling a genuine comparison between respondents and non-respondents.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0185">Our results suggest that non-respondents do not skew the assessment of outcome measures following ACDF surgery at 12 months. Although it is crucial for all registers to aim for the lowest possible data attrition, the data from national clinical-quality registers like FinSpine appear to be valid and reliable. It can be argued that the outcome measure results derived from it represent the entire register population. Therefore, FinSpine and other quality register data can and should be used for further clinical research to improve patient care and to help allocate limited resources, especially in publicly funded healthcare systems.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Statements and declarations</title><p id="p0190">Nikolai Klimko received a working grant from Maire Taponen &#x02013; foundation.</p><p id="p0195">No other funding was received to assist with the preparation of this manuscript.</p><p id="p0200">The authors have no competing interests to declare that are relevant to the content of this article.</p><p id="p0205">All authors have agreed to the conditions noted in the journal's copyright agreement.</p><p id="p0210">The datasets generated and analyzed in the current study can be accessed upon approval of a permit application submitted to the Finnish social and health data permit authority, Findata, in accordance with the Finnish law on the secondary use of health and social data.</p><p id="p0215">This register study has been permitted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare with the approval from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health of Finland.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0220">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Nikolai Klimko reports financial support was provided by Maire Taponen Foundation.
