In addition, mutations conferring drug resistance can result in a transmission advantage or disadvantage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Amplicon sequencing of complexity of infection and drug resistance markers was used to analyse post-treatment stage-specific malaria parasite dynamics in human blood infections and in the midguts of mosquitoes that became infected after direct&#x000a0;membrane feeding assays&#x000a0;(DMFAs). Blood samples originated from 50 asymptomatic <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>&#x000a0;gametocyte-carrying participants. These were collected prior to treatment and&#x000a0;at five timepoints over 28&#x000a0;days following a three-day artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regimen of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or pyronaridine-artesunate at the Ou&#x000e9;less&#x000e9;bougou Clinical Research Unit of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako (Bamako, Mali).&#x000a0;At each study visit, DMFAs&#x000a0;were conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 57 <italic>Pfcsp</italic> haplotypes and 53 <italic>Pftrap</italic> haplotypes were identified, indicating high genetic diversity among parasite clones. Prior to treatment, human infections were more often polyclonal and had a higher median multiplicity of infection (MOI; 3 (IQR 2&#x02013;5)), compared to mosquito midgut infections (1 (IQR 1&#x02013;2)). At this timepoint, it is likely that some clones detected in human blood are not producing gametocytes and are, therefore, not contributing to mosquito transmission. Minority clones preferentially transmitted, and these same clones often persisted in the human blood samples post-treatment. These observations mirror the rapid decline in asexual parasite density that occurs after ACT initiation, and the more persistent circulation of gametocytes. The data, therefore, suggests that asexual gametocyte-non-producing clones outnumber the gametocyte-producing clones at baseline, yet it is these gametocyte-producing minority clones that are transmitted to and surviving in mosquitoes. Certain haplotypes were also found to be more prevalent in human samples compared to mosquito infections, and vice versa, with 12.6% of haplotypes at baseline exclusively observed in mosquitoes. Along with this, varying odds of transmission for different parasite clones were observed, indicating that there are inherent clonal differences in gametocyte productivity or viability. To assess the transmission of drug-resistant clones, the overall prevalence of molecular markers of drug resistance was determined in both human and mosquito hosts, followed by a pairwise comparison between human blood infections and paired infected midguts. This showed that Asn51Ile&#x000a0;in <italic>Pfdhfr</italic> and Lys540Glu in <italic>Pfdhps</italic> may have a transmission advantage under ACT, while Ala613Ser in <italic>Pfdhps</italic> may confer a transmission disadvantage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Overall, these findings indicate that parasite dynamics and clonal transmissibility are highly complex, even after ACT. This complexity may have important epidemiological implications, as it suggests the transmission of minority clones and highlights the impact of drug resistance markers on transmissibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12936-025-05298-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd>Gametocytes</kwd><kwd>Transmission</kwd><kwd>Comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>Genetic diversity</kwd><kwd>Artemisinin-combination therapy</kwd><kwd>Drug resistance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/T008709/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vanheer</surname><given-names>Leen N.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INV-002098</award-id><award-id>INV-002098</award-id><award-id>INV-002098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahamar</surname><given-names>Almahamoudou</given-names></name><name><surname>Dicko</surname><given-names>Alassane</given-names></name><name><surname>Drakeley</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC IAA2129, MR/R026297/1, and MR/X005895/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campino</surname><given-names>Susana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>218676/Z/19/Z/WT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stone</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">The cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transmission between human and mosquito hosts relies on the parasite&#x02019;s ability to produce gametocytes. These gametocytes, when ingested by a mosquito, transform into gametes, which undergo sexual recombination, then develop into zygotes/ookinetes, which cross the epithelial wall of the mosquito midgut to develop into oocysts. Various factors such as gametocyte viability and density, host immune responses, and the complexity of the infection can influence this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In regions where <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections are endemic, individuals are often infected by more than one parasite strain at the time, leading to polyclonal infections, which may be the result of clonal co-transmission (a single mosquito infection with multiple clones) or serial superinfections (multiple mosquito infections, each with a single clone&#x000a0;or multiple clones). This multiplicity of infection (MOI), indicating the number of clones within an infection, and the complexity of infection (COI), referring to specific genetic characteristics of these clones, are important for understanding <italic>Plasmodium</italic> epidemiological patterns and transmission dynamics. In regions with high malaria transmission and especially among asymptomatic individuals, infections usually exhibit greater multiclonality, and the various parasite clones compete with one another for replication and transmission, though the resources they compete for are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although most parasite stages are haploid, the zygote formed after fertilization in the mosquito midgut is diploid. At this stage, new parasite haplotypes emerge when genetically distinct gametocytes are transmitted to mosquitoes, where recombination occurs during sexual reproduction, increasing genetic diversity in subsequent generations.</p><p id="Par7">In polyclonal human infections, the contribution of distinct clones to transmission and their relative transmissibility have largely remained unexplored, as have the parasite genetic factors that may influence this. In addition, due to the parasite&#x02019;s complex life cycle, many different population bottlenecks and selective pressures are encountered throughout human host and organ transitions, which may intensify random genetic drift and natural selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Transmission represents a major population bottleneck in the parasite life cycle, as natural mosquito infections typically harbour only about 2&#x02013;5 oocysts, in contrast to the approximately 10<sup>11</sup> asexual parasites found in an infected host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a prior study of transmission using naturally-infected paired human and mosquito samples, haplotype diversity was found to be greater in mosquitoes than in humans, establishing the mosquito vector as a reservoir of genetic diversity in the malaria parasite populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This finding is seemingly contradictory to observations that not all clones present in the human blood transmit to mosquitoes. This could indicate a new infection which may not have had time yet to generate mature gametocytes, or a potential failure to produce gametocytes altogether [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, transmission of clones that were undetectable in the blood stream was reported in multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and it is commonly observed that not all individuals with confirmed gametocytes are able to infect mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such observations may be more likely to reflect the density dependence of successful transmission, the technical limitations in detecting low density clones, or the activity of human or mosquito immune transmission blockage, rather than genetic unviability.</p><p id="Par9">Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the current first-line treatment for uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria, however, its gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking effects vary widely. After treatment with commonly used artemisinin-based combinations, such as dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), pyronaridine-artesunate (PY-AS) or artesunate-amodiaquine, gametocytes and transmission can persist up to 28&#x000a0;days after treatment initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A recent study found that post-treatment parasite dynamics of blood stage parasites are highly complex despite efficacious treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Post-treatment parasite dynamics in both human blood and cognate infected mosquito midguts remain unstudied.</p><p id="Par10">The rise of anti-malarial drug resistance has driven the adoption of new therapeutic approaches. Investigating the effect of drug resistance on transmissibility is crucial, as any transmission advantages conferred by resistance-linked mutations could expedite the spread of these dangerous parasite strains and compound a developing public health crisis. Studies have shown evidence of increased gametocytaemia and increased transmission in infections with chloroquine (CQ) resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites, compared to infections with parasites sensitive to this anti-malarial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), it has been found that resistant parasites produce more gametocytes, but their transmission potential remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, host-specific selection of drug resistant polymorphisms has been observed, reporting contrasting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <italic>Pfdhfr</italic> gene in human and mosquito hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">This study characterises parasite clones and investigates the clonal transmissibility of 50 naturally-infected asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocyte carriers at different timepoints following a course of ACT (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or pyronaridine-artesunate) treatment in South-Western Mali, a region of intense malaria transmission, where high SP resistance and persistent chloroquine resistance have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Gametocyte carriage was an essential recruitment criterion, allowing for inference of parasite stage identity based on the differential clearance times of sexual and asexual stage parasites after ACT. In addition, the relatedness of molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance and transmission potential is investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site, sample collection and feeding assays</title><p id="Par12">Human blood samples of 50 individuals with microscopy detectable <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes (&#x02265;&#x02009;1 gametocyte against 500 white blood cells on thick smear, equating to&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;16 gametocytes per &#x003bc;L of blood with an assumed WBC density of 8000/&#x003bc;L blood), and mosquitoes infected by direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) were obtained from a clinical trial performed in Mali in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1).

The results highlight the important role of gametocyte complexity and infectivity in creating the extensive diversity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genotypes found in infected individuals, in this area of seasonal transmission.</p><p id="Par24">In baseline human blood stage parasites, 88.4% (38/43) of infections were polyclonal, and frequencies of drug resistance molecular markers were consistent with previous reports from this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As mosquitoes were dissected 7&#x000a0;days after feeding, any residual parasite material from the blood meal would have been eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Prior to treatment, minority clones were preferentially transmitted to mosquitoes. This may be due to majority clones representing new infections that consist predominantly of asexual parasites, which are present at higher densities than the&#x02019;minority&#x02019; gametocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. New infections may not have had sufficient time to produce gametocytes, while gametocytes may represent a greater proportion of the parasite biomass in older infections. Alternatively, this observation aligns with the hypothesis of Berry et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reporting a selective advantage of minority clones in the vector; one biological hypothesis for this preferential transmission would be the maintenance of genetic diversity in the parasite population, which may be important with respect to the spread of drug resistance polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These findings of clones detectable exclusively in the mosquito confirm previous reports that gametocytes present in blood stage infections at undetectable densities, potentially due to selective amplification of asexual parasites, are infectious for the mosquito vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast with a study observing higher genetic diversity in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], a higher clonality in human blood samples compared to infected mosquito midguts was found&#x000a0;in this study. This could be attributed to the naturally infected mosquitoes that were investigated in that study, as compared to experimentally infected&#x000a0;mosquitoes that were investigated here. Naturally infected mosquitoes can have taken multiple feeds on infected hosts, allowing parasite strains to accumulate in the mosquito abdomen. Comparing pre- and post-ACT, clones that persisted in the blood generally shared identity with clones present in cognate mosquitoes, as expected based on prior reports showing the persistence of gametocytes after most standard treatments, with the exception of artemether-lumefantrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These gametocyte-producing clones can persist until day 28 in some individuals, even after re-treatment with an ACT at day 21, supporting the addition of a single-low dose of primaquine to accelerate gametocyte clearance and preventing transmission.</p><p id="Par25">A transmission advantage caused by a certain genetic variation can be the result of a higher gametocyte production, a higher gametocyte longevity or a more efficient fertilisation. The latter is evidenced by cases of gametocyte-producing clones after treatment that fail to infect mosquitoes, confirming that factors other than gametocyte density play a role in establishing oocyst development. Advantages in human-to-mosquito transmission have previously been observed in chloroquine-resistant parasites strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and more recently in artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites under artemisinin drug pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant isolates were found to produce more gametocytes, but with unknown effect on transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this study, nanopore sequencing was used to identify molecular markers of drug resistance and assess their prevalence in blood stage parasites at 48&#x000a0;h after ACT initiation and in matched infected mosquito midguts. The polymorphisms Asn51Ile in <italic>Pfdhfr,</italic> conferring pyrimethamine resistance<italic>,</italic> and Lys540Glu in <italic>Pfdhps,</italic> conferring sulfadoxine resistance, appeared to have a transmission advantage. In addition, Ala613Ser in <italic>Pfdhps</italic> was significantly more prevalent in human blood samples than in infected midguts and could, therefore, be associated with a transmission disadvantage. Notably, the Lys540Glu and Ala613Ser variants in <italic>Pfdhps</italic> were never observed together in the same infection. These mutations may be rendering the parasite intrinsically more or less infectious, in the absence of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug pressure. In vitro studies introducing these polymorphisms with gene editing are needed to investigate a causal relationship between the polymorphisms and a change in parasite transmissibility. Additionally, a small but statistically insignificant transmission disadvantage of drug resistance marker Lys76Thr in <italic>Pfcrt</italic>, linked to chloroquine resistance, was observed, which is consistent with a previous report from Zambia showing preferential transmission of the wild-type (Lys76) form of <italic>Pfcrt</italic> compared to the mutant 76Thr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], while another study found similar frequencies of wild-type and mutant <italic>Pfcrt</italic> alleles in gametocytes and sporozoite samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Monitoring the relative infectivity of drug-resistant mutations, including <italic>Pfkelch13</italic> mutations in areas with artemisinin partial resistance, may help model the spread of resistance.</p><p id="Par26">This study had several limitations. Firstly, many infected midguts failed to amplify parasite DNA by PCR in the complexity of infection assay. This could be due to the midgut storage conditions and sensitivity of the assay. Consequently, the data presented here may have incurred a density bias, if midguts with a higher number of oocysts were more likely to be amplified compared to those with a lower number of oocysts. Although the median number of oocysts in infected midguts that amplified was identical to the midguts that did not amplify (median oocyst density of 1), the 75th percentile was higher in the amplified group (IQR 1&#x02013;4 vs. IQR 1&#x02013;2), indicating that a certain degree of density bias may have occurred. In addition, the mosquitoes used in the feeding assays were insectary-reared and, therefore, may be genetically different and have less overall genetic diversity than the natural population of mosquitoes in Mali. As the insectary-reared mosquitoes likely harbour low genetic diversity in midgut receptors for parasite invasion and development, this could affect transmission results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the drug resistance polymorphisms assessed may not be selected for by the anti-malarial treatments administered in this study, and no artemisinin partial resistance has been reported in Mali to date. Complexity of infection markers and the drug resistance markers only represent a very small portion of the genome and it is not currently possible to &#x0201c;phase&#x0201d; this genotypic data. Therefore, the complexity of infection data cannot be linked to the observed frequencies of drug resistance markers for a specific sample. For example, in a blood sample containing four parasite clones, it is unfeasible to determine which clones possess drug resistance polymorphisms and which do not. There is a need for bioinformatic tools that enable phasing of this genetic variation in polyclonal infections, as this would offer valuable insights into whether drug resistance is present in the minority or majority parasite clone and whether transmitting or non-transmitting gametocyte-producing clones are drug resistant. Parasite sexual recombination takes place inside in the mosquito, leading to the creation of new parasite haplotypes; however, as another consequence of the short segments that were assessed in this study, it is highly unlikely that meiotic recombination occurred in the sequenced portion of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This suggests that the analysis presented here may have underestimated the parasite genomic diversity in infected mosquitoes. Finally, a study with a larger sample size and a wider range of infection densities is needed to draw epidemiological conclusions about which age groups have a higher multiplicity of infection and infectivity.</p><p id="Par27">Overall, preferential transmission of minority parasite clones and putatively gametocyte-producing clones with SP resistance-conferring polymorphisms was observed in our study. These findings underscore the intricate nature of parasite-parasite and host-parasite interactions in their natural environments. They further stress the need for both fundamental and field studies to assess the importance of genetic and biological parasite and vector characteristics in driving parasite transmission. Molecular characterization of transmission could prove beneficial in the fight against drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
