Unfortunately, no specific treatment for NEC is currently available, making it crucial to further investigate its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to identify the key target gene, CHI3L1, which was significantly upregulated in the intestinal tissues of both affected children and model mice from the GEO database. CHI3L1 is known to play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses, as well as in tissue damage and repair, all of which are closely associated with the development of NEC. We conducted validations at both the cellular and animal levels, demonstrating that the inhibition or knockdown of CHI3L1 significantly reduced the severity of NEC. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the knockdown of CHI3L1 inhibited the PI3K-Akt-FoxO1 signalling pathway, alleviating excessive autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells and subsequently reducing injury and inflammatory responses. Clinical studies have revealed that elevated serum CHI3L1 expression in paediatric patients is associated with both the occurrence and severity of necrotising enterocolitis NEC, demonstrating positive correlations with the Duke Abdominal Assessment Scale (DAAS), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), red cell distribution width (RDW), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In conclusion, our findings confirmed a close relationship between CHI3L1 and the occurrence and severity of NEC, suggesting that it may mitigate inflammatory responses and tissue damage by alleviating excessive autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, targeting CHI3L1 may be an effective strategy to combat NEC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Infant necrotizing enterocolitis</kwd><kwd>Paediatric research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82271741), Jiangsu Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission Medical Research Project (ZD2021013), Suzhou Health Leaders Program (GSWS2022055), Soochow University Translational Platform Program (ML13101523), and &#x0201c;Suiyuan&#x0201d; Clinical Research Program (SY003)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Cell Death Differentiation Association (ADMC) 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract, commonly observed in preterm infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With advancements in perinatal medicine and neonatal critical care, the survival rate of preterm infants has significantly improved; however, the incidence of NEC remains high, with an overall mortality rate of 20&#x02013;30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While the pathogenesis of NEC is not yet fully understood, researchers believe that perinatal factors impact the immature intestinal tract of preterm infants, leading to an excessive inflammatory response and tissue damage to the intestinal barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, no specific treatment for NEC and its management primarily involves conservative surgical approaches. Unfortunately, children who undergo surgical treatment often experience long-term growth and neurodevelopmental delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, exploring the pathogenesis of NEC and identifying new specific targets for its prevention and treatment are of great significance.</p><p id="Par3">RNA sequencing is an essential method for analysing the entire transcriptome, focusing on transcript identification and gene expression quantification. This technique offers a broader detection range, greater reproducibility, and more reliable analytical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It has been extensively utilised in the investigation of disease-specific mechanisms underlying NEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Significant differences exist in the responses to intestinal injury between humans and mice, despite the increasingly detailed insights gained from NEC mouse models. These disparities may contribute to the failure of many therapies that have shown promise in preclinical animal studies to be successfully translated into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, identifying the shared mechanisms between necrotic intestinal tissue in mouse models of NEC and human children affected by NEC is crucial for achieving successful clinical translation.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we integrated transcriptomic data from the intestinal tissues of children with NEC and animal models to identify the differentially expressed target gene CHI3L1, which was significantly upregulated in both human and mouse transcriptomic datasets. Based on the biological functions of this gene, we hypothesised that CHI3L1 may play a critical role in NEC pathogenesis. Consequently, we initiated investigations at the cellular, animal, and clinical levels to explore the role of CHI3L1 in mediating excessive inflammatory responses and injury to the intestinal epithelium, as well as the signalling pathways that may be involved. These findings offer new insights and potential targets for interventions for the prevention and treatment of NEC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CHI3L1 is expressed at high levels in children with NEC and animal models</title><p id="Par5">Differential gene identification was performed on NEC datasets (GSE46619, GSE64801, and GSE212694), revealing 739 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GSE212694 (410 upregulated and 329 downregulated), 600 DEGs in GSE46619 (130 upregulated and 470 downregulated), and 776 DEGs in GSE64801 (369 upregulated and 407 downregulated) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). In total, 795 upregulated DEGs were identified across the three datasets, with 12 common upregulated DEGs shared among them (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Among these, CHI3L1 was significantly expressed in the NEC group across all three datasets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), whereas it was almost undetectable in the control group. A literature review indicated that CHI3L1 exhibits strong biological activity, regulating various pathophysiological processes and playing a key role in inflammation, immune response, tissue damage, and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesised that CHI3L1 is crucial for NEC onset and progression. Western blot analysis demonstrated that freshly collected intestinal tissues from children with NEC exhibited higher CHI3L1 protein expression than those from controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). IHC of intestinal tissues indicated that CHI3L1 expression was significantly elevated in the epithelial layer of the small intestine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). We also confirmed that CHI3L1 levels were significantly increased in the NEC animal model, coinciding with a notable decrease in levels of the barrier proteins ZO-1 and occludin and a significant elevation in levels of IL-1&#x003b2; <italic>(p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). IHC analysis of animal intestinal tissues further demonstrated that CHI3L1 was highly expressed in the epithelial layer of the NEC group, whereas it was barely detectable in the control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Additionally, CHI3L1 was found to be directly correlated with the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and Spearman correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between CHI3L1 levels and IL-1&#x003b2; (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.642, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and IL-6 (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.546, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). In conclusion, the high expression of CHI3L1 in the intestinal tissues of patients with NEC suggests that it may play a significant role in NEC development.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Screening for the high expression of CHI3L1, a gene shared by children with NEC and animal models of NEC.</title><p><bold>A</bold>&#x02013;<bold>C</bold> Analysis of co-expressed genes in human and mouse NEC using data from the GEO database, which revealed significant changes in CHI3L1. <bold>D</bold> Western blot analysis showing the expression of CHI3L1 in clinically collected intestinal tissues from patients with NEC and controls. <bold>E</bold> Immunohistochemical analysis of CHI3L1 expression in representative images from patients with NEC and controls.

During the modelling process, the survival rate of mice in the inhibitor group was significantly higher than that in the NEC group, and NEC mice showed notably reduced weight loss (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B&#x02013;D</xref>). Comparison of the intestinal tissues among the groups after modelling revealed that the intestinal length in the NEC group was shorter than that in both the control and control + K284-611 groups. However, the intestines of the NEC&#x02009;+&#x02009;K284-611 group were longer than those of the NEC group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). HE staining of 1-cm segments of intestinal tissue from the upper ileum showed that the intestinal villi in the control and control + K284-611 groups were regularly and neatly arranged, with the submucosal layer closely connected to the lamina propria. In contrast, the intestinal structure of the NEC group was compromised, resulting in severe villous damage. Importantly, the integrity of the intestinal villi was restored following inhibition of CHI3L1 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Western blot of intestinal tissues indicated that the levels of barrier proteins ZO-1 and occludin were significantly lower in the NEC group than in the control and control + K284-611 groups. Additionally, levels of the inflammatory factors IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 were significantly elevated in the NEC group. After inhibiting CHI3L1, the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin significantly increased, whereas IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 levels significantly decreased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated a marked increase in ZO-1 expression in intestinal tissues following CHI3L1 inhibition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Furthermore, intestinal IHC revealed a significant decrease in Ki67 expression in the NEC group, which was notably elevated after the inhibition of CHI3L1 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>), suggesting that the inhibition of CHI3L1 promoted intestinal cell proliferation in mice with NEC. Collectively, these results indicated that inhibition of CHI3L1 in vivo can reduce the severity of NEC.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>In vivo inhibition of CHI3L1 reduces the severity of NEC.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Four groups of mice were established: Ctrl, Ctrl+K284-611, NEC, and NEC&#x02009;+&#x02009;K284-611. <bold>B</bold>&#x02013;<bold>E</bold> Body size, survival curves, changes in body weight, and intestinal gross morphology of the different groups of mice. <bold>F</bold> HE-stained intestinal sections with representative images from each group. <bold>G</bold> Western blot analysis showing the expression of CHI3L1, ZO-1, Occludin, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 proteins in the different groups of mice. <bold>H</bold> Representative immunofluorescence images of ZO-1 in the various groups. <bold>I</bold> Representative immunohistochemical images of Ki67 in the different groups.

To further investigate the effect of CHI3L1 on NEC, we established an IEC-6 cell line with low CHI3L1 expression using siRNA (knockdown group). Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in CHI3L1 protein expression in the knockdown group, which effectively reversed the LPS-induced decrease in ZO-1 protein expression and reduced the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Immunofluorescence analysis also demonstrated that CHI3L1 knockdown significantly mitigated LPS-induced loss of the barrier protein ZO-1 caused by LPS treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). CCK-8 assays confirmed that LPS exposure led to a marked decrease in the viability of IEC-6 cells compared to the nc and knockdown groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In contrast, CHI3L1 knockdown significantly enhanced cell viability, which was consistent with the results of the EdU assay, showing a considerable increase in the percentage of positive cells and enhanced cell proliferation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C, D</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Subsequent scratch-healing assays indicated that CHI3L1 knockdown alleviated LPS-induced migration inhibition caused by LPS in IEC-6 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). These findings suggest that CHI3L1 knockdown significantly improved LPS-induced proliferation and migration in IEC-6 cells. Inflammatory factors were also markedly reduced in the CHI3L1 knockdown model. To evaluate the anti-apoptotic effect, flow cytometry was used to assess the percentage of apoptotic cells, revealing that apoptosis in the si+LPS group was significantly lower than that in the nc+ LPS group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Overall, these results indicate that the protective effect of CHI3L1 knockdown on NEC may be linked to its capacity to restore intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and migration and to reduce apoptosis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Knockdown of CHI3L1 inhibits apoptosis and inflammatory response while promoting proliferation, migration, and barrier repair in NEC intestinal epithelial cells.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Western blot analysis showing the expression of CHI3L1, ZO-1, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 proteins across different groups of cells. <bold>B</bold> Representative immunofluorescence images of ZO-1 in IEC-6 cells with and without CHI3L1 knockdown.

We identified 847 DEGs in the nc&#x02009;+&#x02009;LPS group compared with the nc group, with 508 upregulated and 339 downregulated genes. Compared to the nc+LPS group, we found 493 DEGs in the si&#x02009;+&#x02009;LPS group, comprising 197 upregulated and 296 downregulated genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). As illustrated in the Venn diagram, 1 215 DEGs were identified when comparing the two groups, and we focused on the rightmost 368 genes for further pathway analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway along with the FoxO signalling pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). To verify whether CHI3L1 knockdown influenced this pathway, we analysed the protein expression levels using western blotting. The results indicated that the levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT significantly increased, whereas FoxO1 levels significantly decreased in the nc+LPS group. However, after CHI3L1 knockdown, the elevation of p-AKT and p-PI3K, as well as the decrease in FoxO1, were reversed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). These findings suggest that CHI3L1 knockdown alleviates NEC in vitro by partially inhibiting the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and that FoxO1, which is known to be associated with autophagy, plays a critical role in NEC development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesised that CHI3L1 may regulate autophagy through the PI3K-AKT-FoxO1 pathway and performed IHC for the LC3 protein, a key autophagy biomarker, in the small intestinal tissues of children, revealing significant activation of autophagy in NEC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). Western blot analysis at the cellular level showed that the LC3II/I ratio was significantly increased in the NEC group. In contrast, CHI3L1 knockdown led to a significant decrease in LC3II expression (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), indicating the inhibition of excessive autophagy activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Furthermore, we utilised the AD-stubRFP-sensGFP-mLC3B adenovirus to monitor the occurrence of autophagosomes and autolysosome in IEC-6 cells. The NEC group exhibited a marked increase in autophagosomes, alongside a rise in autolysosome compared to controls. Following CHI3L1 knockdown, the number of autophagosomes was significantly decreased (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), whereas autolysosome levels remained unaltered. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>).

A joint intersection analysis of public databases revealed that CHI3L1 is significantly upregulated in NEC, a finding that was further confirmed at the human, animal, and cellular levels. In vitro and ex vivo validations demonstrated that both inhibition and knockdown of CHI3L1 significantly improved NEC-related phenotypes. Further mechanistic investigations indicated that this effect might be mediated through the PI3K-AKT-FoxO1 signalling pathway, which regulates autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells. Collectively, these results suggested that CHI3L1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NEC. To assess its predictive efficacy for NEC, we examined clinical serum samples and found that CHI3L1 was significantly overexpressed in NEC cases and correlated with disease severity. The potential mechanism by which CHI3L1 is involved in the occurrence and development of NEC is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Mechanistic and clinical studies on the possible involvement of CHI3L1 in intestinal epithelial injury in NEC.</title><p>We identified the key target gene, CHI3L1, which was significantly upregulated in the intestinal tissues of both affected children and model mice from the GEO database.

Mechanistic investigations revealed that the knockdown of CHI3L1 inhibited the PI3K-Akt-FoxO1 signalling pathway, alleviating excessive autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells, and subsequently reducing injury and inflammatory responses. Moreover, clinical studies indicated that high serum levels of CHI3L1 in children correlate with increased incidence and severity of NEC, as well as with DAAS, CRP, PCT, RDW, and LDH.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41420_2025_2443_Fig6_HTML" id="d33e685"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">CHI3L1 is widely distributed throughout the body and is primarily produced by stellate cells, fibroblast-like cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It regulates a variety of pathophysiological processes, including programmed cell death, oxidative damage, activation of the inflammatory response, M2 macrophage differentiation, and Th1/Th2 inflammatory balance, thereby playing a crucial role in inflammation and immune responses as well as tissue injury and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. CHI3L1 is overexpressed in various inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We conducted differential gene identification and interaction analysis in the present study using GEO databases across multiple NEC datasets. Our findings revealed that CHI3L1 was significantly overexpressed across all NEC cases, a result that was further validated in intestinal tissues, animal models, and cellular models in children with NEC.</p><p id="Par12">Previous in vitro studies using human colonic epithelial cell lines have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF&#x003b1;, induce high expression of CHI3L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the animal experiments conducted in this study, we found that the upregulation of CHI3L1 levels was positively correlated with the inflammatory markers IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, which subsequently contributed to the impairment of the intestinal barrier. These findings suggest a close relationship between elevated CHI3L1 expression and increased levels of inflammatory factors in intestinal tissues.</p><p id="Par13">To the best of our knowledge, no study has specifically linked CHI3L1 to NEC. However, studies on colitis have shown that CHI3L1 enhances bacterial adhesion and invasion in colonic epithelial cells while activating specific cell signalling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells to exacerbate intestinal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In our study, using the IEC-6 cell line, transcriptome analysis of the CHI3L1 knockdown line indicated that CHI3L1 might target the PI3K-Akt-FoxO1 pathway to regulate the occurrence of NEC. FoxO1 is closely associated with the development of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], a key regulator of immune-inflammatory responses and cell death. Previous studies have established the important role of autophagy in the development of NEC in intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similarly, we found that autophagy was significantly activated in the intestinal tissues of children with NEC. Further analysis revealed an increase in the conversion of LC3I to LC3II in NEC cells, which was reversed by CHI3L1 knockdown. Because autophagy and apoptosis are closely related to cellular self-destructive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], changes in autophagy levels play a crucial role in the fate of the intestinal epithelium in NEC. In this study, we observed that both the levels of autophagy and the degree of apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells were alleviated to varying extents following CHI3L1 knockdown. Nevertheless, we found a small number of autolysosomes in the in vitro model induced by LPS for 48&#x02009;h, suggesting that autophagolysosomal function may be impaired in NEC. Importantly, the knockdown of CHI3L1 did not alter the level of autolysosomes but significantly reduced the conversion of LC3I to LCII and the number of autophagosomes, indicating that an increase in autophagosomes along with dysfunctional autolysosomes can lead to the accumulation of damaged organelles and toxic protein aggregates, as well as increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This can trigger an inflammatory cascade, which is consistent with the mechanisms underlying NEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and aligns with our findings. Therefore, based on our experimental results, we propose that CHI3L1 knockdown does not affect autophagy by altering the lysosomal pathways. Instead, it reduces autophagic flux in the intestinal epithelium by inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes, leading to decreased cellular autophagy and ultimately impacting the outcome of NEC.</p><p id="Par14">The role of CHI3L1 in inflammatory diseases was first identified in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, where serum CHI3L1 levels were significantly elevated during periods of disease activity and were positively correlated with two pro-inflammatory markers, IL-6 and CRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, serum CHI3L1 levels have been shown to correlate with disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To further validate the clinical predictive value of CHI3L1 for NEC, we measured serum samples from children diagnosed with NEC. Our findings revealed that the serum CHI3L1 levels in patients with NEC were significantly higher than those in the control group, with levels increasing further as the condition worsened. In addition, our correlation analysis of serum CHI3L1 and laboratory indicators in preterm infants revealed that serum CHI3L1 levels were positively correlated with CRP, PCT, RDW, and LDH levels. Elevated CRP, PCT, and RDW levels all indicate the presence of infection and a highly active inflammatory response in the body. While CRP and PCT are well-established markers, RDW has been less studied. In critically ill infants with infections, increased RDW levels also suggest excessive inflammatory responses, which may be related to inflammatory cytokines suppressing erythropoiesis and promoting erythrocyte apoptosis through multiple pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Elevated serum LDH concentrations indicate increased intestinal permeability, reflecting intestinal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This demonstrates that the intensity of systemic inflammatory responses and the degree of intestinal damage are closely associated with serum CHI3L1 levels, though the underlying mechanisms connecting these indicators require further investigation. Furthermore, ROC curve analysis showed that combining serum CHI3L1 with traditional inflammatory markers provides superior predictive efficacy for NEC, suggesting CHI3L1&#x02019;s potential as a biomarker for NEC prediction. Future multi-centre clinical studies should be conducted to further validate its predictive value for NEC onset.</p><p id="Par15">This study has certain limitations. The human NEC RNA-seq data from NCBI lacked matched gestational age and birth weight between control and NEC groups. To effectively control the impact of this confounding factor on gene expression analysis, we implemented the following dual strategies: First, we identified stable core gene sets through intersection analysis of multiple datasets, then conducted validation using a strictly matched study cohort (1:1 matching for gestational age and birth weight). This approach effectively mitigated the influence of data heterogeneity on research conclusions, ultimately yielding reliable experimental results. Secondly, we did not develop CHI3L1 knockout mice to further elucidate the precise mechanism underlying NEC development using in vivo experiments. In terms of mechanistic investigation, we have not yet explored the specific mechanisms underlying CHI3L1&#x02019;s interaction with autophagosome maturation. However, these aspects will constitute a primary focus in our subsequent research endeavours.</p><p id="Par16">In conclusion, our study is the first to highlight the critical role of CHI3L1 in the mechanism underlying NEC development. The upregulation of CHI3L1, which is associated with inflammatory mediators, may contribute to excessive autophagy and apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells through the PI3K-Akt-FoxO1 pathway. We also established a correlation between CHI3L1 levels and clinical NEC by using biospecimen assays. Future multicentre studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate the reliability of these findings. Our results provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NEC, suggesting that targeting CHI3L1 may be an effective strategy for combating this condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Clinical research and biological sample collection</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study objectives and methods</title><p id="Par17">Following approval from the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Soochow University (Approval No. 2023CS125) and informed consent from the guardians of the patients, we initiated a prospective and dynamic collection of clinical data, laboratory tests, imaging, and biological samples.

The slides were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilised with 1% Triton-X100 for 5&#x02009;min. Following this, the slides were blocked with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 2&#x02009;h and incubated with the target antibody overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The working solution of the secondary antibody was prepared and added to the corresponding wells (protected from light), incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02009;h, and subsequently stained with DAPI. Observations and photographs were taken using a confocal microscope (Olympus, New York, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title><p id="Par32">TEM was used to analyse the ultrastructural characteristics of each group of IEC-6 cells. After fixation, samples were dehydrated and embedded in resin to prepare ultrathin sections. These sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to enhance contrast before examination via TEM at the appropriate accelerating voltage. The resulting images were captured and analysed to observe organelles and other fine structures (Hitachi TEM System, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Western blot</title><p id="Par33">The samples were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer, and the lysates were centrifuged after sonication to obtain the supernatant (12000&#x02009;rpm, 30&#x02009;min). Equal volumes of protein samples were electrophoresed on a 12&#x02013;20% precast gel (Genscript, China) and subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked with skim milk for 2&#x02009;h at room temperature. Subsequently, the corresponding primary antibody was added and incubated at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C overnight. After three washes with TBST, the secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1&#x02009;h at room temperature, then washed again three times with TBST. Finally, an ECL luminescence system was employed to visualise the protein bands, which were quantified using ImageJ software. See the supplementary material for original images of the western blot.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p id="Par34">Total RNA was extracted from the mouse ileum using TRIzol (Vazyme), and its concentration was measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. RNA was then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (HiScript II Q Select RT SuperMix for qPCR + gDNA wiper; Vazyme). The resulting cDNA product served as a template for qPCR, which was conducted using the AceQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) on a qPCR detection system (Bio-Rad, California, USA). Relative gene expression was analysed using the 2-&#x00394;&#x00394;CT method, with &#x003b2;-actin employed as the internal reference gene.
