This syndrome is usually characterized by a young woman with the illusion that a man whom she considers to be of a higher social or professional position is in love with her.

Consultations in the emergency room occur on a couple of occasions due to mild behavioral alterations secondary to messages and communications that he reports receiving where said love is confirmed. Despite readjustments, there continues to be an increase in clinical symptoms due to abandonment of medication, finally producing serious alterations aimed at the search for said therapist, finally culminating in admission to the acute care unit for containment of said condition.</p></sec><sec id="sec8483"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objetives is the diferencial diagnosis, in this case symptoms could be classified as positive symptoms of schizophrenia, although it is its own nosological entity.</p></sec><sec id="sec8484"><title>Methods</title><p>.</p></sec><sec id="sec8485"><title>Results</title><p>.</p></sec><sec id="sec8486"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This patient represents a classic example of De Clerambault syndrome and is a faithful expression of the recurrent syndrome associated with delusions of grandeur, eroticism and jealousy.
