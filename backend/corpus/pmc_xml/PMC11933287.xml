Specifically, age estimation of young animals is very important for animal rehabilitation centers because it may determine if the animal should be taken in and, if so, what care is optimal for its rehabilitation. Accurate age estimation is also important to determine the growth pattern of an individual, and it is needed to correctly interpret the influence of early body condition on its growth trajectories. The purpose of our study was to find body measurements that function as good age estimators in young (up to 3 months old) harbor seals (<italic toggle="yes">Phoca vitulina vitulina</italic>), placing emphasis on noninvasive techniques that can be used in the field. To meet this goal, body mass (BM), dorsal standard length (DSL), upper canine length (CL), body condition (BC), and sex were determined from 45 Harbor Seal pups of known age. Generalized additive mixed models were fitted to find how well these morphometric measures predicted age, and the results from the selected model were used to compute growth curves and to create a practical table to determine the age of young animals in the field. We found that both DSL and CL&#x02014;and to some extent sex&#x02014;were useful predictors for estimating age in young harbor seals and that the growth rate of pups raised in captivity is significantly lower than for those raised in the wild. In addition, we found no evidence for compensatory growth, given that animals that arrived at the center with a poor BM or BC continued to show lower BM or BC throughout almost the entire rehabilitation period.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Study on young harbor seals reveals that body measurements such as body and teeth length can accurately estimate their age, aiding in conservation and rehabilitation efforts.

Espec&#x000ed;ficamente, la estimaci&#x000f3;n de la edad de animales j&#x000f3;venes es muy importante para los centros de rehabilitaci&#x000f3;n, ya que puede determinar si el animal joven debe ser ingresado y, en caso afirmativo, qu&#x000e9; cuidados espec&#x000ed;ficos ser&#x000ed;an los &#x000f3;ptimos para su rehabilitaci&#x000f3;n. La estimaci&#x000f3;n precisa de la edad tambi&#x000e9;n es importante para determinar el patr&#x000f3;n de crecimiento de un individuo, y es necesaria para interpretar correctamente la influencia de la condici&#x000f3;n corporal temprana en sus trayectorias de crecimiento. El prop&#x000f3;sito de nuestro estudio era encontrar medidas corporales que funcionen como buenos estimadores de edad en focas comunes j&#x000f3;venes (de hasta 3 meses de edad; <italic toggle="yes">Phoca vitulina vitulina</italic>), poniendo &#x000e9;nfasis en t&#x000e9;cnicas no invasivas que puedan usarse en el campo. Para alcanzar este objetivo, se ha medido la masa corporal (BM), la longitud dorsal est&#x000e1;ndar (DSL), la longitud del canino superior (CL), la condici&#x000f3;n corporal (BC) y el sexo de 45 cr&#x000ed;as de foca com&#x000fa;n de edad conocida.

Descubrimos, por un lado, que tanto DSL como CL, y hasta cierto punto el sexo, parecen ser predictores importantes para estimar la edad en focas comunes j&#x000f3;venes, y, por otro, que la tasa de crecimiento de las cr&#x000ed;as alimentadas en cautividad es significativamente menor que la de las criadas en la naturaleza.

Moreover, age estimation of mammals is especially important for animal rehabilitation centers because it may determine if an animal should be taken in and, if so, what specific care is optimal for its rehabilitation. Knowing the correct age not only provides insights into population structure and expected growth patterns but also recognizes the age-dependent relationship between food and growth. Additionally, having accurate age information facilitates the assessment of whether animals arriving in a relatively poor state demonstrate accelerated growth during rehabilitation, also known as compensatory growth (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Metcalfe and Monaghan 2001</xref>). Compensatory growth can help an organism catch up after a period of slowed growth, but may reduce the quality of its physical traits, emphasizing the importance of considering other strategies such as allowing more time to reach normal body mass.</p><p>Historically, Atlantic harbor seals (<italic toggle="yes">Phoca vitulina vitulina</italic>), called harbor seals hereafter, have been rehabilitated in the Netherlands since the 1950s when the first rehabilitation center was built on the island of Texel. Rehabilitation efforts aimed to fight the decrease in population numbers due to hunting and outbreaks of the phocine distemper virus in 1988 and 2002 (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brasseur 2018</xref>). Despite the Wadden Sea housing the largest harbor seal population in Europe with approximately 33,300 individuals (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Common Wadden Sea Secretariat 2022</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Galatius et al. 2023</xref>), the practice rehabilitating harbor seals is prevalent not only in the Netherlands but also in other countries around the Wadden and North Sea, including Germany and the United Kingdom. These rehabilitation centers primarily care for 2 groups of patients: young harbor seals up to 3 months old and older seals that are injured or sick, often with parasitic pneumonia.</p><p>The age of seals is usually estimated by counting the annual growth rings laid down in the cementum of their teeth (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Lockyer et al. 2010</xref>). This method is an invasive technique that requires putting the animal under anesthesia, and it estimates the age of an individual with a resolution of only 1 year. Thus, this technique has limited use for a more refined estimation or for animals younger than 1 year old. Other less invasive techniques include analysis of the pelage condition and the use of body measurements. Unfortunately, analysis of the pelage can only differentiate individuals between animals younger or older than 1 year (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Corpe et al. 1998</xref>) due to the different qualities of the hairs. Body mass in pups varies based on the quality and quantity of nursing received, the timing of weaning, and how long it takes them to learn how to hunt (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Muelbert and Bowen 1993</xref>). The condition of the umbilical cord can be used to age pups to some extent, but as the cord drops off between Day 6 and 10 (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dierauf et al. 1986</xref>), its usefulness for older than 10 days of age estimation is nonexistent. Weaning happens quite abruptly, around 21 to 24 days old (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Muelbert and Bowen 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cordes and Thompson 2013</xref>), but can sometimes take up to 4 weeks. During the first 5 weeks following weaning, weaners lose about 21% of their body mass while they learn how to hunt (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Muelbert and Bowen 1993</xref>). Thus, body mass alone cannot be used as a measure to age young weaners. Rehabilitation centers need to determine if a seemingly stranded young seal is a nursing or weaned pup. A nursing pup would be brought into rehabilitation if it is in poor body condition and has lost weight in the last 24 h; however, a weaned pup should not go through rehabilitation, even when underweight (according to the regulations of the <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Ministery of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality of the Netherlands 2020</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of our study was to find body measurements that can be used for constructing good age estimators in young harbor seals, placing emphasis on noninvasive techniques that can be used in the field. This study will help make more informed decisions prior to taking animals into rehabilitation and will allow observation of their growth patterns in captivity. To meet this goal, body mass (BM), dorsal standard length (DSL), upper canine length (CL), axillary girth (AG), and body condition (BC) were taken from 45 harbor seal pups of known age. These seals were brought into rehabilitation at Sealcentre Pieterburen during the spring and summer of 2018, and age was determined at arrival by veterinarians based on the state of the umbilical cord. Statistical modeling was performed to test how well morphometric measures predicted age. Results from the selected model were used to compute growth curves and to create a practical table for usage in the field. Growth patterns were then statistically compared between pups that arrived with poor or good BM and BC, assessing the presence or absence of compensatory growth&#x02014;additionally, they were compared with growth patterns extracted from the literature of wild harbor seals to evaluate the efficiency of captive feeding protocols.</p><sec id="s1"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study area</title><p>The study was conducted in Sealcentre Pieterburen, a rehabilitation center for sick, injured, and orphaned seals in the Netherlands during the spring and summer of 2018. The subjects of the present study are Harbor Seal pups that were found along the mainland coast of the Netherlands and the Dutch Wadden Sea islands (except Texel; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data SD1</xref>). They were brought to the Sealcentre for rehabilitation because they were considered orphaned, having lost at least 300 g in the last 24 h and with no females in the vicinity (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Wilson 2009</xref>). The weight of an animal was initially measured in the field using a digital luggage scale and a weighing sling. Twenty-four hours later, they were reexamined, though they were not continuously monitored during this interval. The absence of females nearby was inferred from the lack of tracking marks in the mud around the pups.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Measurements</title><p>Sex, BM, DSL, AG, CL (of the upper right canine), and fat score were measured for all pups that arrived at the Sealcentre between 20 May up until 8 July of 2018. Pups were sexed by checking the perianal region; females present 2 openings (anus and vagina) between the hind flippers, and males present only the anus. To measure BM, pups were placed in a wicker basket and put on a digital scale (Universal Weight Electronics, Model No.: AFS-150) that can measure with an accuracy of 0.05 kg. The weight of the basket was later subtracted. To measure DSL, AG, and CL pups were restrained on their ventral area by professional caretakers from Sealcentre Pieterburen; a towel was always used to cover the eyes of the animals to minimize their stress. DSL, defined as the straight line from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">McLaren 1993</xref>), was measured by the veterinarian and the first author (BR-T) using a measuring tape to the nearest centimeter (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To get a standard measurement of DSL, the caretaker restrained the head of the animal against the floor and aligned the zero mark of the measuring tape with the tip of the nose. The caretaker would then immediately hold the pup in a more natural position with its head up to minimize discomfort. AG was measured behind the axilla of the front flippers of the pup to the nearest centimeter (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>)&#x02014;the chest was gently lifted by the caretaker so that the measuring tape could be tightly strapped around it. CL was measured with a digital caliper (Powerfix Profi, IAN 291710) with an accuracy of 0.01 mm (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The caretaker kept the mouth of the pup open placing the narrow end of a plastic funnel between the upper and lower jaw, between the second and third postcanine&#x02014;the fixed upper jaw of the caliper was placed at the border of the gums with the protruding canine and the movable lower jaw at the tip of the canine. For each animal, after the initial measurements taken at arrival, BM, DSL, AG, and CL were taken once a week. To avoid disturbing them unnecessarily, the sampling was always done on the same day that the pups were scheduled to be weighed for veterinary purposes. Measurements were taken until release or death of the animal. At arrival, the fat score of all pups was determined by veterinarians based on the estimated fat deposition in the pelvic and neck region of the animal, following the guidelines of <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Merck (2013</xref>; <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data SD2</xref>). Furthermore, the BC of all individuals was calculated using both AG and DSL.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Measurement techniques.

This age window was taken to ensure that age could be reliably estimated based on the status of the umbilical cord (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dierauf et al. 1986</xref>), compared to older pups which arrive without an umbilical cord or with the belly button fully healed. This reduced the data set to 50 individuals. Another 4 individuals were removed from this reduced data set before performing the analysis because there were not enough data: 2 died within 5 days after arrival; 1 was euthanized shortly after entering the rehabilitation process due to the appearance of severe neurological signs; and another was euthanized 14 days after arrival due to lack of improvement despite treatment for its fever, lethargy, and digestive system problems. Upon examination of the data, an additional animal (seal 18-081) was excluded from the analysis due to its outlier status. This individual exhibited no dental growth during the initial 2-week period, a phenomenon deemed exceptional and not previously documented among Harbor Seal pups at the Sealcentre (Results section). This resulted in 428 observations from 45 individuals, staying at the Sealcentre for a period ranging from 45 to 94 days&#x02014;all had fat scores ranging from 1 (emaciated) to 4 (underweight), indicating overall poor condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>No invasive sampling was performed, and no special permit was needed. Admission and rehabilitation procedures of harbor seals at the Sealcentre Pieterburen were authorized by the government of the Netherlands (permission ID at time of sample-taking: FF/75/2012/015).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software (v4.4.0 alpha; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team 2024</xref>) assisted by the integrated development environment RStudio (v2023.12.1; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Posit Team 2024</xref>). We: (i) examined the interrater reliability of our body measurements; (ii) fitted and compared several models to estimate the age of pups in captivity; (iii) analyzed their growth curves; (iv) compared our data with animals raised in the wild; and (v) tested for the presence of compensatory growth.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Interrater reliability</title><p>Since DSL and AG were measured twice, once by the veterinarian on duty and once by BR-T, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to test the interrater reliability (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Stemler 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2016</xref>). We used the <italic toggle="yes">icc</italic> function from the <italic toggle="yes">irr</italic> R package (v0.84.1; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Gamer et al. 2019</xref>). We specified the type of model as 2-way because both subjects and raters are viewed as random effects. We computed the agreement based on the single value of each rater. For the different pairs of researchers, the ICC for DSL and AG ranges between 0.78 and 0.90, and 0.91 and 0.99, respectively. Since for both measurements, the ICC was higher than 0.75, they were considered sufficiently reliable across raters (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Koo and Li 2016</xref>). For each measurement, we used the average value of both raters for statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Predicting the age of our study subjects</title><p>When pups arrived at the Sealcentre, their age was estimated by on-site veterinarians using the established criteria from <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dierauf et al. (1986</xref>; <xref rid="sup3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data SD3</xref>). Subsequently, age was calculated by adding on the difference in the number of days between the measurement date and the arrival date to the age estimated at arrival. We modeled the data using the estimated age as the response variable and several morphometric measurements (i.e., DSL, CL) and sex of the animal as predictors.</p><p>Our aim was to determine to what extent the abovementioned morphometric measurements could predict the age of pups and young weaners between 0 to 9 weeks old (given that they are one of the main patient groups in the rehabilitation centers). However, to ensure a more accurate model fit, we used all data that we collected until the animals were released (up to a maximum of 16 weeks). BM and AG were not included in the model because they are highly dependent on the nursing performance of the mother and when, during the lactation period, a pup is found (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Skinner 2006</xref>). Therefore, they are considered unreliable predictors for estimating the age of stranded pups. For this reason, only DSL, CL, and sex were included. Due to the nonlinear growth curves of DSL and CL (<xref rid="sup4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data SD4</xref> and <xref rid="sup5" ref-type="supplementary-material">SD5</xref>) and the presence of repeated measurements, we chose to employ generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) for analysis, with all models fitted using the <italic toggle="yes">mgcv</italic> package (v1.9-1; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Wood 2017</xref>). We assessed model residuals to verify adherence to distributional assumptions, always assuming a Gaussian error distribution, which was validated through Q&#x02013;Q plot inspections. Additionally, we employed an identity link and the default thin plate spline smoothers in all models. Our approach involved a stepwise background elimination regression to identify the most suitable model for predicting new data. To initiate our model selection process, we started by constructing the most comprehensive model possible. This model incorporated DSL, CL, their interaction, as well as sex and the interaction of sex with DSL and CL, all as fixed effects. To establish the interaction between DSL and CL, we employed the ti() function. Additionally, we introduced sex-specific smoothers to capture each potential interaction between sex and DSL/CL.

BM is commonly used in the literature and allowed us to compare our results with animals raised in the wild, but BC corrects for the size of the animal, potentially making it more biologically relevant.

We did this separately for both males and females to factor in possible sexual differences as sex was retained as a predictor in the age model mentioned in the section above. To predict whether pups belonged to the good or poor groups for each measurement, we fitted another GAMM, henceforth known as the state model. Specifically, for this model, we created a new age variable. This age variable has, as a starting value for each pup, its age predicted at arrival obtained from the age model described above. Subsequent age values were simply calculated by adding the number of days that passed since the date of arrival and the dates of following measurements. This was done to make sure that the age values used in our predictions were as realistic as possible. Our state model included the new age variable as a continuous predictor, a random intercept for seal identity, and a random slope for predicted age. We then predicted the (i) BM and (ii) BC for each seal at arrival and compared those predictions with their actual values. If the actual value was lower than the predicted value, the seal was included in the poor group; if the actual value was equal or higher, it was considered part of the good group.</p><p>To evaluate if seals in poorer state at arrival compensated by growing faster during the rehabilitation process, we plotted growth curves for: (i) BM, based on the BM groups; and (ii) BC, based on the BC groups. The growth curves were again obtained by fitting GAMMs using a REML approach. All models include both the BM or BC group at arrival of each animal (determined by the state model) and their predicted age (determined by the age model) as fixed effects. We fitted a separate curve with respect to the predicted age for each group, allowing for an interaction between predicted age and the categorical predictor. A random intercept for seal identity and a random slope for predicted age were also included. We plotted the predicted mean and 95% CIs for each group and for the difference between groups across all ages that were included in the data.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Results</title><sec id="s12"><title>Examining data and identifying data anomalies</title><p>Plots of the raw data show that both CL and DSL seem to be important predictors for estimating age in young harbor seals (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), justifying our initial decision to include both measures in the minimum model.

Additionally, the incorporation of a random factor characterized by a smooth function for DSL demonstrated a beneficial impact on predictive accuracy of the model. Conversely, the introduction of a similar random factor for CL failed to enhance model performance, leading to its substitution by a random slope. A total of 21 models were fitted during the analysis process.

We determined that DSL and CL could be used to adequately predict age as determined by the condition of their umbilical cord. These measures can be used to determine age beyond 10 days old, when pups typically lose their umbilical cord, making them more useful when evaluating pups or young weaners found stranded in the wild. We found that BM and DSL of animals admitted to the Sealcentre grew at a much lower rate than those weaned by their mothers in the wild. Furthermore, we found no substantial evidence for compensatory growth.</p><sec id="s18"><title>Predicting the age of our study subjects</title><p>The GAMM to predict age (i.e., the age model) proved to be a good choice given how well it fitted the data, suggesting that we could accurately estimate the age of stranded animals in the field. Both DSL and CL together are good predictors for estimating the age of Harbor Seal pups and early weaners, and are also relatively easy to measure in the field without the need to handle the animal for a long period of time. The importance of CL is supported by the model for estimating the age of harbor seal pups created by <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Skinner (2006)</xref> during a field study in Maine in 2004 and 2005. It is important to note that measuring the length of the canine requires professional handling of the seal to get a proper measurement. The other predictors of Skinner&#x02019;s model were AG and the nursing status of the pup (whether the pup was seen attended by a female or unattended). In our study, AG was not included in the model as it is directly related to nursing status (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Skinner 2006</xref>) and we had no information about the last time that our subjects were nursed or seen with a female. Furthermore, our model also has limitations related to the nature of our study subjects: they were all admitted into rehabilitation because they were considered orphaned and/or had low-fat scores. Hence, it is highly recommended to replicate this study with animals weaned in the wild, as it would allow us to generalize our age model predictions to wild populations.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Creating a practical guideline</title><p>Reliable age estimation is important as weaners lose BM in the weeks following the end of the lactation period (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Muelbert and Bowen 1993</xref>), and could thus be easily confused with pups. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref> present a useful practical tool that can easily be used in the field, and with a high level of confidence, to identify whether an animal is a pup still being nursed by a female or whether it is already weaned. These tables will facilitate the decision-making process of rehabilitation centers concerning which animals need help (i.e., pups) and which are independent enough to survive on their own (i.e., young weaners). Nevertheless, it could be that the animal is sick and may need help, independent of its age. It is important to emphasize that the tables are meant to be used by a minimum of 2 people: 1 restraining the animal and the other measuring it. As such, they must be trained in the proper handling of seals to ensure accurate measurements. It is worth mentioning that, given that the data are sourced from rehabilitated animals and comparisons with wild counterparts from distinct populations indicate differences in growth rates, these tables may prove more beneficial when identifying potential orphans rather than assessing the entire wild population.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Comparison of growth rate and size at Sealcentre Pieterburen versus wild</title><p>Our results show that overall BM growth rate at the Sealcentre Pieterburen (0.1 to 0.16 kg/day) was significantly lower than that for wild-raised pups (0.394 to 0.600 kg/day). This discrepancy is in line with the findings of <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">MacRae et al. (2011)</xref> on Harbor Seal pups recovered along the British Columbia coastline and admitted into rehabilitation (0.043 to 0.123 kg/day). It is remarkable that our study findings agree with those of <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">MacRae et al. (2011)</xref> despite different definitions of when we consider an animal to be weaned in rehabilitation. They considered animals to be weaners once they were fed whole fish in all feedings (20 to 30 days old) and we based our definition on the average weaning age for seals in the area (24 days old), independently of their type of diet. Our results are also supported by the findings of <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Richmond et al. (2010)</xref> who stated that rehabilitated Harbor Seal pups grew in terms of BM at a much slower rate than animals in the wild. No literature was found for pups and young weaners raised in captivity regarding the growth rate of DSL.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Effect of BM and BC at arrival on growth curves</title><p>We did not find a clear indication for compensatory growth for either BM or BC; in general, animals that started rehabilitation with a poor BM or BC had a lower BM or BC throughout their stay, with the exception of the BM of females over the age of 90 days old. However, this fact should be considered carefully as just 1 single female individual reached 90 days of age at the Sealcentre. Because this individual belonged to the good BM group, its data have highly affected the shape of the curve. We do not know how the curve would have looked for an animal of the poor BM group at 90 days of age. There may be several possible explanations for not being able to clearly identify compensatory growth. Firstly, it could be that the differences between poor and good groups are so small that we are not able to see compensatory growth, probably because all of our subjects were considered underconditioned at arrival. This possibility aligns with the statement from <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hornick et al. (2000)</xref>, that young, food-restricted ungulates often fail to express compensatory growth. Secondly, it may be that young harbor seals do not show compensatory growth due to compensatory strategies of the mother (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kovacs and Lavigne 1986</xref>). Furthermore, lack of evidence for compensatory growth raises the question whether the feeding protocol in the Sealcentre allows for compensatory growth or whether the animals do not have the physiological capacity for it&#x02014;a question for further study. It is important to note that the mass of a mammal at weaning reflects the extent to which it is prepared to cope with its adult niche (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Millar 1977</xref>). For example, weaning mass is highly correlated with 1-year survival in several pinniped species: gray seals, <italic toggle="yes">Halichoerus grypus</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al. 2001</xref>); southern elephant seals, <italic toggle="yes">Mirounga leonina</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et al. 2000</xref>); northern fur seals, <italic toggle="yes">Calorhinus ursinus</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Baker and Fowler 1992</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Harding et al. (2005)</xref> calculated that harbor seal pups must reach 25 kg before fall to increase their chances of surviving the winter. <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kovacs and Lavigne (1986)</xref> found that female seals nurse their pups for longer if needed to ensure that they reach a weaning weight that improves their chances of survival. Hence, it seems that females have found an alternative solution to make up for the size of smaller-born pups. Interestingly, rehabilitation systems follow similar procedures to give animals a better chance of survival: their stay lasts until they have reached a good BM or BC that sustains them for longer while they learn how to forage (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">MacRae et al. 2011</xref>). Finally, it may be that they do show compensatory growth, though later in time. Unfortunately, our animals were all very young (i.e., pups or early weaners); hence, we could not test for compensatory growth at older life stages. Given that seal centers often release animals once they have reached a sufficient BM (among other criteria), in fact mimicking the maternal strategy mentioned above, it is important to tag animals at release and monitor their survival rate and perhaps their reproduction because the rehabilitation protocols may affect seal population dynamics.</p><p>The growth curves and the above-cited literature suggest that animals starting with a low BM or BC may also be at disadvantage in terms of winter survival. Although speculative, one other possible consequence of being born with poor BM or BC is that mating performance of males may be affected. Male harbor seals vocalize underwater to attract females (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Hanggi and Schusterman 1994</xref>) and establish territories along female-traffic corridors (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al. 2004</xref>). As the body size of harbor seals is directly proportional to the size of their vocal tract (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">de Reus et al. 2022</xref>), their ability to defend underwater territories/corridors and gain access to females may be affected, given that size differences influence the call frequencies (pitch) they can produce.</p><p>The growth curve plots show some differences between females and males. Pups that arrived with poor BM did not show compensatory growth, except perhaps for females after 80 days old. However, the presence or absence of compensatory growth for either sex at that age may have to do with our model fit, which is greatly influenced by the limited number of older individuals (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Hence, the shape of the curve between 80 and 100 days old may not be representative of the larger population. One possibility for ruling out the presence of compensatory growth at older ages might involve extending the duration of animal rehabilitation. However, this contradicts the principle that animals should not be kept in captivity beyond what is essential. It is interesting to note the shape of the curve for males in good BC at the start of rehabilitation, which unexpectedly decreased over the first 20 days. This result may, however, be an artifact of our data due to the large variability in the BC of young males belonging to the good group, likely caused by the small sample size (<xref rid="sup7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data SD7</xref>). No such artifacts are observed for female BC or for males in poor BC, likely due to the higher number of individuals in those groups (<xref rid="sup7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data SD7</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides an objective guide for assessing the age of young Harbor Seal pups suspected of being prematurely abandoned by their mothers in the field. This guide is useful not only for rehabilitation centers but also for studies on Harbor Seal behavior, biology, and ecology. Finally, the Harbor Seal population in the Wadden Sea is abundant and healthy, raising the question of whether we need to continue rehabilitating them. Being able to accurately assess the age of an animal may therefore reduce the number of animals that are unnecessarily brought into rehabilitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s22" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic toggle="yes">Journal of Mammalogy</italic> online.</p><p>
