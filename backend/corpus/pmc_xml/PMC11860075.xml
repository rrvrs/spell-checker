It is a major contributor to death and morbidity on a global scale. For patients with ischemic stroke, effective risk classification is essential for predicting outcomes and directing therapy choices. A number of variables, including age, sex, medical history, and imaging results, are generally considered to determine further risk classification, have been studied extensively. Most of the work up done is after the event happens and fails to identify the individual&#x02019;s specific risk of stroke occurrence or recurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may be useful indicators for ischemic stroke risk stratification, according to recently published research papers (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs are tiny, non-coding RNA molecules that control gene expression by attaching to and degrading or inhibiting the translation of their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Numerous physiological and pathological processes, such as neuronal growth, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation, are influenced by miRNAs. Dysregulation of some miRNAs has been connected to the etiology of ischemic stroke and may provide important clues for stroke risk assessment (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that ischemic stroke patients&#x02019; miRNA expression patterns are different from those of healthy controls. The molecular processes implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke, including as inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and neuroplasticity, are influenced by these differentially expressed miRNAs. Notably, several miRNAs have consistently displayed dysregulation in many investigations, suggesting their potential as accurate biomarkers for predicting the risk of stroke (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>In a variety of biofluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva, miRNAs may be found and measured. They make good candidates for clinical applications because of their non-invasive nature. The discovery of certain miRNA signatures linked to various stroke subtypes, severity, and prognosis has also been made easier because to developments in high-throughput technologies like microarray analysis and next-generation sequencing (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>It is very promising to employ miRNAs as biomarkers for ischemic stroke risk stratification. MiRNA profiling may improve the accuracy of current risk prediction methods and enable individualized treatment approaches. Additionally, miRNAs may be used as therapeutic targets for stroke since altering their expression may be able to affect pathways linked to stroke and aid in neuroprotection and recovery (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>In nutshell research into the role of miRNAs in the risk assessment of ischemic strokes is still in its infancy. MiRNAs have distinctive patterns of expression in stroke patients and are engaged in a number of molecular processes that contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke. MiRNA profiles may enhance the predictive accuracy of current risk prediction algorithms and help to individualized stroke therapy. To confirm the clinical usefulness of miRNAs and investigate their potential therapeutic uses in ischemic stroke, more research is necessary. It could be able to create risk stratification models for ischemic strokes that are more precise by combining miRNA profiling with conventional risk factors including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking history. In turn, this can aid in locating stroke-at-risk people who may benefit from proactive measures and specialized treatment plans to lower their risk. Present review article focuses on the role of microRNA in the risk stratification of Ischemic Strokes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are promising indicators for ischemic stroke risk stratification due to their stability in biofluids, dynamic expression changes in response to stroke-related pathophysiological processes, and role in regulating gene expression. Unlike DNA or mRNA, miRNAs provide a more sensitive and minimally invasive means to assess stroke risk and progression. Their ability to reflect inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and neuronal injury makes them uniquely relevant for personalized risk assessment and monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Objectives</title><p>

Vascular inflammation has a significant role in the onset and development of cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref>).</p><p>A number of miRNAs have been shown to control vascular inflammation. These miRNAs have the ability to target particular genes implicated in inflammatory pathways, which affects how vascular cells respond to inflammation. For instance, miR-155, a key regulator of inflammation, has been demonstrated to enhance vascular inflammation by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathway. On the other side, miR-146a targets important components in the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and functions as a negative regulator of inflammation (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Dysregulation of miRNA expression may promote chronic inflammation and the development of vascular disorders by causing an imbalance in the inflammatory response. In order to reduce vascular inflammation, miRNAs have become viable therapeutic targets as well as indicators for risk assessment.</p></sec><sec id="sec20"><title>MicroRNA-mediated effects on endothelial dysfunction</title><p>Cardiac failure, hypertension, and atherosclerosis are just a few of the several cardiovascular illnesses that frequently exhibit endothelial dysfunction. By controlling vascular tone, inflammation, and thrombosis, the endothelium is essential in preserving vascular homeostasis. Vasodilation is reduced, oxidative stress is elevated, and inflammatory reactions are amplified in endothelial cells that are dysfunctional (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>The modulation of endothelial function and dysfunction has been linked to miRNAs. They can specifically target genes related to nitric oxide synthesis, endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and endothelial cell survival pathways, among other genes. For instance, it has been demonstrated that miR-155 and miR-221/222 target eNOS, lowering nitric oxide generation and compromising endothelium-dependent vasodilation.</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular illnesses can be attributed to altered expression of certain miRNAs in endothelial cells. Insights into disease causes and prospects for therapeutic treatments may be gained from the discovery and characterization of miRNAs implicated in endothelial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="sec21"><title>Role of microRNA in thrombus formation and resolution</title><p>In hemostasis and the response to vascular damage, thrombus development and resolution are closely controlled processes. Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke are thrombotic diseases that can be caused by the dysregulation of these mechanisms (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>It has been discovered that miRNAs have a role in the control of thrombus development and resolution. They have the ability to affect platelet activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis, among other elements of thrombus formation. Adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12, which is involved in platelet aggregation, has been revealed to be a target of miR-223, which has been proven to decrease platelet activation.</p><p>Additionally, miRNAs have a role in the dissolution of thrombi. They have the ability to alter the expression of fibrinolysis-related genes such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). MiR-30c and miR-223 have been demonstrated to control the expression of tPA and PAI-1, respectively, affecting fibrinolysis and thrombus resolution.</p><p>The development of novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic diseases may be facilitated by a better understanding of the function of miRNAs in the generation and resolution of thrombi (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec22"><title>Potential therapeutic applications</title><sec id="sec23"><title>Targeting microRNA for stroke prevention and treatment</title><p>Targeting certain miRNAs that have been found to be dysregulated in stroke patients shows promise for stroke therapy and prevention. It could be able to modify the expression of genes implicated in stroke etiology and possibly lessen the damage caused by stroke by adjusting the amounts of these miRNAs.</p><p>Targeting miRNAs for stroke treatment has been investigated using a variety of strategies. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), also known as antagomirs, are one strategy and are created to attach to certain miRNAs and suppress their action. These compounds may be able to offer neuroprotection and enhance stroke outcomes by preventing the negative effects of dysregulated miRNAs (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Another strategy is to utilize synthetic miRNAs called miRNA mimics, which may be delivered into cells to raise the levels of a particular miRNA. By promoting neuronal survival and recovery, this strategy seeks to make up for the decreased expression of protective miRNAs in stroke victims.</p><p>The area of miRNA-based treatments is still in its infancy, and additional studies are required to fully comprehend the intricate functions that miRNAs play in stroke pathophysiology and to create efficient and secure therapeutic approaches. Clinical studies are being conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of therapies based on miRNA in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec24"><title>Challenges and future directions in microRNA-based therapeutics</title><p>While targeting miRNAs for therapeutic purposes shows promise, there are several challenges and future directions that need to be addressed (<xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Challenges and future directions in microRNAs- based therapeutics (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sr. no</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Challenges</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Delivery</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MiRNA-based therapies are difficult to deliver to the target tissues or cells.

The predictive power of microRNAs for stroke recurrence and long-term outcomes must be determined by longitudinal investigations. Prospective studies can shed light on how the expression of microRNAs varies over time and how that affects the risk of stroke (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The precision of risk stratification models can be increased by combining microRNA signatures with other biomarkers, such as imaging characteristics or clinical risk scores. Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data can provide us a more complete knowledge of the pathogenesis of stroke. To gain insight into underlying processes and prospective treatment targets, more research is required to clarify the precise targets and pathways controlled by stroke-associated microRNAs.</p><p>Extensive preclinical and clinical investigations are needed for microRNA-based treatments in order to optimize delivery strategies, evaluate off-target effects, and ensure safety and effectiveness. MicroRNAs show significant potential as useful tools for ischemic stroke risk stratification, opening up new opportunities for enhancing stroke therapy and patient outcomes. To fully use the therapeutic potential of microRNAs in ischemic stroke risk assessment and customized treatment, more study is required.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) offer significant potential in improving the clinical management of ischemic strokes by serving as reliable biomarkers for risk stratification. Their incorporation into clinical workflows could enhance early detection, enable personalized treatment plans, and provide tools for monitoring therapeutic responses. Developing non-invasive diagnostic assays, such as blood-based miRNA panels, could further bridge the gap between laboratory findings and real-world applications, facilitating more precise and proactive patient care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p>With several studies demonstrating their potential for predicting stroke risk, determining the severity of strokes, and predicting clinical outcomes, microRNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers for the risk stratification of ischemic strokes. These tiny non-coding RNAs participate in a number of biological processes, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation, all of which are important in the pathophysiology of ischemic strokes. Researchers have discovered distinctive fingerprints connected to various stroke subtypes and risk levels by examining the expression patterns of certain microRNAs. Additionally, microRNAs can be used to predict the severity of a stroke and assist clinicians make treatment decisions, improving patient care and outcomes. Finally, altering the expression levels of certain microRNAs with antagonists or mimics has shown promise in animal models, demonstrating the value of microRNAs as therapeutic targets. This creates new opportunities for targeted medicines and customized therapeutic approach.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec27"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec28"><title>Author contributions</title><p>HA-J: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
