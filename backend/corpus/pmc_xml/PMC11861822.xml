Comorbidity burden was summarized using van Walraven&#x02019;s scoring of the Elixhauser comorbidity list, which is calculated using ICD codes and is based on the presence or absence of 30 comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Highest Healthcare Utilization</title><p id="Par16">Daily data were collected via patient self-report and validated through comprehensive review of medical records, including records from outside facilities. There was no loss to follow-up or missing data. The primary outcome Highest Healthcare Utilization (HHU) was a composite, ordinal measure which synthesized daily healthcare utilization data across the first 90&#x000a0;days after discharge. Daily post-discharge healthcare utilization for each patient was coded into one of five HHU states, ordered from the best to the worst outcome: at home, emergency room (ER) visit without hospitalization, skilled nursing facility (SNF) stay, rehospitalized, or not alive. Because an ER visit typically consists of a transient interaction, it was ordered as the second best outcome. Since acute care hospitals usually provide more intensive services and treat more complex medical needs, rehospitalization was ordered higher than SNF. For each patient, the single worst state across the first 90&#x000a0;days after discharge was assigned as the primary outcome. For example, an outcome was coded as an &#x0201c;ER visit&#x0201d; if the visit did not result in hospitalization; an outcome was coded as a &#x0201c;SNF stay&#x0201d; if the patient spent at least once night at a SNF, but neither rehospitalization nor death occurred; and outcome was coded as a hospitalization if a patient spent at least one night in the hospital without dying.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Days Not at Home</title><p id="Par17">The secondary outcome was days not at home (DNAH), which was measured as a proportion of days (out of 90) not spent at home alive during the follow-up period. To calculate DNAH, we added the number of days spent in each healthcare utilization setting out of 90. For example, a patient who spent 4&#x000a0;days readmitted to the hospital and 5&#x000a0;days in a SNF would have 9&#x000a0;days of utilization; DNAH would be calculated as 9/90, or 0.10. We also incorporated multiple events and mortality during the 90-day period. For example, a patient who had a 5-day rehospitalization, another 6-day rehospitalization, and died on day 72 would have 29&#x000a0;days not at home alive; and DNAH would be calculated as 29/90, or 0.32.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par18">Demographic and baseline characteristics for the study sample are described with the median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and with a frequency and percent for discrete variables. To study the relationship between VES-13 and the ordered primary outcome variable, HHU, we used cumulative logistic regression analyses while controlling for covariates described earlier. We chose proportional odds (PO) logistic regression because it models the (log) odds for worse outcomes associated with changes in exposure values. To study the association of vulnerability with HHU, we relaxed the PO assumption and fit a partial proportional odds (PPO) model with PO imposed on covariate associations with HHU. This allowed for greater flexibility in the functional form of the association of VES-13 with HHU. By fitting the PPO model, we also estimated distinct associations for the relationship between VES-13 and the following dichotomizations of HHU outcomes that increased in severity: (1) ER visit, SNF, hospitalized or death, versus at home; (2) SNF, hospitalized, or death versus ER visit or at home; (3) hospitalized or death versus SNF, ER visit or at home; and (4) death versus hospitalized, SNF, ER visit, or home. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals characterized the relationship between VES-13 and each of the binary outcome variables, all of which are included in the PPO model.</p><p id="Par19">To study the relationship between the proportion of DNAH and VES-13 during the 90-day follow-up period, we fit a covariate-adjusted, beta-binomial logistic regression model. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals quantified the strength and uncertainty of observed associations. The beta-binomial logistic regression model retains the interpretation of standard logistic regression, but appropriately acknowledged overdispersion in the DNAH response. It modeled the (log) odds of being &#x0201c;not at home&#x0201d; across all days, or for a representative day across the 90-day follow-up period. We modeled VES-13 as a linear and continuous variable, and for all models we characterize effect size for VES-13 and other continuous variables using an interquartile range change.</p><p id="Par20">Because VES-13 incorporates age into its score, age was left out of the primary models. Models were constructed at the time participants were discharged, and included length of stay, a potential mediator. Sensitivity analyses that adjusted for age and removed length of stay were constructed and are shown in the Supplementary Information. Across all participants and variables, 1.11% of data were missing, and 21.56% of participants had at least some missing data. Missing data were imputed with a predictive mean matching algorithm. Multiple imputation analyses were conducted, and results were summarized across ten imputed datasets. All analyses were conducted using R v.4.3.0, and specifically the mice and VGAM packages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="Par21">A total of 806 patients were included with median [interquartile (IQR)] age, 65 [55&#x02013;73] years; 445 [55%] were male; and most [644 (80%)] were self-reported white (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Furthermore, we found that vulnerability predicted higher forms of healthcare utilization and days not at home. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence for patients hospitalized for HF, a high-risk group, during a crucial post-discharge time when mortality, readmissions, and impaired quality of life are common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup></p><p id="Par26">Although hospital readmissions are an important quality indicator, our detailed characterization which demonstrated 20 different combinations of healthcare utilization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) may better contextualize patient experience, and reflect patient-centered outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> In our study, the most prevalent healthcare utilization trajectory was characterized by patients who went home but also had at least one hospital readmission depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The 90-day readmission rate was 35%, which is similar to the reported national average of 32%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> The second most common trajectory included 69 (8.6%) patients who went home but also had an ER visit. In other studies, ER visits are often excluded or combined with readmissions compositely, though they are not equivalent, and are notably undesirable outcomes for patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> The third most common trajectory included 51 (6.3%) patients with at least two healthcare utilization interactions including (1) a SNF stay and (2) a hospital readmission. Of note, certain exclusion criteria for the main study (e.g., admission from a nursing home, moderate to severe cognitive impairment, or not providing informed consent) likely contributed to a lower percentage of patients being discharged to SNF. Though our data does not capture the ordering of these events, future work should look at risk stratification of such trajectories. Detailed consideration of outcomes such as this is important as HF post-acute care utilization is on the rise and can represent an important marker for patient functioning and health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup></p><p id="Par27">Our study is also novel in creating a HHU combined ordinal outcome which included home, ER visit, SNF stay, rehospitalization, and death. The HHU ordering of best to worst was created based on acuity of care (e.g., skilled nursing facility stay less acute than a rehospitalization) and temporality (e.g., ER visit less duration than a skilled nursing facility stay). The measurement of DNAH in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> added sensitivity, providing a cumulative measure of outcomes in the 90&#x000a0;days post-discharge period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> DNAH accounts for repeated hospitalizations, length of stay, and time spent in SNFs. Furthermore, it has been identified as an important patient-centered outcome. Decreased home time has been associated with worse outcomes such as self-rated health, low social activity, and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> This is not surprising as studies suggest that patients with HF prioritize quality over quantity of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup></p><p id="Par28">To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that vulnerability is a potent predictor of many types of post-discharge healthcare utilization and increasing days spent away from home. Improved identification of vulnerable hospital patients and targeted interventions are needed to increase the time that patients spend at home and improve their quality of life. The VES-13 was initially studied in the outpatient setting and used as a quick measure to identify vulnerable patients at risk of functional decline or death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> More recent work showed that inpatient VES-13 implementation was feasible, and hospital patients with higher vulnerability scores also experienced prior hospitalizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Because the VES-13 is a patient self-report tool that includes some functional limitation measures, components of it have potential for inpatient intervention. Our data suggest that an inpatient VES-13 assessment may have utility for stratifying patients at risk for HHU, as well as DNAH. Although there is not a gold standard for hospital functional status or frailty, the VES-13 should be compared against other measures, and future work should examine appropriate actions to modify risk during index hospitalization and discharge planning. For example, communication among teams to prioritize high-risk patients (scores of 3+) for early follow-up, telehealth appointments, and access to resources such as home health, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or cardiac rehabilitation could be investigated. Future investigations might also consider exploring whether the length of time from discharge to scheduled follow-up contributes to the model as a potential target for intervention.</p><p id="Par29">Limitations of the study included performance at a single site large academic medical center with tertiary referral care for HF which may limit generalizability. VES-13 measurement was collected via patient report, creating the possibility of bias as participants may under- or overestimate their own health. Additionally, patients with cognitive impairment or other chronic conditions limiting their ability to consent were excluded from the study, potentially excluding some of the most vulnerable patients, yet vulnerability was still a common phenotype in the study. This study also had many strengths. It is a large, well-characterized, prospective cohort that included a 90-day post-discharge follow-up with detailed data collected on healthcare utilization. It used the VES-13, a validated measure of function with predictive validity for functional decline and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p id="Par30">In this cohort of patients hospitalized for decompensated HF, there were 20 total possible combinations of healthcare utilization in the 90&#x000a0;days after discharge.
