However, while these strategies are often learned and practised under low&#x02010;stress conditions, they are more likely to be required under conditions of high stress. We created virtual reality (VR) biofeedback games to both teach participants a breathing technique and then practise that technique under stress. We present two studies: the first provides a proof of concept, demonstrating that participants can apply the breathing technique during stress, with a significant lowering of both respiration rate and increase in heart rate variability (HRV) under stress (<italic toggle="no">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). The second study explicitly evaluated the effectiveness of training by comparing trained and untrained groups. Training was associated with a significantly greater HRV (<italic toggle="no">p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.008) under stress. In within&#x02010;group comparisons of HRV during stress compared to a baseline stressor presented before training, the trained group showed a significantly greater increase compared to untrained controls (<italic toggle="no">p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.025). Our results show the feasibility and potential effectiveness of VR&#x02010;based games for biofeedback training under experimentally applied stress. This may offer the opportunity for clinical techniques to more closely reflect the circumstances under which those techniques will be required.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>Breathing&#x02010;based regulation of physiological stress responses offers a potential for anxiety management.

This is important, given that anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders (Bandelow &#x00026; Michaelis,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and that anxiety frequently co&#x02010;occurs with many psychiatric conditions, including autism and schizophrenia (Achim et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Braga et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hollocks et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; White et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Anxiety also has an appreciable impact outside the clinical domain (Kwong et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Slee et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The need for effective, accessible interventions is therefore pressing.</p><p>There is growing recognition of the importance of viewing psychiatric conditions and their symptoms in the context of the whole body, rather than focusing solely on the brain. Work examining interoception&#x02014;the experience of internal bodily sensations (Craig,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>)&#x02014;is particularly relevant to anxiety researchers, given that anxiety often entails bodily experiences (Clark &#x00026; Watson,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). There is a large body of evidence that physiological regulation, such as paced breathing, can lead to reductions in anxiety and improvements in emotional well&#x02010;being (Chen et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Doll et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Kim et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mather &#x00026; Thayer,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Zaccaro et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This informs various treatment options such as breath&#x02010;focused mindfulness, which may be used in mindfulness&#x02010;based cognitive therapies (Arch &#x00026; Craske,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gu et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>One promising approach to encouraging and facilitating physiological regulation is the use of biofeedback. Biofeedback provides individuals with explicit representations of physiological measures enabling them to recognize and regulate bodily responses. Biofeedback can include cardiac, respiratory, neural, electromyographic, and electrodermal regulation (Schoenberg &#x00026; David,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and has shown promising results in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders. While the most common regulation target has been the EEG signal (Schoenberg &#x00026; David,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), cardiac&#x02010;based measures, such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV; Ge et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Goessl et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Lehrer &#x00026; Gevirtz,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Weibel et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), also form an important target for biofeedback control. HRV refers to the variability in time between successive heartbeats within a given time period and it is a measure that has been associated with better physical (Kleiger et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and psychological (Zaccaro et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) health. It is typically quantified using a variety of measures in the time and frequency domain (for a full review, see Shaffer &#x00026; Ginsberg,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and may provide a useful marker for stress and therefore a useful index of the degree to which a biofeedback intervention is effective in modulating stress responses. In our studies, we employed slow&#x02010;paced breathing, which is known to enhance HRV through a variety of mechanisms that are under parasympathetic control (for review, see Lehrer &#x00026; Gevirtz,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Sevoz&#x02010;Couche &#x00026; Laborde,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, biofeedback&#x02010;based regulation offers promise both alone (Lehrer et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) or in association with other psychological or pharmacological treatments as a means of managing anxiety. As well as equipping a person with skills that they can learn and deploy independently, it can be made accessible to those waiting for treatment access. However, it involves applications of techniques that demand learning and practice, requiring a high degree of engagement and motivation. Low motivation for treatment has been identified as one of the factors that can lead to patient nonadherence to treatment plans (Taylor et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, combining biofeedback and breathing techniques into inherently motivational contexts is important. Previous studies using virtual reality (VR) biofeedback have reported both anxiety&#x02010; and stress&#x02010;reducing effects of these interventions. In addition, VR biofeedback may have advantages over traditional biofeedback due to increased participant motivation and attention (L&#x000fc;ddecke &#x00026; Felnhofer,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Blum et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) reported that, when comparing VR biofeedback to standard biofeedback protocols, the VR group demonstrated increased self&#x02010;efficacy and mindfulness compared to the standard biofeedback group.</p><p>One further potential advantage is that VR provides a convenient setting in which to provide rich and powerful experiences. This may be important in that both biofeedback and physiological regulation training (i.e., breathing exercises) are often done in a controlled and relatively relaxed setting, which may differ appreciably from the highly stressful circumstances in which the techniques are most pressingly required. This may make it difficult to generalize trained biofeedback&#x02010;based regulation to its real&#x02010;life deployment. Given this, the combination of video games, which are inherently motivational and enjoyable ways to develop skills (Granic et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) with VR, which provides immersive lifelike experiences, including stressful ones, offers new possibilities. Recently, researchers have developed a variety of games with the aim of teaching players emotional regulation skills (Cheng &#x00026; Ebrahimi,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Gummidela et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Schuurmans et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Weerdmeester et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>, among others).</p><p>Here we describe two studies conducted to determine whether a VR&#x02010;based game intervention would allow healthy participants to successfully deploy a prelearned breath control strategy in the context of a stressful experience. Each study used two VR game experiences in collaboration with Ninja Theory Ltd., a Cambridge&#x02010;based video game design studio (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ninjatheory.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.ninjatheory.com</ext-link>).</p><p>Study 1 determined the feasibility and acceptability of applying the breathing technique in the context of a moderate stressor. It examined physiological and subjective responses to both the respiratory training and the stressful experience. Participants initially underwent baseline cardiorespiratory measures before receiving a 5&#x02010;min VR breath&#x02010;training game in a relaxed setting. Following this, they were immersed in a 10&#x02010;min stressful biofeedback experience in which the successful completion of the game was dependent on their ability to maintain control of their heart rate using the newly learned breathing technique. Our primary question was whether people would be able to deploy the breathing pattern, and this was assessed by comparing their breathing rate during the stress experience with that measured during the initial baseline assessment. Our secondary question was whether participants' ability to control their breathing under stress would modify physiological (HR and HRV) and subjective markers of stress.</p><p>Study 2 used a between&#x02010;group design to more formally characterize the impact of breath&#x02010;regulation training. A trained group received four sessions of breathing control training over two visits (5&#x02013;7&#x02009;days between visits). The control group received no training. We also included a different stressful VR experience (involving a monstrous home intruder) prior to any training in order to index baseline stress reactivity.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>STUDY 1: PROOF OF CONCEPT TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF APPLYING BREATH CONTROL UNDER <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">VR</styled-content> STRESS</title><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="psyp14705-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Cambridge Psychological Research Ethics Committee, reference number PRE.2021.094.</p><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0004"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited through advertisement in the Cambridge area. We included healthy participants aged 18&#x02013;40&#x02009;years with no self&#x02010;reported significant history of neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, or metabolic disease or of recent alcohol or substance misuse. While a history of anxiety or depression was not an exclusion factor, we did not recruit participants on psychoactive medication or on drugs affecting cardiovascular function. Where there was uncertainty about the participant's suitability, a clinical member of the study team reviewed the participant's responses to screening questions before proceeding. Apart from a need for normal or corrected&#x02010;to&#x02010;normal (with glasses or contact lenses) vision we used no exclusion criteria specific to VR. However, participants were instructed that should any concerns arise, such as headset discomfort, motion sickness, or headache, they should remove the headset and we would stop the study.

Four participants were excluded due to incomplete data collection resulting from equipment errors. PPG data were considered excessively noisy if over 1&#x02009;min worth of data in totally showed unreliable peak detection, or if more than three independent areas of the PPG trace needed to be removed due to incorrect peak detection.

Participants were then asked to complete a series of questionnaires relating to their mental health, including the State&#x02010;Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), Beck Depression Inventory&#x02010;II (Beck et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and Multimodal Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (Mehling et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

The testing environment was isolated to minimize extraneous noise and, during subsequent experimental procedures participants were wearing the VR headset with incorporated headphones to avoid noise other than those that were part of the experiment. Firstly, they were connected to the BioRadio&#x02122; (Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies), a multichannel physiological measurement device. The BioRadio was set to record cardiac activity through pulse PPG via a fingertip sensor on the index finger of the nondominant hand, and respiration via a resistance belt placed around their chest (at a sampling rate of 75&#x02009;Hz). Their hands were supported on a conveniently positioned table and care was taken to avoid pressure on the PPG sensor. A 5&#x02010;min baseline recording, with participants sitting quietly, was obtained before going on to the two different VR experiences.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0007"><label>2.1.4</label><title>Virtual reality setup</title><p>After the baseline measurement, participants were asked to put on the VR headset. The headset used for this study was the Vive Pro Eye (HTC). Participants were informed at the beginning of the VR section of the study that they were free to stop at any time and to inform the experimenter if they experienced any negative effects from the VR (such as motion sickness). Both VR games were undertaken with participants seated, with the stressor game beginning immediately after the end of the training.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0008"><label>2.1.5</label><title>Training game</title><p>The aim of the training game was to teach participants a breathing technique. In this game, participants found themselves seated on a boat on a calm sea. They were instructed that the boat was being driven by their own biometrics and told that, to move the boat forward, they must try and lower their heart rate by practicing a paced breathing exercise structured around a 5&#x02010;5&#x02010;5 breathing pattern. Participants were then prompted to practise the paced breathing exercise by following onscreen prompts, saying &#x0201c;inhale,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;hold,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;exhale&#x0201d; at fixed 5&#x02010;s intervals each. This breathing pattern aimed to help participants achieve a slow deep breathing rate of 4 breaths per minute. This session lasted last from 4 to 7&#x02009;min, with a mean completion time of 307&#x02009;s (range 240&#x02013;374&#x02009;s, standard deviation 26&#x02009;s). The length of each session was determined by the speed of the boat which in turn was dependent on successful adherence to the breathing pattern.</p><p>The training comprised two different visual prompts concerning the participants' physiological signals. First, their PPG waveform was displayed on the bow of the boat (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Second, the light particles in the air expanded during the &#x0201c;inhale&#x0201d; prompt and contracted during the &#x0201c;exhale&#x0201d; prompt.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="psyp14705-fig-0001"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Ex(a) Example still from the training session. Participants' HR trace was fed back to them (cyan trace in the prow of the boat), and they also received both written and verbal instructions on the breath regimen. Further ambient sounds of the water were presented to encourage relaxation. (b) Example still from the stressor session. In this still, the participant is looking down and can see a representation of their body including the attachment of the pulse device to their right index finger. The stress monitor (top right) was experienced as being fixed to their headset so that it was always in their field of view no matter where they looked. In the image, their stress index (see main text) is within the &#x0201c;safe zone&#x0201d; (with the indicator to the left of the display and the green light on). When aroused it could move to the &#x0201c;danger&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;death&#x0201d; zones.

The speed of the boat was determined using arbitrary units in which 1 beat increase in HR led to a 1 unit change of speed, with a constant of 50&#x02009;units added to the participant's average HR. The 50&#x02010;unit constant was added as the boat movement when tested at 70&#x02009;units was imperceptibly slow. In practice, we believe that this coding error had a negligible effect since participants had no reference for the speed of the boat and being focused on the verbal and visual breathing instructions, were unlikely to be aware of any changes in heart rate.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0009"><label>2.1.6</label><title>Stressor game</title><p>After the training session, participants began the stressor game. Participants were briefed in advance that this virtual experience involves entering a dungeon. The goal of the game is to avoid detection by a blindfolded creature who could hear their heartbeats very well and hence had a high chance of discovering them if their heart rate became too high. Upon detection by the creature, participants would lose the game, and the experience would be terminated. This experience lasted for a maximum of 10&#x02009;min, with 9 participants not completing the entire experience (in other words, being detected and losing the game). The mean time spent in the stressor game for all participants was 549&#x02009;s, and for the participants who were detected by the creature and lost the game, the mean time spent in the stressor session was 318&#x02009;s.</p><p>After having completed the procedure (baseline, training, and stressor), participants were debriefed and asked how stressful they found the different training and stressor sessions on a 1&#x02013;10 scale.</p><p>The biofeedback component of this game was communicated through a display on the top right of the screen showing three lights and a moving dial. The display was affixed to a headframe in the virtual scenario and therefore visible to the participants regardless of their head position or which direction they turned their head. The lights were green, amber, and red. These indicated the participants' relative stress level, as indexed by their heart rate relative to the training session. Participants were instructed that the lights were indicative of their safety&#x02014;how likely it was that they would be found by the creature&#x02014;with green indicating that they were safe, amber indicating their chances of being found were rising, and red indicating that it was likely that they would be discovered.

RangeBPM was set to 25 for this study.</p><p>The stress score calculation was chosen to give a comparable score across participants, regardless of their baseline heart rate. It uses a sigmoid function to keep the stress score in a range from 0 to 1, with RangeBPM scaling the score such that RefBPM + RangeBPM provides a stress score of 0.9 (red), and RefBPM &#x02013; RangeBPM gives a stress score of 0.1 (green). RangeBPM is a variable that can be manipulated by the experimenter to make the stressor easier or harder and can be set from 5 to 100 BPM (in increments of 5).</p><p>When the stress index computed by the above calculation reached a value of 0.41 then the light would change to amber, and when it reached a value of 0.778 the light would change to red. Being in the red zone during one of five prespecified time points at which participants could die would trigger a death sequence, thus ending the game early. Participants were instructed to try and continue the breathing technique that they had previously learned in the training session to keep their heart rate low and thus decrease the risk of &#x0201c;dying.&#x0201d;</p><p>The heart rate increase required for the red zone to be reached (RangeBPM) can be prespecified in the experimental setup. For this experiment, RangeBPM was set to 25. This value was chosen after piloting as a value that should lead to most participants completing the full experience of the stressor, allowing comparable data analysis while still making the experience challenging. Pilots (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) were completed with RangeBPM&#x02009;=&#x02009;15, which led to 3 pilot participants &#x0201c;dying&#x0201d; early and was thus considered too restrictive. Pilots were also completed with RangeBPM&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), which led to pilots rarely leaving the &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; green zone which was considered too easy. Twenty&#x02010;five were chosen for this study instead of 20 to improve the likelihood of participants completing the entire session.</p><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0010"><title>Analysis</title><p>Due to the use of PPG in this study, we technically measured pulse rate variability which, while not the same as HRV, is highly correlated to it (Bulte et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We will henceforth refer to it as &#x0201c;HRV&#x0201d; as the more commonly understood term. The (HRV) metric used for this study was time domain measure SDNN&#x02014;the standard deviation of N&#x02013;N intervals (or the standard deviation of the interbeat interval of normal beats). We selected SDNN as our preferred metric for HRV given that, in relatively brief resting recordings, variation in SDNN is primarily driven by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) (Shaffer &#x00026; Ginsberg,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), especially under conditions of slow&#x02010;paced breathing. RSA is parasympathetically driven and therefore SDNN would provide an indirect marker for whether participants were able to regulate stress responses, particularly given the brief recording times and the focus on respiratory control in our study. Conversely, other time&#x02010;domain measures such as root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) may be less appropriate for paced breathing techniques given a less certain relationship with respiratory rate, leading to potential ambiguities (Shaffer &#x00026; Ginsberg,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, slow breathing has complex effects on measurements in the frequency domain, in particular increasing the low frequency (0.04&#x02013;0.15&#x02009;Hz) power as a consequence of reducing the frequency of respiration&#x02010;influenced HRV. So, in keeping with recommendations (Chang et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hernando et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) frequency domain measures were not used. Thus, while no measure is without ambiguities and limitations, we reasoned that SDNN would be optimal under the current circumstances.</p><p>HR and HRV metrics were extracted using the Systole package (Legrand &#x00026; Allen,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) in Python (version 3.10.5). Systole employs an automated correction algorithm that detects missing beats, long beats, and ectopic beats, which was implemented in the HRV detection. In addition to this correction, all HRV data were manually inspected, and if there were noisy periods in the PPG trace of &#x0003e;3 beats, these sections were manually removed. The SDNN measure was normalized for each participant according to their heart rate, using the cvSDNN adjustment suggested by De Geus et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This is important since heart rate has a clear relationship with HRV: we would normally have expected increases in heart rate to be associated with reductions in HRV. Adjustment was made using the HR calculated using the HR measure from each of the different conditions (i.e., baseline SDNN was adjusted for baseline HR, training session SDNN was adjusted for training session HR, and biofeedback stressor SDNN was adjusted for biofeedback stressor HR). The adjustment for cvSDNN is as follows:<disp-formula id="psyp14705-disp-0003">

Respiration data were first passed through a butterworth filter using the &#x0201c;butter&#x0201d; function in MATLAB. The butter filter used a 10th&#x02010;order low&#x02010;pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.1. A peak detection algorithm was implemented to determine the number of breath cycles per minute. All results were visually inspected by an experimenter to ensure the consistency of the outputs. After visual inspection, the experimenter was able to manually enter the number of any peaks detected or missed in the peak detection phase. From the respiration rate, an adherence score was calculated (4&#x02014;breaths/min). This was to show how closely participants adhered to the breathing rate outlined in the training session (4 breaths per minute).</p><p>We analyzed the data according to the primary question concerning whether there was evidence that participants were able to deploy the breathing technique in the context of the VR stressor. We quantified the effect of training on breathing by comparing breathing rate before (during the initial baseline recording) and after (during dungeon stressor) the boat training experience. Adherence was indicated by a breathing rate during the stressor that was closer to the trained rate than it had been pre&#x02010;training.</p><p>Our secondary analysis examined how HR and HRV during the stressor differed from these metrics during the initial baseline session. Finally, complementary exploratory analyses were carried out to determine whether those individuals showing greater levels of breathing adherence showed the greatest tendency to reduce the impact of the stressor on changes in HR and HRV. In addition, we sought to relate these effects to individual variations in stress experiences.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="psyp14705-sec-0011"><label>2.2</label><title>Results</title><p>All other analyses were conducted in R (version 4.3.1).

They initially answered some baseline questionnaires: the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and the Multimodal Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (Mehling et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). After this, they were asked to take baseline physiological measurements. As in Study 1, participants' physiological metrics were measured using a BioRadio (Great Lakes Neuro Technologies Ltd), using a respiratory belt, and pulse PPG via a fingertip sensor on the nondominant hand. In the first session, participants took a baseline of their physiological measurements, which was taken over a 5&#x02010;min period with participants seated quietly.</p><p>Then participants were asked to put on the VR headset, which was also the Vive Pro Eye (HTC), for the &#x0201c;intruder&#x0201d; VR scenario. The intruder VR scenario was used as an index of participants' physiological reactivity during Session 1. In this scenario, participants are seated at the base of a large staircase. The lights flicker and music plays from a radio. Following a flash of lightning there is a power failure, and the environment goes dark. A crash is heard from upstairs, indicating an intruder. Seated in the dark, participants hear, and see fleetingly through flashes of lightning, a monster progressing down the stairs towards them. This scenario is almost entirely passive, with the only interaction the participants have with the scenario being a brief period where they can move a virtual torch using the handheld controller. Otherwise, they have no control or input into the scenario.</p><p>This scenario differs from the dungeon as the dungeon involves active participation, as participants can exert control by regulating breathing, whereas the intruder experience is entirely passive. However, as these two scenarios have been shown to produce similar subjective levels of stress in our previous studies (with participants rating the stressfulness of the dungeon as 5.61/10 in Study 1, reported above, and participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;47) rating the intruder stressor of 51/100 in a forthcoming paper), we used both as similar stress inductions to examine differences in physiological reactivity between the training and control group before and after training.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0022"><title>Training group</title><p>The training group's Session 1 was identical to the control group, with the addition of playing the boat training game twice at the end of the session.

They were then attached to the BioRadio, as in Session 1. When attending for Session 2, the control group began by undergoing a repeat baseline physiological measurement. This was primarily to ensure that the structure of the session was comparable to that for the training group, who began the session with physiological measurements taken in a repeat of the boat training game (see below). After this, they were asked to do the biofeedback stressor VR, which is the same as described in Study 1. The only difference regarding the biofeedback stressor was that all participants completed the full game by turning off the possibility of early death&#x02014;hence, the experience lasted for 10&#x02009;min for all participants. The only other difference was that in Study 2, RangeBPM was set to 15 BPM. In previous piloting, RangeBPM set to 15 led to more time spent with the biofeedback monitor showing either amber or red lights, leading to a greater sense of urgency for participants to regulate their HR. By implementing this RangeBPM without the possibility for death, we aimed to increase the motivation for participants to self&#x02010;regulate, while standardizing the time spent in the VR scenario.</p><p>After the end of the biofeedback stressor game, control participants were asked to fill in the same questionnaires that they had filled in at the beginning of Session 1. They were also asked to rate how stressful they found the biofeedback experience. Afterward, they were debriefed, and the control group were offered the option of experiencing the boat training if they desired.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0025"><title>Training group</title><p>The training group's Session 2 was the same as the control group, except they were given refresher training on the breathing strategy by going through the training game twice before being exposed to the biofeedback stressor game.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0026"><title>Analysis</title><p>The extraction of HR, HRV metrics, and respiration metrics were the same as in Study 1.

It further provided preliminary evidence that the training was associated with successful breathing control and a corresponding increase in HRV. However, the latter finding requires comparison to an untrained control group, and Study 2 therefore used a between&#x02010;group design, demonstrating that participants who underwent training showed increased HRV and decreased respiration compared to untrained participants. Unexpectedly, training was associated with an increase in subjectively reported stress, which we discuss below.</p><p>The impact of slow&#x02010;paced breathing (SPB) on HRV is of potential value both clinically and nonclinically. However, it is important to acknowledge that the mechanistic underpinnings of this effect are highly complex, resulting from several interacting factors reflecting the central and peripheral effects of respiratory function on both blood pressure and HR (Sevoz&#x02010;Couche &#x00026; Laborde,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). While the optimal frequency and pattern of SPB remains unclear, 0.1&#x02009;Hz breathing (5&#x02009;s inspiration; 5&#x02009;s expiration) may produce maximal effects on HRV. It has also been suggested that a delay (of greater than 1&#x02009;s) between the two phases may further optimize the impact on physiological markers of stress (Sevoz&#x02010;Couche &#x00026; Laborde,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). However, the latter remains unclear and further consideration is outside the scope of this paper. Our own choice of breathing rate (0.07&#x02009;Hz: 5&#x02009;s inspiration, 5&#x02009;s hold, 5&#x02009;s expiration) is slightly slower than the 0.1&#x02009;Hz favored by Sevoz&#x02010;Couche and Laborde&#x000a0;(<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) but, nonetheless, had a significant impact on HRV in the anticipated direction.</p><p>The first of our two studies examined both the adherence to a prelearned breathing rate when subjected to a moderate degree of stress and the degree to which this adherence was associated with an elevation in HRV. HRV increased compared to a baseline measurement after respiration training. It was also demonstrated that those individuals showing the greatest adherence to the trained breathing rate showed the greatest increase in HRV. However, the design of Study 1 is not able to provide evidence that the training (rather than a nonspecific time effect) was causally related to the physiological changes during ensuing the stress experience. Notwithstanding this, the slowed respiratory rate provides a plausible explanation for the increase in HRV given the well&#x02010;known mechanisms described above (Sevoz&#x02010;Couche &#x00026; Laborde,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>Study 2 was designed to control for nonspecific effects by including a matched, untrained group of participants. We demonstrated a significantly greater HRV in the trained compared to the untrained group during the VR biofeedback stressor game. Moreover, the trained group showed a significance increase in HRV when comparing a pretraining stress (intruder experience) to the posttraining biofeedback stress game. This was seen as a group&#x02010;by&#x02010;session interaction demonstrating the change from baseline in the trained group was significantly greater than the change in the untrained group. While we did not collect subjective stress ratings for the first stressful situation, in a previous study, we found this scenario to have a similar mean stress rating compared to the stressor in Session 2.</p><p>In a further demonstration of the potential efficacy of the VR games, we also demonstrated that the training group was able to lower their breathing rate significantly more than the control group, demonstrating the utility of the boat game for training the slow&#x02010;breathing technique.</p><p>We selected HRV (as signified by SDNN) as our primary index of physiological stress given its relation to respiratory sinus arrhythmia (Shaffer &#x00026; Ginsberg,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In line with best&#x02010;standard recommendations, SDNN was corrected for HR (De Geus et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Sacha,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This is important since HR has a clear relationship with HRV: we would normally expect increases in HR to be associated with reductions in HRV. However, corrections of this kind are not universally found in psychophysiological studies, meaning that reports of altered HRV may be a consequence of altered HR rather than directly reflective of a true change in the physiological parameters that HRV is held to signify. The fact that we found increased HRV despite elevated HR in the stressor session therefore lends further weight to our observations of clear increases in HRV associated with respiratory control.</p><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0034"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to these studies that are worth noting and that future work may focus on. The high degree of dropout due to technical problems with the respiratory measurement setup, predominantly affecting Study 1, was unfortunate. This arose partly due to participant movement (affecting the respiration belt around their chest) and additionally a lack of appropriate respiratory band sizing for some of our participants. Loss of respiratory data was primarily due to movement and noise, although three participants were excluded from the analysis due to poor band&#x02010;fitting, which could have introduced bias. Most data lost due to noise were in the baseline condition in Study 1, perhaps due to participants moving due to boredom while asked to sit quietly. While this problem was largely mitigated in Study 2, future work could replicate this study with larger samples of respiration data.</p><p>A second concern relates to the coding error that led to the respiration training biofeedback mechanism being the opposite of what was intended. In brief, while participants were instructed that lowering their HR would make the boat go faster, in fact, this made the boat go more slowly. Fortunately, speed changes would be unlikely to be perceived by participants, given they had no point of reference for the boat's speed. The HR readout in the prow of the boat was unaffected, as were the verbal and visually presented respiratory training instructions. Given this, and the fact that the respiratory training did have a significant effect on ensuing performance in the stress task, we do not feel that this error has affected the key findings. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge the possibility.</p><p>An important, and seemingly paradoxical, observation is that in Study 2, despite the physiological changes, the training group reported the stressor experience in Session 2 as significantly more stressful than the control group. The increase in subjective stress of the training participants in Study 2 requires further exploration, as this may negatively affect potential clinical utility. One important difference between the two groups is that the training group was aware that their ability to apply the prior training was under scrutiny, meaning that the task was akin to a test. Future studies will examine the extent to which this may be a factor in determining levels of subjective stress and how these may be mitigated through experimental context, setup, and instructions. This raises questions about future experiments and whether changes can be made to the experimental procedure or the games themselves to promote less stress.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="psyp14705-sec-0035"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Biofeedback is a method of reducing stress and anxiety and a useful adjunctive treatment for established clinical approaches to anxiety, such as pharmacological interventions and psychotherapies. Biofeedback could also be used for patients who are currently on treatment waiting lists or those struggling to access standard care pathways. Given that recent research has demonstrated the utility VR has for psychological treatment, and as a tool for clinical practice and research (Bell et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Valmaggia et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="psyp14705-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), we have sought to show that it is a convenient, acceptable, and safe method of generating a moderately stressful experience in VR and that this experience can provide a useful context for practising biofeedback regulation. We showed that VR facilitated a smooth transition from a training environment to a stressful environment, enabling a more immediate practice of a physiological regulation technique in a stressful environment. While the stress experience itself is evidently unrealistic, it was deliberately used in this study as a scenario that would cause stress in most participants. Future work could explore the development of more personalized stressors for patients, potentially combining elements of biofeedback with exposure therapy. Additionally, future work could examine whether regulation skills acquired in an unrealistic environment like the horror scenario described can be generalized into real&#x02010;world stressful environments, and whether the skills are situation&#x02010;specific or generally applicable.</p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations described above, our study points to the potential promise of VR in providing engaging, immersive convenient, and experimentally flexible experiences for testing and developing potentially valuable clinical tools. Furthermore, incorporation of gameplay into these experiences lends further potential, particularly in the pressing search for therapies that are attractive and accessible to a wide range of people, including those outside the clinical domain.</p></sec><sec id="psyp14705-sec-0041"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>
