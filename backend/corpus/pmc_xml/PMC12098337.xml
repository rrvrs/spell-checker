The aim of this study is to develop a simple and effective method for the therapeutic quantification of RPE cell transplantation and immune rejection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A nanoprobe was developed and modified to label donor RPE cells, and used to monitor the position and intensity of the fluorescence signal <italic>in vivo</italic>. Immunofluorescence staining and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the cell types showing the fluorescence signal of the nanoprobe and to determine the composition of the immune microenvironment associated with subretinal transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>The spatial distribution of the fluorescence signal of the nanoprobe corresponded with the site of transplantation, but the signal intensity decreased over time, while the signal distribution extended to the choroid. Additionally, the nanoprobe fluorescence signal was detected in the liver and spleen during long-term monitoring. Conversely, in mice administered the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A, the decrease in signal intensity was slower and the expansion of the signal distribution was less pronounced. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a significant temporal increase in the proportion of macrophages with nanoprobe-labeled cells following transplantation. The stability and cell-penetrating ability of the nanoprobe enables the labeling of immune cell niches in RPE transplantation. Additionally, scRNA-seq analysis of nanoprobe-labeled cells identified MDK and ANXA1 signaling pathway in donor RPE cells as initiators of the immune rejection cascade, which were further amplified by macrophage-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Near-infrared fluorescent nanoprobes represent a reliable method for <italic>in vivo</italic> tracing of donor RPE cells and long-term observation of nanoprobe distribution can be used to evaluate the degree of immune rejection. Molecular analysis of nanoprobe-labeled cells facilitates the characterization of the dynamic immune cell rejection niche and the landscape of donor-host interactions in RPE transplantation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>near-infrared fluorescent nanoprobe</kwd><kwd>RPE transplantation</kwd><kwd><italic>in vivo</italic> tracking</kwd><kwd>immune rejection</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

However, the chronic loss of transplanted RPE cells remains a contentious and unavoidable issue in long-term follow up studies. This issue arises primarily due to two factors, namely the lack of clinical methods for tracing and quantifying transplanted cells, and the insufficient clinical evaluation of local immune rejection, due partly to the presence of the blood-retinal barrier (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the most commonly used <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling technique for transplanted cells involves the use of reporter-gene systems (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which is suitable for short-term cell tracking, but not long-term. In addition, reporter-gene based imaging is limited to viable cells and cannot track the turnover of cells and cellular debris. As a novel class of biocompatible fluorescent nanoparticles used in cell tracking (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), semiconducting polymer (SP) nanoparticles show better photostability than reporter proteins and lower <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity than inorganic quantum dots (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, ratiometric imaging probes based on SP nanoparticles are not used for <italic>in vivo</italic> cell labeling and tracking as they require ultraviolet (UV) light excitation and emit in the visible range. Recently, a group modified SP-based nanoprobes, such as those based on poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-alt-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole] (PFO-DBT) nanoparticles, which can be excited with red light and exhibit dual SP near-infrared (NIR) emissions, were used to efficiently label the hypoxic regions of tumor tissues (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), establishing a precedent for the application of SP-based nanoprobes for <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling.</p><p>In our study, we enhanced the PFO-DBT nanoprobe by conjugating it with the TAT peptide (from the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein) to facilitate cellular penetration (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref>). In the retina of mice transplanted with RPE cells, nanoprobe-labeled donor RPE cells were visualized by both NIR ratiometric fluorescence imaging and fundus fluorescence imaging. Additionally, due to its intracellular stability, the nanoprobe is capable of tracking the fate of transplanted cells and labeling the cells with which it interacts. Leveraging this capability, we performed single-cell transcriptome sequencing of nanoprobe-positive cells to characterize the dynamic immune cell rejection niche and the landscape of cell&#x02013;cell interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p>Four-week-old, female BALB/c mice (strain ID: 221; Charles River Laboratories International Inc., Wilmington, MA, United States), were raised in a specific pathogen-free facility with a 12&#x0202f;h light/dark cycle at 28.5&#x000b0;C at Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China).

Two cDNA libraries were sent for high-throughput DNA Sequencing at Nanjing Jiangbei New Area Biopharmaceutical Public Service Platform Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China), where the cDNA libraries were amplified and ligated with Illumina adaptor sequences, adjusted to appropriate concentration, pooled, and subjected to high-throughput DNA sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Platform (Illumina Inc.). The sequencing library format chosen was 150-bp pair-end. Software from Illumina was used to output the sequencing data in FASTQ format. Cell ranger 7.1.0 was used to map the sequencing reads in the FASTQ files onto a custom reference genome we prepared. The custom reference genome contains both the human (GRCh38) and the mouse (10 mm) reference genome sequences concatenated together. After processing, we generated a matrix with each row representing one human or mouse gene and each column representing one cell. The counts are integers representing the number of reads for the corresponding gene in that corresponding cell. The matrices were imported into Seurat 5.1.0 for further single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) bioinformatics analysis and data visualization. For filtering cells, each cell had to satisfy all of the following criteria: (1) Minimum number of cells expressing a single gene needs to be more than 3; (2) the percentage of reads that mapped to mitochondrial DNA shall be less than 25%; and (3) the total number of unique genes with reads &#x0003e; 200 needs to be more than 500 genes.

We hypothesized that this phenomenon might be attributed to the phagocytosis of cell-released probes or cellular debris by macrophages. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a non-contact co-culture of nanoprobe-labeled and non-nanoprobe-labeled RPE cells with BV2 microglial cells for 48&#x0202f;h, followed by flow cytometry analysis of the BV2 cells. The analysis revealed the absence of nanoprobe-positive BV2 cells, suggesting that the nanoprobe remained stably associated with the RPE cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, in a contact co-culture experiment involving carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE)-labeled BV2 cells and nanoprobe-labeled RPE cells, we observed that the majority of CFSE-positive cells became nanoprobe/CFSE double-positive, indicating the successful transfer of the nanoprobe to the BV2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

Thus, we performed single-cell intercellular communication analysis to investigate the initiators of immune rejection and the mechanisms underlying macrophage-mediated immune rejection. CellChat analysis revealed that the donor RPE cells strongly respond to autocrine midkine (MDK) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Concomitantly, donor cells significantly contribute to macrophage/neutrophil activation <italic>via</italic> annexin A1 (ANXA1) and MDK signaling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). ANXA1 and MDK are recognized as endogenous anti-inflammatory molecules that suppress immune activity and exacerbate tumor progression. The localized enrichment of immunosuppressive signals within grafts may seem contradictory to established paradigms, but they can act as signaling molecules for efferocytosis, mediating the phagocytosis of M2 macrophages and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Thus, the above results highlight the double-sided nature of suppressive immune cells in the early transplantation microenvironment.</p><p>We found that macrophage inflammatory signals predominantly originate from neutrophils, as exemplified by cytokines such as CCL and TNF. However, following the attenuation of neutrophil-derived signals post-acute transplantation phase, these signals transition into macrophage autocrine signaling, thereby initiating a signaling cascade that promotes macrophage hyperactivation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These findings further highlight the heterogeneous nature of transplantation-associated macrophages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec28"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have developed an imaging nanoprobe designed to monitor the fate of donor cells during RPE transplantation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Using NIR ratiometric imaging, fundus fluorescence imaging, and immunofluorescence staining techniques, we have demonstrated that the nanoprobe signal not only can be used to label the transplanted cells but can also be used to effectively track the turnover of donor cells (or cell debris) in real-time throughout the RPE transplantation process. As donor cells undergo phagocytosis or antigen presentation, the probe signal is relocated to phagocytes or antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thereby propagating the signal through the cellular hierarchy. Additionally, through long-term observation, we have monitored the nanoprobe signal in the living liver and spleen, demonstrating the biostability and optical sensitivity of this nanoprobe.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Graphical illustration of probe kinetics that predicts fate of donor RPE cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fundus fluorescence imaging, the attenuation and dispersion of the probe signal in the prolonged monitoring indicate that donor cells are engulfed by macrophages, which subsequently reside <italic>in situ</italic> or migrate to the spleen and liver through the bloodstream. The fate of donor cells can be categorized into three distinct groups according to the pathways followed: (1) cells functionally integrating into the host RPE layer without being rejected; (2) cell debris being phagocytosed by tissue-resident macrophages and residing within the retina or choroid; and (3) those activating the peripheral immune system by the circulating probe-labeled macrophage.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmed-12-1583790-g005" position="float"/></fig><p>In RPE cell transplantation, monitoring residual donor RPE cells and immune rejection remains a significant challenge in assessing therapeutic efficacy. Previous clinical studies have used pigmentation in fundus photography and the reflective signal over the RPE in OCT as indicators of residual donor cells. However, there is increasing evidence showing that the pigmentation may be a temporal condition not accurately indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref>). Preclinical studies have shown that overlying cell clumps may be associated with high risk of immune rejection. In terms of clinical monitoring for immune rejection, clinical studies of RPE transplantation typically employ strategies akin to those used in large organ transplantation, such as the analysis of circulating T cells (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref>). However, blood analysis appeared to lack sensitivity in the case of RPE transplantation. In this study, the range and intensity of the probe signal can be used to accurately assess the degree of immune rejection and the residual presence of donor cells, respectively.</p><p>In addition, we generated a single-cell atlas of RPE transplantation microenvironment by sorting probe-labeled cells. Our analysis identified an extensive array of cellular communication signaling molecules and potential APCs which acquire probe molecules through phagocytosis. This dataset serves as a reservoir of potential strategies for regulating RPE graft rejection and facilitating the functional integration of donor RPE cells.</p><p>Notably, in our single-cell analysis, T cell clusters were not detected, likely due to the lack of phagocytic ability of T cells. Our subsequent single-cell transcriptomic study of CD45&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;cells showed that T cells accounted for only approximately 2% of these cells, suggesting that T cell-mediated adaptive immunity plays a limited role in RPE graft rejection (unpublished, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). This finding also implies that the use of clinical-grade immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine A, may have limited efficacy in the long-term management of RPE transplantation. Furthermore, our results indicate that macrophages not only function as APCs but also act as effector cells that directly reject grafts by recognizing &#x0201c;eat me&#x0201d; signals from donor cells and then instigating a deleterious cycle of immune hyperactivation.</p><p>In conclusion, a modified NIR fluorescent nanoprobe has been developed for the noninvasive monitoring of donor cells in RPE transplantation. The distribution and intensity of the nanoprobe signal, as determined by real-time imaging, may reflect varying fates of RPE grafts, providing a novel approach for the clinical evaluation of graft survival and immune rejection. Additionally, scRNA-seq analysis of nanoprobe-labeled cells improved our understanding of the RPE transplantation microenvironment and contributes to advance current prevention and therapeutic strategies for the chronic loss of transplanted RPE cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the Core Facility of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University for its help in the experiment.
