Mammographic density is determined by the X-ray attenuation coefficient of the tissue. Therefore, depending on their X-ray attenuation coefficients, breast tumors and fat appear whitish and blackish on MMG, respectively.</p><p>Ultrasound (USG) can show tomographic planes and reveal small breast tumors even when they are located in the dense breast [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Reflection and backscattering of USG waves determine the shape and echogenicity of the tumor, respectively [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;Internal echoes become higher as USG backscattering increases.&#x000a0;Conversely,&#x000a0;less USG wave backscattering makes the internal echoes of the tumor low.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps in judging whether the target lesion is malignant or benign, especially by time-signal intensity patterns [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, MRI evaluation is frequently done after the diagnosis of breast cancer to detect the presence of multiple lesions and intraductal spread for deciding the optimal surgical option [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, MRI can also be used to predict the presence of various pathological components such as collagen fibers, fat, and tumor cells through the different image-forming mechanisms besides MMG and USG.</p><p>We herein report a case of small breast cancer in which its pathologic findings were predicted not by pattern recognition but by pathological component-based image evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 63-year-old woman had come to the hospital for a regular screening mammography, which showed a small mass with indistinct borders in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mammography showing a dense mass with poorly defined borders in the fatty breast.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078026-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>A USG was done, which showed a triangular mass of 12 mm in size with somewhat unclear anterior borders with focal strong echoes at their center, multiple punctate echogenic foci in the internal low echoes, and slightly attenuated posterior echoes (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Ultrasound showing a triangular mass with somewhat unclear borders; central part of the anterior borders had very high echogenicity (arrow), while the lateral parts had less echogenicity.

Therefore, with a preoperative diagnosis of node-negative breast cancer, the patient underwent partial mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy.</p><p>The bisected cut surface macroscopically showed a well-demarcated tumor encompassed by fat tissue. Pathologically, atypical cells were growing mainly in a tubular fashion and distributed sparsely and diffusely in the fibrous background extending widely throughout the tumor (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), matching well with our prediction of pathological findings.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Pathological findings</title><p>A. Low-magnified view (H&#x00026;E &#x000d7;20) showing tumor cells sparsely distributed throughout the mass in the fibrous background.

The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy to the conserved breast and has been well for 18 months on letrozole therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Collagen fibers have fewer protons and a higher USG attenuation coefficient than other pathological components in the breast [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. MRI uses the magnetic properties of protons to generate images. Fewer protons, therefore, caused the hypointense pattern of the tumor on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images and the persistent pattern on time-signal intensity images, respectively. The high USG attenuation coefficient generally makes the posterior echoes attenuated. However, the small tumor size of 12 mm only generated slight USG attenuation in this case. In addition, collagen fibers, when present at the tumor edges mixed with tumor cells, obscure the tumor borders. The tumor borders, therefore, were indistinct both on USG and MMG in this case.</p><p>Fat has a very small X-ray attenuation coefficient, the lowest acoustic impedance in the body, and markedly different T1- and T2-values than mammary gland and breast tumors [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The very small X-ray attenuation coefficient of the fat surrounding the tumor made the small tumor stand out on MMG. The lowest acoustic impedance of fat generated strong USG wave reflections at the plane in contact with the tumor [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and actually made the center of the anterior tumor borders highly echogenic in this case. However, the outer part of the anterior tumor borders had a decreased echogenicity, which was presumably caused by less USG wave reflection to the USG probe due to the inclination of anterior tumor borders. Markedly different T1- and T2-values of fat made the tumor depiction very clear both on T1- and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The hypointense pattern on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images suggested the massive presence of fat or collagen fibers in the tumor. T1-weighted images, however, would have shown a more hyperintense pattern if massive fat had been present in the tumor.&#x000a0;MRI findings, therefore, highly suggested the abundant presence of collagen fibers in the tumor. In addition, rim enhancement on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images was likely due to the presence of small vessels surrounding the mass.</p><p>Tumor cells have high X-ray attenuation coefficients and abundant protons. Diffuse and sparse cancer cell distribution in the fibrous background well explained the depiction of the somewhat hyper-dense mass with indistinct borders on mammography, the hypointense pattern on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, and the plateau pattern on time-signal intensity images. In addition, tumor cells, when forming some kind of papillary/tubular structures, make the internal echoes high due to the papillary/tubular structure-induced&#x000a0;USG wave backscattering [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the diffuse distribution of tumor cells with a tubular pattern generated the multiple punctate echogenic foci in this case.</p><p>The vast majority of physicians generally diagnose various solid tumors with pattern recognition of image findings. In short, many physicians understand that scirrhous-type invasive ductal carcinomas typically have an irregular shape, low internal echoes, attenuated posterior echoes, and large depth/width ratios on USG. Diagnostic physicians, however, often are unable to make a correct diagnosis through this approach, especially in the diagnosis of small breast cancers. It is, therefore, very important to understand how fibrous components, fat, and tumor cells affect the image depiction in each image modality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Fibrous components obscure the tumor borders when present at the tumor edges mixed with cancer cells, make the posterior echoes attenuated, depict the tumor as hypointense on T2-weighted images, and show a plateau or persistent pattern on time-signal intensity images. Fat appears blackish on MMG due to its low X-ray attenuation coefficient, highlights adjacent tumors or materials on ultrasound due to its extremely low acoustic impedance, generates a hyperintense pattern on both T1- and T2-weighted images, and has a plateau or persistent pattern on time-signal intensity images. Tumor cells appear whitish on MMG due to their high X-ray attenuation coefficients, appear blackish and whitish when showing solid growth and when having papillary structures, respectively, on USG,&#x000a0;appear hyperintense on T2-weighted images due to the abundance of protons, and show a washout pattern when the density of tumor cells is high on time-signal intensity images. Therefore, these pathological component-based image evaluations can help us accurately predict the pathological findings even of small breast cancer.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Shoji Oura, Yurie Kitano, Mariko Honda</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Shoji Oura, Yurie Kitano, Mariko Honda</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Shoji Oura, Yurie Kitano, Mariko Honda</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Shoji Oura, Yurie Kitano, Mariko Honda</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Individual and combined effects of age, breast density, and hormone replacement therapy use on the accuracy of screening mammography</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><person-group>
