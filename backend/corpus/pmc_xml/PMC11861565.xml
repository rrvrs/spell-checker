Humidity was believed to control green/brown color polyphenism in locust species.

This study investigated the effects of humidity and visual stimuli on <italic toggle="yes">Locusta migratoria</italic> nymphs reared in isolation. When <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs were fed either <italic toggle="yes">Bromus catharticus</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Dactylis glomerata</italic> leaves only during the dark period, the proportions of green nymphs at the 5th instar were comparable.

However, these nymphs were not sensitive to humidity regarding this polyphenism under a 23&#x02010;h dark/1&#x02010;h light cycle, suggesting that sensitivity is related to visual cues. The daily overlap between food availability and light periods for 12&#x02009;h resulted in a higher proportion of green morphs than a daily overlap for only 4&#x02009;h, suggesting that such an overlap affects green/brown polyphenism in this species. Although we were unable to assess the effect of the total food availability period on polyphenism in this study, we confirmed that at least (1) humidity and (2) visual cues during feeding are associated with green/brown polyphenism in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic>. These regulations may have ecological significance for this species, allowing them to phenotypically adjust to the seasonal and spatial variation in their environment, increasing their chances of survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>Green/brown polyphenism occurs in various insects including <italic toggle="yes">Locusta migratoria</italic>.

This phenomenon plays a crucial role in thermoregulation, ultraviolet protection, crypsis, aposematism, and intraspecific communication in arthropods (Chapman&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Umbers et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Reversible color changes can be categorized as morphological or physiological (Goda and Kuriyama&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Umbers et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>): morphological color changes involve alterations in the morphology and density of chromatophores, which are specialized pigment&#x02010;containing and light&#x02010;reflecting cells found in various animals (Sugimoto&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), whereas physiological color changes arise from rapid motile responses of chromatophores, manifesting colors more quickly (milliseconds to hours) than morphological changes (days to months) (Umbers et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Reversible color changes observed in grasshoppers and locusts are primarily morphological (Filshie et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>; Umbers et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, the chameleon grasshopper <italic toggle="yes">Kosciuscola tristis</italic> (Sj&#x000f6;stedt) has been reported to exhibit physiological color changes from black to turquoise in response to increasing temperatures (Key and Day&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">1954a</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">1954b</xref>; Umbers&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Acridids display three main types of morphological color polyphenism: (1) phase polyphenism, (2) green/brown polyphenism, and (3) homochromy (Faure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">1932</xref>; Rowell&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). The last instar nymphs of the migratory locust <italic toggle="yes">Locusta migratoria</italic> (Linnaeus) exhibit all three polyphenisms in response to environmental conditions (Pener and Simpson&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Rowell&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Uvarov&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>). The regulatory model for body coloration in this locust is widely accepted as a hierarchical pathway (Pener&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Pener and Simpson&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), where phase polyphenism sits at the top of the hierarchy. Nymphs at high population densities display dirty orange with black patterns, whereas those at low densities (solitarious nymphs) exhibit non&#x02010;contrasting coloration, either uniform or with faint patterns (Uvarov&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>). The coloration of solitarious nymphs is controlled by the second level in the hierarchy, green/brown polyphenism, in which high humidity conditions lead to green morphs and low humidity conditions lead to a non&#x02010;green uniform coloration (Faure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">1932</xref>). The body color of the non&#x02010;green nymphs is regulated by the lowest level in the hierarchy, homochromy; the nymphs adjust their body color to match the substrate color of the habitat (Hertz and Imms&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">1937</xref>; Rowell&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). Thus, <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> last instar nymphs can develop a variety of body colors in response to environmental factors.</p><p>The regulation of body coloration in the desert locust <italic toggle="yes">Schistocerca gregaria</italic> (Forsk&#x000e5;l) has been explained by a model similar to that of <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic>, except for the lack of homochromy (Pener and Simpson&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, Tanaka et al. (<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reported that <italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic> nymphs display homochromy. More importantly, they demonstrated that humidity had little effect on green/brown polyphenism in this species (Tanaka et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In contrast, Hunter&#x02010;Jones (<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>) reported that green/brown polyphenism is substantially influenced by humidity in <italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic> nymphs. It is now believed that humidity possibly contributes to the expression of green coloration in these nymphs indirectly by maintaining the green color of the leaves, which stimulates locust vision (Tanaka et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In Tanaka's experiment, the effect of the discoloration of grass leaves on visual stimuli was eliminated by supplying the leaves only during the dark period (Tanaka et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic> nymphs reared in isolation in cups covered with yellow&#x02013;green paper tend to develop greener coloration than that developed by nymphs reared in isolation in cups covered with other colored papers, despite maintaining consistent humidity levels inside the cup (Tanaka et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This suggests that green/brown polyphenism in this species is influenced more by visual information about the surrounding color than by humidity. A similar re&#x02010;examination of the effects of humidity on <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs has not yet been reported. Thus, the role of humidity and visual information in regulating green/brown polyphenism in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> requires further investigation. In the present study, we investigated the factors that induce <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs reared in isolation to become green by eliminating visual stimuli from grass leaves. We designed different light cycles, 23&#x02010;h darkness/1&#x02010;h light, 16&#x02010;h darkness/8&#x02010;h light, 8&#x02010;h darkness/16&#x02010;h light, and 12&#x02010;h darkness/12&#x02010;h light, to modulate the exposure time of test nymphs to the colors of the feeding grass and yellow&#x02013;green paper. After several experiments, we found that the overlapping time of the food availability period (FAP) and light duration might play an important role in inducing green body color in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs. In other words, the overlap between the FAP and the light period, which was designed in our experiment to create artificial extreme conditions, might inadvertently mimic a realistic situation. Therefore, we further verified the role of visual information during feeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="arch70044-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="arch70044-sec-0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Insects and Container</title><p>
<italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs of the Minami&#x02010;Daito strain, derived from individuals collected on the Minami&#x02010;Daito Island, Okinawa (25.8&#x000b0; N, 131.2&#x000b0; E), were maintained under crowded conditions (gregarious phase) and used in this study (Sugahara et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The locusts were fed grass leaves of <italic toggle="yes">Bromus catharticus</italic> (Vahl) (Poales: Poaceae) unless otherwise specified. <italic toggle="yes">Dactylis glomerata</italic> (Linnaeus) (Poales: Poaceae) leaves were also used as food (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In our preliminary experiment, we found that 8&#x02009;h of fasting in 1st instar nymphs resulted in high mortality rates during nymphal growth (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-suppl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Because starvation tolerance increases with the nymphal instar stage in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> (Uvarov&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>), newly ecdysed 2nd instar nymphs (day 0) were used in this study. Hatchlings used in Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="arch70044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="arch70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="arch70044-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="arch70044-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6A</xref> were obtained from the same egg pods within each respective experiment, and all groups within each experiment were reared concurrently. Hatchlings were supplied daily with freshly cut grass leaves (1&#x02013;2&#x02009;cm long) as food. They were individually reared in Petri dishes (diameter, 9&#x02009;cm; height, 1.5&#x02009;cm), the walls of which were covered with yellow&#x02013;green vinyl tape (Sugahara et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tanaka and Nishide&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Day 0 2nd instar nymphs were transferred to transparent plastic cups (bottom diameter, 8&#x02009;cm; lid diameter, 9&#x02009;cm; height, 2.5&#x02009;cm) with a perforated lid with four holes (diameter, 2&#x02009;mm) for ventilation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-suppl-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The nymphs were visually isolated inside the cups, which had their bottom and inner walls covered with yellow&#x02013;green paper (Daio Paper Products Co., Shizuoka, Japan; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-suppl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>) (Tanaka and Nishide&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Although the 5th instar is the last nymphal stage in gregarious <italic toggle="yes">L. migaratoria</italic>, 6th instar nymphs are observed in less than 10% of females when the locusts are reared in isolation (Sugahara et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

Red light&#x02010;emitting diodes were used only when handling the insects during the dark period. The number of simultaneously available growth chambers was four or less, and each experiment took a month or more to complete. Consequently, we were concerned that the feeding plant species could affect the results of our study, as the availability of plants changes with season.

Thus, a question arose regarding the importance of humidity in green/brown polyphenism. We speculated that fasting for 8&#x02009;h has a negative effect on producing green morphs. Accordingly, we prepared test nymphs that were allowed to feed at all times under either dry or moist conditions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).

Grass was additionally provided to both groups just before the dark period to prevent decreased appetite due to dried grass leaves, particularly in dry cups.

In this experiment, a green morph at the 3rd instar was observed in a dry cup. However, more green morphs at the 3rd instar were observed in the moist cups (Fisher's exact test, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).

In this experimental design, the nymphs were able to see grass and feces for 8&#x02009;h.

This result supports the interpretation shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> that high humidity causes brown morphs to turn green.

According to our data, green/brown polyphenism was not affected by the level of moisture in grass (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) but might have been influenced by a regular short light period of 1&#x02009;h, as discussed above.</p><p>Another factor contributing to green/brown color polyphenism in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> was overlapping periods of food availability and light. When test nymphs were fasted for 8&#x02009;h each day, individuals exposed to a 12&#x02010;h overlapping period of food availability and lighting showed a higher proportion of green morphs compared with those exposed for only 4&#x02009;h (<italic toggle="yes">VI_groups 1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). In contrast, nymphs in both groups could see the yellow&#x02013;green wallpaper for 12&#x02009;h in this experiment. The difference between the two groups was possibly caused by visual information regarding the color of the feeding grass. During feeding, nymphs may observe grass color, which affects their body color. Alternatively, the color of the grass may have a greater influence on polyphenism than yellow&#x02013;green wallpaper. After the cut grass leaves were inserted into the rearing cup, the nymphs gradually ate them at intervals (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-suppl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A,B</xref>) (Chapman&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Accordingly, these nymphs may observe grass color during the intervals of digestion. If grass color was the dominant factor affecting polyphenism, the proportion of green morphs would fluctuate depending on the timing of the experiments, as grass colors vary somewhat with seasons and plant species. Tanaka et al. (<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) observed that the yellowing of grass over time had little effect on green/brown polyphenism in <italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic> nymphs reared in isolation. This suggests that green color in grass is not essential for producing green morphs in <italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic>. Another possibility involves neuronal interactions between feeding and vision, suggesting a complex integration of sensory inputs. The mouthparts and salivary glands are regulated by the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG), which interconnects with the optic lobes (OL) (Chapman&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Uvarov&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>). Both nerves belong to the central nervous system and may cooperate to integrate visual sensitivity and feeding behavior through neuropeptides in <italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic> (Dillen et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Activation of SOG during feeding may stimulate the OL, resulting in increased sensitivity to the substrate color of the habitat. Further studies are necessary to determine why the overlap in food availability and light periods affects green/brown color polyphenism in this species.</p><p>Based on the results of the present study, we cannot conclude whether the total daily FAP is involved in green/brown polyphenism in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratroria</italic>. This uncertainty arises because an increase in the FAP was accompanied by high humidity and visual stimuli from the grass. Although we attempted to isolate the effect of the total FAP by controlling other factors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), the results were inconclusive. As discussed earlier, the proportion of green morphs at the 23&#x02010;h dark/1&#x02010;h light cycle was always low. In contrast, nymphs fasted for 8&#x02009;h demonstrated lower proportions of green individuals (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="arch70044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="arch70044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="arch70044-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>) only when green&#x02010;inducing factors were not present. We observed that 5th instar nymphs reared in cups consumed grass for an average of 11.9&#x02009;min at intervals of 87.4&#x02009;min (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-suppl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">3A,B</xref>), suggesting that fasting for 8&#x02009;h suppressed feeding in test nymphs. The green pigments in most green plants are chlorophylls, whereas the visible green coloration in locusts is composed of yellow and blue pigments (Matile et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Pener&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Thus, the decreased intake of chlorophylls due to daily fasting is unlikely to be directly associated with brown body color. The effect of the total FAP should be further analyzed in future studies.</p><p>A previous study reported that varying the temperature and substrate color in rearing containers can change the proportion of green morphs in <italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic> (Tanaka et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The temperature and substrate color in the rearing cups stimulated the expression of the yellow protein of the takeout family gene <italic toggle="yes">YPT</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">S. gregaria</italic> (Sugahara and Tanaka&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Yellow and blue pigments are involved in locust green coloration (Pener&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). We conducted the present study at a constant temperature 30&#x000b0;C in growth chambers, using rearing cups covered with yellow&#x02013;green paper. These two factors would further complicate the regulation of green/brown polyphenism in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs.</p><p>The coloration of <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs is associated with habitats that exhibit seasonal changes and local spatial variations (see Frontispiece VI, Tanaka&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Is there an ecological significance in regulating green/brown color polyphenism in <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> through humidity and overlapping FAP and light periods? In regions with a dry climate, a moist atmosphere becomes a cue to manifest green body color during and after the rainy season (Rowell&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). This resultant cryptic coloration among green vegetation may contribute to a selective advantage during the season. In contrast, in wet temperate zones, the green body color does not match withered grass, exposed ground, and locally burned grassland (see Frontispiece VI, Tanaka&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). It is likely that brown morphs of <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> often remain in these fields, which correlates with a cryptic background during the daylight period, as brown individuals are frequently found in such fields in wet temperate zones. However, green grass is less available as food on exposed ground and locally burned grasslands. This raises the following question: when do brown morphs feed on grass? Although many grasshopper species do not feed in total darkness, <italic toggle="yes">Acrida</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Locusta</italic> do feed under these conditions (Rowell&#x000a0;<xref rid="arch70044-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). Consistent with the feeding habits of <italic toggle="yes">Locusta</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> nymphs fed on grass during dark periods. If brown nymphs of <italic toggle="yes">L. migratoria</italic> primarily feed at night, this behavioral trend could result in their body color becoming brown because of the short overlap between the FAP and light periods. Further studies are needed to examine the feeding patterns of green and brown morphs under light and dark cycles to better understand their ecological adaptations.</p></sec><sec id="arch70044-sec-0180"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
