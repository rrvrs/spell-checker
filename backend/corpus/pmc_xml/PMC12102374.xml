The combination of oxaliplatin (OXA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (LV) is administrated according to strict protocols. Based on incompatibility studies, LV and OXA are supplied concurrently via intravenous infusion, followed by intravenous administration of 5-FU. This study aims at determining the stability of the binary mixture of OXA and LV diluted in infusion bags containing either 5% dextrose or normal saline compared with their single solutions besides single solutions of 5-FU at two temperatures (room temperature and refrigeration) for two weeks. HPLC diode array detection method was developed and validated to simultaneously determine the three drugs. Stability studies in 5% dextrose solution revealed that mixtures of OXA and LV kept at room temperature showed chemical degradation for OXA, with better stability for refrigerated solutions. Generally, single solutions showed considerable stability. Using normal saline, a combination of OXA/LV showed relative stability of LV over the 15 days of study with marked degradation of OXA. 5-FU was relatively stable in 5% dextrose and normal saline at both temperatures. Method&#x02019;s applicability was extended to the determination of the cited drugs in plasma and colonic media samples.

Lymph node invasion is a prominent prognostic factor in localized CC, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 99% and 70% for patients with stage I and II CC, respectively, versus just 45 to 65% for stage III patients, who account for around 35% of CC at diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Management protocols for CC usually rely on treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. Selection of a particular plan is based on a number of variables, such as the cancer&#x02019;s stage, potential side effects, the patient&#x02019;s preferences, and general health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Since the late 1980s, adjuvant chemotherapies have become more significant for various stages of cancer and are administered in accordance with conventional clinical criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The treatment of CC has involved the use of five different regimens: FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin(LV), and irinotecan); FOLFOXIRI (LV, 5-FU, oxaliplatin (OXA), and irinotecan); Cape-Ox (capecitabine and OXA); FOLFOX (5-FU, LV, and OXA); besides combination therapy of 5-FU and LV. Yet the serious side effects including severe diarrhea with the use of FOLFIRI, FOLFOXIRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and hand-foot syndrome with severe nausea/vomiting generated from capecitabine in Cape-Ox contributed to their current limited use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Since the early 1990s, the protocols which have been continued to be commonly employed for the treatment of CC are FOLFOX and 5-FU/ LV binary combinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In 2004,the MOSAIC ( Multi Omic Spatial Atlas in Cancer) research established the FOLFOX regimen as a standard treatment for stage III CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The inclusion of OXA to the doublet combination of 5-FU/LV leads to a considerable improvement in response, with an extension of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Nowadays, FOLFOX is commonly used as adjuvant therapy for patients with high risk of recurrence (stages II and III) of primary CC or metastatic colorectal cancer. However, it is noteworthy to mention that despite FOLFOX is considered as the relatively safest protocol, OXA-induced neuropathy is the most significant negative impact associated with this protocol particularly for old patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This therapy is administered intravenously every two weeks based on patients&#x02019; response and tolerance.</p><p id="Par7">5-FU, a uracil analog, is a chemotherapeutic agent used for the management of CC as well as different types of cancers. Being an antimetabolite, it blocks cancerous cells&#x02019; proliferation by interfering with different stages of DNA and RNA synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, it serves as the most widely utilized medication for the treatment of stages II and III metastatic CC.</p><p id="Par8">Calcium leucovorin (LV), also known as calcium salt of folinic acid, is commercially available as a 1:1 racemic combination of the l- and d- isomers with the levo-isomer being the pharmacologically active form. It is used in anticancer FOLFOX protocol to increase the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU through stabilizing its binding to the thymidylate synthase enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Accordingly, treatment of CC with adjuvant 5-FU/LV combination is more effective than 5-FU monotherapy in terms of overall survival and response rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Oxaliplatin (OXA) is a third-generation anticancer platinum molecule. Pt based medications are reported to have diverse mechanisms of action. Cisplatin and its platinum analogs, carboplatin and OXA, are widely used chemotherapeutic agents of different clinical implementation. Cisplatin and carboplatin are used primarily in the management of breast and lung cancer, while OXA is mainly used in the treatment of colorectal and gastrointestinal malignancies. It was shown that OXA exhibits its anticancer effect by inducing ribosome biogenesis stress rather than DNA damage caused by the other two platinum drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These medications often create cross-linking adducts in plasma during non-enzymatic transformation, resulting in the prevention of DNA transcription and replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. It was also previously revealed that angiogenin could be a possible target of the platinum antineoplastic drug OXA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although the precise mechanism of synergism of 5-FU and OXA is very complex, experimental data indicates that OXA may be able to block or downregulate dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which would slow down 5-FU&#x02019;s catabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Chemical structures of 5-FU, OXA, and LV are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a.</p><p id="Par10">FOLFOX is currently not available in an all-in-one dosing form. Drugs (LV and OXA) are available as a sterile lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted and diluted before use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In practice, each medicine is supplied individually following a tight chronological order. LV and OXA are often supplied concurrently over a two-hour period via intravenous (IV) infusion using a Y-shaped tube positioned directly before the injection site to avoid a long-term combination of both drugs since LV solution contains sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide for pH correction to 6.5&#x02013;8.5. However, the alkaline pH of the LV solution is detrimental to the stability of OXA, which undergoes alkaline hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, chloride salts may have a negative impact on OXA&#x02019;s stability due to its quick conversion to reactive species (monochloro-, dichloro-, and diaquoplatinum)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Although, it is suggested to dilute OXA with 5% dextrose (D5W) instead of normal saline (NS), a risk of phlebitis and venous discomfort may arise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, D5W itself may be contraindicated for diabetic patients administering OXA. On the contrary, other studies suggested the compatibility of solutions of OXA and LV mixed together up to 4&#x000a0;h with no signs of instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. As a matter of fact, solution mixtures of both drugs are likely to occur in the combined tubing of the administration set. Following the 2&#x000a0;h administration of OXA and LV ,5-FU is administrative intravenously as a bolus, followed by continuous infusion. This separated administration is based on the incompatibility of the highly alkaline 5-FU solution with OXA. Moreover, it was reported that high concentrations of LV induce catheter obstruction following 5-FU perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.Despite all previous precautions, a great chance of the concomitant mixing of OXA and LV in the junction of Y- shaped tube is still unavoidable. Based on the significant effect of pH on solutions&#x02019; stability, it is noteworthy to mention that solutions of binary mixtures of OXA/LV recorded a pH of 5.5 <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e287">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Literature review revealed that some stability studies of the single cited medications in NS/D5W have been reported. The stability of 5-FU in NS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>and in D5W<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>has been studied.

To our knowledge, no previous reports have been found in the literature so far dealing with the stability of OXA/LV in NS/D5W. Accordingly, the study aims at measuring the stability of binary admixtures of OXA/LV in comparison with their single solutions along with single 5-FU solutions.</p><p id="Par13">In this study, HPLC supported with DAD detection method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of the three drugs.

Eco friendliness is dependent upon the type of chemicals and solvents used, as well as the generated waste. In this regard, a number of matrices have been authorized for examining the degree of greenness and environmental friendliness of analytical techniques. They include analytical NEMI, ESA, GAPI, and AGREE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par83">The first method utilized to assess the level of environmental friendliness of the proposed HPLC-DAD method was NEMI where the greenness profile of a four-field pictogram was employed, each quadrant was left blank if the designated requirement was not met and is colored green otherwise. The four requirements were as follows: the substance must not be hazardous, corrosive, persistent, bio accumulative, or toxic (PBT), nor should it produce a significant quantity of waste (more than 50&#x000a0;g per sample analysis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Since the solvent system was neither corrosive nor PBT, the waste generated per sample was less than 50&#x000a0;g, and the solvents utilized in both methods were of considerable hazards (methanol and TEA), the NEMI pictograms of the published and proposed HPLC methods showed three green quadrants and the quadrant depicting the method&#x02019;s hazardous potential was left blank (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par84">The second tool used to assess the greenness was ESA. This method depends on computing the overall penalty points according to the type of reagents, which include all solvents used, as well as the instrument used in terms of energy consumption, occupational hazards, and waste generated during the analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Comparing the ESA scores between the proposed and the reported HPLC-DAD methods, both methods obtained the same ESA score of 84 since they both used the same solvent system ; methanol / acidified water adjusted with TFA and generated waste more than 10 mL (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). However, the two methods were considered acceptably green. Although Eco-Scale has numerous benefits, including ease of use, semi-quantitative computation of chemical and waste amounts, quantitative information regarding the environmental effects of analytical methods, and evaluation of various environmental impact aspects. One of its shortcomings, though, is that there aren&#x02019;t any more quantifiers that can distinguish between method applications on a micro- and macro-scale. Furthermore, in the event of a negative environmental effect, the outcome is not instructive, and as a consequence, it does not support the method&#x02019;s improvement throughout the design phase in this regard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par85">Additionally, we employed the more recent tools, GAPI, which was first used in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> and AGREE, which was just adopted in 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, to assess the method&#x02019;s greenness. The GAPI tool utilizes colorful, fifteen-zoned pentagrams to reflect the greenness of the created analytical methods. The resulting GAPI pictograms showed the two methods&#x02019; high level of environmental friendliness since only three red, four yellow and eight green zones were recorded in each method. The red zones represented the usage of non-green solvents (zone 7), waste volumes greater than 10 mL(zone 14), and inadequate waste treatment (zone 15). The four yellow zones stood for the following parameters : using simple processes such as extraction and filtration (zone 5); a solvent that was moderately hazardous (zone 10); a solvent that had a flammability rating of two or three (zone 11); and energy consumption less than 1.5 kWh per sample (zone 12).Finally, the remaining 8 zones were colored green corresponding to the following: inline collection (zone 1), no preservative (zone 2), no transport (zone 3), no storage (zone 4), no extraction (zone 6), no advanced treatment like derivatization (zone 8), sample volume&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10 (zone 9), and hermetic system use (zone 13)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par86">Conversely, AGREE offers a colorful pictogram with a central circle with a number value and 12 surrounding sectors.

The closer the central numerical score is to unity; the greener the analytical method is<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Regarding the AGREE pictogram, it is noteworthy to mention that the proposed method had a better overall green score (0.76) than the reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (0.70). The greenness evaluation with the descriptive AGREE tool clearly validates better the proposed method&#x02019;s eco-friendliness, which could not be measured with the other assessment techniques. This might be ascribed to the superiority of the most recent AGREE tool, when compared to ESA, NEMI, and GAPI, because the former incorporates the full assessment of the 12 GAC principles. For the proposed method, no section in the perimeter was red, while four sections were colored yellow owing to generation of a large volume of analytical waste (Sector&#x000a0;7), sample throughput was 3 sample / hour (Sector&#x000a0;8), being LC technique with high energy consumption (Sector&#x000a0;9), and the biological origin of some of the reagents used (Sector&#x000a0;10). The remaining eight sections of the pictogram were green for the obedience of the following criteria of GAC, online analysis (Sector&#x000a0;1), a small amount of sample of 0.02 mL (Sector&#x000a0;2), the inline position of the device (Section 3), few steps of sample preparation (Sector&#x000a0;4), automation of the applied method with minimum sample preparation (Sector&#x000a0;5), absence of derivatization (Sector&#x000a0;6), degree of toxicity (Sector&#x000a0;11) and the degree of flammability and corrosiveness of the reagents used (Section 12). Nearly the distribution of colored sections was the same in the pictograms of both methods except for sectors&#x000a0;7, 8, and 9, since the volume of generated waste was approximately double than that in the proposed method (Sector&#x000a0;7), very long runtime which led to sample throughput 0.88 sample / hour (Sector&#x000a0;8) and runtime also affected energy consumption (Sector&#x000a0;9) so these sections were colored dark orange in the reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> while yellow in the proposed method. The differences in the chromatographic conditions regarding flow rate, and runtime with subsequent waste generation resulted in the relatively superior AGREE score for the proposed method (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).

BAGI allows for a comprehensive evaluation of an analytical method&#x02019;s blueness by considering 10 key factors: type of analysis, number of analytes, type of analytical technique, sample throughput, needs of sample preparation, numbers of samples /h, required reagents/materials, preconcentration requirement, degree of automation, and amount of sample. Each of the ten variables was rated on a scale of 2.5 (worst) to 10 (best) where the score of 10, 7.5, 5.0, and 2.5 points correspond to dark blue, blue, light blue, and white, respectively. The composite BAGI score is the geometric mean of the 10 individual criterion scores. A higher BAGI score points to an analytical approach that is more relevant, applicable, and fit-for-purpose. BAGI was applied to evaluate and compare the blueness of our proposed HPLC-DAD method to the reported one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Our method had a score of 90 while the reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>obtained a score of 87.5. The high BAGI score of both methods reflected excellent blueness since they achieved the best score (dark blue color) in 7 factors and blue color in two factors: number of analytes and type of analytical technique. The factor corresponding to the number of samples /h led to difference between the two methods as the proposed method got 5 ( light blue ) but the reported one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>obtained the worst score (white) due to its very long runtime (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). It is important to mention that BAGI relies on using geometric means rather than arithmetic means since the former is more sensitive to data extremes and is appropriate for the multiplicative character of the criterion with a greater relative weight for low scores. Although BAGI examines real-world applicability, it does not give a comprehensive assessment of sustainability.

SD of analytical methods combines three pillars: social demands, validation criteria compliance, and eco-friendliness and greenness aspects, in addition to practical and economical aspects. It is important to note that greenness assessment tools, such as NEMI, ESA, GAPI, and AGREE, only assess the environmental impact of analytical methodologies; they do not guarantee the method&#x02019;s sustainability because they do not provide a comprehensive picture of the method&#x02019;s applicability or economic issues. To this end, the Red-Green-Blue (RGB12) model is a comprehensive evaluation tool that evaluates analytical performance (red), GAC compliance (green), and ultimately economic and productivity elements (blue). The evaluation tool&#x02019;s impartiality and flexibility are enhanced using an online Excel sheet and a unique algorithm to give color ratings to each of the three basic criteria.

Since therapeutic protocols rely on diluting medications using NS or D5W as universal diluents and since the drug diluents could play an important role on the stability of drugs, stability studies were extended to mixtures&#x02019; solutions diluted in NS/ D5W in comparison with their corresponding single diluted solutions. Two temperature settings were examined, room temperature (25<sup>o</sup>C), and refrigeration (2&#x02013;8 <sup>o</sup>C). The chemical nature and the incompatibility studies of FOLFOX ingredients; OXA, LV ,5-FU, necessitates a sequence of the administration as follows: Y- shaped tube containing OXA and LV in each branch followed by IV bolus of 5-FU. This study focuses on the investigation of the stability of binary combination of OXA/LV, being found in the junction tubing in actual administration set, as compared with their single solution, as found in each branch of the Y-shaped tube. The results showed that single solutions of each drug (OXA/LV) suspended in D5W were stable all over the period of study at both temperatures. On the contrary, their binary mixture was stable for only 2&#x000a0;h for OXA at room temperature. These findings revealed the safe storage of single OXA/LV diluted in D5W solution, enabling the possibility of their early preparation in clinical practice with no need for on- time setting which may be a burden in some cases.</p><p id="Par92">Regarding NS solution, the instability of OXA in NS at room temperature forced the necessity of its avoidance as a diluent in the administration set despite the stability of LV in NS. On the other hand, 5-FU could be safely dispensed in either diluent. It is also important to mention that treatment protocols depending on using a binary anticancer combination of 5-FU and LV, being taken separately, could also be diluted in NS or D5W solutions without any degradation. The use of NS in drugs&#x02019; dispensing resulting in preventing the use of D5W which should be avoided in some clinical situations since it is reported to produce hyperglycemia, phlebitis with severe venous pain to some patients.</p><p id="Par93">The proposed method could also be successively applied to the determination of plasma samples or colonic media samples spiked with the studied drugs. Finally, the method was proved to have a high degree of greenness, blueness, and whiteness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
