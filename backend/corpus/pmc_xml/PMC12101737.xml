</self-uri><abstract><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and second leading cause of death worldwide. However, the screening rate, which is a typical preventive measure, remains low. A community pharmacy pharmacist (CPP)-mediated procedure was used to increase the CRC screening rate. A total of 37 community pharmacies in Kagoshima, a core city in Japan, participated in this study. The results were statistically compared with the results of two procedures in Kagoshima City: hospital/clinic institution-mediated and health examination institution-mediated procedures. The cost was set at 1,100 JPY to perform a fecal immunochemical test, considering the costs as the self-payment of the other two procedures. In March 2023, 2,611 kits were distributed, and 273 tests were conducted under the research conditions. A significantly higher percentage of people in their 40s were tested using CPP-mediated procedures (35.2% vs. 14.3% in the hospital/clinic, and 21.8% in the health examination institution, respectively, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The percentage of participants who underwent a detailed examination at CPP facilities was significantly lower than in the other two groups (46.7% vs. 87.3% in the hospital/clinic, and 83.0% in the health examination institution, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In the CPP-mediated procedure, the test result turn-around time was approximately one day. Although a 2-day method was used, the implementation rate was 100%. The CPP-mediated procedure did not differ significantly from hospital/clinic or health examination institution procedures in terms of the number of detailed examination findings. In particular, the CPP-mediated procedure may address gaps by increasing the number of young people and people with reduced opportunities who receive CRC screening. The CPP-mediated procedure could be implemented as a new procedure with certain advantages. Moreover, it should be considered that this procedure can be implemented and sustained in society without government support.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data on the number of pharmacists in the pharmacies were obtained from the site (<ext-link xlink:href="https://iryo-info.pref.kagoshima.jp/qqport/" ext-link-type="uri">https://iryo-info.pref.kagoshima.jp/qqport/</ext-link>), which was updated on December 19, 2023 (<xref rid="pone.0322879.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Although improvements in the public awareness and promotion of CRC screening by physicians will help raise participation rates, physicians&#x02019; capacity is limited. Although various efforts have been made to increase CRC screening rates, such as the distribution of CRC testing kits to participants through a health checkup program or at influenza vaccination clinics, screening rates remain unsatisfactory [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Community pharmacy pharmacists (CPPs) deliver public health services for preventive medical care worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These services include promoting smoking cessation, weight management programs, and syringe exchange and inoculation programs. However, CPPs in Japan have not been significantly involved in the provision of health services provided by public facilities, independent of their work [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Currently, pharmacists in Japan are undergoing a shift to a six-year system in university, which includes the expansion of the educational content related to prevention and health in addition to clinical training [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Along with involvement in medical care by providing medicine, pharmacists&#x02019; work in supporting self-care using over-the-counter drugs functions as a health support activity by the pharmacy. Moreover, CPPs are expected to be involved in preventive medical initiatives provided by regional healthcare centers or insurers. The use of CPPs has been devised to improve access and knowledge of the CRC test, and has been implemented in various countries, including Italy, Switzerland, and Spain [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>A preliminary study on the possibility of implementing CPP-mediated CRC screening was conducted in Kagoshima, a core city in Japan.

The cut-off value was set at 100&#x02009;ng Hb/ml as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Therefore, the sensitivity of the 2-day method for CRC is 100.0% (74.1&#x02013;100.0% as 95% confidential intervals) [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>A total of 31 participants were excluded either due to the absence of consent to participate in the study or age outside the study range (40&#x02013;69 years old). Finally, 273 participants who underwent FIT were included in the study (<xref rid="pone.0322879.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Participant agreed to pay 1100 JPY for FIT, which was the same as the cost at medical institutions for CRC screening in Kagoshima. Comparatively, hospital/clinic mediated- and health examination institution mediated-procedures cost patients 600 JPY and 1100 JPY, respectively, as per the rules of the local government. Furthermore, those who agreed to undergo FIT were asked to complete a questionnaire to investigate their characteristics, including their awareness of health checkups. All Japanese people must register with health care insurers based on their age and occupational status. Notably, health services, including cancer screening tests, differ for the respective insurers. Therefore, the participants were also asked to name their medical health insurer in the administered questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Data collection method</title><p>Data on the number of pharmacists in each pharmacy were obtained from the website <ext-link xlink:href="https://iryo-info.pref.kagoshima.jp/qqport/" ext-link-type="uri">https://iryo-info.pref.kagoshima.jp/qqport/</ext-link>, which was updated on December 19, 2023 (<xref rid="pone.0322879.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Participation was voluntary. The number of pharmacists working in the participating pharmacies ranged from 1.0 to 14.4. The number of working pharmacists was calculated based on the employment conditions stated in the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law. There was a weak correlation between the number of pharmacists in the pharmacy and the number of kits distributed (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.454, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). However, no significant difference was observed when comparing the number of kits distributed between pharmacies with two or fewer pharmacists and those with more than two working pharmacists. As a result, 273 individuals were examined in community pharmacies, and 15 positive tests were obtained (<xref rid="pone.0322879.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>The 273 participants who underwent FIT had health insurance with the following insurers: 166 (60.8%) participants were with the Japan Health Insurance Association, 71 (26.0%) were with the National Health Insurance, 16 (5.9%) were with the Mutual Aid Association, 15 (5.5%) were with Union Health Insurance, 3 (1.1%) were with the Public Fund, 1 (0.4%) was with the Late-Stage Senior Citizen&#x02019;s Health Care System Insurer, and 1 (0.4%) participant&#x02019;s insurer was unknown. A total of 127 (46.5%) participants were undergoing the FIT for the first-time, while 146 (53.5%) participants had been tested at least once previously. The number of patients regularly taking medication was 170 (62.3%), whereas 102 (37.4%) did not receive any medication. Regarding subjective interest in health checkups, 7 (2.6%) participants had low interest, 67 (24.5%) had moderately low interest, 159 (58.2%) had moderately high interest, 39 (14.3%) had high interest, and the interest of 1 (0.4%) participant was unknown.

Their data are publicly available from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. In <xref rid="pone.0322879.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the current data was compared with the two 2018 data points from Kagoshima, as described above. There were 2,192 examinees at the hospital/clinic and 8,403 at the Health Examination Institute. In terms of sex, all three groups were predominantly female and there were no significant differences between the groups. In terms of age groups, similar proportions were observed in three age groups. The CPP group had a significantly higher proportion of examinees in their 40s and a significantly lower proportion in their 60s than the hospital/clinic institution group. The CPP group had a significantly higher proportion of patients in their 40s and 50s and a significantly lower proportion of patients in their 60s than the hospital/clinic and the health examination institute groups. Compared between the hospital/clinic institution and health examination institute groups, the hospital/clinic institution group had a significantly lower proportion of patients in their 40s and 50s and a significantly higher proportion of patients in their 60s.</p><p>There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of FIT experience. Although no data were reported from hospitals, clinics, and health examination institutions, the community pharmacies used the 2-day FIT method 100% of the time, and had a turn-around time of 1 d. In total, 270 samples were simultaneously submitted by community pharmacies, while 3 samples were submitted separately on different days.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Results of detailed examinations</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="pone.0322879.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the CPP group did not differ significantly from the hospital/clinic or health examination institution groups in terms of sex and number of detailed examination findings. In contrast, the proportion of patients who underwent a detailed examination was significantly lower in the CPP group than in the hospital/clinic and health examination institution groups. There was no significant difference between the hospital/clinic institution and health examination institution groups in terms of sex or rate of visits for detailed examinations. The proportions of patients who underwent a detailed examination in their 40s, 50s, and 60s were not significantly different between the CPP and hospital/clinic institution groups. In contrast, the proportion of patients who underwent a detailed examination in their 40s, 50s, and 60s were significantly different in the health examination institution group. The hospital/clinic institution group had significantly more adenomas and lesions other than adenomas and cancers compared to the health examination institution group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Discussion</title><p>More than one-third of the FIT for CPP participants included in the study were not taking any medication at the pharmacy where they were evaluated. Compared with conventional CRC screening procedures, a higher percentage of the younger adults were screened, however the rate of detailed examination was lower. The 2-day method was used 100% of the time. In addition, the rate of pathological findings on the detailed examination in the CPP-mediated CRC screening group was similar to that in the hospital/clinic and health examination groups. These results suggest that the CPP-mediated screening could be used as a novel screening procedure for CRC.</p><p>In the current study, approximately 10% of city pharmacies participated in the study. The participating pharmacies had 1 to 14.4 working pharmacists, with the number of working pharmacists positively correlating with the number of kits distributed (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.454, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). However, there were no significant differences in the number of kits distributed by pharmacies with &#x02264;2 versus &#x0003e;2 working pharmacists, suggesting that this testing support could be implemented even through pharmacies with a small number of pharmacists on duty. This suggests that this initiative is feasible in other regions of Japan, where there are many pharmacies with a small number of pharmacists on duty [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Those who participated in the study were more commonly enrolled in the Japan Health Insurance Association, which covers people working for small- and medium-sized companies than in the National Health Insurance, which covers people who are self-employed, or the Union Health Insurance, which covers people working for large-sized companies [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In Japan, municipalities are responsible for cancer screening, including CRC screening [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the percentage of working individuals who undergo CRC screening has recently increased [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the completion rate depends on the company size. Large company workers have the opportunity to receive CRC screening tests as part of their medical examinations, while small- and medium-sized company workers often do not have CRC screening tests as part of their medical examinations [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In Kagoshima, a regional city, a high percentage of small- and medium-sized companies are expected to have low CRC screening rates. Therefore, a CPP-mediated CRC test supporting system may be necessary for local cities with people working for many small- and medium-sized companies.</p><p>In the current study, one out of ten individuals who received the FIT kit performed FIT (<xref rid="pone.0322879.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The implementation rates in CPP-mediated procedure were low compared to that in Spain, where 40% of individuals receiving an invitation letter finally performed FIT [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This was attributed to the financial burden of implementation on participants. The rates reported in Spain were based on the number of people tested per number of recommendations in letters, while those in the current study were based on the number of people tested per number of kits submitted, making comparison between these two studies difficult. However, the current study may not have been more convenient due to the limited number of participating pharmacies, and the costs associated with the test, resulting in a lower implementation rate.</p><p>Due to prospects of implementing this testing procedure in Japan, the financial burden was set at 1,100 JPY in the current study, considering the costs of medical institution-mediated procedures (1,100 JPY) and health examination institution-mediated procedures (600 JPY) as self-payments, both of which are already in place in Kagoshima. In addition, the two procedures conducted through the Health Promotion Act are financially supported by the prefectural and/or city office. In contrast, the CPP-mediated procedure costed the test kit (165 JPY) and implementation of the test (435 JPY), which generated a profit of 500 JPY which was used to fund the research study. A profit of 500 JPY will be supplied to pharmacies for future implementation. It should be considered that a procedure can be implemented and sustained in society without government support, compared to the financial support of government-led procedures used in other regions [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Besides the financial benefits for pharmacies, this implementation was an opportunity to put into practice the social contribution of supporting the health of the local population and workplace employees around the pharmacy.</p><p>Regarding the age of the participant, the CPP-mediated procedures had a small bias in the age categories of 40s, 50s, and 60s. However, the other two groups&#x02019; participants were mostly in their 60s, suggesting that it may be possible to target a relatively younger generation through CPP-mediated procedures. A relatively large number of people were enrolled in the Association Health Insurance Plan. Therefore, employees of small and medium-sized enterprises who had not yet undergone CRC screening were able to take the test. Women of working age who visited the pharmacy with their children or parents may have also been screened. These suggest that if the pharmacies were in the community and provided an environment conducive to screening, then the applicants in the CPP-mediated procedure were relatively young.</p><p>Moreover, it has been reported that the test itself, even if it is a 2-day method, is required to increase sensitivity compared with the one-day method [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The fact that the 2-day method was used 100% of the time in the current study may have increased the positivity rate [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted. The test results were returned within two days. These results were similar to those obtained in Spain [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The fact that the results returned immediately after the test indicates a shorter period of anxiety while waiting for the test results, suggesting this as an advantage of conducting CRC tests in community pharmacies.</p><p>FITs performed at high ambient temperatures have low positivity rates and sensitivities [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For testing, it is believed that the samples were properly managed, as was the drug management in the community pharmacies. It has been noted that the use of kits purchased over the mail-based self-sampling resulted in poor handling, including the transportation condition of the collected stools [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although mail-based self-sampling is reported to be cost-effective [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], it may be associated with problems with the storage and transportation of samples and is not a recommended procedure due to its high false negative rates [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In Japan, the cost of mail-based self-sampling when purchased via the Internet is also high.</p><p>Contrary to expectations, the rate of undergoing a detailed examination was lower for CPP-mediated procedure than for the other two. This rate was expected to be higher in CPP-mediated procedure because the pharmacists can provide individualized information on medical institutions that perform detailed examinations. The people who received the detailed examinations in the CPP-mediated procedure were relatively young (40&#x02013;59 years: 46.7%, <xref rid="pone.0322879.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Fewer people in their 40s and 50s received a detailed examination in the health examination institution-mediated procedure than those in their 60s. The relatively high proportion of young people among those with a positive FIT may be one of the reasons for the low rate of detailed examinations in the CPP-mediated procedure.</p><p>Those who were originally less interested in undergoing medical check-ups might have tested positive. Even if the results were positive, this may not have influenced them to take the next step. In Japan, a high primary screening uptake rate has been reported for CRC conducted in the workplace [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the rate of receiving detailed examinations is low (3040%). Our current results are similar to those of screenings conducted in the workplace. To increase the CRC screening rate, including the rate of receiving a detailed examination, enhanced programs such as educational booklets and telephone calls may be required [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the prevalence of pathological findings was not significantly different between the other two groups (<xref rid="pone.0322879.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that CPP-mediated CRC screening is meaningful.</p><p>Furthermore, a unique Japanese system of school pharmacist activities can be used to increase the implementation rate. Health information was provided to school children [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. By using this system to provide information about CRC testing from children to their parents, it is expected that the number of participants who will receive the kit at a nearby pharmacy and undergo the test will increase.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, the kits used in the study were distributed for one month in March. The short distribution period could have affected the results. However, the procedure was conducted at the end of the fiscal year (March), in anticipation of those who had not yet been screened, as regular cancer screening begins in April in Japan. In the future, it could be conducted throughout the year, with the importance of serving as a contact point for those who have not yet undergone regular cancer screening, and especially with a reinforcement month at the end of the fiscal year. Second, this study reported the cost of implementing FIT. Verification of cost-effectiveness was required in several places. In this study, the verification was done with the fewest variables. More valuable evidence was needed to determine whether the CPP-mediated procedure can be sustained in real world settings [<xref rid="pone.0322879.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, the number of samples distributed was uneven among pharmacies. The location of the pharmacies, the medical specialties of nearby medical facilities, and the enthusiasm of the participating pharmacists may have influenced their distribution. Although the pharmacists volunteered to participate in this implementation, there was variability in how they communicated the procedure. This variability may have influenced the actual CRC screening rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The introduction of a screening test for CRC prevention through the participation of CPPs has been discussed. Compared to conventional procedures, a higher percentage of the younger adult population took the test in community pharmacies, suggesting that the procedure could be used as a novel screening procedure for CRC. It should be considered that a procedure can be implemented and sustained in society without government support. The uptake rate in the current study was low. However, as the procedure requires the recipient to bear the cost, increasing the uptake rate could help to financially sustain this procedure. In addition, motivation for the pharmacists themselves to engage in the activity is likely to exist, as it increases the social value of CPPs.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;1. Introduction needs to be reorganized (paragraph 1; burned and incidence including Japa, 2: uptake and screening, 3: health promotion, 4; the Community pharmacy pharmacists and study aim), need to be consistence, if we say uptake should be uptake throughout, if screening rate should have to the same throughout, there is a need for rephrasing and rearrangement of the paragraphs.</p><p>2. Introduction 49 to 51; this has to be part of second paragraph</p><p>3. Introduction line 52; this sound to be part of paragraph one which speak on burden and has to include the incidence as well.</p><p>4. Introduction line 66 to 67; is not clear what is six-years system mean and why is so important for this study.</p><p>5. Methodology Participants: line 81 to 90; you have to explain the characteristics of participants/ or participating pharmacies, and including their exclusion criteria but I see also you included the part of the results in this section.</p><p>6. Methodology is missing the study design part, is it cross-sectional, survey, or randomized study???</p><p>7. Methodology Examinations line 92; this has to be rephrased to study procedure</p><p>8. Methodology line 93 to 95; the authors need to mention the sensitivity cut point you are referring to is it 98%, 35% etc and explain the usually CRC screening Method used in Japan. And you need to start this procedure part by explaining what was done, how, when and where, and you mention the kits used for this and its sensitivity.</p><p>9. Methodology data line 100 this has to be data collection method.</p><p>10. Methodology data line 106 to 109; the authors need to stick to CRC and not COVID-19.</p><p>11. Result Correlation line 131; why did we do the correlation; do we have correlation procedure in analysis like Kappa.</p><p>12. Result Table 1: need to be the table for participants characteristics, age., sex, how many tested (tested negative and tested positive), insurance (mention only the insurance with significance number, and the other with lower number should be grouped under one part mentioned as other insurance). The one you provide fits to be part of supplementary tables.</p><p>13. Result line 140 to 143; this is parts for participant in methodology and not results; Authors need to remove the results in this section and include it on respective section</p><p>14. Result line 156 to 158; it has not explained well in introduction even on the methodology and statistical part if it is needed it needs to be reflected on the study aim on introduction and well as in analysis procedure.</p><p>15. Discussion of this study is not clear and straightforward, the authors explained all results as in results section, some are not in the scope of this study, in general needs to be focused.</p><p>16. Discussion; the first paragraph needs to have your 3 or 4 important findings according to your aim. Thereafter, the following paragraphs has to contain the detailed information of each mentioned important findings from 1st paragraph, you compare and contrast against evidence from previously.</p><p>17. Discussion line 219 to 223; no need for this information in this part of discussion advised to be deleted.</p><p>18. Discussion Line 245 to 247; need to be consistence on wording choose either pharmacist-mediated CRT test or community pharmacy pharmacists, check also other part of manuscript where you mixed up these words.</p><p>19. Discussion line 249; no need to refer figure, you already mentioned in results</p><p>20. Discussion line 248 to264; this paragraph has the important finding according to the study aim the uptake following the intervention, you need to explain in detains on the uptake, comparing with other findings from other studies, and give the impression for it. The cost and profit need to be in a separate paragraph, and include in the study procedure the information on how you assessed the cost and profit.</p><p>21. Discussion line 265 to 275; need to be a separate paragraph, no need to refer table at this point already is in the result. Rephrase and mention only the important finding of which I see the uptake of community pharmacy pharmacist test CRC test by young age. Remove the other part which has no information on the uptake and the paragraph should be before the const information. And discuss in details on your result about young age are these also seen to other studies from different area or not, and if possible, why.</p><p>22. Discussion line 275 to 294; The positivity rate increase with age is important information but has not discussed well and is not clear if you&#x02019;re reporting this as a limitation or you are reporting the new findings, need to separate this paragraph part of it is not scope of this study.</p><p>23. Discussion line 295 to 296; is a good finding but what are the other two you mean needs more discussion on this finding.</p><p>24. Discussion line 319 to 320; reporting the cost why it is a limitation to this study?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Thank you for the manuscript. I have a few questions regarding its content:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>1. Could key statistical findings be added to better highlight the study&#x02019;s impact?</p><p>2. How does the community pharmacy approach specifically address gaps in CRC screening participation compared to other methods?</p><p>Methods:</p><p>3. Was there variability in how pharmacists communicated the procedure, and could this variability have influenced participant uptake?</p><p>4. Were standardized protocols in place to ensure proper storage and transport of the returned FIT kits?</p><p>Results:</p><p>5. Why was the uptake rate lower compared to international benchmarks? Could cultural or logistical factors have played a role?</p><p>6. What could explain the significantly lower rate of undergoing detailed examinations in the pharmacy group?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>7. How might this model help to address colorectal cancer screening gaps in rural or underserved populations?</p><p>8. What strategies could be implemented to improve participation among men and individuals with lower health awareness?</p><p>Limitations:</p><p>9.

</p><p>Sameen Abbas, Ph.D.</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Prof. Abbas,</p><p>We are pleased to learn that our manuscript (PONE-D-24-43344, Involvement of the</p><p>community pharmacy pharmacists in fecal immunochemical screening without government</p><p>supports in Japan) can be considered for publication in your journal.</p><p>First of all, we explained the correction to the Table 2. We have noticed the error in in Table 2 regarding the applicants aged 50-59 in the hospital/clinic-mediated procedure. According to the correction, we have corrected the statistical results, which are marked in red. The percentage of positive results in the hospital/clinic-mediated procedure was changed from 5.8 to 5.7. In addition, we have added the data on the number of age groups (40s, 50s, and 60s) in the hospital/clinic- and health examination institution-mediated procedures in Table 3 to respond to the reviewers&#x02019; comments. The correction and addition would be helpful for a better understanding of the presentation of our manuscript.</p><p>We have responded to the reviewers&#x02019; comments point by point as follows. We have highlighted in red the sentences that have been added to the text.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1. Introduction needs to be reorganized (paragraph 1; burned and incidence including Japan, 2: uptake and screening, 3: health promotion, 4; the Community pharmacy pharmacists and study aim), need to be consistence, if we say uptake should be uptake throughout, if screening rate should have to the same throughout, there is a need for rephrasing and rearrangement of the paragraphs.</p><p>We agreed with the comments. We have reorganized the introduction section as suggested by the queries 2-3 as below.</p><p>The screening rate is used consistently.</p><p>2. Introduction 49 to 51; this has to be part of second paragraph</p><p>We have moved this part to the second paragraph.</p><p>3. Introduction line 52; this sound to be part of paragraph one which speak on burden and has to include the incidence as well.</p><p>We have moved this part to the first paragraph.</p><p>4. Introduction line 66 to 67; is not clear what is six-years system mean and why is so important for this study.</p><p>The change from a four-year system to a six-year system has increased the increased content on prevention and health in addition to clinical training. Therefore, the change to the six-year system is important for this study. Accordingly, we changed the sentence (P4 L70-72 in the Manuscript).</p><p>However, pharmacists in Japan are undergoing a shift to a six-year system at university and the expansion of the educational content related to prevention and health in addition to clinical training [16].</p><p>5. Methodology Participants: line 81 to 90; you have to explain the characteristics of participants/ or participating pharmacies, and including their exclusion criteria but I see also you included the part of the results in this section.</p><p>We have removed the results part of this section. We have added the information to the sentence (P5 L84-85 in the Manuscript).</p><p>Thirty-seven community pharmacies in Kagoshima City voluntarily participated in the study (Table 1).</p><p>6. Methodology is missing the study design part, is it cross-sectional, survey, or randomized study???</p><p>We have added the part in this section as Study design and participants. We added the sentence (P5 L84 in the Manuscript).</p><p>This study was conducted as a survey.</p><p>7. Methodology Examinations line 92; this has to be rephrased to study procedure</p><p>We have combined the sections (Participants and Examinations) and rephrased them as Study design and procedure.</p><p>8. Methodology line 93 to 95; the authors need to mention the sensitivity cut point you are referring to is it 98%, 35% etc and explain the usually CRC screening Method used in Japan. And you need to start this procedure part by explaining what was done, how, when and where, and you mention the kits used for this and its sensitivity.</p><p>The 2-day method used in the study is the usual CRC screening method in Japan.</p><p>We modified the sentence as follows (P5 L94-96 in the Manuscript).</p><p>Considering the sensitivity of the test, a 2-day method was used, which is the usual method for CRC screening in Japan [20].</p><p>As suggested, we explained what was done, how, when, and where in the study design and procedure section (P5 L86-93 in the Manuscript).</p><p>Kits were distributed by participating pharmacies between March and the first week of April 2023 (Fig 1). Stool samples were collected at home, brought to a community pharmacy, and sent to the laboratory (Clinical Pathology Laboratory Co. Ltd., Kagoshima, Japan). The collection period was from March to August 31, 2023. The results were reported to the community pharmacist in charge and then to the participants. For patients who tested positive, explanations were provided about the medical institutions that performed detailed examinations.</p><p>We have added the sentences (P5-6 L96-98 in the Manuscript).</p><p>According to the manufacturer, the cut-off value is 100 ng Hb/ml. Therefore, the sensitivity of the 2-day method for CRC is 100.0% (74.1-100.0% as 95% confidential intervals) [20].</p><p>9. Methodology data line 100 this has to be data collection method.</p><p>We have rephrased it as suggested.</p><p>10. Methodology data line 106 to 109; the authors need to stick to CRC and not COVID-19.</p><p>We have explained the sentences. These sentences are the reason for selecting the data.</p><p>We have added the sentence and removed the sentence for the redundancy (P7 L120-122 in the Manuscript).</p><p>The time of the data was chosen because the COVID-19 pandemic could affect the screening rate of general health examinations, including CRC screening.</p><p>11. Result Correlation line 131; why did we do the correlation; do we have correlation procedure in analysis like Kappa.</p><p>As we understand it, the kappa statistic is used to assess the reproducibility using the same samples. Since the participants in each pharmacy were different, we analyzed the correlation between the number of pharmacists in the pharmacy and the number of kits distributed in the pharmacy.</p><p>12. Result Table 1: need to be the table for participants characteristics, age., sex, how many tested (tested negative and tested positive), insurance (mention only the insurance with significance number, and the other with lower number should be grouped under one part mentioned as other insurance). The one you provide fits to be part of supplementary tables.</p><p>We are sorry that we did not receive information about the participants who did not take FIT. Therefore, we cannot prepare the table as suggested. We have corrected the ethical sentence (P8 L135-136 in the Manuscript).</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from all participants with FIT examination before they completed the questionnaire.</p><p>13. Result line 140 to 143; this is parts for participant in methodology and not results; Authors need to remove the results in this section and include it on respective section</p><p>We have moved it to the methodology section.</p><p>14. Result line 156 to 158; it has not explained well in introduction even on the methodology and statistical part if it is needed it needs to be reflected on the study aim on introduction and well as in analysis procedure.</p><p>We have added the explanations in the Introduction section (P3 L57-58 in the Manuscript).</p><p>In Japan, there are two FIT procedures that are provided by hospitals/clinics and health examination institutes.</p><p>15. Discussion of this study is not clear and straightforward, the authors explained all results as in results section, some are not in the scope of this study, in general needs to be focused.</p><p>We agree with the proposal. We have attempted to rewrite the discussion section as indicated below.</p><p>16. Discussion; the first paragraph needs to have your 3 or 4 important findings according to your aim. Thereafter, the following paragraphs has to contain the detailed information of each mentioned important findings from 1st paragraph, you compare and contrast against evidence from previously.</p><p>We described the key points of the study (P18 L229-236 in the Manuscript).</p><p>CPP-mediated CRC screening was conducted in Japan. More than one-third of the FIT participants with FIT were not taking any medication at the pharmacy where they were tested. Compared with conventional CRC screening procedures, a higher percentage of the younger generation was screened, but the rate of detailed examination was lower. The 2-day method was used 100% of the time. In addition, the rate of pathological findings on the detailed examination in the CPP-mediated CRC screening was similar to that in the hospital/clinic and health examination-mediated procedures. These results suggest that the CPP-mediated procedure could be used as a novel screening procedure for CRC.</p><p>17. Discussion line 219 to 223; no need for this information in this part of discussion advised to be deleted.</p><p>We have removed the sentences.</p><p>18. Discussion Line 245 to 247; need to be consistence on wording choose either pharmacist-mediated CRT test or community pharmacy pharmacists, check also other part of manuscript where you mixed up these words.</p><p>We have used the term, community pharmacy pharmacists as CPPs, consistently throughout the text.</p><p>19. Discussion line 249; no need to refer figure, you already mentioned in results</p><p>We have deleted the information.</p><p>20. Discussion line 248 to264; this paragraph has the important finding according to the study aim the uptake following the intervention, you need to explain in detains on the uptake, comparing with other findings from other studies, and give the impression for it. The cost and profit need to be in a separate paragraph, and include in the study procedure the information on how you assessed the cost and profit.</p><p>We appreciated the suggestion. We have detailed the comparison of the implementation rate in Spain (P19-20 L262-267 in the Manuscript).</p><p>Spain was based on the number of people tested per number of recommendations in letters, while the current study was based on the number of people tested per number of kits distributed, so there is no easy comparison, but the current study may not have been more convenient due to the limited number of participating pharmacies, and the costs associated with the test were charged, resulting in a lower implementation rate.</p><p>We separated the paragraph in the discussion section, and added the information on the cost of the procedures (hospital/clinic-mediated procedure and health examination institution-mediated procedure) in the study procedure section (P6 L103-105 in the Manuscript).</p><p>According to the local government rule, the other two procedures (hospital/clinic-mediated procedure and health examination institution-mediated procedure) are performed by the cost of self-payment, 600 JPY and 1100 JPY, respectively.</p><p>21. Discussion line 265 to 275; need to be a separate paragraph, no need to refer table at this point already is in the result. Rephrase and mention only the important finding of which I see the uptake of community pharmacy pharmacist test CRC test by young age. Remove the other part which has no information on the uptake and the paragraph should be before the const information. And discuss in details on your result about young age are these also seen to other studies from different area or not, and if possible, why.</p><p>We have removed the part that does not provide information on the screening rate as suggested. We have separated the paragraph related to the sensitivity of the test.</p><p>We discussed in detail the results of the higher screening rate at younger ages in the CPP-mediated procedure. We have added the following sentences (P21 L285-291 in the Manuscript).</p><p>A relatively large number of people were enrolled in the Association Health Insurance Plan. Therefore, employees of small and medium-sized enterprises who had not yet undergone CRC screening were able to take the test. Women of working age who visited the pharmacy with their children or parents may have been screened. These suggest that the pharmacies were in the community and provided an environment conducive to screening, then the applicants in the CPP-mediated procedure were relatively young.</p><p>22. Discussion line 275 to 294; The positivity rate increase with age is important information but has not discussed well and is not clear if you&#x02019;re reporting this as a limitation or you are reporting the new findings, need to separate this paragraph part of it is not scope of this study.</p><p>We agree with the suggestion and have removed this part.</p><p>23. Discussion line 295 to 296; is a good finding but what are the other two you mean needs more discussion on this finding.</p><p>We analyzed the people who received the detailed examinations in the hospital/clinic- procedure and in the health examination institution-mediated procedures. Fewer people in their 40s and 50s received a detailed examination in the health examination institution-mediated procedure compared with people in their 60s. The relatively high proportion of young people among those with a positive FIT is one of the reasons for the low rate of detailed examinations in the CPP- mediated procedure.</p><p>We have added the data to Table 3, and we added the following sentences in the Discussion section (P22 L311-316 in the Manuscript).</p><p>The people who received the detailed examinations in the CPP-mediated procedure were relatively young (40-59 years: 46.7%, Table 3). Fewer people in their 40s and 50s than in their 60s received a detailed examination in the health examination institution mediated procedure. The relatively high proportion of young people among those with a positive FIT may be one of the reasons for the low rate of detailed examinations in the CPP-mediated procedure.</p><p>24. Discussion line 319 to 320; reporting the cost why it is a limitation to this study?</p><p>The cost verification in this study was done with the fewest variables. We thought that more careful verification was needed, so the cost calculation is raised as a limitation. We have modified the sentences according to the concept (P23 L337-340 in the Manuscript).</p><p>Second, this study reported the cost of implementing FIT. Verification of cost-effectiveness was required in several places. In this study, the verification was done with the fewest variables. More valuable evidence was needed to determine whether the CPP-mediated procedure can take root in society [36].</p><p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the manuscript. I have a few questions regarding its content:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>1. Could key statistical findings be added to better highlight the study&#x02019;s impact?</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion. We have added the main statistical results in the section.&#x03000;</p><p>We have added the following sentences in the Abstract section as follows (P2 L31-36 in the Manuscript).</p><p>A significantly higher percentage of people in their 40s underwent the test in the CPP-mediated procedures (35.2% vs. 14.3% in the hospital/clinic, and 21.8% in the health examination institution, respectively, p &#x0003c; 0.01). The percentage of participants who underwent a detailed examination was significantly lower than in the other two groups (46.7% vs. 87.3% in the hospital/clinic, and 83.0% in the health examination institution, respectively, p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>2. How does the community pharmacy approach specifically address gaps in CRC screening participation compared to other methods?</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion. We have added the sentences (P3 L40-42 in the Manuscript).</p><p>In particular, the CPP-mediated procedure may address gaps by increasing the number of young people and people with low opportunity to receive CRC screening.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>3. Was there variability in how pharmacists communicated the procedure, and could this variability have influenced participant uptake?</p><p>Yes, there was. The degree to which pharmacists communicated the procedure may have influenced participants' uptake. We have added these sentences to the study limitation in the Discussion section (P24 L343-346 in the Manuscript).</p><p>Although the pharmacists volunteered to participate in this implementation, there was variability in how they communicated the procedure. This variability may have influenced the actual CRC screening rate.</p><p>4.

</p><p>Sameen Abbas, Ph.D.</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Prof. Abbas,</p><p>We are pleased to learn that our manuscript (PONE-D-24-43344_R2, Involvement of community pharmacy pharmacists in fecal immunochemical screening without government support in Japan) can be considered for publication in your journal.</p><p>We have responded to the reviewers&#x02019; comments point by point below. We have highlighted the sentences that have been added to the text in red.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1. Methodology: Minor additional suggestion on ethics. Would suggest to remove line 135 to 136: Informed consent was obtained from all participants with FIT examination before they completed the questionnaire; sounds like repetition and remain with line 137 which cover both FIT examination and enrollment.</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion. As suggested, we have deleted the sentence.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1. The grammar needs to be improved throughout the manuscript. The language is not good.</p><p>We have asked a native speaker, through an editing company, to proofread the manuscript. We hope this has improved the language and grammar of the manuscript. We have also included the English editing certificate for your reference.</p><p>2. The main message of the paper is not clear. What's the main takeaway of the paper that the reader should have.</p><p>We appreciate your question. The main message of the paper is the possible contribution that CPPs can make towards CRC prevention through FIT. This has been added in Conclusions section.</p><p>3. I was confused when I was reading the paper about the intent of the authors. Are they describing how community pharmacies don't have enough uptake? They conclude that the procedure can be sustained without financial incentives, but where do authors state this in the paper?</p><p>We appreciate your comment. Accordingly, we have added the following sentences to the Conclusions section to present the relevant information (L349-352 in the manuscript):</p><p>The uptake rate in the current study was low. However, as the procedure requires the recipient to bear the cost, increasing the uptake rate could help to financially sustain this procedure. In addition, motivation for the pharmacists themselves to engage in the activity is likely to exist, as it increases the social value of CPPs.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0322879.s012" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response_to_Reviewers 20250326.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0322879.s012.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0322879.r006" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0322879.r006</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Abbas</surname><given-names>Sameen</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Sameen Abbas</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Sameen Abbas</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0322879" id="rel-obj006" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
