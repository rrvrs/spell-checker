Our major findings are that the AddaVax adjuvant more significantly enhanced local antigen uptake, while the AddaS03 adjuvant more significantly enhanced antigen uptake in draining LNs; &#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Discussion, &#x0201c;AS03-like&#x0201d; in the parentheses has been changed to &#x0201c;AddaS03&#x0201d;.</p><p>In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, &#x0201c;AS03-like&#x0201d; has been removed in the fourth sentence.</p><p>In the last paragraph of the Discussion, the sentence &#x0201c;More studies are required to evaluate antigen processing and induction of antigen-specific T and B cell responses in the presence of the two adjuvants&#x0201d; has been changed to &#x0201c;More studies are required to evaluate the antigen processing and induction of antigen-specific T and B cell responses in the presence of AddaVax and AddaS03&#x0201d;. The last sentence has been changed to &#x0201c;The more potent adjuvant effects of AS03 observed in clinical studies might be related to the different vaccines explored (avian influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H5N8 vaccines) or simply reflect the differential responses of humans and mice to squalene emulsion adjuvants [13&#x02013;15].&#x0201d;</p><p>In the Conclusions, the last two sentences should be as follows: &#x0201c;More work is needed to identify MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways to aid in a better understanding of AddaS03&#x02019;s adjuvant effects. Overall, our work contributes to the understanding of the similarities and differences of the two squalene emulsion-based vaccine adjuvants in the potentiation of DC function and adaptive immunity, although it remains to be explored how the results obtained with AddaVax and AddaS03 can be translated to MF59 and AS03 adjuvants&#x0201d;.</p><p>The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected.
