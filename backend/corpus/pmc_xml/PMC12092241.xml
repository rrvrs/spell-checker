Moreover, the molecularly distinct principal neurons of hippocampal area CA2 are required for social recognition memory and aggression in mice. To interrogate the effects of stress on CA2-dependent behaviors, we chemogenetically manipulated neuronal activity in vivo during an acute, socially derived stressor and tested whether memory for the defeat was influenced. One day after an acute social defeat (aSD), defeated mice spent significantly less time investigating another mouse when compared to non-defeated control mice. We found that this avoidant phenotype persisted for up to one month following a single defeat encounter. When CA2 pyramidal neuron activity was inhibited with Gi-DREADD receptors during the defeat, subject mice exhibited a significantly higher amount of social avoidance one day later when compared to defeated littermates not expressing DREADDs. Moreover, CA2 inhibition during defeat caused a reduction in submissive defense behaviors in response to aggression. In vitro electrophysiology and tracing experiments revealed a circuit wherein CA2 neurons connect to caudal CA1 projection neurons that, in turn, project to corticolimbic regions including the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, socially avoidant, defeated mice exhibited significant reductions in cFos expression in caudal hippocampal and limbic brain areas during a social investigation task 24&#x02009;h after aSD. Taken together, these results indicate that CA2 neuronal activity is required to support behavioral resilience following an acute social stressor and that submissive defensive behavior during the defeat (vs. fleeing) is a predictor of future resilience to social stress. Furthermore, CA2 preferentially targets a population of caudal CA1 projection neurons that contact cortical brain regions where activity is modulated by an acute social stressor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Physiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES 21 100221</award-id><award-id>ES 21 100221</award-id><award-id>ES 21 100221</award-id><award-id>ES 21 100221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radzicki</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>McCann</surname><given-names>Katharine E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Alexander</surname><given-names>Georgia M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dudek</surname><given-names>Serena M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The acute stress response is conserved across species and allows an organism to learn from and adapt to a myriad of potentially threatening environmental stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent studies have highlighted variability in physiological and behavioral effects following exposure to a stressor. In humans, for example, a traumatic stressor can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can manifest as hyperarousal, social deficits or aggression with patients often exhibiting comorbid disorders like major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, only a subset of humans develop PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similarly, only a subset of mice exposed to the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) behavioral paradigm, in which subject mice are challenged with multiple stressful encounters with an aggressor mouse over consecutive days, develop social avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the vulnerable, &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d;, mice, this chronic stress has been shown to cause long lasting changes in brain regions like the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], striatum, and hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and alter defensive behaviors in susceptible animals, while a more &#x0201c;resilient&#x0201d; population of mice exhibit minimal effects of the chronic social stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, chronic stressors like CSDS, restraint and early-life social stress can lead to gross morphological changes in limbic regions including the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recent work has highlighted the transcriptomic and structural differences between vulnerable and resilient groups in an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying stress susceptibility. For example, both the behavioral responses in a light/dark place preference assay and glucocorticoid-dependent modulation of excitatory signaling have to been shown to be predictive of which mice will go on to exhibit deficits following CSDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, it is the mice that exhibit stronger defensive behaviors over repeated encounters with an aggressive mouse, that go on to show social investigative levels similar to non-defeated control mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Within the hippocampus, the morphologically and functionally distinct hippocampal area CA2 has been shown to be required for social behaviors like social recognition memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], allowing animals to form and maintain social partnerships and discern a safe, familiar animal from a potential threat. This ability to discriminate between a familiar and&#x000a0;a novel conspecific, or at least show a preference for novel mice, engages downstream targets of CA2, such as caudal CA1 projection neurons, and results in activation of corticolimbic regions like the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Importantly, inhibition of CA2 during a social discrimination task does not affect overall sociability (social exploration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. CA2 activity has also been shown to positively regulate aggression towards a conspecific via direct, excitatory projections to the dorsal lateral septum, and chemogenetic disruption of CA2 activity adversely affects context dependent fear memory in female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, area CA2 expresses a higher density of the mineralocorticoid stress hormone receptor (MRs) when compared to the surrounding hippocampal subfields of dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Conditionally knocking out MRs in CA2 neurons not only alters the unique molecular profile of CA2 neurons, but is also sufficient to disrupt social behavior and promote hyperarousal in response to a novel object, behaviors which are also seen in vulnerable animals following restraint stress and the CSDS paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Although a stressful memory may play a crucial role in an animal&#x02019;s ability to predict a future threat, cognitive flexibility is also important when adapting to a changing environment. Hippocampal regions like the DG and ventral hippocampus, as well as cortical areas like the prefrontal cortex, are required for reversal learning which, in turn, may underlie a more resilient phenotype when animals are faced with a stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In fact, some research suggests that stress may facilitate this adaptive flexibility; although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, it is likely that hippocampal activity during reversal learning plays a role in the variable responses observed in a given population following either acute or chronic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Given hippocampal area CA2&#x02019;s established role in adaptive behaviors like social processing, aggression and contextual fear memory, and the functional role of mineralocorticoid stress hormone receptors in maintaining CA2&#x02019;s molecular identity and associated behaviors, we sought to better understand the role of CA2 in stress resilience and susceptibility using an acute model of social defeat stress (aSD). Although this model has been well established in Syrian Hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], recent evidence has highlighted social investigative deficits in mice following a single bout of social defeat by an aggressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Using a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, behavioral, and in vivo chemogenetic techniques, we investigated whether the hippocampus, specifically area CA2, plays a role in social stress resilience and susceptibility in response to an acute social defeat stress. Lastly, given the lack of direct cortical projections from rostrodorsal hippocampus, we investigated how information from CA2 is routed to corticolimbic brain regions required for social processing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and handling</title><p id="Par6">All procedures were approved by the NIEHS Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of animals.

We defined aggression as low latency (&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x02009;s) to attack a novel, C57 adult male mouse over successive days. Subject mice remained in the CD1 home cage for a single, 5-min bout of aSD and were then returned to their homecage. Twenty-four hours after the aSD, non-defeated control mice and defeated subject mice were placed in a novel arena that contained a littermate of the CD1 aggressor housed in a wire cup and allowed to explore the arena for five minutes before being returned to their homecage. In order to determine the effect of aSD over time, mice were again placed in the day 2 arena at one week, 4 weeks and, in a subset of mice, 12 weeks, that again contained a littermate of the CD1 aggressor and allowed to explore the context for five minutes. The CD1 littermate mice presented during the day 2 avoidance test were novel to the subject mouse at the 24-h, one week and four-week time points. At the three-month time point, subject mice were presented a CD1 mouse from an early timepoint do to CD1 litter size limitations. Non-defeat control mice were age matched to experimental mice, received no viral injections, no CNO, and had no previous exposure to CD1 mice. Moreover, non-defeat controls mice remained in their home cage prior to the day 2 avoidance test and were not exposed to a novel C57 mouse during day 1 of our paradigm. Video recordings were taken during both the defeat and the investigative encounters for behavioral analysis. Defeat videos were analyzed by an experienced individual, blinded to genotype as applicable, and the following behaviors were scored: amount of direct aggression a subject mouse received (seconds); passive submission (freezing) during aggression + subject flee reactions when facing aggression (seconds); defensive submission, defined as a subject mouse taking a defensive, often upright posture and standing its ground when facing aggression (seconds). Passive and defensive submission scores were later added together in order to calculate total submission during defeat.

To better understand these potential effects, we subjected adult male, wildtype mice (C57BL/6&#x02009;J) to a 5-min bout of aSD in the home cage of a male CD1 aggressor mouse. One day after this stressful encounter, subject mice were placed in a novel arena that contained a male littermate of the CD1 aggressor and were allowed to explore the context for 5&#x02009;min. We then calculated the amount time a subject mouse spent in the far zone of the area (avoidance) and the number of discrete entries into the interaction zone surrounding the CD1 mouse (investigation) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). When compared to non-defeated control mice, defeated mice spent significantly more time in the far zone of the arena (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b&#x02013;d</xref>). Additionally, they exhibited significantly fewer entries into the interaction zone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Not only did aSD result in a reduction in social investigation, but defeated mice also covered significantly less total distance over the course of the 5-min avoidance assay (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). We next asked if any metrics observed during the day 1 defeat would predict the degree of social avoidance a defeated subject mouse would exhibit 24&#x02009;h later. We observed no significant correlation between either the amount of aggression a subject received and the amount of time of spent in the far zone (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>) or total observable submissive behaviors such as freezing, flee, and defensive posturing and avoidance 24&#x02009;h post defeat (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Surprisingly, this avoidant phenotype persisted in the more &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d; population of defeated mice: when re-exposed to the day 2 context, containing a novel CD1 mouse, one month after the initial acute defeat exposure, defeated mice that spent &#x0003e;200&#x02009;s in the far zone of the arena on day 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, red) continued to exhibit significantly higher levels of avoidance when compared to more investigative cohort of defeated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, blue, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>).

To that end, we injected intracranially a cre-dependent inhibitory Gi-DREADD AAV into area CA2 of cre+ and cre- Amigo2-icre-ERT2 male mice. Forty-five minutes prior to the defeat, CNO was delivered intraperitoneally to both populations of subject mice, effectively silencing CA2 neuronal output in subject mice (cre+ defeat group, expressing Gi-DREADD) during the stressful defeat encounter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Cre- and cre+ mice were then subjected to the day 2 avoidance test as previously outlined (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). Similar to what we observed in male C57 wildtype, defeated cre- mice (no DREADD-expressing control mice), with CA2 activity left unperturbed, spent significantly more time in the far zone of the arena (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) with significantly fewer entries into the interaction zone surrounding the CD1 mouse (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) than non-defeated control mice. Surprisingly, cre+ mice, with CA2 neuronal activity inhibited during defeat, exhibited an even stronger avoidance phenotype when compared to cre- defeat counterparts as measured by time spent in zone opposite the CD1 mouse (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>) and number of entries in the surrounding interaction zone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). The significant increase in social avoidance in mice where CA2 activity was inhibited during the defeat was driven by the loss of the more investigative/&#x0201d;resilient&#x0201d; population of cre+ mice. When comparing the two defeated populations, 61.1% of cre- mice exhibited an investigative phenotype versus 16.7% of cre+ mice. Conversely, although 38.9% of cre- defeats showed an avoidant phenotype, this avoidant population significantly increased to 83.3% in cre+ defeated mice (Chi-square 40.69, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). As CNO-driven activation of an inhibitory Gi-DREADD is known to exert its effects for up 6&#x02009;h following administration, we next wondered if the investigative deficits we observed in cre+ mice were due to CA2 neuronal inhibition during acquisition (during the defeat) or as a result of Gi-DREADD mediated disruption of consolidation of the stress memory which occurs on the order of hours following acquisition. To better understand the role of these distinct phases of memory processing we ran a second cohort of Gi-DREADD expressing mice through the aSD paradigm with CNO being delivered to both cre- and cre+ defeat groups immediately following the defeat (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Chemogenetic inactivation of area CA2 immediately following the defeat encounter had no statistically significant effect on avoidance levels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), whereas both groups showed significantly less avoidance levels relative to defeated cre+ animals that had CA2 activity inhibited during defeat (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Chemogenetic inactivation of CA2 alters investigation of a CD1 mouse 24&#x02009;h after defeat.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Acute social defeat experimental timeline.

When CA2 was inhibited during the defeat, cre+ mice spent significantly less time in defensive postures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) and showed a significant reduction in defensive submission as a percentage of total submissive behaviors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between the amount of aggression a subject mouse received, and the amount of time spent in a defensive submissive posture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>).

In the first test, the day 1 social defeat stress was replaced with a stressful fear conditioning assay, consisting of five tone-shock pairings followed by the day 2 avoidance test and re-exposure to the footshock context (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>).

Although CA2 afferents to dorsal lateral septum (dLS) have been shown to underlie aggression towards a conspecific, these pyramidal neurons, like those in dorsal CA1, are not believed to directly project to higher level brain areas like the mPFC. Within the hippocampus, it is the projection neurons located in caudal CA1 (cCA1) that form excitatory connections with such regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. To better understand how CA2 activity may be transmitted to these cortical areas we performed whole cell, patch-clamp experiments in cCA1 of cre+ Amigo2-icreERT2 mice that expressed channelrhodopsin (AAV5-DIO-ChR2-EYFP) in rostrodorsal CA2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). This allowed us to record light-evoked excitatory synaptic responses in CA1 pyramidal neurons of coronal slices along the dorsal-intermediate-ventral (DV) axis of the caudal hippocampus originating from rostrodorsal CA2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>). We observed strong rostrodorsal CA2 (rCA2) axonal labeling in the dorsal and intermediate regions of caudal hippocampal slices (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref><bold>)</bold>. Notably, we saw limited EYFP+ labeling in the more ventral region of the cCA1 cell body layer. Consistent with this observation, optical stimulation of rCA2 axons resulted in excitatory synaptic currents in both dorsal and intermediate caudal CA1 cells, with the largest response amplitudes observed in intermediate cCA1 pyramidal neurons, but minimal to no synaptic responses in CA1 cells in the more ventral region of the caudal DV axis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>). The evoked responses we did observe were of a significantly lower amplitude than those recorded at intermediate levels.

Action potentials were evoked using 500&#x02009;ms stepwise current injections and although we observed a trend towards more robust firing in dorsal CA1 cells, we found no significant difference in firing rates between groups at 400 pA current injections (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>).

As these CA1 neurons have previously been shown to project to extrahippocampal, cortical targets, we next investigated whether cCA1 could be acting as an intermediary in a disynaptic circuit routing CA2 information to higher order limbic brain areas.</p><p id="Par30">We first asked whether activation of CA2 neurons resulted in increased activation of cortical neurons as approximated by cFos staining. To do this, we expressed cre-dependent, excitatory Gq-DREADDs in rCA2 neurons of cre+ and cre- Amigo2-icreERT2 mice via bilateral intracranial injections. After allowing for expression of the Gq-DREADD construct, rCA2 neurons were activated following a single IP injection of CNO (1&#x02009;mg/kg) and the mice were euthanized 90-min later. Brain sections from these mice were immunohistochemically labeled for the immediate early gene (IEG) cFos, one marker for neuronal activity. Although cFos was detectable in cortical areas of cre- control animals, chemogenetic activation of rCA2 drove a significant increase in the number of cFos+ neurons in the ACC of cre+ mice when compared to control mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Similarly, Gq-DREADD activation resulted in a marked increase in the number of cFos+ cells in both the prelimbic and infralimbic subregions of the mPFC of cre+ mice when compared to cre- controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>). Furthermore, Gq-DREADD activation of rCA2 neurons resulted in a significant increase in cFos+ cells within the caudal CA1 region when compared to cre- control mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a, b</xref>). Given our finding that (a) rCA2 neurons synaptically activate dorsal and intermediate cCA1 neurons, and (b) GqDREADD activation of CA2 results in increased cFos expression in ACC, mPFC and caudal CA1, we wondered if dorsal or intermediate cCA1 neurons project to ACC and mPFC. To address this question, we unilaterally infused retrogradely transported AAVs (rAAV-mCherry) into either the prelimbic mPFC or the ACC to label CA1 neurons targeting these areas. In coronal sections of the caudal hippocampus, mCherry+ neurons were found labeled along the dorsal-ventral axis of the CA1 cell body layer and specifically in the dorsal and intermediate regions that receive direct, excitatory input from CA2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Next, we recorded from acutely prepared caudal hippocampal slices from cre+ Amigo2-icreERT2 mice that expressed ChR2-EYFP in rCA2 neurons and mCherry+ cCA1 neurons with ACC as a known projection target (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Optical stimulation of rCA2 axons resulted in excitatory synaptic responses in mCherry+ cCA1 neurons that were significantly larger in amplitude than responses in mCherry- cells that presumably target regions other than the ACC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that chemogenetic stimulation of rCA2 is sufficient to drive activation of cells in both the mPFC and the ACC, and that excitatory synaptic information originating in rCA2 pyramidal neurons can be routed to corticolimbic brain areas via cCA1 projection neurons in the dorsal and intermediate regions of the caudal hippocampus. Furthermore, CA2 may preferentially target cCA1 neurons that, in turn, project directly to the ACC.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Activation of CA2 neurons engages corticolimbic brain regions, likely through caudal CA1 projection neurons.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Coronal sections from the anterior cingulate cortex of cre- (top) and cre+ Amigo2-icreERT2 (bottom) mice immunohistochemically stained for the IEG cFos (scale bar = 500&#x02009;&#x000b5;m). <bold>b</bold> in vivo activation of area CA2 via bilateral expression of Gq-DREADDs causes a significant increase in cFos expression in the ACC of cre+ mice compared to cre- mice (cre-: 72.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15.1 cFos+ cells vs. cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;: 239.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.5 cFos+ cells, 8 hemispheres from 4 animals and 6 hemispheres from 3 animals, respectively, unpaired <italic>t-test</italic>

In this experiment, we examined cFos staining in non-defeated controls and cre- and cre+ defeated mice (given CNO prior to defeat). Forty-five minutes following the avoidance test, animals were euthanized, and coronal brain sections cut and immunostained for cFos. We asked whether cFos would be differentially expressed in the highly avoidant cre+ group, where CA2 activity was inhibited during the defeat (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, c, e</xref>). We found that 24&#x02009;h after aSD, the number of cFos+ cells was significantly reduced in the mPFC of cre+ mice when compared to non-defeat controls during social investigation. This effect was largely driven by significantly lower cFos positivity in the prelimbic subregion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Moreover, we observed significantly lower cFos+ neuron counts in highly avoidant cre+ mice in the ACC when compared to non-defeat control mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Notably, cFos+ cell counts from the more heterogeneous cre- defeat population, which contains mice that were either investigative or avoidant fell, on average, between our control mice and our cre+ defeated mice. Somewhat surprisingly, cFos+ was unaffected in the dorsal lateral septum, a region that receives direct input from rCA2 and modulates aggressive behaviors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). In the caudal hippocampus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) the number of cFos+ cells in the cCA1 cell body layer was significantly reduced in both cre- and cre+ defeat groups when compared to non-defeat control mice. Interestingly, this effect is mainly driven by a subregion specific loss of cFos positivity in ventral cCA1, a region that our electrophysiological data suggests receives little to no direct synaptic input from rCA2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). These reductions, along with significantly lower cFos expression in caudal CA3 in cre+ mice, result in significantly lower total cFos+ counts in the caudal hippocampus of both cre- and cre+ socially defeated mice. In the rostral hippocampus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), a region that underlies social recognition memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and also the region most directly affected by Gi-DREADD mediated inhibition in cre+ mice during defeat, we observed a general trend towards reduced cFos expression in defeated animals. The number of cFos+ neurons was only significantly reduced in the rCA1 of cre- defeated mice when compared to non-defeated control mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). Together these data support the idea that inactivation of CA2 during defeat on day 1 can result in decreased activation of ACC that occurs when animals are investigating another animal on day 2. In contrast, cFos staining in hippocampal areas appeared to best reflect whether an animal had experienced defeat, irrespective of CA2 inactivation status the day before.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Defeat alters frontocortical and hippocampal neuronal activity in defeated animals during social investigation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Confocal image of mouse anterior cingulate cortex stained for the immediate early gene (IEG) cFos (green) 45&#x02009;min after the day 2 avoidance test, 20x, scale bar = 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;m. <bold>b</bold> Quantification of cFos+ cells in extrahippocampal brain regions active during the investigation of a CD1 mouse 24&#x02009;h after aSD.

Axons from rCA2 form excitatory synaptic connections with CA1 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal and intermediate regions of the caudal hippocampus (cHPC) and may preferentially target caudal CA1 (cCA1) neurons that project to the ACC. Inhibition of CA2 during an acute social defeat stressor resulted in highly avoidant mice that exhibited significant reductions in defensive behaviors when faced with aggression. Moreover, cFos staining was significantly lower in the rCA2&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;cCA1 &#x02192; ACC circuit in highly avoidant, defeated mice following (the opportunity for) social exploration. Our findings contribute to the increasing understanding of the role that CA2 plays in social behaviors and aggression. Alongside previous work from our lab describing the effects of CA2 inhibition on fear conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], these data support a role for area CA2 in the processing of stressful stimuli. We also report that the acute social defeat paradigm (aSD) is sufficient to drive social avoidance in a subset of defeated mice, not only one day after the defeat, but also weeks later while the more investigative/resilient mice return to avoidance levels similar to those of non-defeated controls.</p><p id="Par33">Previous studies have identified behavioral and physiological markers that can predict whether an animal would exhibit a more &#x0201c;resilient&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d; phenotype following chronic social defeat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although much of this work has focused on identifiable variability prior to the stressor, Willmore, et al., observed that a defensive, &#x0201c;fighting back&#x0201d; phenotype emerged over the 10-day CSDS paradigm in mice that go on to exhibit resilience following the chronic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Consistent with their finding, our results indicate that inhibition of area CA2 during the aSD can significantly reduce the amount of defensive submission in mice that show higher levels of avoidance (low investigation) when compared to defeated mice with unperturbed CA2 activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f, g</xref>). Moreover, and counter to what one may assume, the more time a mouse spends in a defensive posture the more aggression it receives. If chemogenetic inhibition of CA2 activity is disrupting the CA2 to dorsal lateral septum (dLS) excitatory projections known to positively regulate aggressive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], it follows that neuronal activity along this pathway may promote defensive aggression, versus freezing or fleeing, thus leading to a more investigative phenotype following aSD. One question that arises is whether the upright defensive posturing we describe as defensive submission can be considered on the spectrum of aggressive behavior. Our reasoning for categorizing this behavior as submission is two-fold; for one, we only observed this posture in response to aggression and never as active or instigative and two, we did not observe subject mice biting or lashing out towards the aggressor. If defensive submission is akin to aggression, we might expect to see changes in cFos expression in the dLS of defeated mice. Surprisingly, when defeated mice were exposed to a littermate of the CD1 aggressor 24&#x02009;h after defeat, we observed no changes in cFos staining in either the dorsal or lateral septum, regardless of whether CA2 was previously active or inhibited (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, cre- and cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;, respectively). This could be because while active during the defeat, the rCA2 &#x02192; dLS circuitry may not be reactivated during the day 2 investigation/avoidance test. To better understand the response of brain circuitry during social stress, future work will focus on cFos activation patterns in our regions of interest during the defeat itself. If defensive submission during defeat promotes a more resilient phenotype, as our data suggests, we would expect to see differential patterns of cFos activation along the rHPC-cCA1-ACC pathway when comparing cre- and cre+ mice. This would also further our understanding of a potential role of the ACC in defensive behaviors during received aggression. Interestingly, we also found that CA2 itself has the lowest levels of cFos staining of all the hippocampal areas. However, we know from our in vivo and in vitro work, CA2 neurons are active during social interactions, but that they have unique molecular features that would be predicted to suppress IEG expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Future work will help us to better understand the role rostral CA2 may playing in promoting a more defensive response to aggression to support a more investigative/resilient phenotype following an aggressive encounter.</p><p id="Par34">CA1 cell bodies span the length of hippocampus along the dorsal-ventral axis in the mouse brain, and cCA1 excitatory projections to the lateral septum, amygdala and cortex have been shown to regulate and modulate anxiety-related behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Conversely, the rostrodorsal hippocampus is believed to make few if any afferent connections to higher brain regions that underlie &#x0201c;emotional&#x0201d; behaviors, but more likely send intrahippocampal projections to cCA1 projection neurons that, in turn, project to limbic centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Although much of the literature on hippocampal circuits has focused on the dense concentration of ventral cCA1 projection neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we found that rCA2 axons preferentially target CA1 neurons in the more dorsal/intermediate regions versus the more ventral region of the cHPC. Consistent with our results, Raam &#x00026; Sahay demonstrated that optogenetic inhibition of rCA2 afferents terminating in the more dorsal/intermediate region of cHPC was sufficient to disrupt social discrimination during a three-chamber social memory task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Conversely, Meira et al. disrupted social discrimination memory by chemogenetically inhibiting CA2 axons in ventral CA1 (direct injection of CNO). Though we did not observe direct synaptic input from rCA2 onto these more ventral neurons, we did see that reductions in cCA1 cFos expression was primarily found in neurons in vCA1. A possible explanation for the results observed by Meira, et al. is that CNO diffused from the ventral injection location and modulated CA2 axon in more intermediate regions. Moreover, previous work has detailed the reciprocal connectivity both within cCA1 and between cCA1 regions and the subiculum, another important, cortically projecting output region of the hippocampal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. As we provide evidence that rCA2 sends excitatory signals to dorsal and intermediate cCA1, the afferent connections to either more ventral or subicular projection neurons could further modify hippocampal information before subsequent transmission to corticolimbic regions implicated in stress and anxiety. Future work will be required to better understand not only how rostral hippocampal information is routed to extrahippocampal, cortical regions, but also how reciprocal connectivity within caudal projection neurons alters or modulates outbound transmission.</p><p id="Par35">Activity in the ACC is modulated by stress. For example, in humans with post-traumatic stress disorder, exposure to emotionally relevant stimuli results in hypoactivity of the ACC when compared to healthy counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In mice, an early-life stressor, such as maternal separation, reduces the activation of ACC pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Furthermore, repeated social defeat changes ACC IEG level in a manner consistent with the social hierarchy position (Basil, Gross et al. 2018). Caudal hippocampus is known to project to ACC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], and we found that rostrodorsal CA2 neurons form excitatory synaptic connections onto cCA1 neurons that project to limbic regions such as the mPFC and anterior cingulate cortices. We also found that inhibition of CA2 during aSD (cre+ group, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>) significantly reduces social investigation (<italic>i.e</italic>., increases &#x0201c;susceptibility&#x0201d;) in defeated mice that also had reduced cFOS+ cells in the ACC. Thus, these findings support the idea that a CA2&#x02192;cCA1&#x02192;ACC pathway may at least partially control an animal&#x02019;s response to social stress acutely, as well as the memory of social stress. Given our results that defeated mice show reduced cFos levels along this pathway, and specifically in the ACC of the more avoidant, cre+ mice, future experiments could use Gq-DREADD mediated activation of either dCA2 or the ACC to effectively counter this deficit and restore the investigative deficits of susceptible mice.</p><p id="Par36">Pyramidal neurons in CA2 express high levels of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), but not glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which prompted this study to examine the role of CA2 in processing information related to a stressful social stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Even given the high levels of MRs in CA2, our experiments demonstrate that mice undergoing the fear conditioning (shock) protocol showed minimal avoidance behavior, showing that avoidance is not a generalized response to stress or stress hormones. Rather, the nature of the stressor does seem to be an important factor for later avoidance. We note however, that, in keeping with the mouse aSD experimental design first reported by Rosenhauer et al., subject mice were not presented with an empty wire cup prior to interacting with the CD1 littermate. For that reason, we are unable rule out the idea that subject mice are reacting to a novel object versus a novel social stimulus. Our data supports the idea that an animal&#x02019;s behavior during the defeat (flee vs. defensive behavior) is likely to be a major contributor to later avoidance. Note that the two scenarios, either (a) CA2 activity is central for &#x02018;learning&#x02019; the identity of an aggressor, or (b) CA2 activity is critical for defensive submission, which could be required for the resilient/investigative phenotype, would be exceedingly difficult to disentangle. Also still unknown is whether the resilient/investigative (CA2 activity intact) mice were simply better able to &#x0201c;learn&#x0201d; during the defeat the exact identity of the aggressor (better social discrimination during the defeat), leading them to be less likely to avoid the unfamiliar CD1 mouse. Some level of social discrimination is required for the avoidance behavior, however, in that defeat by a CD1 failed to lead to avoidance of a conspecific. Thus, CA2 activity, be it by modifying behavior in response to an aggressor, and/or by aiding in social discrimination, plays a critical role in the lasting effects of social defeat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
