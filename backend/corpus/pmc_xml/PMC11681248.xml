Focusing on hypothalamic function, the effects of local anesthesia, CRF, and PRF on central and peripheral temperatures were analyzed and compared. Our findings revealed that all three nerve block groups cause a decrease in central temperature, with the CRF group exhibiting the most pronounced effect. Furthermore, immunostaining analysis showed decreased neural activity in the preoptic area, suggesting that nerve blocks may influence central thermoregulatory mechanisms. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of peripheral nerve blocks on thermoregulation and may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies to managing perioperative hypothermia and enhancing pain management, especially in patients undergoing surgeries with high risks of thermoregulatory complications, such as on-pump surgery and laparoscopic surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Thermoregulation</kwd><kwd>Peripheral nerve block</kwd><kwd>Local anesthesia</kwd><kwd>Conventional radiofrequency thermocoagulation</kwd><kwd>Pulsed radiofrequency</kwd><kwd>The preoptic area</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Peripheral nervous system</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">The regulation of body temperature is vital for optimal physiological function. Neurons in the hypothalamus serve as the thermoregulatory center, detecting changes in body temperature and responding appropriately to uphold thermal equilibrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While the effect of general anesthesia on body temperature is well recognized, epidural and spinal anesthesia methods, typically devoid of direct drug exposure to the brain, have also been implicated in impaired thermoregulation and lowering overall body temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These methods result in the blocking afferent pain signaling and efferent nerves that control vasoconstriction and shivering, ultimately leading to reduced body temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the effects of peripheral nerve blockade, wherein local anesthesia is administered at a more peripheral site compared to epidural or spinal anesthesia, on thermoregulation remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p id="Par11">This study aimed to investigate the effect of different nerve-blocking techniques (local anesthesia, conventional radiofrequency thermocoagulation [CRF], and pulsed radiofrequency [PRF]) on thermoregulation. CRF involves the application of continuous electrical current to heat tissue and disrupt nerve function, typically used for chronic pain conditions where other treatments have failed. It is indicated for conditions such as facet joint pain, trigeminal neuralgia, and chronic low back pain. On the other hand, PRF is a minimally invasive method that delivers intermittent electrical pulses to nerve tissues, causing less neural damage and is indicated for conditions like neuropathic pain and radicular pain. Both techniques aim to modify the pain signals before they reach the brain, potentially influencing thermoregulatory pathways by altering peripheral nerve inputs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par12">Given the necessity for immobilization of the mice during the procedure, nerve blocks were conducted under general anesthesia with isoflurane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). However, it is important to note that general anesthesia with isoflurane significantly impairs thermoregulation and concurrently lowers the thresholds for vasoconstriction and shivering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, a comparative analysis of the sham and nerve block groups was performed to evaluate central and peripheral temperatures, aiming to determine the timing of recovery from the temperature reduction induced by isoflurane.</p><p id="Par13">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">In this study, we investigated the effects of different nerve block methods (local anesthesia, CRF, and PRF) on body temperature using mice. Similar to previous reports, the administration of general anesthesia resulted in decrease in body temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, a decrease in the central temperature was observed in radiofrequency ablative techniques and peripheral nerve block groups. Furthermore, immunostaining with c-Fos antibody revealed that the number of active neurons in the MnPO, the thermoregulatory center, was significantly decreased in the radiofrequency ablative techniques and peripheral nerve block group. These findings suggest that nerve blockade leads to decreased central and peripheral body temperature and decreased neural activity of the MnPO may be involved in this temperature reduction.</p><p id="Par24">We performed three types of nerve blocks with different mechanisms of action. Local anesthesia suppresses nerve activity by inhibiting neural depolarization (Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes). CRF thermally denervates by generating continuous radiofrequency waves from the tip of the needle to generate a high temperature (80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) at the needle tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. PRF involves the intermittent generation of radio waves to maintain the needle tip at approximately 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to induce nerve block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although the detailed mechanism of action remains unclear, PRF is an effective method for treating neuropathic pain because it is less likely to cause hypoesthesia, unlike local anesthesia and CRF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Both PRF and CRF have been reported to be effective for chronic pain involving sympathetic nerves, suggesting that they may act on the sympathetic system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This implies that both PRF and CRF could influence body temperature, as evidenced by the temperature changes observed in this study when compared to the sham group. However, the specific mechanisms through which they affect thermoregulation remain unclear, necessitating further research. Our results revealed that the three nerve block methods had different effects on the central and peripheral temperatures. Notably, the right hind paw surface temperature after the procedure was higher in the local anesthesia group than in the other groups. This result is consistent with the fact that epidural and spinal anesthesia block the autonomic nervous system and inhibit vasoconstriction. Although the sciatic nerves treated in this study are primarily composed of sensory and motor fibers, they do contain some autonomic fibers as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which may explain why the hind paw surface temperature of the right foot was higher in the local anesthesia group compared to the other groups. Since local anesthetics tend to infiltrate the surrounding tissues, it is speculated that they may block a wide range of nerves, including autonomic nerves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This infiltration might explain why the CRF group, which is supposed to induce permanent nerve degeneration, showed differences in peripheral temperature compared to the local anesthesia group. The autonomic nervous system is not only contained within the sciatic nerve but also extensively distributed directly from preganglionic fibers, with its pathways being quite diverse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The response to hypothermia is to inhibit the release of body heat, typically by constricting the peripheral blood vessels. In the local anesthesia group, the administered local anesthetic blocked a wide range of autonomic nerves and inhibited peripheral vasoconstriction, which could potentially affect body temperature. However, a decrease in body temperature was observed after 90&#x000a0;min post-treatment in the CRF and PRF groups, without clear inhibition of peripheral vasoconstriction. This suggests that nerve blocks may impact central thermoregulation through a mechanism other than autonomic nerve blockade (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The observation of reduced body temperature following nerve block, alongside decreased activity in the MnPO, prompts consideration of alternative explanations such as sensory input disruption or vasodilation-induced heat loss. The role of peripheral nerve input in central temperature regulation is complex and involves multiple pathways and feedback mechanisms. As demonstrated by Morrison and Nakamura, the hypothalamus integrates various sensory inputs to maintain thermal homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">

</p><p id="Par26">The sham group recovered its central temperature at 60 minutes post-treatment, whereas the nerve block group showed no such recovery. Reports typically suggest that nerve blocks performed far from the central nervous system, as in this study, do not usually affect the overall body temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, contrasting with the results observed in our research. This difference may be attributed to the nerve block technique. The local anesthesia blocks nerve transmission by suppressing neural depolarization, whereas CRF blocks nerve transmission via thermal denervation. The sensory blockade induced by local anesthesia and CRF primarily affects the afferent nerve fibers that carry temperature and pain signals to the central nervous system. The hypothalamus integrates various sensory inputs, including temperature, to maintain homeostasis. Under normal conditions, it receives constant updates on peripheral temperature, which it uses to initiate compensatory mechanisms such as vasodilation or vasoconstriction, shivering, and sweating to maintain core temperature. When peripheral sensory inputs are diminished due to nerve blocks, the hypothalamus may not receive accurate temperature signals, leading to inappropriate thermal responses. Research has shown that thermoregulation is critically dependent on the integrity of afferent and efferent pathways within the autonomic nervous system. For instance, studies have highlighted how regional anesthesia can lead to hypothermia by blocking sympathetic nerve activity, which is crucial for vasoconstriction and shivering responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, the inactivation of sensory inputs can lead to an &#x02018;underestimation&#x02019; of peripheral temperatures, causing a shift in the hypothalamic set point for temperature regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Additionally, the role of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which is significant in mediating the sensory transmission to the hypothalamus, cannot be overlooked. Disruption in glutamatergic transmission due to nerve blocks might impede the hypothalamus&#x02019;s ability to accurately gauge and respond to changes in body temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Taken together, these two groups may have had reduced sensory stimulation from the area innervated by the blocked nerve, thereby affecting central thermoregulation.</p><p id="Par27">Surprisingly, the PRF group, which supposedly did not experience a decreased sensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, also showed a decrease in body temperature. PRF may act centrally, without altering the activity of thermosensitive receptors. CRF and PRF have been shown to affect nerve fibers differently. CRF, by generating high temperatures, can cause extensive coagulative necrosis affecting all types of nerve fibers, including C fibers and A&#x003b4; fibers, which are primarily involved in pain transmission and temperature sensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. PRF, meanwhile, by delivering electrical energy intermittently, might preserve the structure of the nerve while still modulating its function, potentially affecting the signaling pathways without complete denervation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, PRF may exert mechanisms other than peripheral neuronal control, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par28">MnPO is an important neuronal region involved in maintaining body temperature homeostasis, the greatest characteristic of homothermal animal, through autonomic thermoregulatory responses such as heat dissipation and production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. MnPO not only monitors core body temperature (brain temperature), but also receives environmental temperature information from temperature sensors in the skin via sensory nerves. In fact, when body temperature is lowered, the neurons expressing prostaglandin EP3 receptor in the MnPO are activated, suppressing heat dissipation and production by inhibiting sympathetic output. When body temperature is increased, the GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the MnPO are activated, which induces heat production and maintains thermostability through sympathetic nerve activation. Thus, when body temperature is regulated, neural activity is always observed in the MnPO. Our findings revealed that the number of activated neurons in the MnPO was the highest in the sham group, followed by the local anesthesia and PRF groups, and the lowest in the CRF group. This order is the same as that for the central temperature at 90&#x000a0;min post-treatment. Taken together, the delayed recovery of body temperature in the nerve block groups suggested that this might be due to decreased neural activity of MnPO, a central thermoregulatory mechanism.</p><p id="Par29">Long-term observations have provided insight into the long-term effects of nerve blocks on body temperature regulation. The transient temperature decrease observed exclusively in the CRF group at three hours post-treatment suggests a prolonged effect of CRF on thermoregulation, which may be due to more sustained nerve damage. However, the normalization of temperatures across all groups thereafter, and the lack of significant differences in c-Fos activity in the thermoregulatory centers at 48&#x000a0;h, suggest that the acute thermoregulatory disturbances caused by the nerve blocks are temporary and do not result in lasting alterations in central thermoregulatory functions. These findings underscore the resilience of the thermoregulatory system, and the transient nature of the thermal disturbances caused by peripheral nerve blocks.</p><p id="Par30">This study has some limitations. An important limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size of three mice per group, which may not provide sufficient statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes. This was a deliberate choice made during the initial design phase of our experiment, aiming to balance the need for demonstrable results with ethical considerations regarding the use of mice. The main objective of this study, the effect of each treatment group on body temperature compared to the untreated group, was statistically significantly different. However, a larger sample size would be needed to examine significant differences between treatment groups. Moreover, since the procedure was performed under general anesthesia with isoflurane, making comparisons with local anesthesia-only conditions is challenging. General anesthesia itself affects body temperature; therefore, comparisons should also be made with the block method alone. Additionally, the degree of sensory and motor nerve damage caused by each nerve block was not evaluated. Furthermore, to analyze the differences in thermoregulation caused by different types of nerve blocks, the following factors must be considered, assuming similar block efficacy: type and amount of local anesthetic, voltage and duration of PRF and CRF, etc. Therefore, the differences in the effects between nerve blocks will be investigated in the future.</p><p id="Par31">The effects of epidural and spinal administration of anesthesia on thermoregulation have been previously reported; however, the effects of peripheral nerve blocks have not been clarified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Since hypothermia increases the risk of postoperative complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, thermoregulation plays an important role in cases of prolonged surgery and treatment of severely ill patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To minimize these risks and improve patient outcomes, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of peripheral nerve blocks on thermoregulation is warranted. This study revealed that different nerve block methods (local anesthesia, CRF, and PRF) have complex effects on central and peripheral thermoregulation. These results suggest that MnPO, the thermoregulatory center, may be involved in these phenomena. Although it remains to be seen how nerve block in the DRG affects the neural circuitry of thermoregulation to the MnPO via the spinal dorsal horn, our results offered valuable insights into the impact of peripheral nerve blocks on thermoregulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Animal experiments</title><p id="Par32">Eight-week-old C57B/6J male mice were purchased from the Japan Society for the Promotion of SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).
