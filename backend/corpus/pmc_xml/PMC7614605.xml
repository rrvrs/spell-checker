Large patient cohorts incorporating longitudinal plasma sampling and extended follow-up are required to determine the role of ctDNA as a phylogenetic biomarker of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we developed ctDNA methods tracking a median of 200 mutations identified in resected NSCLC tissue across 1069 plasma samples collected from 197 patients enrolled in the TRACERx study<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Lack of preoperative ctDNA detection distinguished biologically indolent lung adenocarcinoma with good clinical outcome. Postoperative plasma analyses were interpreted within the context of standard-of-care radiological surveillance and administration of cytotoxic adjuvant therapy. Landmark analyses of plasma samples collected within 120 days post-surgery revealed ctDNA detection in 25% of patients, including 49% of all patients who experienced clinical relapse; 3 to 6 monthly ctDNA surveillance identified impending disease relapse in an additional 20% of landmark negative patients. We developed a bioinformatic tool (ECLIPSE) for non-invasive tracking of subclonal architecture at low ctDNA levels. ECLIPSE identified patients with polyclonal metastatic dissemination, which was associated with poor clinical outcome. Through measuring subclone cancer cell fractions in preoperative plasma, we found subclones seeding future metastases were significantly more expanded compared to non-metastatic subclones. Our findings will support (neo)adjuvant trial advances and provide new insights into the process of metastatic dissemination using low ctDNA level liquid biopsy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">ctDNA is a multi-faceted biomarker, pre-surgical ctDNA levels reflect relapse risk in early-stage NSCLC<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and postoperative ctDNA detection highlights impending NSCLC recurrence<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.

The ER corresponding to each TNC alternate was calculated as DAO/DDP (DDP, deep UMI-corrected depth across a TNC alternate). In order to measure only PCR and sequencing error, a position in the ROI was not included in the TNC ER calculation if the VAF at that position for a particular alternate was &#x0003e; 1% (on the basis that this could represent a clonal haematopoiesis associated mutation or a single nucleotide polymorphism).</p><p id="P36">A mapping of tumour observed variants and their accompanied TNC ERs was generated.

Therefore, if a clone has a total combined error of less than two mutant reads only one group will be used. A maximum number of clusters is set to four as the default value (which was used for application to the TRACERx plasma sequencing data).

Erroneous clusters may not continue to track at similar CCFs in data from new samples. To identify such clusters, the distribution of ECLIPSE-calculated CCFs in each clone in a ctDNA sample are quantified using normalised standard deviations (SDs). The SDs can then be compared to the expected CCF distributions of high confidence clones, for example clonal clusters in higher purity plasma samples. In our data we quantified the normalised SD of all clonal clusters in samples of greater than 5% purity and took the upper 95% confidence interval for this data calculated at 0.56. Subclonal clusters with normalised SDs for CCFs &#x0003e; 0.56 were considered of poor quality and were not considered for analysis. This identified 2.6% of clones in the TRACERx data as of poor quality.

Our companion article<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> has focused on metastatic disseminations estimated from primary tumour tissue including disseminations detected at surgery to local lymph nodes (also excised at initial surgery). Metastatic dissemination to excised local lymph nodes cannot be estimated in cfDNA alone, as preoperative ctDNA may derive from either metastatic lymph nodes or the primary tumour. For tissue based metastatic dissemination calls at relapse, relapse seeding primary tumour subclones from Al-Bakir et al. that were tracked by PSPs were considered<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. These clones were used to determine whether a single clone or multiple primary tumour clones seeded the tissue relapse (monoclonal and polyclonal dissemination respectively). Using the phylogenetic tree in polyclonal cases, we also determined whether clones were directly descended from one-another in the same clade (polyclonal monophyletic) or if there is branching between the disseminating clones into different clades (polyclonal polyphyletic). For metastatic dissemination calls at relapse based on post-operative cfDNA, the number of relapse seeding clones was determined <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> without reference to the relapse tissue samples.

Metastasis unique subclones tracked by PSPs in surgically excised lymph nodes or intrapulmonary metastases which were also present at relapse were not considered when defining primary tumour to relapse metastatic dissemination patterns, as they represent metastasis to metastasis seeding rather than primary to metastasis seeding.

To assign each clonal mutation to a VAF cluster the mclustBIC and then Mclust functions from the mclust package (v5.4.7) were used. In this case 4 VAF clusters were identified. The mutations in the lowest VAF cluster had an average VAF 1.2% and mutations in the second lowest VAF cluster had an average VAF of 12.1%. If the lowest cluster represented mutations with multiplicity of 1, the large majority of mutations in the remaining 3 clusters would therefore be presented at very high multiplicities (&#x0003e;10) given their &#x0003e;10 fold higher average VAF which would represent a biologically implausible amount of allele duplication across the genome, equivalent to 5 compounded whole genome doubling events. A more plausible explanation of these data is that the lowest cluster represents mutations with a multiplicity of 0 in a new subclonal population which has expanded at the final time point to a CCF &#x0003e;80%. Consistent with this, the mutations in the lowest VAF cluster were present at very similar VAFs in the previous plasma sample time point, consistent with the notion that these mutations remained only in those same tumour cells at the final time point, but not in the expanded subpopulation. The second lowest VAF cluster also contained 100% of the mutations which were associated with a multiplicity of 1 in the tumour tissue WES data. Therefore we assigned the second lowest VAF cluster a multiplicity of 1, the second highest cluster (average VAF of 25%) a multiplicity of 2 and the highest VAF mutation (KRAS G12 variant, VAF = 84%) a multiplicity &#x0003e;2.

As a result two germline variants (chr6:31118898:A:T and chr16:70928307:C:A) were targeted. These two variants were removed from consideration in making the MRD call automatically by the Outlier Filter in every library prepared with this panel (refer to the Library-specific MRD Calling section above) but were kept in all analyses and not manually blanked. Two patients lacked Archer picked variants (CRUK0157, 0227), CRUK0157 as the exome data could not be processed by the Archer variant picking pipeline and CRUK0227 due to an error during PSP primer ordering.</p></sec><sec id="S46"><title>Neoantigen pipeline</title><p id="P65">HLAHD was used to determine the patient-specific HLA composition. 9-11mer peptides harbouring nonsynonymous mutations coupled with patient-specific HLA were used as input to NetMHCPan4.1.

Six AMP enrichment panels were generated targeting 50 SNPS heterozygous in NA24385 and absent from the other four cell lines. To generate contrived samples NA24385 DNA was spiked into a background of the other four samples at ratios of 0.006% to 0.2% by mass to target variant allele frequencies ranging from 0.003% to 0.1% allele frequency (since heterozygous variants are present at 50% in the neat NA24538). As part of the same dilution series, admixtures with target allele frequencies of 1%, 5% and 10% were made. These mixtures were used as input for AMP library preparation to confirm that mixing based on mass achieved the desired target allele levels. The spike-in variant level was measured in these higher AF libraries by adding the number of deep alternate reads across the targeted SNPs and dividing by the total coverage of all deep reads across targeted SNPs. This analysis confirmed that the spike-ins achieved the targeted AFs. Fragmented DNA inputs from 2ng to 80ng were used in the experiment to reflect the range of DNA inputs encountered in a clinical setting. Overall 559 of 634 samples were deemed evaluable for LOD1 analysis (62 samples failed because of incorrect DNA input used, determined by on-target read per primer per ng input of &#x0003c;30 or &#x0003e;400, 8 samples failed because they had less than 10 million reads and 5 samples due to potential duplicate libraries). Clinical samples were used in validation of AMP MRD (LOD2) and were prepared using a similar method to the Genome in a Bottle mixtures. Whole exome sequencing data from four patients was used to design patient-specific panels with the ArcherDx panel design algorithm containing 50 SNVs. The panels were used to prepare libraries using cfDNA from each patient and the overall tumour variant AF for each sample was calculated by adding the total number of deep unique reads containing a targeted tumour-specific variant and dividing by the sum of the deep unique coverage across all targeted tumour variants. All four patient cfDNA libraries had a total AF of &#x0003e;1%. A single mixture was made using cfDNA from healthy donors and used to dilute the patient cfDNA. These dilutions were performed as a serial dilution. First a dilution was made targeting a 1% total AF and libraries were prepared using this mixture. The total AF was measured for this sample and a dilution correction factor was calculated to account for differences in conversion efficiency between the background cfDNA. For example, if a 1% AF was targeted and an AF of 1.3% was observed then this would indicate that the patient cfDNA is more efficiently converted to library than the background and more background DNA would need to be used. Mixtures were then made to achieve AFs of 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01%, 0.008% and 0.005%. A total of 100 libraries were prepared at 5 AFs and 3 input masses. 48 blank samples (DNA donated from 24 healthy donors) were analysed to assess assay specificity. Panel observed allele frequencies were calculated by taking the number of deep alternate reads noted across the AMP panel, removing estimated background error and dividing by deep depth across the panel. For experiment LOD3 an AMP PSP was generated targeting 300 heterozygous SNPs in Genome in a Bottle product HG002. HG002 was diluted into a background mixture of HG003, HG005, HG006 and HG007 at multiple dilution levels such that heterozygous variants located in HG002 were present at final AFs of 0%, 0.003%, 0.005%, 0.006%, 0.01%, 0.03% and 0.05% and 0.1%. Using stocks of these contrived input materials, 10 ng was input into library preparation. 2 libraries were prepared at AFs from 0% to 0.05% and a single library was prepared at 0.1% AF using the 300 variant AMP panel. <italic toggle="yes">In silico</italic> subsampling was performed on the 15 libraries.

Based on these data mock tumour signatures (genomic positions covered by the enrichment primers with positions of similar expected error rates of the targeted SNVs) were generated. A mock variant was added to a mock signature if the following criteria was met: It is bi-directionally covered by primers intended for MRD detection, It contained the same TNC-group error rate as the true MRD variant it is replacing, it was not a known population SNP variant as dictated by Ensemble's Variant Effect Predictor version 94.5, had a error-corrected coverage delta no more than 2,000 compared with the true MRD variant, and was not used within any other mock tumour signature, including itself. Thus, the resulting mock signatures targeted bases that are not mutated in the primary tumour and any positive MRD call from these mock signatures was by default a false positive. 3157 mock signatures across 91 pilot cfDNA libraries were interrogated for MRD positive calls A simulated ctDNA level was estimated for each sample by taking the number of deep alternate reads noted across the mock signature, removing estimated background error and dividing by deep depth across the mock signature.

The confidence intervals on the plot are Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (95% CIs). The X axis shows the quantity of variant germline DNA that was spiked into each repeat expressed as a percentage of total DNA in that sample. <bold>F</bold>. Circulating tumour DNA samples with high variant allele fractions were spiked into a different cell-free DNA background. Variant positions in ctDNA were targeted with a 50 variant panel; 100 data points were generated across the DNA input quantities indicated. Axes and error bars are the same as (E). <bold>G</bold>. Data from analyses of 48 blank samples donated by 24 healthy participants, caller P values are displayed. <bold>H</bold>. Barplots demonstrating the intended allele frequencies and the measured allele frequencies in the different spike-ins presented in part (E) and part (F) only data from variant DNA positive samples are presented. The colours of the barplot represent different DNA input masses as shown by the legend. The error bars on the plot represent the mean value of all positive spike-in samples +/- standard deviation of the values. Where the error bar is absent, this is because at this spike-in level and DNA input mass, only one positive sample was observed. Where the error bar led to an observed mean AF less than 0, the error bar was stopped at 0 for visualisation purposes (the 0.05% spike-in, 2ng input mass case). The horizontal dashed lines correspond to 0.1%, 0.05%, and 0.01% spike-in categories.

The ctDNA detection method estimates intra-library, trinucleotide specific sequencing error rates. For calling ctDNA, the number of consensus reads at all positions targeted by a patient specific panel (PSP), that pass described filters are compared to expected error rates. To detect subclones, ECLIPSE evaluates the collective signal across all mutations in each subclone and integrates this with primary-tumour derived copy number information to estimate plasma cancer cell fractions (CCF), clonal sweeps (where a subclone reaches 100% CCF) and metastatic dissemination patterns. The ctDNA analysis approach is described further in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>. <bold>B</bold>. Heatmap of clinical features associated with preoperative ctDNA analyses in non-pilot TRACERx patients (with non-synchronous primary tumours). N2 upstaging row: patients clinically staged with N0/1 lymph-node involvement upstaged to N2 disease by pathology; grey - no pathology staging. pTNM stage row: pathological tumour node metastasis (v7) stage. Volumetrics row: tumour volume (cm<sup>3</sup>) measured by computed tomography, grey - unevaluable, log10 transformed. Barcharts: mutations tracked by a patient's PSP categorised by clonality; black - mutation undetected (per-variant one-sided Poisson P value &#x0003e;0.01, methods), red - mutation filtered by MRD caller, blue - mutation detected. Clonal ctDNA level: the mean percentage of mutant consensus reads across all clonally mutated positions tracked by a PSP (log10 transformed, methods), patients with 0% level are given a white colour, a non-zero clonal ctDNA level can occur in ctDNA negative patients where signal was insufficient to result in confident detection of ctDNA. <bold>C</bold>. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating overall survival outcomes in ctDNA high (dark red), ctDNA low (blue) and ctDNA negative (grey) non-synchronous adenocarcinoma patients (left) and non-synchronous non-adenocarcinoma patients (right). ctDNA high and low was categorised based on median clonal ctDNA levels across all ctDNA positive NSCLCs (0.16%).

In all panels, each circle represents a cfDNA sampling time point. Circles to the left of surgical day are preoperative timepoints, circles to the right of surgical day are postoperative timepoints. Black filled circle: positive ctDNA detection. Light blue rectangles: chemotherapy, dark blue rectangles: radiotherapy, orange rectangles: patient received post-recurrence surgery. Triangles represent standard of care postoperative CT, PET or MRI surveillance imaging (imaging up until first relapse or last follow-up displayed on plot). Imaging classified as no disease (grey), equivocal images (yellow), or unequivocal imaging evidence of extracranial relapse (red). Light green triangles: no evidence of intracranial relapse, dark green triangles: intracranial relapse. Vertical black lines: the event date for a patient (if death, second-primary, NSCLC recurrence occurred); otherwise, the vertical line represents last TRACERx follow-up. Crosses: patient death events. To the left of the panels, the annotation plots highlight histology, pTNM (pathological TNM) status, relapse site, and details regarding whether an intracranial relapse was isolated (brain-only) or non-isolated (brain and extracranial site) or occurred without extracranial imaging to confirm solitary status.

Depiction of a clonal illusion where a dark blue subclone is found in 100% of cells in a single clinical tissue sample. Such clonal illusion mutations may be detected in a clinical setting using ctDNA derived from many different tumour regions to increase accuracy of ITH measurements in the clinic. Mutations which were clonal (CCF &#x0003e; 90%) in a single, randomly selected tumour region are compared using plasma-based preoperative CCFs splitting by those truly clonal across all tumour regions in TRACERx (clonal) and those which, whilst they were clonal in the randomly selected region, were absent from other tumour regions (clonal illusion). Only data from a single randomly selected region was used by ECLIPSE to generate these CCFs. The distribution of plasma CCFs in each case is represented by a violin plot and a box and whisker plot. A Wilcoxon-test was used to compare groups. Only preoperative samples with at least 0.1% clonal ctDNA level (high subclone sensitivity samples, 71 samples from 71 patients) were included in this analysis (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref> for analysis of lower ctDNA levels). M-seq = Multiregional sequencing. <bold>B</bold>. Box and whisker plots of preoperative plasma primary tumour subclone CCFs split by whether a given subclone was found to be present or absent in cfDNA samples at relapse and postoperative plasma CCFs for relapse subclones at the last high subclone sensitivity timepoint. Only tumours with at least one sample &#x0003e;0.1% clonal ctDNA level (high subclone sensitivity) both preoperatively and postoperatively were included (N=26 tumours with CCFs from 247 subclones included). Two sided Wilcoxon-tests were used to compare groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS176197-f004" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Longitudinal measurements of clonal evolution in plasma from surgery, through therapy and to recurrence.</title><p><bold>A-D</bold>. ctDNA purity for each clone is calculated by multiplying the clone CCF by the ctDNA purity of the plasma sample (<xref rid="S15" ref-type="sec">methods</xref>) and represents the fraction of all cells from which cfDNA was derived which harbour a given tumour clone at each timepoint.
