This ensures that unnecessary referral, which can delay a patient's access to care and increase waiting times for those requiring specialist input, is avoided.</p><p>The first part of this paper aims to describe medical conditions where the provision of endodontic treatment is complicated by a medical risk, bleeding, or infection, or in instances where avoiding extraction is indicated. It aims to provide the reader with the skills to appropriately risk-assess the patient and offer safe endodontic care and help develop an understanding of how medical conditions can influence whether or not endodontic treatment is preferred to exodontia.</p><p>The second part of the paper aims to present endodontic techniques and adaptations which can be implemented to reduce the risks and challenges experienced by this patient cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Bleeding conditions</title><p>There are several bleeding disorders that may have an impact on the endodontic management of a patient with a wide range of aetiologies (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Therefore, it is good practice to consult the patient's haematologist before delivering any invasive care to ascertain if any precautionary measures need to be taken.</p><p>Depending on the dental treatment indicated, patients may require a range of haematological preparations before attending. These preparations include tranexamic acid (topical and oral), desmopressin and factor replacement, and are dictated by the patient's condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6410">8</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6412">9</xref></sup> Some preparations may need to be directly administered by the haematology team, which necessitates close liaison when organising the timing of appointments. It is therefore often more practical for these patients to be treated in a setting close to a haematology centre. Other preparations, such as oral tranexamic acid and the immunological medication emicizumab, are self-administered by the patient. The introduction of emicizumab for the management of haemophilia A, and increasing numbers of patients being responsible for providing their own haematological preparation, have reduced the barriers for these patients accessing some dental treatment in primary care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6415">10</xref></sup></p><p>From an endodontic perspective, the World Federation of Hemophilia guidance states that non-surgical endodontic management is generally a low-risk procedure in terms of bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6417">11</xref></sup> However, consideration must be given to the preferred local anaesthetic technique, as administering an inferior dental block (IDB) is considered a higher-risk procedure for bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6417">11</xref></sup></p><p>To minimise bleeding risk, buccal infiltrations with articaine or intraosseous or intraligamentary anaesthesia could be used as an alternative to an IDB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Platelet disorders</title><p>As with factor deficiencies, non-surgical endodontic management is considered a low-risk procedure. The minimum recommended platelet count required for endodontic treatment varies between haematology centres. When providing endodontic care, the haematology team must be consulted for all patients with a platelet count of less than 50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6420">12</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6423">13</xref></sup> In patients with platelet defects (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), platelet levels may be normal or even raised. Liaison with the haematology team is essential to determine if haematological management is required, as qualitative defects in platelets may significantly impair clotting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cardiology conditions</title><p>Heart and circulatory diseases affect more than 7.6 million people in the UK and subsequently will be regularly encountered by a general dental practitioner. Cardiovascular diseases encompass a wide range of conditions, including ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and infective endocarditis (IE).</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessing the stability and severity</title><p>Assessing the severity and stability of a cardiac condition is essential to determine if endodontic treatment can be provided safely in a primary care setting. Angina is a common clinical feature of IHD, which presents typically as chest pain resulting from myocardial ischaemia during periods of increased exertion. Angina episodes increasing in frequency, new onset of severe angina, pain occurring at rest, and prolonged episodes of pain lasting longer than 15-20 minutes, are all indications of unstable angina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6426">14</xref></sup></p><p>Additionally, patients with IHD are at risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Historic guidelines state that elective dental care should be avoided in the six months immediately post-MI, on the basis that the risk of complications is highest during this period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6429">15</xref></sup> However, emerging evidence suggests the period in which elective care should be avoided is as little as 4-6 weeks post-MI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6431">16</xref></sup> Patients requiring urgent management of dental pain who have recently had an MI should be referred onwards for treatment in a hospital setting where facilities to manage a potential medical emergency are readily available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6433">17</xref></sup></p><p>Cardiac arrhythmias range from mild conditions which have little to no effect on cardiac function, to life threatening arrhythmias which require immediate medical management. The presence of symptoms, such as fatigue, dizziness, syncope and angina, are all indications of a poorly controlled arrhythmia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6435">18</xref></sup> In addition, asking a patient how regularly they see a cardiologist provides insight into both the severity and stability of the condition.</p><p>Heart failure is a progressive disease which has a minimal impact on endodontic treatment in the early stages, where numerous compensatory mechanisms maintain cardiac output. As the disease progresses, cardiac function deteriorates and pulmonary congestion results, leading to dyspnoea. Subsequently, patients may struggle to lie supine. Asking a patient about the position they sleep in can help guide whether they are likely to tolerate treatment in a supine position. Endodontic treatment may be contraindicated if there is insufficient access due to patient positioning.</p><p>In patients with unstable heart disease, which poses a constant threat to life and significant risk of a medical emergency occurring, further medical or surgical management may be planned, in which case, elective endodontic care should be delayed until the disease is more stable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6438">19</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6441">20</xref></sup> In instances where treatment cannot be delayed or the stability is unlikely to improve, patients should be treated in a specialist setting in close liaison with the cardiologist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6441">20</xref></sup> For example. for patients with unstable cardiac conditions, treatment in a hospital or theatre setting in the presence of, or following consultation with, an anaesthetist may be required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pain and anxiety management</title><p>Pain and anxiety can increase heart rate and risk of angina, or induce arrhythmias, so excellent pain and anxiety management is essential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6435">18</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6445">21</xref></sup></p><p>In patients with known arrhythmias, the use of large volumes of local anaesthetic with adrenaline should be avoided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6435">18</xref></sup> However, it is imperative that analgesia is adequate during endodontic therapy to avoid pain, stress and anxiety, and the resultant release of excessive endogenous catecholamines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6447">22</xref></sup> Thus, local anaesthetic with adrenaline should not necessarily be avoided, and evidence suggests that using less than four cartridges of lidocaine with adrenaline 1:80,000 was relatively safe for cardiovascularly compromised patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6449">23</xref></sup></p><p>Alternative treatment modalities, such as conscious sedation, should be considered where patients have significant dental anxiety to reduce the stress experienced. Inhalation sedation with nitrous oxide is of particular benefit for those with cardiovascular conditions due to additional availability of oxygen and the beneficial effect of increasing cardiac output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6452">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Anticoagulation</title><p>Patients with heart disease may be anticoagulated. Anticoagulants include anti-platelet medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel; direct oral anticoagulants; low-molecular-weight heparins, such as dalteparin and enoxaparin; and the vitamin K antagonist warfarin. As previously discussed, non-surgical endodontics is a low-risk bleeding procedure and therefore can be safely carried out in these patients. Both infiltration anaesthesia and IDBs can be safely administered; however, if an IDB is required for a warfarinised patient, the international normalised ratio (INR) should be below 4.0. The INR should be measured no more than 72 hours before the procedure and no more than 24 hours before for those where the INR is unstable. Excellent guidelines published by the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) on the management of patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs are available and the reader is encouraged to read these for further information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6402">5</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Risk of infective endocarditis</title><p>IE is a rare, life-threatening infection affecting the endocardium; in particular, the heart valves. SDCEP provide implementation advice for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines published in 2015, providing guidance as to how to manage patients presenting with an increased risk of IE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6454">25</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6457">26</xref></sup> It is worth noting that the European Society of Cardiology guidelines differ in terms of when antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended, and the prescribing regimen and NICE are currently reviewing their guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6457">26</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6460">27</xref></sup> The reader should therefore ensure that they refer to the most up-to-date guidance.</p><p>Patients at increased risk of IE can be seen in <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

As for IV bisphosphonates, most studies demonstrated a risk of less than 5% for oncology patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6485">36</xref></sup> Due to its different mechanism of action, the risk of MRONJ in patients taking denosumab decreases following cessation of the drug and current evidence suggests that the risk is low in patients who have not taken it in over nine months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6487">37</xref></sup> It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss all the drugs that present a risk of MRONJ and readers are directed to the SDCEP guidelines for further guidance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6489">38</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Osteoradionecrosis</title><p>Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) presents as an area of exposed necrotic bone or a fistula in an area of the mandible or maxilla which has been exposed to radiotherapy.

In cases of heavily broken-down teeth or retained roots, the split dam technique, combined with the use of a flowable liquid dam, can be employed to achieve effective isolation. To further minimise trauma to the gingival tissues, a careful selection of rubber dam application is essential. Polymer non-traumatic RD clamps, such as SoftClamp (Kerr, Switzerland), or use of Wedjets elastic stabilising cord, should be considered to prevent unnecessary soft tissue trauma. Additionally, floss ties or composite resin tags can be placed on the tooth surface to ensure optimal rubber dam fit and security. For patients with nasal breathing difficulties, such as those with an obstructed airway, adjusting the rubber dam placement can offer significant relief. Lowering the rubber dam frame slightly or creating a small breathing window at the base of the dam can help maintain adequate ventilation without compromising the isolation of the treatment site (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p> Lowered rubber dam placement creating a breathing space for a patient with an obstructed nasal airway while maintaining isolation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41415_2025_8561_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Although sodium hypochlorite remains the gold-standard irrigant for endodontic treatment due to its effective antimicrobial properties, other irrigants, such as chlorhexidine, can be considered in cases where achieving an effective coronal seal is challenging. Chlorhexidine has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as antifungal efficacy against <italic>Candida albicans</italic>; however, its effect on microbial biofilms is significantly weaker than sodium hypochlorite and it has minimal tissue solubility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6509">46</xref></sup> This may be advantageous in situations where chemical properties of sodium hypochlorite pose patient safety concerns due to the risk of leakage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Single-visit versus multiple-visit endodontics</title><p>Single-visit endodontics should be strongly considered in medically complex patients due to its advantages, including reduced risk of bleeding/trauma episodes and subsequently the reduced need for factor replacement and other haematological adjuncts, which can be costly and have side effects. In addition, there is greater convenience for both patients and carers, and decreased anxiety associated with multiple visits, all while maintaining the same reported level of effectiveness as multi-visit treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6511">47</xref></sup> The single-visit approach is particularly recommended for patients with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, as supported by the latest European Society of Endodontology S3 guidance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6400">4</xref></sup> Reciprocating file systems, such as WaveOne Gold (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland) or Reciproc Blue (VDW, Munich, Germany), can be especially useful due to a simple file sequence and minimal number of files required for the shaping of the root canal system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Managing limited mouth opening</title><p>For patients with trismus, using mouth props can provide a comfortable and stable working space.

Pre-bending of the endodontic file and use of tweezers can be used to guide the endodontic instruments precisely into the canal orifices, reducing the need for excessive hand movement and improving visualisation (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In the initial stages of root canal instrumentation, orifice openers, such as the ProTaper Gold SX file (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland) can also be used. These shorter-length files facilitate access and shaping of the coronal portion of the canal, which reduces the stress on the subsequent instrumentation files and provides straight-line access (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p> 21 mm (left) vs 25 mm (right) K file</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41415_2025_8561_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p> Use of tweezers with a pre-bent K file</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41415_2025_8561_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p> Comparison of length of orifice opener file ProTaper Gold (19 mm) (left) against 25 mm WaveOne Gold family of files</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41415_2025_8561_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>Additionally, refrigerant spray, such as Endofrost (Roeko, Germany), can be used to cool and temporarily modify the properties of nickel-titanium endodontic instruments, enabling greater flexibility in the manipulation to reach root canal orifices (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

This is especially important in the management of curved canals, where the canal curvature tends to straighten following shaping, leading to a decrease in the overall working length; therefore, frequent use of the electronic apex locator (EAL) is recommended. EALs are more accurate than using periapical radiographs alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6513">48</xref></sup> Additionally, the use of the periapical radiographs should be minimised for the bleeding patient cohort due to the low risk associated with intra-oral trauma during film placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6515">49</xref></sup></p><p>In the case of suspected prolonged apical bleeding, it is essential to confirm that all pulpal tissue has been fully removed from the apical and lateral portions of the root canal system through instrumentation and copious irrigation with sodium hypochlorite. Paper points soaked in a refrigerant spray such as Endofrost (Roeko, Germany), together with application of gentle apical pressure, can be used to effectively manage a bleeding apex. However, caution should be exercised when using refrigerant sprays, as excessive use may cause localised tissue necrosis. Additionally, injecting a local anaesthetic solution with adrenaline into the canal space or applying adrenaline topically (in a 1:1,000 concentration) using paper points can be effective in reducing bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6515">49</xref></sup> If apical bleeding cannot be controlled due to factors such as severe inflammation or infection, placing an intracanal medicament and scheduling a follow-up visit may be appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Restorability of the tooth and obturation</title><p>Single cone obturation with a hydraulic calcium-silicate cement (HCSC) sealer is a suitable approach for this patient cohort, as it provides a simplified technique that minimises procedural time while maintaining an effective seal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6517">50</xref></sup> HCSCs have multiple desirable properties, including biocompatibility and excellent sealing abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6520">51</xref></sup> In cases where teeth are deemed unrestorable and extraction is contraindicated due to the risk of developing ORN or MRONJ, an alternative obturation with sole use of HCSCs can be performed.
