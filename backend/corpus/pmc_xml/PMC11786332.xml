Forty interviews with trial participants (20 young people and 20 parents) were deductively coded to an analytic framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] based upon the four core NPT constructs. Coding was led by LH, supported by PL, and shared regularly with the wider team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Data source 4: Usage statistics</title><p id="Par32">During the testing of Eczema Care Online the online platform automatically recorded usage: frequency of visits, duration of visits, hits on specific bits of the platform, etc. This usage data was collected from the intervention arm of each trial and included 171 parents and carers and 168 young people who were given access to Eczema Care Online. A review of this data identified the most frequently used aspects of the intervention which allows a refining of Eczema Care Online prior to implementation. For example, aspects rarely used might be edited or removed, more frequently used aspects might be positioned to make them easier to identify and access.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data source 5: Existing eczema websites</title><p id="Par33">To understand how Eczema Care Online fits within the landscape of currently available online information for eczema, we identified what other online eczema resources are available. We looked for: a) websites or webapps providing information about the cause, management, treatment or living with eczema; b) both public facing and targeted to professionals; c) freely accessible to members of the public. We did not consider any resources that required registration or payment to access.</p><p id="Par34">Beyond those resources that the authors were already aware of (such as the NHS or national organisation websites) others were identified by searching <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.google.co.uk">www.google.co.uk</ext-link> (3rd-9th Feb 2022). A variety of simple queries relating to eczema management were searched (to replicate how an average google user may find resources), a country filter for the United Kingdom was used to limit hits. This search was not intended to be comprehensive or replicable.</p><p id="Par35">Two researchers (LH, PL or NR) independently reviewed website content and provided a subjective rating of the &#x02018;unique selling points&#x02019; of each.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p id="Par36">We created a theoretical framework that articulates a context specific interpretation of NPT. This includes the four key NPT constructs with examples of processes considered to be supportive of the successful implementation of Eczema Care Online (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Framework to support implementation planning</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2024_12179_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">Populating this framework using data generated during the development and testing of Eczema Care Online informs a practical plan for implementation. Building this plan potentially requires a negotiation between NPT constructs and practical, contextual considerations. For example, NPT analysis might identify the National Health Service (NHS) as a &#x02018;trusted source&#x02019; of information (NPT&#x02014;collective action), but implementing Eczema Care Online via the NHS might require an assessment of which NHS sources are most relevant or practical.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Results</title><p id="Par38">Through the development and testing of Eczema Care Online several avenues for implementation were identified and/or utilized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Key outputs supporting implementation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2024_12179_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par39">Organised around the four NPT constructs here we present how our understanding about implementation developed.

Marketing materials emphasised this. For example, we created an animation (https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj- ID="EN1"&#x0003e;2022&#x02013;072007#media-1) and social media advertisements that promoted the proven efficacy of Eczema Care Online.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Cognitive participation</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Learning</title><p id="Par45">Users in the process evaluation were generally willing to engage with the platform and found it easier than other routes to access information about eczema (e.g., challenges accessing General Practice, overwhelmed by information via search engines).</p><p id="Par46">However, there was a concern from some stakeholders (public as well as healthcare professionals) that Eczema Care online could &#x02018;add to noise&#x02019; in an online space that is already saturated with &#x02018;mixed messages&#x02019;. Eczema Care Online needs to be up to date and should reinforce, rather than undermine, other trusted sources (e.g., guidelines, manufacturer packaging, healthcare professional advice to patients). The Cochrane review identified some key messages that are currently absent from guidelines, for example that once daily application of topical corticosteroids is adequate for most people.</p><p id="Par47">Healthcare professionals stressed that they need simple and practical ways of incorporating messages into their practice, with electronic systems in primary care being increasingly important.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Actions</title><p id="Par48">We focused upon ensuring consistency and accessibility to promote the use of Eczema Care Online.</p><p id="Par49">To support consistent and up to date messaging, we lobbied key places (e.g., UK guidelines) and disseminated Cochrane review findings widely to encourage shared messaging. We produced a &#x02018;two treatments used well&#x02019; booklet and circulated this via primary care and some pharmacies and secondary care settings. We also contacted providers of electronic system providers so that links to Eczema Care Online could be accessed by primary care staff as well as sent in SMS to patients.</p><p id="Par50">We contacted training providers so that Eczema Care Online could be embedded into healthcare training materials. We also identified secondary care &#x02018;champions&#x02019; who are trusted sources of information for both secondary care and primary care colleagues. We developed template wording for healthcare professionals working in secondary care to add to &#x02018;advice and guidance&#x02019; letters to primary care clinicians and made this available on our website.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Collective action</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Learning</title><p id="Par51">Process evaluation data demonstrated that ease of use is important to people, and that there were some aspects of the Eczema Care Online that needed improving to create an easier experience. For example, some people found the layout of the website confusing and struggled to find the content that they were interested in. Ease of access (i.e., no log in) was identified as being important to make Eczema Care Online more usable.</p><p id="Par52">Stakeholder meetings with members of the public and with representatives of patient groups stressed that where information is found/recommended is important to its legitimacy. The value of signposting from healthcare professionals was recognised in the process evaluation:<disp-quote><p id="Par53"><italic>&#x0201c;they trust their GP</italic> [general practitioner] <italic>and they trust their doctors to give them advice that&#x02019;s good for them.

[&#x02026;] people trust doctors and having it maybe, you know, people talking about it maybe on social media, so it makes it a bit more &#x02013; a bit more &#x02013; reachable.&#x0201d; (Young person aged 24, female, Indian)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par54">Some people were happy to act on information from less trusted but more convenient sources (e.g., social media), but in these case branding (such as &#x02018;NHS recommended&#x02019;) was important.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Actions</title><p id="Par55">In re-designing the website for implementation, we addressed users&#x02019; reported barriers to use. We ensured branding and logos of involved organisations were clear on the homepage and in advertising materials. We contacted numerous legitimate resources about embedding an Eczema Care Online link into their materials (e.g., NICE guidelines, professional body websites, eczema charity websites). To support engagement from trusted sources, we created a concise summary based on the NICE evidence summary framework to emphasise the legitimacy of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We produced a public-facing booklet (described in Cognitive Participation) that could be distributed by healthcare professionals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Reflexive monitoring</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Learning</title><p id="Par56">Healthcare professionals in the stakeholder meetings stressed that research data showing that Eczema Care Online produces a sustained benefit (i.e., trial findings) helps clinicians to feel confident that it works and supports their ongoing usage and recommendation of Eczema Care Online. They made a similar point about organisational support, that research evidence is essential for organisational buy in.</p><p id="Par57">Users within the trial reported that completing questionnaires was helpful for monitoring changes to eczema and that they would value something similar in the future:<disp-quote><p id="Par58"><italic>&#x0201c;even just doing the questionnaires I found quite helpful because it makes me stop and assess how she&#x02019;s doing and I don&#x02019;t know that I would do that in quite the same way &#x02026; in a different context.

Normalisation Process Theory was used to structure and interpret data, shaping future implementation with relevant questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]: <italic>is there a need for Eczema Care Online; do people want to use it; can it be easily used by different individuals; and, how will we know that it has made a difference?</italic> Value propositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were generated to distinguish Eczema Care Online from other sources of online eczema information in what was recognised to be a crowded marketplace.</p><p id="Par64">With regard to research efficiencies, implementation planning reused and repurposed data generated in developing and testing Eczema Care Online, it also piggy-backed onto dissemination events (e.g. of systematic review finding &#x02013; data source 2.1 and 2.2). A concern for implementation complemented all research processes, rather than being a concern to be addressed later.</p><p id="Par65">These activities involved all stakeholders, including people living with eczema, parents of children who have eczema, primary care health professionals, secondary care health professionals, eczema charities and patient organisations, as well as those participating in the Eczema Care Online trials. Negotiating and incorporating different viewpoints about the potential for implementing Eczema Care Online was important, with Normalisation Process Theory providing a framework for synthesising different perspectives (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Links to the website have been embedded in multiple eczema charity websites, professional bodies&#x02019; websites, healthcare professional training resources, and resources used in the NHS (e.g., primary care electronic templates by Ardens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). The website is referenced on the NICE &#x02018;information for the public&#x02019; webpage that supports the &#x02018;Atopic eczema in under 12&#x000a0;s: diagnosis and management&#x02019; clinical guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p id="Par67">Implementation has been central to the project with a commitment to produce a web resource that persists beyond the research that created it. This generated new challenges for researchers who are more often concerned with delivering a clinical trial, not least an unfamiliarity with implementation theories. NPT was selected as an accessible and flexible approach, but this flexibility brings a fluidity that can make it difficult to disaggregate key aspects of implementation. Thinking of NPT on multiple levels (user, healthcare practitioner and organisational) created challenges and some of the team found the language of NPT difficult. An adapted version of the framework is in fitting with the broad approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and helped it to work more specifically in the context of Eczema Care Online (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par68">It is likely that many of those stakeholders whose views informed implementation planning may have already been involved in Eczema Care Online, eczema organisations or other eczema research. Therefore, we may be missing views of important groups of people who are less engaged in eczema organisations or research.</p><p id="Par69">Another possible weakness is that the team lacked marketing and commercialisation experience. A desire to ensure that Eczema Care Online remains free to access for the public is positive but creates a challenge in a financially driven health market. Whilst we have had some implementation success to date, ongoing success is contingent on resources and having funding to maintain a free at point of use intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. To date, we have been monitoring the intervention for functionality and updating content to reflect new evidence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par70">Research projects that aim to develop an online health intervention should consider implementation early to help mitigate against the intervention falling into the &#x02018;implementation gap&#x02019; which often happens due to lack of resources and strategy to take the idea from research to practice. Implementation requires a flexible approach, and whilst it is helpful to draw on available data and theoretical frameworks to inform strategy, understanding context specific requirements and practical constraints is necessary to make a plan that will be feasible and achievable.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p id="Par7">National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p id="Par8">National Institute of Health and Care Excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR</term><def><p id="Par9">National Institute of Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPT</term><def><p id="Par10">Normalisation Process Theory</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all the stakeholders who engaged in consultation to support the development of our implementation strategy.
