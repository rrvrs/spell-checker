This study evaluated the knowledge, beliefs, and practices of healthcare professionals in primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using an online validated questionnaire based on the World Health Organization Hand Hygiene Knowledge Questionnaire. Data were analyzed to identify gaps and patterns across professional roles and demographics. A total of 221 healthcare professionals participated, 76% women and 24% men, 57% aged 30&#x02013;39 years. Most had over 15 years of experience (33%), with nurses comprising the largest professional group. Nearly all participants (91%) had received HH training in the past 3 years, and 88% reported routine use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. However, only 67% correctly identified the minimum time for alcohol-based sanitizer to kill germs, and misconceptions about hand rubbing efficacy persisted. The primary route of germ transmission was identified as healthcare workers' unclean hands. Most participants agreed that hand rubbing is faster than handwashing and emphasized HH after patient contact, exposure to body fluids, or contact with the patient&#x02019;s surroundings. Nearly all endorsed using both hand rubbing and handwashing for specific scenarios, such as before injections. This study highlights strong HH knowledge and adherence among healthcare workers in Riyadh PHCs, reflecting effective training programs. However, persistent misconceptions and knowledge gaps regarding germ transmission and hand rubbing efficacy require targeted interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Beliefs</kwd><kwd>hand hygiene</kwd><kwd>healthcare professionals</kwd><kwd>knowledge</kwd><kwd>practices</kwd><kwd>primary healthcare centers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hand hygiene (HH) is a fundamental practice in infection prevention and control, with its importance emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a key measure to reduce healthcare-associated infections [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For healthcare professionals, particularly in primary healthcare centers (PHCs), effective HH is essential to protect patients and prevent the transmission of infectious diseases within healthcare settings. Despite global guidelines and widespread education campaigns, HH compliance among healthcare workers remains challenging in many countries, including Saudi Arabia. Suboptimal HH knowledge and practices are key barriers to effective infection control [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In Saudi Arabia, various studies have examined HH awareness among healthcare workers, revealing that while most healthcare professionals understand the importance of HH, gaps in knowledge and non-compliance with recommended practices are prevalent. In Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, these issues have been particularly notable in the PHCs, where high patient volumes and close interactions increase the risk of infection transmission. While healthcare workers were generally aware of the critical moments for HH, compliance rates were lower than expected, especially during routine patient care [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recent research has also highlighted the need for enhanced education and targeted interventions to bridge these knowledge gaps. Although healthcare workers were knowledgeable about HH guidelines, significant barriers to proper implementation existed, such as lack of time, heavy workload, and inadequate access to necessary supplies [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Continuous training and institutional support to improve HH practices, especially in high-risk healthcare environments like primary care, is vital [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite the growing body of research, there is still limited focus on the specific knowledge and practices of healthcare professionals in PHCs. Understanding HH behavior in this setting is crucial for designing effective interventions that promote consistent compliance. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of HH knowledge, beliefs, and practices among healthcare professionals in the PHCs located in Riyadh using the WHO hand hygiene knowledge questionnaire for healthcare workers [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|method" id="S2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="S2_1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This cross-sectional descriptive study assessed the HH knowledge, beliefs, and practices of healthcare workers from PHCs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The selected primary healthcare centers were in various districts of Riyadh, representing both urban and suburban areas, to ensure a diverse sample of healthcare workers.</p></sec><sec id="S2_2"><title>Study participants</title><p>The target population for this study was all healthcare professionals working in PHCs in Riyadh. Eligible participants were healthcare workers involved in direct patient care, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, and other allied health professionals, such as laboratory specialists or radiologists. Participants were selected using a convenience sampling method, with a target sample size of 250 healthcare workers, calculated to provide adequate statistical power (5% margin of error and 90% confidence interval) in HH knowledge across various demographic groups. The inclusion criteria comprised all healthcare professionals actively working in PHCs who were willing to participate in the study and had at least six months of experience in patient care. Exclusion criteria involved healthcare workers without direct patient contact (e.g., administrative staff).</p></sec><sec id="S2_3"><title>Data collection instrument</title><p>The data were collected using the WHO HH knowledge questionnaire for healthcare workers, a validated tool widely used to assess the HH knowledge of healthcare workers [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This questionnaire was adapted for the local context and used in various studies worldwide to assess theoretical knowledge and practical understanding of HH protocols. In addition to the demographic data (gender, age range, years of experience, and specialty), the WHO questionnaire consists of multiple-choice questions divided into sections addressing:</p><p>

</p><p>Fourteen questions from the WHO questionnaire were selected and translated into Arabic following a discussion among experts to ensure they aligned with the study's objectives and were clear and understandable for all participants (<xref rid="Supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary file</xref>). A pilot study was conducted with 15 healthcare workers to assess the clarity and validity of the Arabic version, and any necessary adjustments were made before the full-scale study. The reliability of the Arabic questionnaire was assessed using statistical methods, including Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha and inter-rater reliability. A Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; value of 0.80 was obtained, indicating good internal consistency. No modifications were made to the Arabic version of the questionnaire.</p><supplementary-material id="Supp1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="JMedLife-18-332-s001.pdf" id="d100e252" position="anchor"/><p>Supplementary Material</p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="S2_4"><title>Data collection and statistical analysis</title><p>The questionnaires were prepared electronically using Google Forms and distributed to the target participants via email and WhatsApp. The first page of the questionnaire was designed to explain the study to all potential participants and obtain their informed consent.

This study provided insights into adherence to international HH guidelines and identifying areas for improvement.</p><sec id="S4_1"><title>Demographics and training</title><p>Most participants were women (76%) aged 30&#x02013;39 (57%). Similar demographic trends have been reported, as nursing and related professions often have a predominantly female workforce [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most participants (91%) received formal HH training within the last 3 years, aligning with the WHO guidelines emphasizing regular training for effective HH compliance [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This finding is consistent with a report on HH programs in Saudi Arabia, where 91% of healthcare workers had received HH training within 2 years, reflecting the importance of continuous education in maintaining awareness [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4_2"><title>Knowledge of HH practices</title><p>Approximately 67% of participants correctly identified the minimum time (20 seconds) required for effective hand rubbing, aligning with the WHO recommendations [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, 20.8% underestimated this time, indicating potential gaps in their awareness. Similar results were observed in a study in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where 30% of participants were unaware of the recommended duration for handrubbing [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Internationally, gaps in knowledge about HH duration have also been documented, emphasizing the universal need for reinforcing basic concepts through regular training [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4_3"><title>Perceived sources of germ transmission</title><p>Most participants (66.1%) identified unclean healthcare professionals&#x02019; hands as the main route of germ cross-transmission, which aligns with evidence that hands are the primary vectors for healthcare-associated infections [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, misconceptions persisted, with 24.9% attributing the primary source of healthcare-associated infections to air circulation. Similar misunderstandings were observed, where healthcare workers attributed healthcare-associated infections to environmental factors over direct transmission mechanisms [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4_4"><title>Compliance and adherence</title><p>Compliance rates in this study were high, with 94.1% performing HH after patient contact and 92.3% after exposure to patient surroundings. These rates surpass international averages, where adherence to specific HH moments often falls below 70% [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The high compliance reported here reflects the impact of infection control policies in Saudi Arabia, including the national HH campaign, which has significantly improved HH practices [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4_5"><title>Beliefs about hand rubbing versus handwashing</title><p>While most participants (68.3%) believed hand rubbing was quicker than handwashing, over half (59.3%) did not believe it was more effective against germs. This reflects persistent confusion about the complementary roles of these methods. However, 81.4% agreed that handwashing and rubbing should be performed sequentially, reflecting adherence to WHO guidelines [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similar misconceptions were recognized about the importance of using both techniques sequentially.</p></sec><sec id="S4_6"><title>Factors increasing germ colonization</title><p>Participants demonstrated strong awareness of factors increasing hand colonization, with 90% identifying artificial fingernails, 85% identifying jewelry, and 82% identifying damaged skin. These findings are consistent with global recommendations highlighting the risks of such practices [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, only 51% associated regular hand cream use with colonization risk, indicating a gap in understanding product interactions with antiseptics. This pattern was similarly observed in Saudi healthcare facilities [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In conclusion, several studies in Saudi Arabia report high HH training rates but identify gaps in sustained practice adherence and knowledge among less experienced healthcare workers [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Internationally, HH compliance is influenced by workload, institutional policies, and cultural attitudes, with adherence rates varying widely between regions [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The high compliance and training rates observed in this study reflect the success of Saudi infection control efforts, particularly in larger healthcare facilities.</p></sec><sec id="S4_7"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This study has a few limitations. To begin with, the sample size was relatively small, and participants in the PHCs may not represent the broader population of healthcare workers in healthcare facilities in other Saudi regions. Therefore, the results of this study might not be generalizable to other healthcare settings, such as tertiary hospitals. In addition, data on practices, such as HH compliance, often rely on self-reported questionnaires and are prone to overestimation or social desirability bias. Participants may report what they perceive as expected rather than their actual practices. Finally, the study only provides insights into the current state of knowledge or practices but does not account for changes over time, such as variations in compliance during different shifts or after interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study highlights strong HH knowledge and adherence among healthcare workers in the PHCs in Riyadh, reflecting the effectiveness of training programs. However, persistent misconceptions about the efficacy of hand rubbing and knowledge gaps regarding factors influencing colonization require targeted interventions. Future research should explore regional differences in HH compliance and the impact of institutional policies on healthcare workers&#x02019; practices.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S6"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study adhered to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Riyadh Second Health Cluster (IRB# 24-687C).
