</sup> This is one of the main differences from other medical specialties that focus on curing a disease or stabilising an organ. The palliative approach using hypnotherapy is an excellent example of patient-centred care in that the patient, guided by the therapist, plays a key role in addressing their own symptoms. There is a growing demand for integrative approaches to symptom management, most often when traditional medicine reaches its limits and patients continue to experience suffering or have unmet needs.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Hypnosis has gained popular interest over the last few decades and has become increasingly subject to research study.

This practical narrative review aims to help the palliative care clinician advise the patient about the most recent advances in clinical research around hypnosis and to give guidance as to whether this approach may be useful for them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-26323524251321852"><title>Methods</title><p>Pubmed/Medline and Cinhal databases were searched for MESHterms (((&#x02018;Palliative Medicine&#x02019;[Mesh]) OR (&#x02018;Palliative Care&#x02019;[Mesh] OR &#x02018;Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing&#x02019;[Mesh])) AND (&#x02018;Hypnosis&#x02019;[Mesh] OR &#x02018;Hypnosis, Anesthetic&#x02019;[Mesh])). Furthermore, for specific symptoms such as pain, dyspnoea, nausea and anxiety individual searches for each symptom were conducted using again the MESHterms &#x02018;Hypnosis&#x02019; OR &#x02018;Hypnotherapy&#x02019; combined with the symptom MESHterm. The results of both searches were then analysed for relevance to our narrative review: Articles were only included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) included patients receiving palliative care for life-limiting disease; (2) the main intervention was hypnosis; (3) the measured outcome focused on one or several symptoms. When available, only randomised trials, systematic reviews or meta-analyses were considered otherwise other study designs were briefly described in this narrative review.</p></sec><sec id="section3-26323524251321852"><title>What is hypnosis?</title><p>The NIH&#x02014;National Cancer Institute defines hypnosis as &#x02018;<italic toggle="yes">A trance-like state in which a person becomes more aware and focused on certain feelings, thoughts, images, sensations, or behaviours. A person may feel calmer and more open to suggestions in order to aid in healing</italic>&#x02019;.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup></p><p>There are many other definitions of hypnosis, most of them emphasising the presence of an altered state of consciousness or awareness in helping to modulate an unpleasant experience. Palliative care is therefore very well placed to take advantage of this technique. In general, many clinical trials on hypnosis have focused on pain as the main outcome. However, the studied pain situations are varied, ranging from chronic pain to procedure-related pain, as well as cancer pain. There are no studies where palliative care patients (with advanced and progressive disease) have specifically been addressed, although patients with advanced cancer have been included in a few trials.</p><p>During a professional hypnosis session, the patient is guided by a trained hypnotherapist into an altered state of consciousness through induction techniques. This state of mind is called a &#x02018;trance&#x02019; which is a natural experience that an individual has several times a day.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> It is a state of intense focus and concentration, in which the unconscious mind is open to imaging and suggestions that are introduced by the hypnotherapist specifically tailored to the patient&#x02019;s beliefs, needs and behaviour.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr9-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup> One of the goals of hypnosis in palliative care is to have the patient experience in this altered state of consciousness, a pleasant and/or transformed experience of things that are difficult for them (e.g. symptoms, distress and anxiety) in the conscious life. The effect of this experience often continues after the session and the subconscious will integrate progressively what has been enabled during the trance. In summary, hypnosis helps to empower the patient&#x02019;s self-healing capacities, giving back self-esteem and control of the situation.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>The efficacy of hypnosis is influenced by several factors. First, the patient&#x02019;s belief in the intervention and their willingness to comply with therapy. Second, some studies have shown that the degree of hypnotisability also has an impact on a person&#x02019;s response to hypnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Third, the context in which hypnosis takes place is also important. A personalised approach by the hypnotherapist is a fundamental necessity and an excellent example of individual-centred care. Finally, an added benefit is that very few side effects have been reported following hypnotherapy when practiced by a trained healthcare professional.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

</sup> At the beginning of the 19th century, it gained popularity in France through the founder of &#x02018;animal magnetism&#x02019;, Franz Anton Mesmer, who used hypnosis in a more dramatic and spectacular way to &#x02018;align&#x02019; what he believed to be an invisible fluid existing in all living things.<sup>

</sup> In the mid-1900s, an American psychiatrist and psychologist, Milton Erickson, developed what is called today &#x02018;modern hypnosis&#x02019; or &#x02018;Ericksonian Hypnosis&#x02019; by mastering the language as a therapeutic tool while including patients&#x02019; expressions and perceptions in the hypnotherapy session.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr22-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

Therefore, hypnosis, an intervention with which harmful side effects are very unlikely, could be a promising complementary therapy to treat symptoms in palliative care. However, this population has so far, not specifically been subject to any randomised controlled trial (RCT) of hypnotherapy compared to other interventions or standard care. Nevertheless, chronically ill palliative care patients have been included in a 2-year-long-term follow-up study of two groups. A group provided with standard pharmacological care and early integration of self-hypnosis was compared to a group receiving standard pharmacological care alone. This cohort of 50 participants, included patients with advanced cancer, neurological or rheumatic chronic progressive diseases. Pain decreased in both groups over the 2-year period, but this was statistically more significant in the hypnosis group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0001). Furthermore, the investigators observed a higher risk of increasing opioid use in the control group as well as greater anxiety than in the hypnosis group.<sup>

The main objective was to analyse the efficacy of hypnotherapy on post-radiotherapy pain compared to usual care.

Twelve of these trials also showed less opioid consumption or less desire for opioids as well as a delayed time for the first postoperative opioid dose in patients receiving hypnotherapy. The study population was undergoing non-oncological surgery or procedures (eight trials), dental surgery (four trials), had severe burn pain (five trials), were trauma victims (one trial) or had a cancer diagnosis (four trials).

</sup> It must be acknowledged, however, that there are no standardised methods to assess and report adverse events of hypnosis and very few trials even report such events. Patients may report some unusual sensations or feelings, experienced as part of the dissociation process during the trance. An experienced hypnotherapist uses such responses to direct the therapeutic process. Sometimes patients experience a prolonged sensation of lowered alertness after the session. A well-trained hypnotherapist can handle these reactions properly and provide a safe environment for the patient.<sup><xref rid="bibr52-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="bibr53-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p><p>Several trials have reported patient or health care professional&#x02019;s satisfaction during trials of hypnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr54-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="bibr55-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Both parties have reported experiencing an enhanced feeling of relaxation and calm especially regarding procedures or interventions.<sup>

Hypnosis enhances the patient&#x02019;s perception of control over pain and increases a sense of relaxation and well-being due to a decrease in perceived stress.<sup>

</sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section11-26323524251321852"><title>Discussion</title><p>Hypnotherapy is an approach that has been used for centuries, initially exclusively in psychiatry. In the last decades, it has gained interest in the fields of dentistry and anaesthesiology with a focus on pain control during surgical interventions. In the context of palliative care where symptom control is the main focus, hypnotherapy by also enhancing patient empowerment and self-control, is being offered more frequently to patients with an advanced cancer disease. However, many of the studies published in the literature are small and uncontrolled, with no standard outcome measures. The few RCTs published in the literature show not only a positive impact of hypnotherapy on the targeted symptom, but generally a positive impact on the overall well-being of the participants. An advantage of hypnotherapy is, that if practiced by a trained healthcare professional, it has a very favourable benefit-to-harm ratio and is, therefore, an excellent example of patient-centred therapy.</p><p>The main reason why research with hypnotherapy remains challenging is that every session is tailored to the patient&#x02019;s needs and expectations. The latter is especially important, since patients with a positive mindset to hypnosis or complementary approaches in general, experience better outcomes with these therapies.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> Therefore, standardised hypnotherapy sessions may be less effective.<sup><xref rid="bibr59-26323524251321852" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>

More methodologically sound studies with bigger sample sizes are needed. Perhaps in the future, hypnosis will be considered standard care for any patient in need of it. Because of the paucity of research in this area and the consequent lack of evidence of benefit in many areas, hypnosis can currently only be recommended for pain control in women with breast cancer undergoing surgical procedures and for secondary prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting in children. Although not formally studied in the palliative care population, hypnosis can have a favourable impact on psychological symptoms, especially anxiety, as well as chronic pain conditions, including the lower use of opioids.</p><p>
