As a result, treatment-related adverse effects have gained prominence [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thromboembolic events during cancer treatment, collectively termed cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT), include both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism. VTE, encompassing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is the second-leading cause of death in patients with malignancies [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cancer confers a fourfold higher risk of VTE, with cancer-associated VTE accounting for 30% of all VTE cases [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In patients with pancreatic cancer, thrombus formation is facilitated by the production of procoagulant substances, such as tissue factor, as well as by vascular stimulation secondary to peritumoral inflammation and tumor progression. Chemotherapy and other anticancer treatments further contribute to this prothrombotic milieu. Conversely, pancreatic tumors typically exhibit poor vascularization, and spontaneous bleeding is relatively uncommon. However, when the tumor invades adjacent structures, such as the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the duodenum, or surrounding vasculature, the risk of clinically significant hemorrhage increases. This risk is further exacerbated in the setting of chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression, which can lead to thrombocytopenia. Patients with cancer-associated venous thrombosis have a higher risk of recurrent thromboembolism and major bleeding during anticoagulant therapy when compared to those without malignancy. These risks are closely associated with the extent of cancer progression [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, careful assessment of these risks is essential to guide treatment strategies.</p><p>Clinical practice guidelines from the American Cancer Society (ACS), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommend low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and fondaparinux as first-line anticoagulant therapies for CAT. Among these, LMWH and DOACs are most commonly preferred as initial therapy. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is generally reserved for patients with severe renal impairment. Although LMWH is considered the standard of care globally, it is not approved for use in Japan, thereby limiting its availability. While recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that DOACs offer comparable efficacy to LMWH, their use in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies requires caution due to an increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, we chose UFH as an alternative to LMWH. Here, we report the case of a patient with pancreatic cancer and incidental VTE who was started on UFH in the acute phase but unfortunately developed hemorrhagic shock.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 74-year-old woman presented to the gastroenterology clinic with a chief complaint of loss of appetite and weight over two weeks.

Multiple low-density areas of suspected metastases were observed in the liver. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer based on the presence of distant metastases. Although the CT scan did not reveal any findings of active bleeding, a pseudoaneurysm arising from the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arcade, appearing to erode into the duodenum, was suspected. This anatomical configuration suggested a high risk of hemorrhage due to the direct exposure of the vessel within the gastrointestinal tract. Contrast shadow defects were incidentally detected in the lower lobe branches of both lungs (Fig. <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Bilateral femoral veins showed no shadow defects. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and no obvious ST-T changes or deep S waves at V5 and V6.

Hospitalization for anticoagulation therapy was recommended. Given the increased risk of bleeding owing to the exposure of blood vessels into the duodenum, UFH was selected for its ability to be closely monitored and promptly discontinued if necessary. The initial bolus dose of UFH was omitted, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated at a low dose of 4 units/kg/hour. Close monitoring and dose adjustment of anticoagulation therapy were implemented to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic complications. However, the patient suddenly vomited blood 50 minutes after the initiation of UFH. Her consciousness was clear, but her blood pressure dropped to 75/40 mmHg and the hemoglobin level decreased from 11.5 g/dL to 6.5 g/dL. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) measured simultaneously was 30.5 seconds. UFH was discontinued, and rapid fluid resuscitation was promptly administered, restoring her blood pressure to 104/71 mmHg. Since APTT was being monitored and remained unchanged at 30.0 seconds, and her blood pressure was stabilized, the patient did not receive protamine. The hematemesis indicated upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A contrast-enhanced CT was performed again to identify the source of bleeding. The patient had been fasting; therefore, the slightly dense areas noted, when compared to the other areas in the gastrointestinal tract, on contrast-enhanced CT, were unlikely to be food residues and were considered as gastrointestinal hemorrhage or blood clots. There was no obvious contrast leakage in the gastrointestinal tract or other areas (Fig. <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).&#x000a0;</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Contrast-enhanced CT and three-dimensional CT angiography immediately after hematemesis</title><p>The slightly high-density area when compared to the other areas in the gastrointestinal tract on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), immediately after hematemesis, is considered as gastrointestinal hemorrhage or blood clots.

These findings suggested the possibility of tumor collapse and subsequent exposure of blood vessels into the duodenum. No evidence of bleeding was found in other organs. Three-dimensional CT angiography revealed signs of vasospasm in the pancreatoduodenal arcade, including irregular vessel calibers and filling defects (Fig. <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). These findings were consistent with vasoconstriction, which typically occurs following bleeding. We believed that the pancreaticoduodenal arcade within the tumor had ruptured and hemorrhaged into the duodenum. The patient was transferred to another hospital for abdominal angiography and transcatheter arterial embolization of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade, as these procedures were unavailable at our facility. Therefore, transcatheter embolization was subsequently performed using microcoils to cut off blood flow to the gastroduodenal artery (Fig. <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed no active bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or from the duodenum to the inferior duodenal angulus, and hemostasis was considered successful. An extensive ulcer was noted on the papillary wall of the duodenum, with necrotic tissue present on the surface. The ulcer was considered to be tumor-related, and no exposed blood vessels were identified. A biopsy was not performed due to the tumor&#x02019;s fragility and the risk of further disintegration. Thereafter, a hemoglobin level of 8.0 mg/dL was maintained after transcatheter embolization, and no progression of anemia was observed. The treatment plan was re-evaluated through discussions among the patient, family members, and healthcare team. It was collectively decided to discontinue the plan involving anticancer drug therapy and transition to palliative care. Based on the EGD findings, the patient and family members were informed of the potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding from the same site due to tumor progression, as well as the possibility of recurrence or worsening of VTE. Considering these risks, the decision was made to not reinitiate anticoagulant therapy.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Angiography for pancreaticoduodenal arcade</title><p>No contrast leakage are noted on pancreaticoduodenal arcade angiography.

The incidence of VTE varies greatly according to cancer type, with pancreatic cancer having the highest incidence [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; 8.5% of patients with pancreatic cancer have VTE during cancer diagnosis [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hematogenous metastasis is high in cancer patients with VTE, as the coagulation capacity is enhanced by cancer cells [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our patient had multiple hematogenous liver metastases and had stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Anticoagulation therapy is the standard treatment for VTE for both symptomatic and incidental VTE, as they exhibit similar rates of recurrence and mortality [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Europe and the United States, LMWH is recommended as the standard treatment for cancer-associated VTE. However, in Japan, LMWH is not approved for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism, thereby limiting its clinical application. Although the use of LMWH was considered for this patient, the time available before administration was insufficient to thoroughly evaluate its appropriateness. DOACs are recommended for managing symptomatic or incidental VTE in cancer patients [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that DOAC administration is associated with a higher incidence of major bleeding compared to LMWH [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the Caravaggio Clinical Trials, apixaban was not inferior to LMWH in the treatment of cancer-related VTE and did not increase the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the trial was conducted in the USA, Israel, and European countries, and Asian participants were estimated to be underrepresented. Asian patients are known to be more prone to bleeding complications than patients of other ethnic groups [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Anticoagulation with UFH was selected in the present case due to the insufficient evidence supporting the safety of DOAC in Asian patients.</p><p>A bolus dose was intentionally omitted due to bleeding concerns, given imaging findings of tumor exposure from the pancreatic head into the duodenum. The initial dose of UFH was set at 4 units/kg/hour, with a plan to start at a low dose, monitor closely, and adjust gradually. Despite this precaution, a bleeding event occurred before the initial scheduled monitoring, rendering proper dose adjustment and monitoring impossible. UFH was immediately discontinued. Given that the bolus dose had been omitted, the infusion rate was low, and APTT was not prolonged, the bleeding was attributed to tumor-related changes rather than the anticoagulant effect of UFH; therefore, protamine was not administered. A contrast-enhanced CT was promptly repeated to identify the source of bleeding. Hematemesis, along with CT findings indicative of gastric hemorrhage, supported the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding. Furthermore, the presence of gastrointestinal air between the duodenum and tumor on CT indicated direct tumor exposure to the duodenal lumen. Three-dimensional CT angiography demonstrated signs of vasospasm in the pancreatoduodenal arcade, including irregular vessel calibers and filling defects, which are characteristic findings following hemorrhage. Based on the anatomical location and imaging findings, we concluded that the source of bleeding was the pancreatoduodenal arcade, likely due to tumor erosion into adjacent vasculature. We hypothesized that tumor invasion and associated pancreatic inflammation had weakened the outer membrane, leading to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm and subsequent bleeding into the duodenum from vulnerable areas of the vessel. Thus, we proceeded with abdominal angiography and transcatheter arterial embolization of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade. Subsequent EGD revealed no active bleeding but showed a tumor with ulceration exposed in the duodenum, along with necrotic tissue at the same site, suggesting fragility.&#x000a0;</p><p>Cancer-related VTE is associated with a high rate of major bleeding and VTE recurrence [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, both recurrence and bleeding are associated with cancer severity. Therefore, the risk of serious bleeding during anticoagulation therapy must be considered in patients with cancer and VTE. The intensity of anticoagulation therapy should be carefully monitored during the first few weeks of therapy, as this is a period associated with a particularly high risk of bleeding. Monitoring anticoagulation intensity during DOAC therapy is difficult, even though andexanet, a neutralizing agent, is available for factor Xa inhibitors. Thus, we used heparin, which can be monitored and promptly discontinued. Assessment scores, such as Registro Informatizado de Enfermedad TromboEmb&#x000f3;lica (RIETE) and VTE-BLEED, are used to assess bleeding risk in cancer patients with VTE.&#x000a0;The patient had an RIETE bleeding risk score of 2.5, with one point assigned for cancer and 1.5 points for anemia, indicating an intermediate risk, and an estimated incidence of serious bleeding of 2.8% [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. By contrast, the VTE-BLEED score was 5, calculated based on active cancer (two points), anemia (1.5 points), and age &#x0003e;60 years (1.5 points), categorizing the patient as high-risk, with a bleeding incidence rate of 12.6% [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both the RIETE and VTE-BLEED scores evaluate the bleeding risk during the course of anticoagulant therapy for VTE. Although the RIETE and VTE-BLEED scores share several common variables, the proportions of high-risk patients according to the RIETE and VTE-BLEED scores differ significantly (7.1% and 62.3%, respectively). In addition, both scores demonstrate a suboptimal predictive ability; their positive predictive values remain low, ranging from 0.6 to 3.9, reflecting the relatively low incidence of bleeding [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, both scores tend to better predict major extracranial rather than intracranial bleeding. However, it remains unclear whether these scores can predict gastrointestinal bleeding. In the present case, the patient had a high risk of hemorrhage due to tumor-related vascular invasion. Thus, we collaborated with a gastroenterologist to evaluate the tumor location and vascular invasion through imaging studies. Although accurately predicting bleeding events is challenging, we recommend incorporating individualized risk factors, such as imaging findings, into the assessment of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>VTE frequently accompanies pancreatic cancer diagnoses, often identified incidentally during imaging. Standard treatment involves anticoagulation therapy, recommended for both symptomatic and incidentally detected VTE. However, our case highlights the critical need to weigh the risk of major bleeding in patients with VTE exhibiting high bleeding risk due to tumor vascular invasion. Current bleeding risk scores, such as RIETE and VTE-BLEED, consider only the presence or absence of cancer and do not account for individualized imaging assessment parameters. Although the true risk of bleeding is difficult to predict, individualized treatment guided by patient-specific bleeding risk assessment is essential.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Dr. Yuuichi Majima and Dr. Makoto Iijima for performing abdominal angiography and transcatheter arterial embolization and for providing the angiography figures.
