The use of inactivated virus and DNA PD vaccines is common in marine salmonid aquaculture and has contributed to a reduction of the occurrence of disease; however, outbreaks are still frequent. <bold>Methods</bold><italic toggle="yes">:</italic> In this study, we compared the long-term protection after immunization of Atlantic salmon (<italic toggle="yes">Salmo salar</italic>) with three different clones of attenuated infectious SAV3. The clones were made by site-directed mutagenesis targeting the glycoprotein E2 to disrupt the viral attachment and/or nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the capsid protein to disrupt the viral suppression of cellular nuclear-cytosol trafficking.

The clones mutated in both capsid and E2 exhibited the most attenuation, observed as rapid clearing of the infection and showing little transmission, while the clone with glycoprotein E2 mutations displayed greater residual virulence but provided stronger protection, seen as reduced viral loads upon subsequent challenge with SAV3.

Introduction</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Salmonid alphavirus</italic> (SAV) is the etiological agent of pancreas disease (PD) in farmed Atlantic salmon (<italic toggle="yes">Salmo salar</italic>). The virus, also referred to as the Salmon pancreas disease virus (SPDV), is taxonomically placed in the <italic toggle="yes">Alphavirus</italic> genus within the <italic toggle="yes">Togaviridae</italic> family. The SAV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that expresses the four nonstructural genes nsP1&#x02013;4, while a subgenomic RNA expresses the five structural genes capsid, E3, E2, 6k and E1 [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Based on the nucleic acid sequences of the genes for glycoprotein E2 and nsP3 [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], SAV is grouped into six subtypes, SAV1-SAV6. In Norway, the subtypes SAV2 and SAV3 are prevalent [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The clinical signs of PD include inappetence, lethargy, reduced growth, and decreased meat quality [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SAV induces cellular necrosis and a subsequent inflammatory cellular response that results in necrosis and the loss of pancreatic tissue and inflammation in cardiac and skeletal muscles [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Vaccines against PD based on inactivated whole virus particles have been commercially available for many years, yet the number of PD outbreaks in Norway has remained relatively stable. The introduction of a DNA vaccine has been temporally correlated with a reduction of more than 50% in the number of outbreaks in recent years [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, still there are many PD outbreaks annually [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The alphavirion surface contains 80 glycoprotein spikes embedded in the viral membrane which mediate attachment to the host cell receptor and initiate fusion with viral and cellular membranes [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Each spike comprises of a trimer of a heterodimer of the glycoproteins E1&#x02013;E2. For the proper formation and surface expression of the E1&#x02013;E2 dimer, a low temperature, i.e., 10&#x02013;15 &#x000b0;C, is required [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Mutations in the glycosylation sites of alphavirus&#x02019; surface proteins E1 and E2 can potentially alter the virus&#x02019;s infectivity and virulence [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that mutating the predicted N-linked glycosylation site in E2 attenuates SAV3 replication in cell culture, while mutations in the glycosylation site in E1 inactivate the virus [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The E2 glycoprotein is responsible for receptor binding, and antibodies specific for SAV E2 may neutralize the virus [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Replication of the alphavirus genome occurs in replication spherules on organelle surfaces in in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, research has shown that alphavirus capsid proteins, including those of SAV, localize intermediately to the nucleus. The alphavirus capsid protein binds to both the host cell nuclear export CRM1 protein and the nuclear importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;1 protein through its N-terminal part [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This part of the capsid protein contains both a nucleus exporting signal (NES) and a nucleus localizing sequence (NLS). The capsid&#x02019;s ability to bind to both nuclear import and export receptors suppresses nuclear&#x02013;cytosol trafficking, consequently reducing the transcription of host genes in the nucleus and transport of cellular mRNA into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Attenuated strains of the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) containing mutations in this region do not inhibit cellular nuclear import [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, the capsid protein of alphaviruses plays multiple roles in the virus&#x02019; life cycle and disease pathogenesis, making it an attractive target for site-directed mutagenesis to achieve virus attenuation.</p><p>Live attenuated vaccines simulate natural infections and induce a strong and long-term immune response [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They have been successful in tackling viral diseases in mammals and have the advantage of inducing rapid, robust, long-term immunity after a single dose. Research has demonstrated that a live-attenuated vaccine candidate against the alphavirus Chikungunya virus effectively protects against Chikungunya disease after a single dose [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. SAV infection protects against reinfection with the virus [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is beneficial for the development of an attenuated live vaccine approach.</p><p>An ideal SAV vaccine would combine the antigenicity of the envelope glycoproteins with high safety, including reduced transmission potential to minimize environmental hazard. In this study, genetically modified live attenuated SAV3 vaccine candidates were constructed and injected in Atlantic salmon and the clinical effects, weight gain, genetic stability, and transmission abilities of the modified viruses were monitored together with their long-term ability to protect farmed Atlantic salmon against PD in an experimental challenge.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00190"><title>2.

Ethics Statement</title><p>The immunization and challenge experiment was conducted at the Aquaculture Research station, Troms&#x000f8;, Norway. The experimental protocol was approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Authority (NFDA) in accordance with the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU (FOTS ID 27026, 19 April 2021) and adhered to current animal welfare regulations, specifically FOR-1996-01-15-23 (Norway).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vaccines-13-00190"><title>2.2. Plasmid Constructs</title><p>A plasmid containing the complete SAV3 genome (prSAV3) served as the template for constructing mutated infectious strains. The prSAV3 was originally cloned from the wild-type SAV3 isolate H20/03 (GenBank acc. DQ149204). Site-directed mutagenesis of prSAV3 was performed using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), with primers listed in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00190-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The procedure to mutate the nuclear localization signal of the capsid protein (Cap<sub>NLS</sub> = Cap<sub>K79A/K81A</sub>) and the predicted N-linked glycosylation motif in the E2 protein (E2<sub>N319A</sub>) has been described previously [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The Clone 3 used in this study, which combined mutations of the NLS and E2 glycosylation signal (rSAV3-Cap<sub>NLS</sub>-E2<sub>N319A</sub>) was identical to a clone from the previous study [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, a SAV3 infectious clone with targeted modifications in E2, A8V, and T136M, known to cause full attenuation of SAV2, with the A8V amino acid change being responsible for almost 90% of the attenuation [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], was constructed. The three infectious clones that were used are listed in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00190-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, with the unmutated infectious strain, rSAV3, serving as a control.</p><p>Ultracompetent XL10-Gold (Agilent) cells were transformed with the mutated constructs. Plasmid isolation from bacterial colonies was carried out using the Nucleospin Plasmid Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany). Sanger sequencing was employed to confirm the desired mutations (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). Plasmid isolation and purification were performed using NucleoBond<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Xtra Maxi EF Kit (Macherey-Nagel).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-13-00190"><title>2.3.

In brief, 10^6.56 CHH-1 cells were transfected with 1 &#x000b5;g DNA of each construct using the Ingenio Electroporation Kit (Mirus, Madison, WI, USA) and the Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).</p><p>The cell culture medium containing virus was passaged four times on CHH-1 cells to eliminate plasmid traces. The presence of plasmid DNA was assessed by qPCR, omitting the RT step. Viral RNA was purified from supernatant samples from passages 1&#x02013;3 using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini QIAcube Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and cDNA synthesis was performed using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). qPCR was performed using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fischer Scientific) with SAV3 specific primers and probes QnsP1-17F: 5&#x02032;-CCGGCCCTGAACCAGTT-3&#x02032;, QnsP1-122R: 5&#x02032;-GTAGCCAAGTGGGAGAAAGCT-3&#x02032;, and QnsP1-53probe: 5&#x02032;-6FAM-CTGGCCACCACTTCGA-3&#x02032;-MGBNFQ-3&#x02032;. A cycle threshold of 37 was used as cut-off.</p><p>Virus supernatant from passage 4 was transferred to T175 flasks with CHH-1. Passage 5 supernatants were harvested 12 days post-inoculation, aliquoted, and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. One aliquot per virus strain was thawed and the infectious titer was quantified by tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID<sub>50</sub>) assay using CHH-1 cells and standard techniques as previously described [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-vaccines-13-00190"><title>2.4. In Vivo Experiments</title><p>The in vivo trial used non-vaccinated Atlantic salmon, approximately of 50 g size at onset, reared in the hatchery at the research station. The fish were confirmed free of the salmon pathogens ISAV, SAV, PRV, and IPNV by RT-qPCR. They were maintained in running freshwater at 10 &#x000b0;C in a 12:12 light cycle, fed with commercial dry feed, and fasted for 24 h prior to handling and sampling. Fish were randomly selected for immunization and 64 fish per clone were anesthetized by bath immersion in benzocaine chloride (0.5 g/10 L) for 2&#x02013;5 min, labelled (tattooed), and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the virus clones. Fish were kept in four separate tanks based on the clone (Clone1&#x02013;3, rSAV3) injected. The fish were anesthetized by bath immersion in benzocaine chloride before each handling and sampling event. In the field, exposure to SAV may occur at any point during the grow-out phase after sea transfer and to simulate this the fish were exposed to SAV first at week 20 post immunization.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-vaccines-13-00190"><title>2.5.

However, during the challenge experiment, no aberrant swimming movements or loss of appetite were observed in any of the groups. In the groups injected with the Clones 1&#x02013;3, the mortality rate was 0, 0, and 1 fish, respectively, a relative percent survival (RPS) of 98&#x02013;100%. In contrast, 13 out of 64 fish injected with the non-mutated rSAV3 died (RPS of 80), indicating its virulence.

The difference in weight between the rSAV3 and PBS group became particularly evident from 10 wpi (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00190-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B). The average weight and length at 26 wpi of the groups immunized with the mutated clones ranged from 316.6 to 380.7 g and 31.6&#x02013;32.7 cm, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between these groups. However, there was a significant difference (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in weight and length between each of the mutated groups and both the PBS and the rSAV3 groups at 26 wpi. This suggests that the mutated clones caused less growth reduction than the virulent rSAV3 clone, but more growth reduction than the non-infected control. For example, the relative difference in weight between the groups rSAV3 and Clone 1 at 26 wpi, i.e., 213 g and 380 g, was 78%.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-vaccines-13-00190"><title>3.4.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-vaccines-13-00190"><title>4.1. General</title><p>In this study, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to construct attenuated infectious cDNA clones of SAV3. The targeted mutations were introduced in the glycoprotein E2 and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the capsid protein. The rationale behind selecting these sites was that mutations in E2 could potentially interfere with the virus&#x02019;s ability to attach to host cells, while mutations in the NLS might disrupt the compartmentalization of the capsid protein, thereby impairing the viral counteraction against the host&#x02019;s antiviral response. The mutated viral clones were rescued from transfected cell cultures and subsequently injected into Atlantic salmon. This study assessed infection dynamics, genetic stability, viral shedding, and the clones&#x02019; potential to confer protection against a subsequent SAV3 challenge. The absence of clinical symptoms; reduced viral RNA loads in the fish; and diminished transmission capabilities all indicated that the mutated clones were attenuated.</p><p>An ideal live SAV vaccine should be optimized to retain immunogenicity while minimizing virulence, but still have a safety comparable to that of inactivated or subunit virus vaccines. However, achieving the appropriate level of attenuation in a live virus vaccine involves a trade-off. The virus must replicate sufficiently to induce robust innate and adaptive immune responses, which may lead to a strong and long-lasting immunity, but it should not retain replication virulence. Viral clones with low replication abilities might fail to elicit a robust immune response, whereas those with high replication capacities might exhibit residual virulence [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-vaccines-13-00190"><title>4.2. Mutations</title><p>Mutations that cause conformational changes in key epitopes of viral glycoproteins could compromise vaccine efficacy. Studies on alphaviruses have shown that the envelope glycoproteins of wild-type strains elicit the most effective protective immune responses [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, the development of a live attenuated SAV vaccine must balance not only in replication ability but also in antigenicity. Previous studies on SAV3 have shown that mutations in the glycosylation signal of the E1 glycoprotein eliminate the virus&#x02019;s replication capability in cell cultures [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this study, E1 was not mutated; however, the mutations introduced into E2 may have reduced the antigenicity of the attenuated clones compared to the wild-type virus.</p><p>Clone 1 contained the mutations A8V and T136M in glycoprotein E2, which fully attenuate SAV2 infection in rainbow trout, with the A8V mutation accounting for nearly 90% of the attenuation [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Clone 2 contained four mutations: A8V and N319A, the latter predicted to abolish an N-glycosylation site in E2 [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and two lysine residues in the NLS of the capsid protein were substituted with alanine residues (K79A and K81A). The NLS has been shown to determine the intracellular distribution of the capsid protein in the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and to interact with the nuclear pore complex, leading to transcriptional shutoff and cell death [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that mutations in SAV at N319A in E2 or K79A and K81A in the NLS do not significantly reduce virulence in vivo [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Clone 3 did not contain the A8V mutation but was otherwise identical to Clone 2.</p><p>To simulate field conditions, where exposure to SAV may occur at any point during the grow-out phase after sea transfer, and to assess whether immunization with the attenuated SAV clones provides long-term protection, the exposure to SAV in this study was set to 20 wpi. Prior to the challenge at 20 wpi, the fish immunized with the attenuated clones exhibited greater weight gain, lower viral RNA loads, and a reduced transmission capability to na&#x000ef;ve cohabitant fish compared to those inoculated with the rSAV3 clone.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-vaccines-13-00190"><title>4.3. Attenuation</title><p>Reduced weight gain and increased feed conversion ratio are well documented consequences of SAV infection [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study, these effects were evident as the control group injected with PBS had an average weight of 518 g at 26 weeks post-infection (wpi), while the non-mutated rSAV3 group averaged 213 g. This highlights the importance of maintaining SAV-free areas and using vaccination to reduce the impact of SAV in endemic regions. The weights of fish infected with the attenuated Clones 1&#x02013;3 ranged from 316 to 380 g, indicating attenuation compared to rSAV3, although significant growth reduction was observed compared to the PBS control group. This suggests that some residual virulence remained in the mutated clones, likely related to their impacts on pancreatic tissue. In a previous PD vaccination trial comparing the effects of a DNA vaccine with an inactivated vaccine, no significant reduction in weight gain was observed prior to challenge in any vaccinated group compared to the PBS control group [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The mutated Clones 1&#x02013;3 resulted in less growth reduction compared to the virulent rSAV3 clone, but more growth reduction compared to the non-infected control. These weight differences became statistically significant first at week 26, indicating that the pathological changes induced by the Clones 1&#x02013;3 were persistent. This highlights the need for further fine-tuning of virulence for potential vaccine candidate development.</p><p>The level of attenuation varied among Clones 1&#x02013;3 over the course of the infection. By 10 wpi, fish infected with Clone 2 had cleared the infection, as indicated by RT-qPCR at 10 and 20 wpi. Only one fish injected with Clone 3 tested virus positive at 10 wpi, and none at 20 wpi. On the other hand, the attenuated virus from Clone 1 was detected at all sampling points. Furthermore, Clone 1 showed more efficient transmission to na&#x000ef;ve cohabitants, as evidenced by the number of virus-positive fish in the cohabitant group at 3, 10, and 20 wpi. In contrast, no positive cohabitants were found for Clone 2 and only one positive cohabitant fish was found at 10 wpi for Clone 3. This suggests that Clone 2 did not infect cohabitants and Clone 3 only infected cohabitants at a very low level, possibly due to a lack of shedding or reduced virus uptake. Cohabitants were introduced to the tanks the day after immunization to capture potential early shedding and remained with the immunized fish throughout the study. Overall, these findings indicate that Clones 2 and 3 were more attenuated than Clone 1 regarding infection duration and transmission ability. However, this was not reflected in the weight gain, where Clone 1 had a higher average weight than Clones 2 and 3 at 26 wpi, although this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, no differences were observed in the histopathological lesion scores among Clones 1&#x02013;3 at the time of exposure, 20 wpi.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-vaccines-13-00190"><title>4.4. Genetic Stability of the Viral Clones</title><p>Viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes, such as alphaviruses, have high mutation rates, presenting challenges for the development of genetically stable live attenuated vaccines [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Multiple attenuating mutations are generally preferred in live vaccines to minimize the risk of reversion to a wild-type phenotype with regained replication fitness. Experience with live poliovirus vaccines suggests that strains containing several attenuating mutations are much less likely to revert to a wild-type phenotype [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, the mutated clones contained 2&#x02013;4 mutations, which remained stable when sequenced at 10, 20, or 26 wpi, including at least one passage, i.e., infection of cohabitant fish. However, in Clone 3, a mutation resulting in a glutamine-to-arginine substitution in the capsid gene occurred during the study, two bases upstream of the targeted mutations in the NLS. It is unclear whether this mutation was compensatory for the targeted NLS mutation or coincidental.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-vaccines-13-00190"><title>4.5. Shedding</title><p>Live attenuated vaccines must be thoroughly evaluated to minimize environmental risk such as the spread to wild populations. While vaccination can protect and reduce the shedding of wild-type viruses, uncontrolled shedding of vaccine strains could unintentionally infect non-target species. This is particularly concerning in open-cage salmon aquaculture settings, which allows extensive interactions with the surrounding environment. SAV has been isolated from non-salmonid marine fish species in proximity to aquaculture farms [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], raising safety concerns about the potential transfer of vaccine virus strains to other fish populations or the risk of reversion to a more virulent variant through genetic mutations. Therefore, the potential use of live attenuated vaccines in salmonid aquaculture necessitates risk assessments to ensure low shedding rates. However, the transmission of genetically stable attenuated vaccine strains to cohabitants and migrating wild salmon is not necessarily disadvantageous, as it could confer immunity. Clone 1 was found to shed and infect cohabitant fish, whereas Clone 2 did not, and Clone 3 only transmitted at very low levels. Although the exact timing of SAV shedding is unknown, it is likely to occur during periods of high viremia, early in infection. In a study where Atlantic salmon were injected intraperitoneally with the virus, detectable viremia lasted up to 14 days, with the disappearance of viremia correlating with the specific humoral immune response [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is noteworthy that no cohabitant fish tested positive in the Clone 2 group; thus, it did not infect cohabitants but nevertheless had virus load in serum (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00190-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Comparing the Cq values of serum samples with those of organ samples should be done cautiously due to plasma only contains viral genomic RNA in particles, while organ samples also contain viral mRNA and cRNA, and furthermore there are differences in the input for RT-qPCR. For serum samples, the input was based on volume, whereas for tissue samples, it was based on RNA weight. The amount of cDNA equivalent to 15 ng RNA was used per RT-qPCR reaction for organ samples, estimated to be equivalent to the RNA content of approximately 500&#x02013;1500 cells, assuming the average RNA amount in fish tissue cells is similar to that in mammalian cells, i.e., 0.010&#x02013;0.030 ng/cell [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The input per RT-qPCR reaction for serum samples was equivalent to 5 &#x000b5;L of serum. However, the amount of RNA in serum was below the threshold for measurement by spectrophotometric methods, which has a detection limit of approximately 2 ng/&#x000b5;L.</p><p>rSAV3, along with Clones 1 and 3, accumulated in serum early in the infection cycle. Clone 2 may also follow this pattern, as four out of eight fish at 1 wpi were positive for the virus exclusively in serum samples. It remains puzzling how viral presence can be detected in serum but not in organ tissues. This discrepancy may be due to viral replication in pancreatic tissue outside the sampled areas or in other non-sampled organs. The early accumulation of high viral titers in serum is a characteristic feature of alphaviruses and is considered advantageous for transmission via blood-feeding arthropods [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The detection of this trait in SAV suggests a similar transmission pathway could exist [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It could be speculated that the artificial environment of aquaculture, where high host density is prevalent, may have made such a transmission route redundant.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-vaccines-13-00190"><title>4.6. Protection</title><p>Upon injection of the mutated SAV clones into Atlantic salmon pre-smolts, all three clones successfully established infection and replicated within the fish. However, only Clone 1 and the positive control, rSAV3, resulted in all individuals at a given sampling point testing positive for the virus. Consequently, it remains unclear whether Clone 2 and Clone 3 were able to infect all the injected fish. Nonetheless, in situ hybridization revealed that Clone 3 induced an infection level in the heart comparable to rSAV3 at an early stage of infection (i.e., 3 wpi). Previous studies with Clone 3 demonstrated its presence in all injected fish at 2 and 4 wpi, using fish of the same genetic fish strain as in the present study [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of virus-positive fish in the virulent rSAV3 group decreased to five out of eight sampled fish at 20 wpi, suggesting that some individuals cleared the virus, at least to a level below the PCR detection limit.

Similarly, persistence of alphavirus infections has been observed in mammals, such as the long-term persistence of the alphavirus Sindbis virus in the central nervous system of mice [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Following the introduction of rSAV3 shedder fish at 20 wpi, the immunized fish were tested for viral presence at 26 wpi. Among the fish immunized with Clone 2 or Clone 3, two and five out of eight fish, respectively, tested positive for the virus. Sequencing confirmed that the detected virus was the rSAV3 strain used for the challenge at 20 wpi. The Cq values, ranging from the upper 20s to lower 30s, indicated a moderate viral load in these fish. These findings suggest that immunization with these clones did not fully protect against reinfection with the virulent virus.</p><p>The results for Clone 1 were more complex. Of the two fish from which viral sequences were obtained at 26 wpi, one contained the Clone 1-specific sequence, i.e., the clone used for immunization, while the other contained the sequence of the rSAV3 challenge virus. This demonstrated that some fish in the Clone 1 group could be infected with the challenge strain. However, the viral load in the Clone 1-immunized fish infected with rSAV3 was very low, as indicated by a Cq value of 34.2. The absence of detectable virus in five out of eight tested fish in the Clone 1 group at 26 wpi suggests an efficient immune response. This is further supported by the observation that both the Clone 1 and rSAV3 groups showed a decrease in the number of virus-positive fish from 20 to 26 wpi, indicating that the challenge did not increase the number of infected fish. In contrast, for both Clone 2 and 3 groups, there was an increase in the number of virus-positive fish after the challenge, and sequencing confirmed that this was due to infection with the challenge strain.</p><p>In a previous PD vaccine study using an inactivated and DNA vaccine with a cohabitation challenge model, all vaccinated fish tested positive for viremia [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00190" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This suggests that the live-attenuated vaccines in the present study provided better protection against SAV infection than inactivated or DNA vaccines. However, the risk of low-level shedding and exposure of wild fauna to a mutated live vaccine must be weighed against the risk posed by shedding of wild-type virus from a population vaccinated with a traditional vaccine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00190"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The introduced mutations in SAV3 were found to be stable in vivo throughout the experiment, although the genetic stability of the virus was not evaluated over an extended period or across multiple generations of fish. Clone 2 and Clone 3 were the most attenuated but provided less protection to SAV3 infection after challenge, compared to Clone 1. Despite their attenuation, all viral clones caused significant reductions in weight gain as a side effect. If the primary goal of vaccination is to reduce the prevalence of SAV3, these live, attenuated viral clones might be functional. However, if the goal is dual, i.e., reducing SAV3 prevalence while also enhancing productivity, further development of attenuated clones that do not cause weight reduction but still elicit a strong immune response is necessary. Additional studies and safety evaluations are required before deploying attenuated live vaccines for SAV in the field. Live, attenuated virus vaccines could potentially be used in Atlantic salmon aquaculture, but this will necessitate careful optimization of virulence and shedding, along with ensuring satisfactory genetic stability of the mutants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Ingvild B Nyman at NMBU for technical assistance with the ISH and sampling assistance and Ingrid Mo at NMBU and Eva-Stina Edholm at UiT, Arctic University of Norway for sampling assistance.
