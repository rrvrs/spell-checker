She was running away from home repeatedly and under the risk of sexual abuse. After comprehensive clinical and psychopathological assessment, a decision was made to initiate treatment with clozapine, closely monitoring the patient for adverse effects, and assessing its impact on the patient&#x02019;s aggressiveness and other behavioral problems. During her stay, clozapine dose titrated to 250 mg/day in addition to her current treatment as amisulpiride 800 mg/day and valproic acid 500 mg/day. Atropine solution as mouthwash used for salivary hipersecretion. No other side effects observed. Cognitive and behavioural therapy interventions made for anger management and impulsivity. Also focused on family-based interventions about establishing healthy boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="sec4741"><title>Results</title><p>A significant reduction in aggressive behavior was noted under the treatment of clozapine. The patient&#x02019;s overall conduct and interaction with family improved remarkably.

This case highlights the potential of clozapine as a viable treatment option for managing severe, treatment-resistant behavioral problems in patients with conduct disorder, even in the absence of psychosis. A randomized-controlled trial showed that clozapine was more effective than risperidone in conduct externalization factors, delinquency trait and global functioning in children and adolescents(Ju&#x000e1;rez-Trevi&#x000f1;o <italic toggle="yes">et al. Clin Psychopharmacol Neurosci</italic>. 2019;17(1):43-53). While it necessitates careful monitoring due to its side-effect profile, this unconventional use of clozapine may open up new avenues for the management of treatment-resistant conduct disorder, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Further controlled studies are warranted to ascertain the safety and efficacy of this approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec4743"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
