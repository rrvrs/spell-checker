</self-uri><abstract><p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) can negatively impact relationships which may affect health and disease management. This can be moderated by positive communication between partners. Our aims were first, to identify ways in which couples&#x02019; communication and T2D impact each other. Second, we aimed to explore how improving couples&#x02019; communication may enhance self-management for people living with T2D (PLWD) and their partners in South Africa. We conducted secondary data analysis of qualitative interview and focus group data from an intervention pilot study designed to improve T2D self-management &#x02013; &#x02018;Diabetes Together&#x02019;. 14 PLWD and their partners took part in two diabetes self-management workshops, including communication skills training, and were offered two couples counselling sessions. Inductive thematic and dyadic analysis explored how T2D and couples&#x02019; communication were connected, and how participants perceived the impact of couples&#x02019; communication skills training. Findings were compared to data collected from qualitative interviews with intervention-naive participants. We generated four themes linking couples&#x02019; communication and T2D: tone of discussions; listening; openness; and being informed about T2D. Participants described that T2D can create negative moods and stress (both from the disease and its management) and this can make communication challenging. They reported that negative communication styles can create stress worsening T2D and making it harder to manage. Participants felt that positive communication could ease stress, enable problem-solving and support behaviour change, which may improve T2D management. Couples reported that communication skills training helped them to address communication-related issues in their relationships. This included managing negative moods, changing communication styles and developing skills to discuss, listen and collaborate on improving T2D self-management. PLWD and their partners perceived that T2D and couples&#x02019; communication can affect one another positively and negatively. Equipping couples with effective communication skills may empower them to manage T2D more effectively.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Introduction</title><p>While diseases occur in individuals, the impacts and an individual&#x02019;s approach to disease management are inextricably linked to their social and interpersonal context.</p><p>As a chronic and complex condition, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) can negatively impact relationships which then affect health and disease management [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a systematic review of 29 studies exploring the links between familial relationships and diabetes management, marriage quality was found to affect how people living with diabetes (PLWD) felt and behaved in managing their diabetes, both positively and negatively [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Those experiencing high marital stress showed worse blood glucose control. PLWD experienced nagging, arguing, critical comments and overprotective approaches by the partner as unsupportive. Unresolved conflicts between partners were linked with poor management of diabetes. On the other hand, PLWD who experienced higher marital satisfaction had higher diabetes-related satisfaction and felt diabetes had fewer negative impacts on their daily lives [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Open and supportive communication between partners can facilitate a collaborative approach to managing chronic disease. &#x0201c;Communal coping&#x0201d;, a model of dyadic coping, can reduce disease-associated distress and improve outcomes [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In an umbrella review of how families, including intimate partners, influence T2D self-management, emotional support was identified alongside practical support in facilitating better outcomes [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Emotional support included understanding each other&#x02019;s feelings, openly communicating needs and being motivated for lifestyle changes together. In a longitudinal study of couples from the USA where one partner was experiencing a chronic condition, researchers explored how the degree of open communication and dyadic coping was connected to the relational wellbeing of the couple [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. When couples saw the condition as a shared problem they could manage together, they discussed it more often. They used more dyadic coping strategies, which led to more satisfaction with their relationship, greater emotional closeness and higher sexual satisfaction [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Other research highlights the need to ensure discussions are explicit. Being clear about what the problems are, how each partner feels about them, and what solutions are desirable or preferable for each, is important to enable effective communal coping [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Couples&#x02019; communication and T2D affect one another but these effects may vary according to gender and cultural background. Research in the USA found that preferences of language used to describe diabetes self-management varied between partners and PLWD, and between male and female PLWD [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>There is limited research on the topic of couples&#x02019; communication and T2D from low- and middle-income country settings. Notably, over half of the 29 studies in a systematic review of familial relationships and diabetes management were based in the USA with only 2 from middle- or low-income countries (Botswana and China) [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>We recently piloted a prototype couples-focused intervention designed to improve self-management of T2D in Cape Town, South Africa.

It was designed to help couples discuss diabetes together, communicate clearly with each other and come to a shared understanding of diabetes self-management. This module included an audio-recorded role-play, an interactive role-play for volunteer participants, a brief presentation and facilitated whole group discussion.</p><p>A core component of the communication skills module, the describe repeat method, was inspired by the speaker-listener technique [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] previously delivered in HIV-focused couples&#x02019; studies [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It helps couples talk about things that matter to either one of them and which they might find difficult to raise because they are upset, annoyed or worried about how the other person might respond. The technique was illustrated with pre-recorded exchanges between partners, one of which deteriorated into an argument. The second recording acted out the describe repeat method.

Supporting information was provided in the handouts (<xref rid="pgph.0004089.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) with couples invited to practice the technique as part of their homework between workshops.

B then repeats back what they have heard in their own words. This gives an opportunity to verify what has been said and provides a pause before B responds to the content. A can then confirm B&#x02019;s understanding or explain further if there has been a misunderstanding. Once B has fully understood the issue, they then take on the primary speaking role and describe their response to the issue. A then has an opportunity to repeat back to B what they have heard, and the process continues until both partners feel they have been adequately heard.</p><p>A subset of couples were invited to two couples&#x02019; counselling sessions after the second workshop. These aimed to build on the workshops facilitating communication and problem-solving by supporting the couples to practise the describe repeat method, to identify what they most wanted to change in diabetes self-management and to set a goal to achieve this.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>2.5 Sampling and recruitment</title><p>Sampling and recruitment are described elsewhere [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but in brief, PLWD were approached at primary care diabetes clinics or contacted proactively following previous involvement in diabetes management studies with the Chronic Diseases Initiative for Africa (CDIA). Convenience sampling was used to ensure a minimum number of couples were available and in recognition of the challenges of recruitment during COVID.</p><p>Eligible PLWD were aged over 18, in a relationship for at least 6 months and received care at public healthcare clinics. Eligible partners self-reported that they did not have diabetes. All participants completed an informed consent process prior to participation. Recruitment took place between 10-01-2022 and 11-02-2022.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>2.6 Data collection</title><p>Data were collected using interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted during and after pilot delivery of the prototype intervention [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Participants were interviewed or attended FGDs after each of the two workshops, and for couples undergoing counselling, attended individual interviews after the final counselling session. Interviews were undertaken with individual participants. FGDs involved 3 or 4 couples at a time.</p><p>Both interviews and FGDs were semi-structured using topic guides designed to capture participants&#x02019; feedback on the intervention. Topic guides included questions about the communication skills module and aspects of couples&#x02019; communication were also elicited through discussion and response to more general questions about how people were managing diabetes.</p><p>All interviews and FGDs were recorded and transcribed. Interpreters were present for all FGDs. Participants were given the option to conduct interviews in English or to have an interpreter (isiXhosa) present. In general, interviews and FGDs were conducted in English. At times participants responded in Afrikaans or isiXhosa and non-English language statements were translated at the time of transcription by BM and the couples&#x02019; counsellor, MO. BM and MO provided quality control for each other&#x02019;s translations.</p><p>As previously described elsewhere, 14 couples attended the first workshop [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] on 12<sup>th</sup> February 2022. Of these, 12 completed the second workshop on 26<sup>th</sup> February 2022 and 12 contributed to at least one interview or focus group after one or both workshops. Two couples completed two couples counselling sessions (a median of 25.5 and 132.5 days after the second workshop, respectively) and a post-counselling interview (within a median of 28 days of the second counselling session). All participants were Black African (N=24) or Coloured (N=4) (see <xref rid="pgph.0004089.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pgph.0004089.t002"><object-id

Together&#x02019;, a couples-focused intervention to support self-management of Type 2 Diabetes in South Africa. Glob Public Health. 2024;19(1):2386979.</p><p>Two post-doctoral researchers, one from the UK and one from SA, conducted the interviews. Both were involved in the Diabetes Together study since 2021 and are experienced in conducting individual interviews and facilitating FGDs.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>2.7 Data analysis</title><p>LL led analysis of the pilot data for this paper. Using Braun and Clarke&#x02019;s 6 stages to guide thematic analysis [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], she read all interviews and FGD transcripts numerous times to become familiar with the data. She extracted all communication-related sections of text and applied inductive codes describing what the participants were saying. Once all pilot data had been coded, LL collated common topics and experiences into broader inductive themes. She analysed differences between subgroups, by diabetes status (PLWD; partners) and by gender (men; women).</p><p>Previous research inspired the approach to dyadic analysis [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consideration of overlaps and contrasts in partners&#x02019; reports uncovered themes about the nature of couples&#x02019; relationships that would otherwise have remained invisible. The scope of dyadic analysis was limited because individual (and therefore couple) identifiers were not noted during FGD recordings. Comparison of within-couple comments was therefore only possible with data from the subset of couples who participated in post-workshop or post-counselling individual interviews. Where quotes from both partners in a couple were available for a specific code, these were compared and overlaps and contrasts between partners were noted. Communication codes described repeatedly or with emphatic statements by one partner but not mentioned by the other were also noted.</p><p>The international, multidisciplinary research team regularly discussed emerging themes, facilitating continuous reflexivity in the study. This ensured the interpretative analysis accurately reflected the contents of the data. Researchers from the University of Cape Town gave in-depth context when needed. This included exploring colloquial phrases, cultural reference points and the wider social context of the enrolled participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>2.8 Data from intervention naive participants</title><p>During analysis of post-intervention data we noted that participants sometimes echoed language or messages from the communication skills module of the intervention. We did not have pre-intervention data from these participants. However, we had previously collected qualitative data about barriers and facilitators to T2D self-management from 10 couples in the same setting, recruited with the same eligibility criteria.</p><p>Interviews with intervention-naive participants explored their perceptions and experiences of living with T2D. They included questions about communication such as &#x0201c;Do you ever speak [to your partner] about your fears of having diabetes?&#x0201d; as well as exploring communication through discussion. Interviews were conducted in isiXhosa or English, recorded, translated where applicable and transcribed into English. Data from these intervention-naive participant interviews have previously been used in a secondary data analysis exploring the impact of diabetes on sexual relationships among couples, which highlighted that this topic was &#x02018;off limits&#x02019; for discussion by many couples (6).</p><p>In the current study, we returned to the transcripts of intervention-na&#x000ef;ve couples to explore if and how they talked about links between couples&#x02019; communication and T2D.</p><p>Two research assistants (RAs), with previous experience of conducting qualitative interviews and coding qualitative data, independently reviewed each pair of transcripts from intervention-na&#x000ef;ve couples. They extracted communication-related quotes and noted concordance for each couple. The RAs discussed any differences between their data extraction and presented a final combined dataset to MvP and NMcG for discussion.

Discussion</title><p>This qualitative study explored the views of couples living with T2D in low-income peri-urban communities in South Africa on how communication and T2D are linked, and how couples-communication skills training affects T2D self-management. Our findings indicate couples&#x02019; communication and T2D affect each other positively and negatively through tone, listening, openness, and being informed about T2D. Participants reported that improving their communication helped them to feel more understood, improved their ability to manage conflict and enabled more collaboration between PLWD and their partners in managing T2D. The findings also point to a learning curve suggesting couples develop their skills over time and that, with additional opportunities to learn, changes could be sustained. This study highlights the importance of couples&#x02019; communication in T2D self-management and the potential value of communication skills training to enhance dyadic coping within a low-or-middle-income country setting.</p><p>Reflecting on our thematic analysis, our findings can be summarised as four links between couples&#x02019; communication and T2D, which are consistent with existing literature about diabetes and chronic conditions more generally.</p><p>First, participants reported that poorly managed T2D can have a negative impact on communication between partners. Feeling irritable or tired due to disordered blood sugar and the stress of managing T2D, can create low moods in PLWD making it harder to talk calmly or share openly. This can leave partners feeling frustrated and unhappy. There is evidence of a relationship between diabetes and psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety that could make it difficult for PLWD to communicate easily and positively with those around them [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is also consistent with work in the general population showing that higher sugar consumption over years is associated with common mental disorders [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These are likely to affect communication skills and style, particularly with spousal-type partners [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Second, negative communication styles were reported to negatively affect T2D management. This includes having a negative or aggressive tone, failing to listen and understand the other&#x02019;s point of view, or refusing to share or discuss issues. Such negative approaches could raise stress levels or make it harder for PLWD to manage their condition and for partners to support them. Similar issues were identified in a broad review of how family interactions could impact the management of chronic conditions, including diabetes [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A range of studies showed that negative patient outcomes were associated with critical, overprotective and controlling communication styles.</p><p>Thirdly, participants felt that positive communication enhances T2D management. Having open and calm discussions and listening carefully to the other&#x02019;s point of view can lead to a common understanding of issues, sharing of the burden and joint problem-solving. This was also found by the review of chronic conditions, showing better outcomes for patients were associated with supportive family interactions [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Positive communication may facilitate shared appraisal of the challenges an individual living with a chronic illness faces, enabling partners to collaborate more effectively to facilitate self-management including improving treatment adherence [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Finally, couples reported that communication skills training may improve communication styles and their management of T2D. The intervention provided communication skills training alongside efforts to increase knowledge about T2D and how it can be managed. Couples reported their workshop experiences led to more effective dyadic coping with the condition. This is in line with the optimised logic model for Diabetes Together [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which incorporated part of a review of couples-based interventions for managing chronic physical illnesses [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The review recommended combining skills-based and relationship-focused training as both aspects were found to be effective in improving different outcomes.</p><p>There were some differences in how groups of participants described the links between T2D and communication within their relationships. Consistent with studies in the US, we found differences in language and preferences between genders of PLWD and their partners [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We also saw some differences in communication between the genders irrespective of condition status. For example, gender affected the tone of discussions or the degree to which partners felt listened to: men were more often reported by themselves and their partners to be loud or domineering and this could be a barrier to calm discussions with both partners listening to each other. For diabetes status, PLWD were sometimes reported to struggle with being open about how their disease was affecting them or their fears about diabetes, while partners more often reported wanting and needing their partner to be more open. While lack of knowledge affected PLWD by creating fears and sadness, partners without a grounding of knowledge about how to manage diabetes were unable to offer effective support.</p><p>This study highlights the importance of communication in enabling couples living with T2D to effectively manage the condition. Communication skills training alongside education about the condition for both partners may be a valuable part of T2D self-management support.</p><p>In addition to the workshops, this intervention includes couples&#x02019; counselling. These sessions were intended to build on the workshops by supporting couples to identify behaviours they would like to change and use a goal-setting approach. This involved capitalising on the new knowledge and understanding gained from the workshops, including from the greater awareness of relational aspects of diabetes management. The workshops raised issues that participants may not have previously thought about. For example, understanding how traditional gender roles might need to change following one partner&#x02019;s diagnosis, or building confidence to talk about the impact of T2D on sexual relationships by hearing others describe their experiences. Counsellors could facilitate greater openness between partners enabling each to understand the other&#x02019;s perspective, including by managing imbalance between partners in time and propensity to talk. By bringing about a shared appraisal of the issues the couple faces, the counselling sessions could facilitate practice of joint problem-solving.</p><p>Limitations of this study included limited information power [<xref rid="pgph.0004089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As this was a secondary data analysis, we were unable to ask follow-up questions specifically in relation to communication issues that arose, which limited the depth of data collected on the topic of communication. Secondly, interviews conducted after the intervention showed participants sometimes rehearsed messages from the workshops, potentially indicating participants were saying what they thought researchers wanted to hear. Incorporating analysis of interviews with intervention-naive couples enabled us to address this limitation and corroborate our findings. Thirdly, only two couples completed both couples&#x02019; counselling sessions offered and an interview afterwards due in part to resource constraints during the COVID pandemic. Data from these interviews contributed few direct quotes about communication. Finally, the lack of participant identifiers within the FGDs prevented more extensive dyadic analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study contributes to the long-standing field of research around the role of couples in managing chronic conditions by emphasising the importance of couples&#x02019; communication in self-management. We provide insights into a new community: couples from low-income settings in South Africa who are living with diabetes. Our results show the different ways communication and T2D are linked and can impact one another both positively and negatively. We found that a couples-based intervention designed to improve T2D self-management may facilitate improved dyadic coping by strengthening couples&#x02019; communication skills. Future trials to evaluate this intervention should include quantitative measures of relationship-quality and diabetes-related health outcomes to assess whether self-management improves as a function of strengthened dyadic coping.</p></sec><sec id="sec027" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0004089.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><p>Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR)*.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0004089.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0004089.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><p>Inclusivity in global research.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0004089.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0004089.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><p>Quotes from intervention-na&#x000ef;ve participants.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0004089.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0004089.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Appendix</label><caption><p>Quotes from intervention-na&#x000ef;ve participants.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0004089.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thank you to all participants in this research study.
