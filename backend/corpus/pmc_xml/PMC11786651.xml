Differentiated instruction is where teachers modify their lessons to accommodate each child's unique needs, including prior knowledge and skills, interests, and classroom behavior [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To proactively adjust their lessons, teachers should consistently monitor and assess their students' needs, making deliberate decisions based on these evaluations during lesson planning and implementation [<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Differentiated instruction is often defined as an adaptive and proactive educational approach (Prast, E. J et al.) . According to Jager, implementing adaptivity and proactivity necessitates multiple perspectives: understanding teachers' thought processes during lesson planning is essential to identify proactivity, and gathering information on students' experiences and changes in academic performance is crucial to determine if the adjustments effectively address students' needs [<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Tomlinson [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] suggested that teachers can modify various aspects of a lesson to cater to students' needs. When adjusting the process, teachers offer varied learning activities or instructions, which involves tailoring the level of guidance during inquiry and design tasks to suit students' needs [<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The proactive nature of differentiated instruction necessitates that teachers make numerous intentional decisions about their teaching [<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] outlined a differentiation skills hierarchy and identified the chronological sequence of these decisions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>Method details</title><sec id="sec0005"><title>Literature review</title><p id="para0014">The differentiation method in education is grounded in the understanding of students' diverse cognitive abilities and prior knowledge, requiring tailored instructional strategies that create supportive learning environments and accommodate individual needs, inspired by Vygotsky's theory and brain-based learning principles, with evidence from foreign language education research supporting its effectiveness. [<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The differentiation approach in education plays a crucial role in enhancing student motivation. By recognizing and catering to individual differences in students' readiness, interests, and learning profiles, differentiation promotes a sense of relevance and engagement in the learning process. When students see that their individual needs and preferences are recognized through differentiated instruction, they are more likely to feel valued and motivated, especially when given choices that align with their interests and strengths, fostering a sense of ownership and enhancing intrinsic motivation [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="para0015">In studying motivation, it is crucial to focus on students' needs, as understanding these needs helps shape the direction of their learning and mental state, driving activity, forming motives, and enabling goal-setting, which teachers can foster by adapting lessons to meet students' needs and setting collaborative goals to enhance the effectiveness of the educational process [<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The differentiation approach in education can be closely connected with the theory of multiple intelligences proposed by Howard Gardner. Gardner's theory suggests that intelligence is not a singular, fixed entity but a combination of different types of intelligence, including linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligence. Each individual possesses a unique blend of these intelligences, with varying strengths and preferences [<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When implementing the differentiation approach, educators recognize and value this diversity of intelligence among their students. They design instruction and learning experiences that cater to different types of intelligence, allowing students to engage with content in ways that align with their strengths and interests. For example, a teacher might provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding of a concept through various modalities: <italic>Linguistic learners</italic> prefer writing essays or giving oral presentations. <italic>Visual-spatial learners</italic> might benefit from creating diagrams, charts, or drawings. <italic>Kinesthetic learners</italic> might excel in hands-on activities or experiments. <italic>Musical learners</italic> enjoy composing songs or rhythms related to the topic.</p><p id="para0016">By integrating multiple intelligences into the differentiation approach, educators create a more inclusive and engaging learning environment where students can thrive based on their unique talents and abilities. This approach honors the diversity of learners and fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject matter [<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The theory of multiple intelligences is a vital tool for educators across various disciplines. It allows them to transform the teaching-learning process and actively engage students through appropriate activities often missing in traditional school settings. The diversity among learners and high expectations for their learning makes teaching incredibly challenging. Addressing individual differences remains a significant challenge in education today, but it is also a crucial strategy for resolving many educational discrepancies. Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences has numerous implications for teachers, some of which are beyond their control.</p><p id="para0017">Gardner's theory posits that autonomous powers and capabilities shape each person's intelligence level and that every child has potential intelligence in one or more areas. According to Gardner, intelligence is not limited to two regions but includes success in music, sports, art, self-awareness, and evaluation. He views intelligence as the ability to solve problems and achieve results within cultural contexts. Understanding the multiple intelligence profiles of secondary school students enables teachers to better know their students and understand their similarities and differences. Teachers should consider students' dominant intelligence areas when planning education and educational environments, encouraging proactive participation. Utilizing students' strengths positively impacts other areas. Research indicates that students' interests and intelligence areas vary by gender, and these natural differences must be considered. Addressing socio-economic diversity can prevent potential inequalities. Assigning tasks aligned with students' skills contributes to their personal development. Being the best judges of their abilities and differences, students should have their self-assessment results included in their personal development records [<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="para0018">According to Russell Jay Hendel, differentiated instruction (DI) boosts students' academic performance and satisfaction with learning, especially when teachers receive proper training beforehand. However, the vast amount of DI literature can overwhelm many educators, making it difficult for them to implement DI effectively for students with different learning styles. He proposes a transdisciplinary approach to bridge the gap between theory and the challenging practical application of DI. 1) Drawing from architecture, the concept of universal design is introduced, advocating for buildings to be initially constructed to accommodate everyone rather than trying to make adjustments after construction, which can be expensive and inefficient. 2) Neuroscience suggests that higher cognitive brain functions, like executive function, can be effectively addressed through a multi-modal approach, emphasizing the need for inclusive teaching methods that cater to various learning preferences. 3) Industrial psychology highlights the importance of goal-setting and breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, promoting clear, achievable, and challenging objectives. 4) Combining goal-setting with the concept of self-efficacy from social psychology, utilizing software technology with differentiated difficulty levels is advocated, enabling students to assess and improve their learning through self-regulation. This transdisciplinary approach proposes several innovative strategies for DI, which it hopes other educators and researchers will explore further [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Drawing from the concept of universal design means creating learning environments and educational materials that are accessible and inclusive for all students, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds. This approach recognizes that students have diverse needs, learning styles, and abilities and aims to design educational experiences that cater to this diversity from the outset. For example, in the design of classrooms, universal design principles might involve: Ensuring classrooms are spacious and well-lit to accommodate students with mobility issues or visual impairments. We provide flexible seating arrangements for different learning preferences and physical needs. They are incorporating technology and multimedia resources that students with various learning styles and abilities can access. They offer materials in multiple formats (e.g., digital, audio, tactile) to accommodate different learning needs and preferences. Implementing inclusive teaching strategies that engage all students and provide opportunities for active participation.</p><p id="para0019">By applying universal design principles in education, schools can create inclusive learning environments that benefit all students, regardless of their differences. This proactive approach avoids the need for costly and time-consuming adjustments or accommodations later on, leading to more efficient and effective educational experiences for everyone.</p><p id="para0020">In education, insights from neuropsychology highlight the importance of considering higher cognitive brain functions, such as executive function, in designing instructional strategies. Executive function encompasses skills like planning, organization, and self-regulation, which are crucial for academic success.</p><p id="para0021">A multimodal approach to teaching acknowledges that students have diverse learning preferences and strengths. Therefore, instruction should encompass various modalities, such as visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile. This approach recognizes that different students learn best through different sensory channels and emphasizes the need for inclusive teaching methods that cater to these diverse learning preferences. For example, in a classroom using a multi-modal approach: Visual learners benefit from diagrams, charts, and graphic organizers. Auditory learners might excel with lectures, discussions, and audio recordings. Kinesthetic learners might thrive with hands-on activities, experiments, and role-playing exercises. Tactile learners might engage more effectively with tactile materials, manipulatives, and learning aids.</p><p id="para0022">Educators can create inclusive learning environments that engage students of all learning preferences and abilities by incorporating a multi-modal approach into teaching practices. This approach promotes a more profound understanding, retention, and application of knowledge, ultimately leading to improved student academic outcomes. In education, integrating goal-setting with the concept of self-efficacy from social psychology emphasizes empowering students to control their learning processes. Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to succeed in specific tasks or situations. By combining goal-setting with self-efficacy, educators aim to enhance students' confidence in their skills and motivate them to pursue their learning goals. One way to implement this approach is by using software technology that offers differentiated difficulty levels. This means providing students with learning tasks or activities that vary in complexity and challenge, allowing them to select the level that matches their current skill level and learning pace. For example, a math software program might offer practice exercises ranging from essential addition for beginners to advanced algebra for more advanced students. Students can choose the level of difficulty that suits them best based on their confidence and proficiency in the subject. Educators promote self-regulation and autonomy in learning by providing students with choices and opportunities to assess their own learning progress. Students learn to set goals, monitor their performance, and adjust their strategies accordingly, leading to increased motivation, engagement, and academic success [<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="para0023">The effectiveness of teaching science can be negatively impacted by several issues that creative pedagogies can resolve [<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Students better comprehend the ideas in the frequently abstract natural scientific textbooks by using interactive technologies, straightforward experiments, or visualizations as part of creative pedagogies [<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Students can engage with natural science subjects meaningfully by incorporating artistic components into science instruction [<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A learning strategy known as &#x0201c;creative pedagogy&#x0201d; strongly emphasizes adopting methods and techniques to encourage students' creativity during the educational process. The three components of creative pedagogy&#x02014;creative teaching, teaching for creativity, and creative learning&#x02014;are taken from the study findings of Lin [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The method a teacher uses to present educational materials that have enhanced and sparked students' imaginations is referred to as creative teaching. Teaching for creativity has brought attention to how important it is for teachers to support their students' creative growth by using methods that foster critical, analytical, and creative thinking. In the meantime, creative learning has focused on creating a setting in the classroom where students can explore new concepts and come up with creative solutions [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While there is much promise for students and teachers to improve learning effectiveness through creative pedagogy, some researchers have noted that its implementation has been fraught with difficulties, including shifting learning standards to a more flexible and creative approach. However, these difficulties have been surmounted with the correct assistance and cooperative efforts from curriculum developers, educational institutions, and teachers [<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="para0024">The pedagogical foundations of the differentiation approach in education stem from the belief that every student has unique learning needs, interests, and abilities. This approach acknowledges that a one-size-fits-all teaching method is ineffective for reaching all students and maximizing their learning potential. Instead, differentiation aims to tailor instruction to meet the diverse needs of learners within a classroom.</p><p id="para0025">Here are some vital pedagogical foundations of the differentiation approach:</p><p id="para0026">

</p><p id="para0032">By embracing these pedagogical foundations, educators can create more inclusive, engaging, and effective learning environments that support the success of all students.</p><p id="para0033">Teaching and learning are vital educational processes that prepare young individuals for the greater good of society. This greater good is determined not solely by the needs of the youth, but by the collective needs of humanity. It necessitates that all young people, regardless of their individual abilities, disabilities, race, language, or religion, have access to the highest quality educational opportunities available in their time. To achieve this goal, all forms of differentiation must be employed to ensure that every student receives optimal educational opportunities. Differentiation in teaching is a methodological framework designed to cater to individual learning needs and optimize students' academic experiences, potentially resulting in positive learning outcomes. Once instruction and curriculum are differentiated, various forms of assessment can be developed to accommodate the diverse needs of students. Given that classrooms consist of students with varying backgrounds and learning profiles, teachers must become part of the solution by differentiating their teaching methods and instructional programs. Through this approach, teachers can create assessments that accurately gauge students' comprehension of the taught concepts at an appropriate level [<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="para0034">Teaching and learning are increasingly challenging due to diverse student abilities and disabilities. However, there are differentiation processes that, if implemented, can offer enhanced opportunities for students to engage in their learning actively. It's crucial to recognize that ensuring every child achieves their personal best in the classroom is not just an educational but also an ethical imperative. Evidence supports the importance of differentiation in pedagogical approaches for fostering the well-being and success of students in their learning journey. This involves tailoring instructions, content, curriculum, and assessments to meet individual student needs. Such approaches enable students to persevere in their learning, develop a genuine interest in school, collaborate effectively with teachers, and cultivate a desire to gain a deep understanding of the subject matter. For these approaches to resonate with students, schools must develop engaging and relevant curricula that motivate all learners, even in challenging circumstances [<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, the curriculum should be aligned with equally customized assessments to accommodate diverse abilities. By differentiating both the curriculum and assessments, students can thrive and experience a sense of fulfillment in their academic endeavors [<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0006"><title>Materials</title><p id="para0035">K.A.

This initial step ensured students were grouped effectively based on their specific needs and capabilities. Educational materials such as tests and assignments were carefully selected to facilitate grouping. Students who struggled with tasks were placed in weaker groups, ensuring they received appropriate support and instruction tailored to their level. The experiment involved 3rd-grade students working on tasks of the same complexity (a text) but under different conditions. This approach aimed to monitor the development of reading skills and comprehension. The primary goal of the experiment was to observe the progression of reading skills and the ability to understand the text's central idea.

Jirkova's research focused on developing criteria for differentiation and grouping students based on their abilities, which enhanced reading skills and text comprehension among 3rd-grade students. Valtseva's exploration of differentiated learning emphasized its potential to address individual student needs, improve engagement, and enhance overall learning outcomes. Both studies demonstrated that differentiated teaching strategies can prevent knowledge gaps, develop student abilities and interests, and promote a more personalized and effective educational process.

Differentiating instruction is more challenging in practice than it appears, as highlighted by Wan (2016). Teachers were unable to accommodate the diversity of learners with the same ease because they lacked sufficient experience with differentiation tactics. Teachers struggle to understand how differentiated instruction should be applied in their classrooms, despite the fact that the concept is widely recognized [<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By the 2020s, a differentiated approach has proven to be beneficial for students with diverse abilities.
