Intrapericardial adhesion has also been recognized as a tissue healing mechanism for mesothelial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The process is initiated by the attachment of fibrin bundles within 1&#x000a0;week after surgery, followed by an inflammatory reaction with macrophages, fibroblasts, and microangiogenesis within 1&#x000a0;month. After the subsidence of inflammation, fibrous attachments with mesothelial recovery develop as adhesions 1&#x000a0;month after surgery. The degree of adhesion varies depending on the surgical invasiveness, bleeding, and cardiopulmonary bypass.</p><p id="Par6">Various materials are used to prevent adhesion, such as a physical barrier between the epicardium and pericardium. Naturally derived polymers such as oxidized regenerated cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], hyaluronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], dextrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and gelatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have been successfully applied clinically. These hydrophilic materials transform into hydrogels and degrade within 1&#x000a0;month in vivo, leaving only modest adhesion.</p><p id="Par7">These naturally derived polymers contain a substance known as &#x0201c;intermediate water&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Intermediate water is loosely bound to the hydrated polymer and inhibits the adhesion of platelets and fibrinogen to the polymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We propose the &#x0201c;intermediate water concept,&#x0201d; which hypothesizes that the presence of intermediate water is essential for improving biocompatibility of materials. This property may allow polymers to inhibit fibrin and cell attachment to the surface of the epicardium and pericardium during the critical phase of adhesion.</p><p id="Par8">The present study investigated the role of intermediate water in alleviating postoperative intrapericardial adhesion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par9">This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University (approval ID #21,069-A). All animals received humane care according to the guidelines of the committee and the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title><italic>Hypothesis</italic></title><p id="Par10">The hypothesis of this study was that a hydrophobic polymer without intermediate water could alleviate intrapericardial adhesion when coated with a hydrophilic polymer containing intermediate water. Polyglycolic acid (PGA) was selected as a hydrophobic aliphatic polymer. The clinically used PGA sheet is known to have no anti-adhesion effect but induces fibrous tissue formation and is thus used for tissue repair and reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. poly(oxyethylene)oleyl ether (PO-OE), a nonionic surfactant for smooth knitting known to enhance drug absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], was chosen as the hydrophilic polymer for coating PGA. Two PO-OEs (PO-OE 66&#x02013;1 and PO-OE 98&#x02013;2, FL-IN1; Inuisyoji Corp., Osaka, Japan) were blended to maintain an ideal hydrophile&#x02013;lipophile balance, which is the standard for ensuring proper hydrophilicity in the coating materials.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether or not the PO-OE coating could cancel the aforementioned properties of the PGA sheet and provide an antiadhesion effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preparation of a sheet of PGA and coating with PO-OE</title><p id="Par12">The PGA sheet was manufactured as circular knitted fabric composed of PGA yarn. The yarn consisted of ten filaments with an individual filament diameter of 22.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. An aqueous emulsion of the mixed PO-OEs was used to coat multifilament yarns by dipping spun PGA fibers (Pellets; BioDegmer, BMG Inc., Kyoto, Japan). This process is required to transform the multifilament yarn into a bundle. The fabric was needle-punched to control stretchability and dimensional stability. The weight and thickness of the sheet were 70&#x02013;80&#x000a0;g/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.66&#x000a0;mm, respectively. To obtain non-coated PGA sheets, the coated PGA sheets were ultrasonically washed with 80% ethanol to remove PO-OE. Finally, the sheets were packaged and sterilized using ethylene oxide gas. The sheets were then stored at room temperature for a further evaluation. Gross and scanning electron microscopy images of the sheets are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Gross appearance and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets.

The immersion periods were 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4&#x000a0;weeks, and the PGA sheets were maintained in an incubator at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After immersion, the PGA sheets were removed, washed with distilled water, and vacuum-dried (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 each with and without coating). To evaluate the extent of PGA degradation, the weight-averaged molecular weight (MW) of each polymer was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography using a previously reported method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In brief, polymers were extracted from excised PGA samples using hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), and the tissue residue was removed by filtration through deactivated glass wool. Measurements were performed using gel permeation chromatography (Prominence GPC; Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) with a refractive index detector for PGA. The MW of PGA was calculated from a calibration curve obtained using polystyrene standards (MW range 0.5&#x02013;2110&#x000a0;kDa).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Differential scanning calorimetry</title><p id="Par14">To detect intermediate water in the materials, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of hydrated samples were performed as described in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a DSC analysis, hydration water can be identified as free water (very weakly bound water), intermediate water (loosely bound water/freezing bound water), and non-freezing water (tightly bound water) by cold crystallization followed by a heat-melting process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Intermediate water is cold-crystallized in a range of &#x02212;40 to &#x02212;50 &#x000b0;C and melts below 0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, at which point free water melts. In brief, pieces of the PGA sheets were immersed in pure water. The sample sheet (4.3&#x000a0;mg) was sealed in an aluminum cell (GCA-0052; Hitachi High-Tech Science Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The samples were cooled to &#x02212;100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C at a rate of 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C/min, held for 5&#x000a0;min, and then heated to 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C at the same rate using the DSC equipment (DSC7000X; Hitachi High-Tech Science Corp.). Viscous liquid PO-OEs were mixed with water at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;days to obtain a homogenous mixture, which was then used for DSC measurements under the same conditions. The mass of the PO-OE 66&#x02013;1/water system was 3.4&#x000a0;mg, and that of the PO-OE 98&#x02013;2/water system was 4.7&#x000a0;mg. The water content in each system was 2&#x000a0;g/g. Intermediate water is defined as hydrated water that exhibits crystallization or melting at temperatures lower than the phase-transition temperature of pure water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Cell attachment to PGA sheets with and without a PO-OE coating</title><p id="Par15">Tissue culture 24-well plates composed of polystyrene were pretreated with 0.5% (w/v) poly(n-butyl methacrylate 70-co-2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine 30) and left to dry overnight. Three sheets (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) of each PGA sample were placed on plates and sterilized using UV light for 1&#x000a0;h. Subsequently, the wells were thoroughly rinsed with PBS to eliminate any contaminants. A cell culture solution (DMEM/F12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the wells and incubated for 1&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to promote cell attachment. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) were then seeded on the samples at a density of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and allowed to adhere to and proliferate on the surface of the samples for 1&#x000a0;h and 1, 3, and 7&#x000a0;days. The culture medium was replenished every 3&#x000a0;days to maintain optimal cell growth conditions. After removal of the medium, the cells were treated with 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of fresh medium and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of Cell Counting Kit-8 solution (343&#x02013;07623; Dojindo, Kyoto, Japan). After 2 h incubation at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the culture medium was subjected to a spectrophotometric analysis at 450&#x000a0;nm using a microplate reader (Infinite 200PRO M Plex; Tecan, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland).

Surgery to place a sheet on the surface of the heart was performed with reference to a previously reported technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with some modifications. In brief, the animals were intubated after induction with an intravenous injection of thiamylal sodium (25&#x000a0;mg/kg), and general anesthesia was maintained with inhaled sevoflurane. The right chest was opened by standard thoracotomy, and the heart was exposed by gentle retraction of the lungs. An approximately 10-cm longitudinal incision was made in the anterior pericardium parallel to the phrenic nerve (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The epicardial surfaces of the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) were damaged using a rasping file for electrocautery. Blood (5&#x000a0;mL) was collected through a purse-string suture on the RA wall using a 5&#x02013;0 polypropylene suture (Prolene; Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Four additional single stitches were placed on the RA and RV using the same nonabsorbable suture to induce granulation. Blood was sprinkled into the inter-pericardial space. After placing a rectangular sheet over the RA and RV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the pericardial incision was directly approximated using multiple single stitches with the same non-absorbable suture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The chest was then closed. An intramuscular injection of butorphanol tartrate (0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg) was administered for analgesia before the animals awakened.

Interestingly, cell infiltration and fibrous tissue growth were not observed after 3&#x000a0;months. However, collagen fibers proliferated slightly on the surface of the pericardium at 6&#x000a0;months postoperatively. In Groups Y and Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;C, the PGA sheets were completely absorbed and replaced by a connective tissue layer in the pericardial space at each postoperative timepoint. In Group Y, the connective tissue layer irregularly eroded the pericardium and epicardium 3&#x000a0;months after surgery, whereas this active reaction was modest in Group Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;C at this timepoint. The border of the connective tissue layer became clear with sparse collagen fibers and less cell infiltration in Groups Y and Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;C. Three months after surgery, suture-reactive granulomas had formed in all groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, suture on RA). Granuloma was markedly developed in Groups N and Y (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), whereas the reaction was modest in Group Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;C. Although the granuloma was replaced with a fibrous scar 6&#x000a0;months after surgery in all groups, the scar in Group N was prominent with collagen infiltration into the myocardium, resulting in tight fibrotic adhesion. In contrast, fibrosis around the suture was sparse, with a clear border in Group Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;C at 6&#x000a0;months after surgery. At 3&#x000a0;months after sheet insertion, the pericardial space was significantly thicker in Group Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;C than in groups N and Y, although the thickness did not significantly differ between them (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

First, PO-OEs contain intermediate water in their hydrated state, and coating with PO-OEs can provide intermediate water to PGA fibers, which cannot have intermediate water. Second, in the in vitro study, PO-OE coating inhibited the attachment and proliferation of fibroblasts onto PGA fibers. Third, although it was not possible to prevent the undesirable replacement of the PGA sheet by fibrotic tissue in the pericardial space in vivo, the addition of coated PO-OEs alleviated the inflammatory response induced by PGA 3&#x000a0;months after implantation. This was thought to be reflected in the formation of sparse connective tissue during adhesion-release surgery.</p><p id="Par31">An ideal antiadhesion material has a shielding function and prevents adverse inflammatory responses that initiate fibrous proliferation and cell attachment to the epicardium and pericardium, resulting in adhesion. To select a polymer, it is necessary to re-evaluate the mechanism of cell attachment. Recently, it was found that intermediate water, loosely bound to specific polymers when hydrated, plays an important role in biocompatibility by inhibiting the adhesion of proteins and cells to the polymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Polymers containing intermediate water, such as poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA), have been applied in clinical practice as biocompatible coating materials for extracorporeal circuit tubes and oxygenators to prevent thrombosis by inhibiting protein and platelet attachment to the material surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. At present, the main polymers used as commercially available antiadhesives are naturally derived polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These polymers transform into hydrogels in vivo and exert excellent antiadhesive effects. Interestingly, intermediate water molecules have been detected in these polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">To address the role of intermediate water in preventing intrapericardial adhesion, we examined the placement of polymers with or without intermediate water in the pericardial space. Because it is impossible to remove the intermediate water from the hydrogels, we chose an alternative method of adding intermediate water to PGA, a biodegradable polymer used in clinical practice. Woven fabric PGA, which has been used clinically to prevent air leakage in lung resection surgery, induces nonspecific inflammatory reactions around PGA fibers during the first two weeks and is replaced by fibrous tissue adhering to the pleural surface after eight weeks in the pleural space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We examined whether or not fibrous tissue, which is considered to be the main cause of adhesion caused by PGA in the pericardial space, could be alleviated by the addition of intermediate water.</p><p id="Par33">The thickest pericardial space observed in Group Y&#x02009;+&#x02009;C at 3&#x000a0;months after the insertion of the PO-OE-coated PGA indicated that the PO-OEs absorbed water and swelled like a hydrogel. It is also suggested that this swelling reduced the inflammatory and foreign body reactions initiated by macrophage migration into the PGA fibers and subsequent fibrotic tissue formation, which may reflect the inhibitory effects on fibroblast adhesion and proliferation on PGA fibers in vitro. Despite these positive expectations, however, the PO-OE coating did not reduce the replacement of PGA with fibrous tissue; thus, there was no obvious difference in the severity of adhesion between the presence and absence of the PO-OE coating.</p><p id="Par34">Taken together, these findings suggest, at least in part, that a polymer used as an antiadhesive should retain intermediate water when hydrated in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par35">Several limitations associated with the present study warrant mention. First, owing to the small number of experimental animals, it was not possible to statistically prove the anti-adhesive effect of the PO-OE coating. However, we believe this study addresses the hypothesis of positive anti-adhesion effects according to the &#x0201c;intermediate water concept.&#x0201d; Second, the amount of intermediate water added to the PGA fabric was not determined in this study; thus, the amount of intermediate water required to maximize the anti-adhesive effect remains unclear and needs to be defined by evaluating the dose&#x02013;effect relationship. Third, PO-OE was selected because of its compatibility with the circular knitting machine; however, the half-life, mechanism of absorption, and bonding strength of PO-OE to PGA fibers are unclear. Alternative coating materials and additives can provide intermediate water for biodegradable polymers. Further investigations on the intermediate water concept are necessary for the development of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers as antiadhesive materials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Fumiyo Shimada for coordinating the animal studies and data collection and Takafumi Ogawa (Kyodo Byori Inc., Kobe, Japan) for the histological preparations.</p></ack><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by The Japan Wool Textile Co., Ltd.
