Hospital discharge data, publicly available from 2011 to 2021, were analyzed to assess incidence, DALYs, and the spatial distribution of hospitalized cases during this period. Between 2010 and 2021, a total of 6,821 hospitalized cases of bipolar disorder were documented in Ecuador, comprising 2,423 males and 4,398 females. The incidence rate peaked in 2019, with the lowest rate reported in 2020. There was no linear association between time and incidence rates or number of cases, but a significant increase was observed from 2017 to 2019 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). The incidence rate was significantly higher in females compared to males (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). The average annual incidence was 3.47 cases per 100,000 person-years. The mean age at diagnosis was 40.76 years, with females being diagnosed at a younger age than males (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01548). Bipolar disorder-related deaths totaled 27 (12 males, 15 females). The burden of disease, expressed in DALYs, ranged from 66.769 to 126.98 per 100,000 population, with the hospitals from the private sector contributing most to the average DALYs. YLDs represented over 99% of the total burden. This study highlights the significant gender differences and temporal trends in bipolar disorder incidence in Ecuador, emphasizing the need for targeted public health strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data that support the findings of this study are publicly available and can be accessed at the following links: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/camas-y-egresos-hospitalarios/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/camas-y-egresos-hospitalarios/</ext-link> (Descriptive data on hospital discharges and bed occupancy); <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/proyecciones-poblacionales/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/proyecciones-poblacionales/</ext-link> (Population projections, used for incidence calculations).

It is a major contributor to global disability, significantly impairing the social functioning of those affected [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, it is linked to a shorter life expectancy compared to the general population [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], collectively imposing a substantial societal burden.</p><p>While bipolar disorder often emerges in early adulthood, diagnosis is frequently delayed by several years. Some individuals report delays of up to a decade from symptom onset to diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], attributed to the alternation between emotional extremes [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the variability in life trajectories among affected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These factors complicate accurate and timely diagnosis, and lack of treatment can worsen the disease&#x02019;s course and prognosis.</p><p>Bipolar disorder is associated with adverse health outcomes, including elevated mortality rates. Premature death in individuals with this condition is frequently linked to comorbid medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, obesity, and diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Suicide also significantly contributes to mortality rates, accounting for 15% of deaths in this population [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Gender has also been shown to have an important influence on symptom presentation, comorbidity, and response to bipolar disorder treatment. Women tend to experience more depressive episodes and comorbidities such as anxiety and eating disorders, while men experience more manic episodes and substance abuse [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These differences also affect their response to treatment, with women being more susceptible to the side effects of mood stabilizers and men showing higher rates of completed suicidal behavior [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Ecuador, however, little research has been undertaken to analyze these disparities, making it difficult to develop public health interventions that address gender-specific needs [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Given the severity and chronic nature of bipolar disorder, its economic impact is substantial. In Europe, the estimated total cost of the condition is approximately 21.49 billion euros, whereas in the United States, it reaches 151 billion dollars. Insurance studies reveal that bipolarity is one of the costliest disorders compared to other mental and medical conditions, second only to diabetes combined with coronary heart disease. Depressive symptoms lead to high indirect costs due to loss of productivity, while manic symptoms significantly influence direct costs due to hospitalizations [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Epidemiological data and information on the disease burden of bipolar disorder in Latin America remain scarce. In Brazil, the years lived with disability (YLDs) due to bipolar disorder are nearly 249 per 100,000 inhabitants, representing the highest rate in Latin America and the Caribbean. Paraguay and Argentina follow with 245 and 234 years, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder in Latin America is estimated at 2.3% [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the genetic and social risk factors influencing the disorder&#x02019;s clinical presentation and associated comorbidities remain insufficiently studied.</p><p>Bipolar disorder imposes a significant economic burden in Latin America, stemming from both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs encompass hospitalizations, medications, and outpatient care, often aggravated by the region&#x02019;s limited mental health infrastructure. In Brazil, for example, nearly $9 billion is spent annually on managing bipolar disorder, a figure compounded by the fact that nearly half of patients remain symptomatic despite treatment, resulting in recurrent episodes and increased hospitalizations [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Indirect costs, including absenteeism, loss of productivity, and societal burden, are equally significant. Bipolar disorder is among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the region, with tropical Latin America reporting the highest incidence and DALY rates globally [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Comorbidities, such as anxiety and substance use disorders, further increase healthcare utilization and complicate disease management, inflating the overall economic strain [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The treatment gap for bipolar disorder exceeds 80% in countries like Colombia, delaying diagnosis and exacerbating disease severity, which leads to more costly interventions, such as hospitalizations [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In low- and middle-income countries like Ecuador, these pressures are amplified by under-resourced mental health systems characterized by inequitable access, outdated infrastructure, and a shortage of trained professionals [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the indirect costs of bipolar disorder, particularly in low-income populations, create substantial societal and financial disruptions, as these groups lack the financial resilience to absorb such impacts [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Addressing these challenges requires urgent public health interventions, such as expanding access to affordable mental health services, implementing early diagnostic and treatment strategies, and closing the treatment gap to reduce the broader economic and social consequences of bipolar disorder.</p><p>Ecuador lacks specific epidemiological studies on bipolar disorder, making it challenging to accurately determine the disease burden. Global statistics suggest that it is one of the costliest and most burdensome diseases. However, the impact of it on Ecuador&#x02019;s public health services remains unknown, complicating the establishment of effective treatment plans at different levels of care. Studies like this one can offer essential evidence to support the distribution of resources and the implementation of public health initiatives focused on the prevention and treatment of bipolar disorder [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>This research seeks to fill the existing knowledge gap by examining data from individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder and hospitalized in Ecuador. It focuses on exploring the characteristics of the disorder, with particular attention to gender disparities and its impact on the population at the national level. The ultimate goal is to enhance decision-making processes related to advancing strategies for awareness, prevention, and management of this mental health condition in Ecuador.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A dataset publicly provided by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC), a state agency tasked with compiling nationwide statistical information, including hospital data from across the country, was analyzed. This dataset encompasses anonymized information related to hospital discharges, encompassing both public and private healthcare facilities. This information is in the public domain and therefore no ethics committee clearance was required. The INEC is responsible for data collection across multiple domains that inform public policy. It ensures data quality through a governance framework that includes automated systems for secure and consistent data handling, rigorous validation protocols, and adherence to international standards. Processes such as consistency checks, de-duplication, and collaboration with health institutions resolve discrepancies, ensuring reliable and comprehensive data for public health policy. The anonimity of the database precludes consideration of repeated hospitalizations, which are a limitation of the data.</p><p>The dataset, spanning the years 2010&#x02013;2021, included demographic variables such as age, sex, self-reported ethnic or racial identity, and discharge diagnoses. The discharge diagnoses were classified in the database following the guidelines of the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Diagnoses identified as Bipolar Affective Disorder corresponded broadly to the ICD-10 classification codes F31. which include F31.0 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode hypomanic; F31.1 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic without psychotic symptoms; F31.2 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms; F31.3 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode mild or moderate depression; F31.4 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode severe depression without psychotic symptoms; F31.5 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode severe depression with psychotic symptoms; F31.6 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode mixed; F31.7 Bipolar affective disorder, currently in remission; F31.8 Other bipolar affective disorders; and F31.9 Bipolar affective disorder, unspecified [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As of 2021, Ecuador&#x02019;s population was estimated at 17,751,277, compared to 15,012,228 recorded during the most recent nationwide census in 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Sources of information</title><p>In this investigation, information spanning the years 2010&#x02013;2021, sourced from national-level records documenting hospital deaths and admissions resulting in discharges and related to specific illnesses, was employed. These registries are compiled by the General Direction of Civil Registry and the Ministry of Health in Ecuador and subsequently aggregated and disseminated by Instituto Nacional de Estad&#x000ed;stica y Censos (INEC). The dataset utilized in this research was extracted from these consolidated databases, encompassing data from both public and private healthcare service providers [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The database provided details of the sources of hospital record information categorized by the type of institution. The public sources listed include Seguro Social (Social Security), the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social (Ecuadorian Social Security Institute), the Junta de Beneficencia de Guayaquil (Guayaquil Charitable Board), the Ministerio de Defensa Nacional (Ministry of National Defense), the Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n (Ministry of Education), the Ministerio de Gobierno y Polic&#x000ed;a (Ministry of Government and Police), the Ministerio de Justicia y de Gobierno y Polic&#x000ed;a (Ministry of Justice and Government and Police), the Ministerio de Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Cultos (Ministry of Justice, Human Rights, and Worship), the Ministerio de Salud P&#x000fa;blica (Ministry of Public Health), municipalities, other public institutions, Seguro Campesino (Rural Social Security), and universities and polytechnic schools. The private sources are grouped into two categories: private institutions for profit and private institutions not for profit [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The international ICD codes F31.0 &#x02013; F31.9 were applied for the identification of fatalities and hospital admissions attributed to Bipolar Affective Disorder. Prior to employing the DALY calculator in R v4.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the data underwent processing in Microsoft Excel.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Estimation of the burden of disease</title><p>To assess the impact of Bipolar Affective Disorder on the overall disease burden in Ecuador during the 2010&#x02013;2021 period, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were estimated. This metric combines the disease burden derived from both the duration of disability experienced by individuals (YLDs) and the years of life lost due to early mortality (YLLs). The approach followed the methodology outlined by Murray et al. [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies. Calculations were performed using the &#x0201c;DALY&#x0201d; package for R [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Firstly, to estimate Years of Life Lost (YLLs), the study calculated the product of the number of deaths attributed to Bipolar Affective Disorder during the study period and the remaining life expectancy at the age of death. Residual life expectancy was determined using the R software, based on GBD 2010 data, with a standardized life expectancy of 86.02 years applied to both males and females. For the DALY estimations, three distinct methodologies were utilized: the first excluded both a time discount rate and age weighting for the years lost; the second incorporated a 3% annual time discount rate, emphasizing years nearer to the present while omitting age weighting; and the third combined the 3% annual discount rate with age weighting. This approach adheres to the framework described by Murray et al. [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Egunsola et al. [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, to complete the calculation of the total burden of disease, we need to add to the YLL the Years Lived with Disability (YLD), which is the more substantial source of disease burden with Bipolar Affective Disorder. Effectively the YLD reflects the size of the gap between the expected quality of life lived without the illness and that lived with it. It is important to highlight that the hospital admission data recorded by healthcare services reflect only the segment of the symptomatic bipolar population with sufficient access to medical care. Consequently, these data are not appropriate for estimating the total Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) at the national level but are instead utilized to estimate the YLDs observed within the healthcare system.</p><p>To calculate YLD estimates, it is essential to possess Disability Weights (DW) estimates specific to the diagnosed population with Bipolar Affective Disorder. The DW offers an understanding of the anticipated effect of the illness on quality of life, based on available data regarding the typical severity of disability experienced by individuals diagnosed with the condition. Given the absence of detailed information on the severity of Bipolar Affective Disorder experienced by individual patients in the sampled hospital records, utilizing the average disability weight is regarded as the most unbiased assumption. Accordingly, we inferred the distribution of the severity of experience within the population and took this distribution to calculate the weighted average DW for sufferers of Bipolar Affective Disorder.</p><p>According to Kim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the DW for mild, moderate and severe Bipolar Disorder are 0.248, 0.453 and 0.658, respectively. The same authors also estimated a distribution of the severity of illness amongst the diagnosed population of 9%, 61% and 30%, for mild, moderate and severe Bipolar Affective Disorder, respectively. Using the available data, we computed a weighted average disability weight of 0.496, which was then applied consistently across all cases in our database.</p><p>The age-specific data reveals that the incidence rate of schizophrenia diagnosis varies across different age groups, ranging from an average of 0 per 100,000 person-years for infants of both sexes to 4.8 per 100,000 individuals (males) in the 45&#x02013;59 year age group, and 8.6 per 100,000 individuals (females) for adults in the same age group. <xref rid="pone.0320321.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the details of the

The incidence of hospitalized cases for all groups between 2010&#x02013;2021 was 3.47 per 100,000 persons per year. The lowest incidence reported in this period was in 2020 with 2.80 per 100,000 persons per year, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic led to significant declines in accessibility to medical care because of quarantine measures, hospital restrictions, and competition for limited resources [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Mental health was particularly affected in middle and low-income countries like Ecuador, where inadequate funding has resulted in a disproportionate distribution of professionals to the sector, as well as insufficient training, and outdated infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Other studies have also reported a decrease in bipolar disorder diagnoses in hospitals since 2019 [,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], consistent with our findings, possibly reflecting a lack of access to mental health care rather than an actual decrease in incidence [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>These findings highlight the importance of developing public policies focused on improving mental health systems in Ecuador. This is especially relevant in the current context, where events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the urgency of including mental health as a priority in responses to health emergencies.</p><p>Our study found a significant positive association between time and incidence only in women, indicating an increase in cases over the studied period. This aligns with global data showing an increase in the incidence and prevalence of bipolar disorder over the years [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This trend can be attributed to demographic changes, such as increased life expectancy and an older average age [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], as well as greater diagnostic awareness and attention towards bipolarity since 2000 [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study determined that the age-standardized prevalence of bipolar disorder per 100,000 people for Latin America and the Caribbean was 963.7, in Andean Latin America 910.5, in Central Latin America 854, and in Tropical Latin America 1111.1 [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These figures suggest that Ecuador has a low registration of cases, possibly influenced by the treatment gap in the region. For instance, in Colombia, the treatment gap for affective disorders is 84.8% [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], indicating that many individuals do not receive necessary care for diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Reducing this treatment gap should be a priority for the Ecuadorian health system. Measures that have been shown to be effective in addressing this problem include: 1) the development of subsidy programmes or economic incentives to facilitate access to mental health services for low-income groups, 2) the promotion of initiatives to extend health coverage to remote areas with limited access to specialized services, and 3) the strengthening of education and training of specialized health personnel.</p><p>Sociodemographic variables, such as sex, is crucial for understanding the diagnosis and course of this disorder. Although some studies suggest equal prevalence in men and women [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], our study found significant disparities. There were more cases in females (4,398) than in males (2,423), with an average incidence rate of 4.43 vs. 2.48 per 100,000 persons per year. This may be due to better diagnosis for women related to their higher risks, especially among pregnant and postpartum women, for bipolar disorder type II, hypomania, rapid cycling, and mixed episodes [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Men typically have an earlier onset of first episode of mania than women, who have higher incidence rates of bipolar disorder type I across adulthood, though gender differences are not statistically significant [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In contrast, our study shows that the mean age of this diagnosis for men was 41.38 years and for women 40.42 years. The highest peak of diagnosis was between 25 and 30 years, with higher incidence in women. The relatively earlier diagnosis and higher recorded incidence rates for women may suggest that professionals are better at identifying the signs of the illness in women, or women are better at seeking help for their illness, or both. Incidence by sex in other age groups did not differ significantly.</p><p>There is a significant gap between the age of onset (usually late adolescence) and age of diagnosis. Delays in diagnosis range from 5 years in bipolar disorder type I to 11 years in type II in Canada, and on average 8.74 years in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In Chile and Argentina, the delay is around 8 years, while in Ecuador, it extends to 15&#x02013;20 years. The difficulty in diagnosing BD, especially in the initial stage, contributes to this delay. Misdiagnosis as depression and the complexity of assessing manic or hypomanic symptoms during depressive periods further complicates timely diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>This delayed diagnosis leads to significant costs through prolonged suffering, and worse prognosis, contributing to bipolarity having the highest suicide rate among psychiatric conditions [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Patients often endure an average of 10 years with symptoms without a correct diagnosis, exacerbating the disease burden.</p><p>Reducing delays in diagnosis is essential to reduce the negative impact of bipolar disorder on patients&#x02019; quality of life. The implementation of screening systems in primary care or the development of educational campaigns aimed at the general public could contribute to the recognition of early signs of the illness and reduce this gap, especially in adolescents and young adults.</p><p>The results also show that the private sector handles more of the burden from bipolar disorder (69.208) than the public sector (58.003). This may be because, as several studies have reported, patients with bipolar disorder tend to have a higher socioeconomic status [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. People with higher resources and status tend to seek professional help and access better treatment [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and in the context of the Ecuadorian health system, this usually is private. On the other hand, no differentiation in burden by sex was found in global studies [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Observing the geographical distribution of the incidence of bipolarity cases, the provinces with more cases are Pichincha, Pastaza, Bolivar, Guayas, Azuay and Galapagos. While the provinces with the most risk for hospitalization cases are Imbabura, Pichincha, Chimborazo, Azuay and Guayas. We can say that most cases and risk factors occur in the highlands and there is also a higher incidence in the provinces where the largest and most populated cities such as Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca are located.</p><p>Regarding Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), the data indicates that from 2010 to 2021, there was a disease burden of 126.980 per 100,000 inhabitants in Ecuador. Global numbers suggest that this disorder resulted in 105.4 DALYs per 100 000 persons (95% UI 64&#x02013;3&#x02013;162-0) in 2019, a number in line with our results. Such numbers place bipolar disorder as 67th in the ranking of global causes of DALYs and as 28<sup>th</sup> for causes of YLDs [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As for Ecuador, it was found that YLDs explain 99% of all contributions to the burden of disease in DALYs for all sectors.</p><p>The findings from this study, which estimate a mean annual incidence of 3.47 per 100,000 person-years and a burden of disease ranging from 66.77 to 126.98 DALYs per 100,000 population in Ecuador, align with trends observed in other Latin American countries, albeit with notable variations. For instance, in Brazil, bipolar disorder accounts for approximately 249 years lived with disability (YLDs) per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest in Latin America, followed by Paraguay (245 YLDs) and Argentina (234 YLDs) [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder in Latin America is estimated at 2.3%, slightly higher than global figures [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, epidemiological studies in countries such as Colombia and Chile reveal significant gaps in diagnosis and treatment. Colombia, for example, has a treatment gap of 84.8% for affective disorders, highlighting the regional challenges in accessing care [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The spatial clustering observed in Ecuador&#x02019;s highlands and major urban centers like Pichincha mirrors findings in Argentina and Brazil, where urbanization and socioeconomic factors contribute to the concentration of cases (GBD 2019 Mental Disorders Collaborators, 2022) [<xref rid="pone.0320321.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These regional comparisons underscore the shared challenges across Latin America in addressing mental health disorders, including disparities in healthcare access, diagnostic delays, and the societal stigma surrounding mental illness.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology and burden of bipolar disorder (BD) in Ecuador; however, it is constrained by several limitations that could impact the comprehensiveness of its findings. Firstly, the reliance on hospital discharge records means the analysis captures primarily severe cases requiring hospitalization, excluding undiagnosed or outpatient cases. This approach likely underestimates the true prevalence and burden of BD, particularly in rural and underserved areas where access to hospital care is limited. Additionally, the data pertain only to diagnosed and hospitalized cases, and the lack of comprehensive mental health services and social support systems in Ecuador further skews the dataset, as many individuals with BD may remain undiagnosed or untreated.</p><p>Furthermore, variability in diagnostic practices across institutions, coupled with potential inaccuracies in ICD-10 coding, may lead to inconsistencies in identifying and categorizing BD cases, particularly their subtypes. The management and quality of diagnostic registries also vary between public and private healthcare systems, which could contribute to coding inaccuracies and gaps in data. Moreover, data on hospital discharges may include repeat hospitalizations of the same individuals across different institutions, potentially leading to overrepresentation of certain cases. Conversely, the underrepresentation of outpatient and mild cases results in an incomplete picture of BD&#x02019;s true epidemiological footprint.</p><p>Cultural and socioeconomic factors likely influence mental health-seeking behaviors and access to treatment, further complicating efforts to gauge the full burden of BD. These factors disproportionately affect marginalized populations, such as those in rural areas or with limited financial means, resulting in potential underrepresentation in the dataset.</p><p>To address these limitations, future research should adopt a multifaceted approach. Community-based studies and household surveys can complement hospital data by capturing cases that remain undiagnosed or are managed outside of formal healthcare settings. Integrating data from public and private healthcare providers into a unified electronic health system could reduce duplication, improve case tracking, and provide a more comprehensive understanding of BD prevalence. Standardizing diagnostic criteria and training healthcare personnel in mental health diagnostics would enhance the accuracy and consistency of data collection. Furthermore, qualitative research exploring cultural and socioeconomic barriers to diagnosis and care would help illuminate gaps in understanding BD&#x02019;s impact across different populations.</p><p>Finally, longitudinal studies that follow patients from symptom onset to diagnosis would be invaluable in addressing the diagnostic delay frequently observed in BD cases. Advanced methodologies, such as geospatial analysis and machine learning, could uncover trends and risk factors, guiding targeted public health interventions. Such efforts would contribute to reducing the burden of bipolar disorder in Ecuador and similar resource-constrained settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to characterize the incidence and burden of bipolar disorder in Ecuador over an 11-year period. The findings indicate a low incidence of bipolar disorder, likely due to the treatment gap common in low-income countries. Notably, women are more frequently diagnosed with BD, though men tend to receive earlier diagnoses. The burden of disease in Ecuador aligns with global figures, underscoring the significant impact of BD. These results highlight the urgent need for public policies aimed at early diagnosis and comprehensive care to mitigate the personal and social impacts of bipolar disorder.</p></sec><sec id="sec017" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0320321.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1Table</label><caption><title>Parameters for DALY calculation.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0320321.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0320321.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Female cases of bipolar disorder and incidence by year.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0320321.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0320321.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Cases and incidence of bipolar disorder in male Ecuadorians by year.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0320321.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0320321.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Spatial clusters of BD in Ecuador.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0320321.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Natalia Barriga for her help with curation of the data.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0320321.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Rowland</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Marwaha</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>Epidemiology and risk factors for bipolar disorder</article-title>. <source>Ther Adv Psychopharmacol</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>8</volume>(<issue>9</issue>):<fpage>251</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>69</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/2045125318769235</pub-id>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;1. Title and Introduction:</p><p>* Title: The title is clear and reflects the paper&#x02019;s content, but it could be made more concise and engaging.</p><p>* Introduction: The introduction provides a good background on bipolar disorder and highlights the knowledge gap, but more emphasis on previous local studies would strengthen the rationale for the research.</p><p>* Suggestions:</p><p>- Add a short paragraph about the economic impact of bipolar disorder in Latin America to bolster the study&#x02019;s justification.</p><p>- Incorporate more up-to-date references to support the background.</p><p>2. Methods:</p><p>* The methods are well-documented, but there is limited discussion about how differences between public and private hospital records were handled.</p><p>*No adjustment for other demographic factors like social class or education was mentioned.</p><p>* Suggestions:</p><p>- Include a deeper analysis of additional factors like geographic region or socioeconomic status to provide a more comprehensive view.</p><p>- Explain the steps taken to ensure the quality of hospital records and how repeated hospitalizations for the same patients were handled.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>* Suggestions:</p><p>- A comparative analysis with other Latin American countries would highlight regional differences.</p><p>4. Discussion:</p><p>* The discussion touches on key findings, but it leans heavily on the statistics without sufficiently tying them to practical applications or health policy.</p><p>* There is little mention of gaps that future studies could address.</p><p>* Suggestions:</p><p>- Strengthen the discussion by proposing specific public health interventions or policy recommendations based on the findings.</p><p>- Elaborate more on the study&#x02019;s limitations and how future research could overcome them, such as improving hospital record systems.</p><p>5. palgiarism:</p><p>*Plagiarism Check Result: 38.14% (By Plagiarism Detector v. 2695)</p><p>(It is recommended to reduce this percentage as much as possible to ensure originality).</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Burden of disease, incidence, and spatial distribution of bipolar disorder in Ecuador from 2011 to 2021 using hospital discharge records</p><p>PONE-D-24-44009</p><p>Comments</p><p>Overall this research appears to be very well-conceived and conducted!</p><p>I believe that the paper will have value at both a local and global level. This contributes to our understanding of the specific situation in Ecuador in a large way and to the global burden of bipolar disorder as well.</p><p>Recommended for publication</p><p>Minor revision suggestions follow:</p><p>Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript is very well written and easy to follow.</p><p>In fact, it was enjoyable and informative to read.</p><p>The conclusions are robust and follow logically from the data and analysis, yet are not overstated.</p><p>Limitations of the research are identified and the conclusions fall within the scope of the research.</p><p>Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously</p><p>The statistical analysis has been conducted to a high quality in line with accepted practice.</p><p>Note Consider for revision:</p><p>Line 140:</p><p>A 3% discount rate was used. This is in line with the standard discounting practice.</p><p>As Ecuador is identified by the authors as a middle to low-income country, consider running the model with a second analysis using a 5% discount rate. This may affect the high contribution of YLDs to DALYs identified on line 243.</p><p>Table 2.</p><p>Headings: General, Public Sector, Private Sector.</p><p>Consider changing "General" to "Weighted Average".

Time trend of bipolar disorder hospitalized yearly incidences male and female cases (2010-2021)</p><p>The graph shows the annual incidence of hospitalizations for bipolar disorder per 100,000 person-years, with separate trends for males (blue line), females (red line), and the total population (green line). Female incidence rates are consistently higher than those of males across the entire period. The total incidence follows a similar trend to females, reflecting their predominant contribution. A notable peak is observed in 2019, followed by a decline in subsequent years. These trends provide insights into sex-based differences in hospitalization rates for bipolar disorder over time.</p><p>Fig 2. Distribution of Bipolar disorder hospital admission by age (total, female and male)</p><p>The histograms show the number of hospitalized cases across age groups for the total population (bottom), females (top-left), and males (top-right). All distributions demonstrate a peak in hospitalization rates among individuals aged 20&#x02013;40 years, with a gradual decline in older age groups. The female distribution shows a slightly higher number of cases compared to males, particularly in younger and middle-aged groups, reflecting sex-based differences in hospital admissions for bipolar disorder.</p><p>Fig 3. Spatial clusters of bipolar disorder in Ecuador.</p><p>This figure illustrates spatial clusters of bipolar disorder incidences across Ecuador, identifying regions with significantly higher or lower incidence rates. Clusters were determined using SaTScan, based on data from 2010-2021. Single cluster cantons with statistically significant clusters are marked in red dots for high-incidence clusters, grey circles describe high incidence larger areas including more than one single canton cluster. The shape files used in this figure for province and cantonal borders were obtained from the INEC portal ( <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/documentos/web-" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/documentos/web-</ext-link> inec/Geografia_Estadistica/Micrositio_geoportal/index.html ).

Title and Introduction:</p><p>* Title: The title is clear and reflects the paper&#x02019;s content, but it could be made more concise and engaging.</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The new title is: &#x0201c;Trends, Geographic Distribution, and Disease Burden of Bipolar Disorder in Ecuador (2011&#x02013;2021): An Analysis of Hospital Discharge Data.&#x0201d;</p><p>* Introduction: The introduction provides a good background on bipolar disorder and highlights the knowledge gap, but more emphasis on previous local studies would strengthen the rationale for the research.</p><p>* Suggestions:</p><p>- Add a short paragraph about the economic impact of bipolar disorder in Latin America to bolster the study&#x02019;s justification.</p><p>Thank you for your comment. We included a substantial paragraph regarding the economic impact of bipolar disorder in Latin America in the introduction.</p><p>- Incorporate more up-to-date references to support the background.</p><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have carefully reviewed and updated the references in the manuscript, replacing outdated sources with more recent and relevant studies (from reference 3 to 13). The revised references provide up-to-date support for the background.</p><p>2. Methods:</p><p>* The methods are well-documented, but there is limited discussion about how differences between public and private hospital records were handled.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this omission out. We have now provided a more complete description of the public and private institutions and how they have been determined through the data set. For ease of reference, the addition is: &#x0201c;The database provided details of the sources of hospital record information categorized by the type of institution. The public sources listed include Seguro Social (Social Security), the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social (Ecuadorian Social Security Institute), the Junta de Beneficencia de Guayaquil (Guayaquil Charitable Board), the Ministerio de Defensa Nacional (Ministry of National Defense), the Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n (Ministry of Education), the Ministerio de Gobierno y Polic&#x000ed;a (Ministry of Government and Police), the Ministerio de Justicia y de Gobierno y Polic&#x000ed;a (Ministry of Justice and Government and Police), the Ministerio de Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Cultos (Ministry of Justice, Human Rights, and Worship), the Ministerio de Salud P&#x000fa;blica (Ministry of Public Health), municipalities, other public institutions, Seguro Campesino (Rural Social Security), and universities and polytechnic schools. The private sources are grouped into two categories: private institutions for profit and private institutions not for profit&#x0201d;.</p><p>*No adjustment for other demographic factors like social class or education was mentioned.</p><p>* Suggestions:</p><p>- Include a deeper analysis of additional factors like geographic region or socioeconomic status to provide a more comprehensive view.</p><p>We agree that a more profound analysis of the intersection of socio-economic factors with the cost and distribution of bipolar disorder would be a very useful contribution to the literature, and more particularly to those involved in policy-making. Unfortunately, the hospital record data available do not contain information on relevant socio-economic variables such as income, education, family structure etc. It does link hospital records to geographic regions, however, and we have included a geographic analysis of the epidemiological burden of disease of bipolar disorder in the paper. Despite identifying statistically significant spatial clusters, no clear pattern attributable to socioeconomic factors was observed. The clusters were located in distinct areas of the northern and southern highlands of Ecuador, which have highly heterogeneous socioeconomic characteristics, as well as in a coastal cluster within Ecuador's main port city. Therefore, any analysis on socioeconomic factors with the current data would be speculative and lack objectivity. However, identifying spatial clusters of bipolar disorder within the country is highly valuable, as they can serve as indicators for further research in the identified areas and highlight the need for geographically targeted interventions.</p><p>- Explain the steps taken to ensure the quality of hospital records and how repeated hospitalizations for the same patients were handled.</p><p>Additional information regarding policies that ensure data quality was added to the methods section. Unfortunately, as the hospital data records are anonymous, there is no way to control for repeated hospitalization. We noted this limitation in the methods section as well.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>* Suggestions:</p><p>- A comparative analysis with other Latin American countries would highlight regional differences.</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Given that the dataset did not have information about other Latin American countries, we could not conduct a comparison in the results section. However, a comparison with other countries in the region was added to the discussion section.</p><p>4. Discussion:</p><p>* The discussion touches on key findings, but it leans heavily on the statistics without sufficiently tying them to practical applications or health policy.</p><p>We appreciate your valuable feedback. In response to your suggestion, we have revised and adjusted the discussion section to strengthen the connection between the presented statistics and their potential practical applications, as well as their relevance to health policy. In this regard, we have included concrete examples that contextualize the data within practical scenarios and the design of public health policies. We hope these modifications enhance the integration between the statistical conclusions and their practical applicability.</p><p>- Strengthen the discussion by proposing specific public health interventions or policy recommendations based on the findings.</p><p>We appreciate your observation. To address your suggestion, we have expanded the discussion section by incorporating specific recommendations for public health interventions and policies based on the study's findings. We believe these additions enrich the content and strengthen the connection between the findings and their practical application.</p><p>- Elaborate more on the study&#x02019;s limitations and how future research could overcome them, such as improving hospital record systems.</p><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. The limitations section was expanded and enriched as per your suggestions.</p><p>5. plagiarism:</p><p>*Plagiarism Check Result: 38.14% (By Plagiarism Detector v. 2695)</p><p>(It is recommended to reduce this percentage as much as possible to ensure originality).</p><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the similarity percentage identified by Plagiarism Detector. Following your suggestion, we have carefully reviewed the manuscript and addressed the issue. A significant portion of the similarity arises from a preprint under review of another article on a related topic (Mascialino, G., Carrington, S. J., Coral-Almeida, M., &#x000c1;lvarez-Mej&#x000ed;a, D., Torres-Tapia, M. E., &#x00026; Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Lorenzana, A. (2023).

Additionally, affiliations, names of public institutions (e.g., &#x0201c;Instituto de Seguridad Social&#x0201d;), technical terms (e.g., &#x0201c;Years Lived with Disability&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Global Burden of Disease&#x0201d;), references and similar elements account for approximately 10% of the similarity index, which cannot be changed.</p><p>The remaining content has been thoroughly revised and adjusted to minimize overlap and ensure originality. We appreciate your attention to this matter and remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Burden of disease, incidence, and spatial distribution of bipolar disorder in Ecuador from 2011 to 2021 using hospital discharge records</p><p>Note Consider for revision:</p><p>Line 140:</p><p>A 3% discount rate was used. This is in line with the standard discounting practice.</p><p>As Ecuador is identified by the authors as a middle to low-income country, consider running the model with a second analysis using a 5% discount rate. This may affect the high contribution of YLDs to DALYs identified on line 243.</p><p>Thank you for your valuable insights and comments regarding the appropriate discount rate. This is indeed a crucial topic, as the choice of discount rate determines the intertemporal value assigned to health outcomes over time. Ultimately, it shapes the prioritization of health investments, especially in resource-scarce settings, and serves as a key tool for evaluating whether a particular intervention represents the best allocation of societal resources. For instance, comparing two distinct streams of costs and benefits over time requires the application of a well-justified discount rate to determine which option yields better returns for society.</p><p>We wholeheartedly agree with the importance of applying the correct discount rate to facilitate comparisons within a specific context, such as within a country where decisions between competing options are made. An overly high discount rate could lead to the rejection of socially desirable projects, while an exce</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0320321.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers (5).docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0320321.s006.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0320321.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0320321.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Athe</surname><given-names>Ramesh</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Ramesh Athe</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Ramesh Athe</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0320321" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
