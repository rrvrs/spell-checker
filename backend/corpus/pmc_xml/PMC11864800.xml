Japan, traditionally a homogeneous society, now faces a growing need to manage multicultural emergency scenarios. This study examines a mass casualty incident (MCI) predominantly involving foreign workers, highlighting the challenges and strategies for effective emergency care amid language and cultural barriers.</p><p>Methodology: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of emergency response management for an MCI involving 20 patients (18 foreign nationals and&#x000a0;two Japanese nationals) at a secondary emergency medical facility in Japan. Our protocol integrated a two-tier triage system (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment, followed by Physiological and Anatomical Triage) with a multicultural communication strategy.</p><p>Results: Initial triage categorized 17 patients as green (minor) and three as yellow (delayed), with two patients requiring subsequent reclassification from green to yellow. Assessment times for foreign nationals averaged significantly longer than those for Japanese patients (22.3 minutes vs. 12.5 minutes). Implementation of digital translation tools and multilingual medical cards effectively bridged communication gaps. The majority of patients (15/17) were successfully treated and discharged, while two required specialist referral. No fatalities or severe complications were recorded.</p><p>Conclusions: This case study emphasizes the significance of three critical components for the effective management of multicultural MCIs. First, dynamic triage protocols must be designed to accommodate language barriers, ensuring equitable and timely care for all patients. Second, the integration of advanced technological solutions for real-time medical translation is essential to bridge communication gaps and support clinical decision-making during emergencies. Finally, culturally competent emergency care systems are vital for addressing the specific needs of diverse patient populations and fostering trust in healthcare delivery. As workforce globalization continues to advance, these findings provide practical insights for emergency medical services adapting to the challenges of increasingly diverse populations. These results have particular relevance for developed nations experiencing demographic transitions through immigration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>acute trauma care</kwd><kwd>emergency medical service</kwd><kwd>emergency service</kwd><kwd>road traffic injuries</kwd><kwd>triage protocols</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Japan's aging population has led to an increased reliance on foreign workers, presenting unique challenges in emergency medical care [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

For this wave, additional staff were mobilized to enhance capacity. The response team for the second wave included twenty doctors, fifteen nurses, and ten administrative staff. This increased workforce allowed for comprehensive care delivery despite the higher clinical complexity of this group. Examination of injury patterns revealed a consistent trauma distribution reflective of the accident mechanism. Anterior-oriented injuries predominated, with facial trauma observed in eight patients and lower extremity injuries documented in twelve cases. Oral and dental trauma occurred in four patients, correlating with the impact dynamics of the collision.</p><p>Emergency response timeline</p><p>Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> presents the chronological progression of the emergency response, highlighting key decision points and interventions.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Timeline of the emergency response.</title><p>This timeline outlines the key events of the emergency response following the mass casualty incident. The timeline includes the occurrence of the incident (6:30 AM), the initial emergency call (7:20 AM), the arrival of the first patient wave (7:35 AM), the arrival of the second wave (8:10 AM), and the completion of triage and operations (11:05 AM). Changes in triage status (green to yellow) and key interventions are also highlighted.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078084-i03" position="float"/></fig><p>During the initial triage, administrative staff recorded patient information, including ID, name, and date of birth, into the electronic medical record system (Fujitsu, Tokyo, Japan). Nurses and resident physicians conducted patient interviews, while orthopedic surgeons, general surgeons, emergency physicians, and internists collaborated to examine patients and prioritize diagnostics and treatments for those with higher severity.</p><p>The timeline also demonstrates the dynamic nature of the response, including triage category modifications and the implementation of infection control measures. Patient flow was managed using a large whiteboard in the emergency department, with updates recorded in real-time using markers for tracking.</p><p>Communication process and assessment dynamics</p><p>Implementation of the multi-modal communication strategy revealed notable differences in assessment durations between foreign and Japanese nationals. Assessment times for foreign patients averaged 22.3 minutes, compared to approximately 12.5 minutes for Japanese patients. This difference was attributed to several factors, including&#x000a0;the need for name transcription into katakana,&#x000a0;additional documentation requirements for foreign nationals, and complexities in multi-language medical communication. To address these challenges, staff used POCKETALK, a Japanese AI-powered translation device (Sourcenext Corporation, Tokyo). Emergency department nurses and administrative staff had received prior training on using the translation device and multilingual communication aids, ensuring efficient operation during the response.</p><p>Clinical management and outcomes</p><p>Patient management strategies were tailored to injury patterns and clinical presentations. The majority of patients (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>= 15) received treatment and achieved discharge criteria during the initial assessment period. Two patients required specialist referral, including one case of mandibular trauma.</p><p>The detection of influenza A in one patient necessitated the implementation of isolation protocols, demonstrating the facility's capacity to manage concurrent medical conditions during a mass casualty response. Data were recorded in the electronic medical record system (Fujitsu) and later analyzed for insights into patient flow and resource utilization.</p><p>Implementation of systematic disaster response training</p><p>The experiences and challenges encountered during this MCI informed the development of a comprehensive disaster response training program. On February 17, 2024, our facility conducted an extensive disaster drill specifically designed to address the complexities of managing multilingual mass casualty scenarios. The training exercise incorporated both technical and cultural aspects of emergency response, with particular emphasis on communication challenges identified during the actual incident.</p><p>The drill scenario simulated a mass casualty event involving twenty mock patients, deliberately mirroring the demographic composition of the January incident. Initial triage was conducted using the START method, followed by secondary assessment using the PAT method, allowing participants to practice both protocols under time-constrained conditions. Simulated patients were recruited from local international communities and instructed to present with varying levels of English and Japanese language proficiency, creating realistic communication challenges.</p><p>The exercise implemented a structured communication protocol integrating electronic translation devices, multilingual medical cards, and pictorial communication tools. Medical staff practiced rapid patient registration techniques while maintaining accurate documentation in multiple languages. The simulation particularly focused on the critical first 30 minutes of mass casualty response, during which accurate triage and effective communication are paramount.</p><p>Comprehensive patient flow management protocols were tested, including the establishment of separate treatment zones based on triage categories and the implementation of a color-coded routing system to facilitate patient movement between departments. The exercise incorporated dynamic scenario progression, requiring participants to adapt to evolving patient conditions and modify triage categories accordingly. This approach specifically addressed the observation from the actual incident where two patients required triage category modification.</p><p>The real-time evaluation was conducted by experienced emergency medicine specialists who documented team performance metrics and communication efficiency. The exercise revealed several areas for protocol refinement, particularly in the initial registration process for foreign patients and the coordination of interpreter services. Observer feedback highlighted the need for expanded cultural competency training and standardization of multilingual documentation procedures.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates key components of the training exercise, with Panel A showing the systematic organization of the triage station and patient registration area and Panel B demonstrating the treatment area configuration and patient flow patterns.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Mass casualty incident response training.</title><p>This figure depicts the disaster drill conducted on February 17, 2024, at Fukuoka Seisyukai Hospital.

Our experience provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for improvement in disaster medicine protocols, particularly in regions experiencing demographic transitions [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The dynamic nature of triage decisions in this incident merits particular attention. The reclassification of two patients from green to yellow category demonstrates the limitations of initial START triage in scenarios involving language barriers [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first case involved a female patient with mandibular trauma who, despite being ambulatory, was later found to have injuries requiring specialist intervention. The second case, involving the bus driver, illustrated how concurrent medical conditions can complicate trauma assessment. These observations align with Jenkins et al.'s findings regarding the significance of continuous reassessment in mass casualty triage, particularly when communication barriers exist [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The complexity of emergency triage in multilingual settings has been well documented by Pun et al.&#x02019;s paper, which emphasizes the need for structured assessment protocols [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The influence of sociocultural factors on emergency medical care emerged as a significant theme in our analysis. The observed 9.8-minute difference in assessment times between foreign and Japanese patients reflects the complex interplay between language barriers and clinical evaluation. This finding corresponds with Flores' systematic review, which demonstrated how language barriers can significantly impact healthcare delivery timing and quality [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Language barriers and resource utilization studies have shown extended emergency department stays and increased resource requirements for patients with limited language proficiency [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The successful implementation of electronic translation devices and multilingual medical cards represents a practical application of Diamond et al.'s recommendations for culturally appropriate emergency services [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This approach aligns with research on interpreter use in pediatric emergency departments [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which emphasizes the importance of structured communication protocols in multilingual emergency settings. Studies of medical interpreters in triage during mass-gathering incidents have demonstrated the vital role of language support systems in emergency care [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>However, simultaneous disasters pose unique challenges, particularly in ensuring effective linguistic support for injured foreign nationals. Real-time communication may be hindered by the limited availability of translation devices or trained interpreters during large-scale emergencies. Future research should focus on scalable solutions, such as integrating AI-driven translation systems with centralized linguistic support hubs, to address these challenges. Additionally, improving cultural competency training for emergency staff could enhance their ability to listen actively and respond empathetically to foreign patients&#x02019; needs, even in high-pressure scenarios.</p><p>Our experience with distributed treatment areas revealed both advantages and challenges in mass casualty management. This dual-zone approach required additional coordination efforts, particularly for non-Japanese-speaking patients [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent studies on emergency department length of stay and utilization associated with primary language have highlighted the importance of efficient patient flow management [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The integration of infection control measures with trauma care protocols demonstrated our facility's ability to manage complex medical scenarios while maintaining standard precautions, as recommended by Hick et al. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The incident highlighted the importance of regional emergency medical coordination, particularly for facilities serving diverse populations. Research has shown that perceptions of prehospital care for patients with limited language proficiency significantly influence emergency medical service delivery [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our findings support Karliner et al.'s research showing that professional interpreters can improve clinical care efficiency [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The successful integration of various communication strategies reflects contemporary best practices in emergency medicine.</p><p>The subsequent implementation of a comprehensive disaster drill, incorporating lessons learned from this incident, represents a crucial step toward systematic improvement. The drill's focus on multilingual scenarios and cultural competency aligns with Idrose et al.'s recommendations for simulation-based disaster response training [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This approach to preparedness reflects an evolution in emergency medicine practice, acknowledging the growing importance of cultural and linguistic competency in healthcare delivery.</p><p>Our study has several limitations as a single-center experience, with findings that may not be fully generalizable to facilities with different demographic profiles or resource availability. Also, our study's findings are based on a relatively homogeneous group of foreign nationals, with the majority being from Nepal. This limitation reflects the specific demographic characteristics of the incident and the local population distribution. Consequently, the results may not fully capture the challenges and needs associated with more diverse foreign populations. The relatively small sample size limits statistical analysis of outcome measures, and the specific cultural and linguistic background of our patient population may not represent the full spectrum of challenges faced by other institutions.&#x000a0;Future studies should aim to include a broader range of nationalities to improve generalizability and address varying cultural and linguistic needs.</p><p>The longer assessment times for foreign patients highlighted in this study underscore the need for enhanced multilingual support systems. Specifically, improving the efficiency of translation tools, streamlining documentation processes for foreign nationals, and standardizing multilingual triage protocols are critical steps. Future disaster drills should incorporate scenarios reflecting these challenges to train staff in handling such complexities under time constraints.</p><p>Looking to the future, our experience suggests the necessity of enhancing translation services and multilingual medical documentation, developing cultural competency training programs, and modifying triage protocols. These recommendations align closely with the observed challenges and are intended to provide actionable strategies for hospitals facing similar scenarios. The establishment of integrated regional emergency medical networks specifically equipped to handle MCIs involving foreign nationals will become increasingly crucial as Japan's demographic landscape continues to evolve.</p><p>To support broader applicability, we recommend that other hospitals consider tailoring these strategies to their unique demographic and resource contexts. For example, institutions in areas with high concentrations of foreign workers could prioritize recruiting multilingual staff, establishing centralized linguistic support hubs, or investing in AI-driven translation devices. These measures can help bridge the gap between current capabilities and the growing demand for culturally and linguistically competent emergency medical care.</p><p>These developments must occur within the context of existing emergency medical systems while maintaining the highest standards of patient care and safety [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>These insights and recommendations from our experience have particular relevance given Japan's growing foreign worker population and the increasing likelihood of similar incidents in the future. The successful management of this case, despite identified challenges, provides a valuable template for other secondary emergency facilities adapting to demographic changes in contemporary Japanese society.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This MCI predominantly involving foreign workers revealed several critical insights. The importance of dynamic triage was demonstrated through the reclassification of two patients, highlighting the necessity for continuous reassessment, particularly in scenarios where language barriers exist. Although electronic translation devices proved helpful in overcoming communication challenges, the prolonged assessment times for foreign patients underscored the need for more efficient multilingual support systems. Additionally, the experience emphasized the value of structured protocols tailored to managing multicultural patient groups in emergency settings.</p><p>Based on these findings, we recommend the implementation of standardized multilingual triage protocols and the establishment of dedicated language support systems within emergency departments. Furthermore, regular disaster drills incorporating scenarios involving foreign patients should be conducted to better prepare for such incidents. As Japan's foreign worker population continues to grow, these adaptations will be essential for ensuring effective and equitable emergency medical care.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the emergency medical services personnel, hospital staff, and interpreters who participated in this mass casualty response.
