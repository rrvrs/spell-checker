In India, the annual incidence of osteoporotic hip fractures is expected to increase due to the growing geriatric population. The choice of fixation for these fractures remains contentious, with proximal femoral nail (PFN) emerging as a preferred option due to its biomechanical advantages. This study evaluates the outcomes of long and short PFN in managing intertrochanteric fractures, focusing on anterior thigh pain and functional outcomes.</p><p>Method</p><p>A retrospective study was conducted on 100 patients treated with long PFN (n=50) or short PFN (n=50) at MAX Super Specialty Hospital, New Delhi, from January 2020 to December 2021. Data from medical records and radiographs were analyzed for fracture union, anterior thigh pain (Visual Analog&#x000a0;Scale&#x000a0;(VAS) score, Verbal Rating Scale), and functional outcomes (Harris Hip Score).

Further studies with longer follow-up durations are recommended to validate these findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>anterior thigh pain</kwd><kwd>functional outcome</kwd><kwd>intetrochanteric fracture</kwd><kwd>long pfn</kwd><kwd>short pfn</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among one of the many important existing public health problems is the fractures of the hip. Hip treatment consumes a major fraction of healthcare expenditure. There has been two-three times increase in the incidence of hip fractures, particularly in Asia. It has been estimated to rise from 1.66 million in 1990 to 6.26 million in 2050 [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2004, a report on India estimated the annual incidence of approximately 0.6 million osteoporotic hip fractures, which is expected to increase significantly by 2026, due to improvement in the life expectancy of the geriatric population [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The frequency of hip fractures is increasing with age and the physically active population. Proximal femur fractures are a common group of injuries with a bimodal age distribution in elderly patients as a result of low-energy trauma or in younger patients as a result of high-energy trauma. The trochanteric fractures are constantly on the rise because of the increasing number of senior citizens with osteoporosis [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Intertrochanteric femur fractures account for 45% to 50% of fractures around the hip joint in elderly patients [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Recent data from the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) for the year 2023 indicate a 7% increase in the incidence of hip fractures, rising to 72,160 cases from an approximate range of 66,000 to 67,000 cases reported in the year 2020 and the pre-pandemic era. This upward trajectory is projected to persist, owing to demographic shifts characterized by increased life expectancy and an escalating prevalence of frailty and medical complexity within the population [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>There are various modalities available for the internal fixation of these fractures. These fractures can be successfully treated with various types of fixations-intra-medullary or extra-medullary devices, sliding hip screws, blade plates, and cephalo-medullary nails (CMN) [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there is yet to decide upon the ideal implant for fixation of these fractures with different surgeons preferring different implants. The proximal femoral nail has emerged as a favored implant among surgeons given its better biomechanical properties. This intramedullary device along with providing more stability with a shorter lever arm, also shares more loading force and has less chance of collapsing after fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures.</p><p>While biomechanically advantageous in many ways, their use has not been without complications. There has been debate in the literature as to the optimal length of intramedullary nails. Short nails offer the advantages of shorter operative times, reduced blood loss, and lower transfusion rates. Conversely, long nails offer the theoretical benefit of protecting the full length of the femur, particularly in elderly patients with osteoporotic or osteopenic bones, thus potentially decreasing the secondary femoral shaft re-fracture rate.</p><p>An important and commonly occurring post-operative complaint of patients surgically managed with CMNs is anterior thigh pain. We believe that the use of long nails with or without a distal lock will reduce the incidence of thigh pain without affecting or changing the outcome of the fracture union.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A retrospective study was performed in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, MAX Super Specialty Hospital, Shalimar Bag, New Delhi. All patients operated over two years with a minimum of six months follow-up from January 2020 to December 2021 were included in the study. All patients of more than 16 years of age presenting to our emergency with intertrochanteric fracture managed using Proximal femoral Nailing with radiographically confirmed union with a minimum follow-up of six months were included in the study. Patients having compound fractures, neglected inter-trochanteric fractures, fracture non-union, fracture malunion, pathological fractures, facture greater than three weeks old, polytrauma patients and patients not consenting to the study were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were either operated using long or short PFN based on surgeon preference. A total of 113 patients were operated during the period but only 100 patients were on regular follow up with us. Of these, 50 patients were in the long PFN group, and 50 patients were in the short PFN group.</p><p>Medical records of these patients were analyzed, and demographic data and surgical details were retrieved.&#x000a0;Radiographs at the presentation and six-month follow-up were retrieved for all the patients. Radiographs were assessed for Union; Femoral canal impingement; Varus collapse; Cut through of proximal screws; Screw penetration and Screw back out. Patients were followed up in the outpatient department at intervals of two weeks, six weeks, three months, and six months. At the six-month visit, patients were evaluated for anterior thigh pain using the Visual Analog&#x000a0;Scale&#x000a0;(VAS) score and verbal rating scale. The functional status of the patients was evaluated using the Harris Hip Score (HHS).&#x000a0;The primary outcome of our study was to analyze for anterior thigh pain in patients operated using long and short PFN and secondarily implant complications were looked at to identify any association with the same.</p><p>Data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS v23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive data were reported for each variable. Summarized data were presented using tables and graphs. Data were normally distributed as tested using the Shapiro-Wilk W test (p-value was less than 0.05). Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparison of VAS scores and hip scores. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables. A level of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

PFN has been the preferred implant of many orthopedic surgeons. PFN A was introduced in 2004 by the AO/OTA group. However, soon it was observed that the Asian population had different needs due to short stature and increased femoral anterior bow caused by increasing varus and osteoporosis commonly observed in the Asian old. This led to the development of the PFN A2 keeping in mind the special needs of the Asian populace. However, still short PFNA2 implants though come in varying sizes from 170 mm to 240 mm [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are mainly straight and lack an anterior bow&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There has been an ongoing debate about whether a longer nail is better or a shorter one. Short nails require less operative time and have significantly less blood loss. Similar findings were observed in our study and have also been observed by Krishnan et al. [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Li&#x000a0;et al. [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We operated on a total of 100 patients with 50 patients in each group. The mean age of the patients in the short and long PFN groups were 58.9+_8.12 and 57.9+_8.94, respectively, with no significant difference though our population was on the younger side compared to the groups evaluated by Krishnan et al. [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Li et al. [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our study found that 18% of patients in the short PFN group had a VAS score of more than 3 while in the long PFN group, it was observed in only 2% of the population while 98% had a pain score of less than 3.&#x000a0;The mean VAS score&#x000a0;of the short PFN group was 2.26 &#x000b1; 1.42, while the&#x000a0;long PFN group had a mean VAS score&#x000a0;of 1.68 &#x000b1; 0.91 (p=0.017), which was significantly less. This is in agreement with that of Rao et al. [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], Parmar et al. [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and Krishnan et al. [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who found similar findings in their study. Also, Li et al. [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] mentioned in their study that thigh pains are induced by doing gamma nail fixation, which was considered to be relative to the squeeze of the nail to the femoral cortex or the irritation of the iliotibial. They further stated that three patients in whom long nails were placed can relieve themselves and it will not affect their routine life. In total, thirteen cases of thigh pain were induced by using the short nails. From 11 patients' intramedullary nails were removed to relieve pain, and medication was used for the remaining two.</p><p>Hwang et al. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] favored long over the shorter PFNA nail especially when there is excessive anterior curvature of the femur, as there is a geometrical mismatch between the ante curvature of the femur and the contemporary intramedullary nails, which causes technical difficulties.&#x000a0;Mukherjee et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] observed that the short PFN nails introduced in India lacked curvature and had a mismatch in the nail curvature and the femoral curvature. This caused an abutment of the nail tip with the anterior cortex resulting in anterior thigh pain. They evaluated 80 patients operated using various sizes of short PFN nails, it was observed that patients with a nail tip position of 0-2 had less anterior thigh pain compared to those with a&#x000a0;nail tip position of 3-5&#x000a0;(p=0.001). It was also observed that patients operated on with a nail of thinner diameter had significantly less anterior thigh pain (p=0.01). This may be attributed to the fact that thinner nails had less abutment of the anterior cortex and were more centralized in the canal compared to thicker ones. Our study also found four cases of anterior cortical abutment all of which were in the short PFN group; however, none of them had a VAS score of greater than 3. This may be explained by the short duration of follow-up in our group.</p><p>However, it was interesting to note that in spite of patients who operated with a short PFN having significantly more anterior thigh pain, there was no difference observed between the HHS of the two groups&#x000a0;(p=0.436). Similar findings were also observed by Krishnan et al. [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] where both groups had good to excellent outcomes. In contrast, Rao et al. [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported a short PFN group had a better functional outcome.</p><p>The choice of the nail is guided by surgeon preference instead of evidence, however, as our observations stand, a longer PFN would be a better choice of implant in the Indian subcontinent as the general populace has a shorter stature and more bowed femur, resulting in higher incidence of anterior cortical abutment which is considered to be a prime reason for anterior thigh pain. Though there was no incidence of peri-prosthetic fracture in our group, it may be due to two short follow-up durations. However, it has been observed that shorter nails are more prone to periprosthetic fractures and one of the prime reasons why long nails were introduced was to avoid this complication. However, further studies are necessary to validate our results.</p><p>Our study was limited by a smaller sample size, heterogenous population, and short follow up though we plan to continue to follow up with these patients to identify long-term results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We can conclude from our study that though functionally both short and long PFN nails have similar outcomes for the Indian diaspora, a long nail is a better option given its lower incidence of anterior thigh pain and lesser risk of periprosthetic fractures. However, longer nails are limited by more operative time and more blood loss.
