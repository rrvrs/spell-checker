Telehealth is the provision of healthcare that is provided remotely through telecommunication technology, and virtual supervision is clinical supervision of health professions trainees (HPTs) that occurs through telecommunication technology. In this study we evaluate participation in telehealth and virtual supervision for physician, nursing, and associated health HPTs, and describe prevalent themes concerning HPT perceptions of telehealth and virtual supervision.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The survey study cohort included 10,865 HPTs that responded to the VA Trainee Satisfaction Survey in Academic Year 2023 (between July 2022 to June 2023).

Healthcare trends, including advanced technology and the need for increased healthcare access fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, have accelerated the adoption of telehealth and virtual supervision, including in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Technological challenges were frequently associated with negative views of virtual supervision including interruptions in internet connectivity, telephone or video connections, and software issues. Common modalities mentioned included Microsoft Teams, VA Video Connect (VVC), and phone. Additionally, the supervisor-supervisee relationship played an integral role in shaping the virtual supervision experience evidenced by the recurring theme of faculty supervisor traits e.g. accessibility, supervision style influencing the virtual supervision experience. HPTs often commented about faculty supervisors&#x02019; traits including supportiveness, resourcefulness, effective communication skills, kindness and attentiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Representative comments of virtual supervision influenced by technology</title><p id="Par37">

Virtual supervision allowed me to effectively engage in a major rotation during half of a day and engage in my minor rotation the other half of the day. Based on the way patient care fell (i.e., group schedules, appointment times), it would have been difficult to attend all of these as they are across the medical center campus. Virtual supervision truly streamlined my internship. &#x02013; Psychologist HPT</p><p id="Par45">&#x0201c;Value of virtual supervision varied by supervisor and often matched their in-person supervision style; if they were conscientious in person, that remained in remote format, if not, that was also true for both formats.&#x0201d; &#x02013; Psychologist HPT</p><p id="Par46">&#x0201c;It was a nice change of pace my preceptor was amazing and so kind and welcoming.&#x0201d; &#x02013; Nurse HPT</p><p id="Par47">&#x0201c;Dr. R was ABSOLUTELY amazing.

Frequency ranged from occasional sessions in special circumstances to weekly sessions where almost all supervision was conducted virtually. For physician HPTs, virtual supervision most occurred within specific rotations utilizing telehealth clinics, such as dermatology, psychiatry, and stroke care. Pharmacy and nursing HPTs experienced virtual supervision during specific clinic rotations such as anticoagulation and ambulatory care, whereas psychology and social work HPTs received virtual supervision during cognitive behavioral therapy training experiences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Representative comments of virtual supervision influenced by amount of time spent in virtual supervision</title><p id="Par50">

The distribution of HPT professions in the sample was not significantly different from the percent of VA-funded HPTs nationally. Respondents represented 133 VA facilities reflecting the geographic diversity of the VA system.</p><p id="Par55">In the overall sample, approximately one-third reported participating in telehealth and one-fourth in virtual supervision, with statistically significant differences by profession. The literature documents differences in telehealth use and virtual supervision by profession, and furthermore between specialties within a profession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Primary care physicians and nurse practitioners may use telehealth to manage chronic disease and provide follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], whereas psychiatrists may use telehealth for consultation and diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Other factors influencing telehealth use and cited in the literature include reimbursement issues, lack of training, technology issues, and concerns about privacy and quality of care. Reimbursement issues do not apply in the VA training environment but HPTs in our study did identify technology and supervisor traits as prevalent themes shaping perceptions of these practices within the context of the training environment. A notable theme in our study is that soft personality skills e.g. kindness, availability, supportiveness are important supervisory traits for virtual supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Musharyanti (2024) found that these soft skills and the amount of attention, recognition, appreciation and flexibility provided by clinical supervisors are important to the success of clinical education for nursing students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Future work could address personality traits and behaviors shaping the supervisor-supervisee relationship across health care professions and their impact on the effectiveness of teaching in the virtual environment.</p><p id="Par56">The pandemic drastically shifted healthcare delivery towards virtual visits. A national study of 36 million working-age individuals with private insurance claims data showed that the percentage of telemedicine encounters increased from 0.3% of all encounters (pre-pandemic) to 23.6% of all encounters (first year of the pandemic) resulting in an overall increased utilization of telemedicine by 766% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Post-pandemic, telehealth usage remains steady [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As healthcare pivots towards virtual visits, our findings of positive perceptions by HPTs and supervisors promote its enduring relevance in the VA healthcare environment.</p><p id="Par57">The strengths of this study include its large sample size, the inclusion of multiple HPT professions and the diversity of training experiences, which together provide a more comprehensive view of HPT involvement in telehealth and virtual supervision for the largest clinical training environment in the U.S. Study weaknesses include the low estimated overall response rate on the survey and the limited generalizability to all HPTs. The TSS was designed to measure satisfaction across multiple trainee experiences, but not all virtual supervision responses correlated with the TSS open-ended question, requiring unclear responses to be screened out of the sample. Soliciting more targeted feedback through a comprehensive instrument could enhance understanding of how to best structure telehealth and virtual supervision practices for HPTs to maximize educational quality and patient outcomes. A comprehensive instrument could also delve deeper into the type of telemedicine visit (audio vs video), how they are used by different HPT professions, and their impacts on virtual supervision practices.</p><p id="Par58">To ensure the highest quality of care and education, further study is required related to the best balance of telehealth, virtual supervision and traditional models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
