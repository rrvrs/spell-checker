gliding assays provide a unique mechanism for molecular
detection in which binding of analytes to the microtubule lattice
reduces the microtubule gliding speed. The reduction in the gliding
speed correlates with the density of the bound analytes, enabling
its quantification. Although promising, this technique is still in
the proof-of-concept stage. Improving the sensitivity and limit of
detection of the assay could make the technique comparable to that
of advanced molecular detection methods. This study demonstrates that
reducing the ionic strength of the buffer increases the sensitivity
of the assay by enhancing the interactions between kinesin and microtubules.
When using a low ionic strength buffer (BRB10) compared with a standard
buffer (BRB80), we observed a more pronounced reduction in microtubule
gliding speed in the presence of analytes, improving the detection
limit. Therefore, this approach offers a simple and scalable way to
improve the sensitivity of motor-based detection assays.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic xlink:href="nl5c01188_0007.jpg" position="float"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic xlink:href="nl5c01188_0006.jpg" position="float"/></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Point-of-care diagnostics</kwd><kwd>Molecular detection</kwd><kwd>Assay sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Gliding motility assay</kwd><kwd>Kinesin</kwd><kwd>Microtubule</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-1"><funding-source>

</named-content> Among these applications, the detection of biomolecules
based on kinesin driven microtubules has emerged as a promising approach
that can be used at the point-of-care.</p><p>The molecular detection
method utilizes a gliding motility scheme,
where the target analytes bind to the microtubule lattice, usually
via antibody&#x02013;antigen interactions. When analytes are bound
to the microtubule surface, they act as obstacles that impede the
kinesin motors that propel the microtubules, until the motor either
bypasses the obstacle or detaches from the microtubule lattice. This
phenomenon, known as the roadblock effect, results in a reduction
of microtubule gliding speed. Since the degree of speed reduction
correlates with the density of bound analytes, the concentration of
analytes in solution can be quantified from the microtubule gliding
speeds.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/> This approach can be adapted
to detect a wide range of analytes by functionalizing the microtubule
lattice with receptor molecules, such as full antibodies, Fab fragments,
or short peptides. Previous studies have demonstrated its applicability
to analytes of varying sizes and shapes, for example, the detection
of creatine kinase,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/> streptavidin, neutravidin,
avidin, and antibodies<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

</named-content> Furthermore, the compatibility
of the assay with complex biological fluids, such as whole blood and
cell lysates, has been demonstrated.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> Despite
their potential, molecular motor-based detection systems remain in
the proof-of-concept stage. While the assay offers several advantages
over conventional techniques like ELISA including rapid detection,
ease of use, and potential for point-of-care applications, the sensitivity
of the assay is currently comparable to existing point-of-care methods
such as lateral flow assays.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

</p><p>Improving the
sensitivity and detection limit would expand the
usage of roadblock assays in diagnostics that require precise quantification
and detection of low analyte concentrations. The slope of the decrease
in velocity with respect to the analyte concentration can be used
as a measure of the sensitivity of these assays. An increase in the
sensitivity would result in a more pronounced decrease in the microtubule
gliding speed when the analytes bind to the microtubule lattice. The
detection limit can be measured as the minimum analyte concentration
that causes a measurable decrease in gliding speed. Enhancing the
sensitivity and detection limit could make the motor-based detection
method compete with advanced state-of-the-art detection methods like
ELISA and bio barcoding assay.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

</named-content> Despite a strong need to explore
and develop strategies that could increase the sensitivity of these
assays, to date, there have been only scarce efforts.</p><p>In this
work, we tested if enhancing the affinity between kinesin
and microtubules could amplify the roadblock effect, as the motors
facing an obstacle would remain bound to the microtubule longer, slowing
the microtubule gliding speed more profoundly. Given that kinesin-microtubule
binding is dominated by electrostatic interaction,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"/> we expected that modifying buffer conditions, i.e. reducing
the salt concentration, will enhance the affinity between kinesin
and microtubules.</p><p>We thus investigated how the reduced ionic
strength affects kinesin-microtubule
interactions and assay sensitivity. We performed gliding motility
assays and single-molecule stepping assays in standard BRB80 buffer
and reduced ionic strength buffer. In gliding motility assays, we
observed the movement of microtubules propelled by kinesin motors,
and in stepping assays we tracked the motion of single GFP-labeled
kinesin motors along immobilized microtubules. This provided insights
into how the ionic strengths of the buffers used in this study affect
kinesin dynamics in a collective and at the single-molecule level.
Under reduced ionic strength conditions, we observed an increase in
kinesin-microtubule affinity evident from the slower gliding speed
in the microtubule gliding assay along with reduction in stepping
velocity and increase in run length and residence time of kinesin
motors in stepping assays as compared to standard BRB80 buffer. We
then evaluated how ionic strength impacts the sensitivity of the roadblock
assay. We observed a more pronounced reduction in the microtubule
gliding speed in the presence of analytes under low ionic strength
conditions.</p><p>To investigate the impact of low ionic strength
conditions on microtubule
motility, we performed gliding motility assays comparing standard
BRB80 buffer (ionic strength: 184 mM; see <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01188/suppl_file/nl5c01188_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Methods</ext-link> for calculations) with low ionic strength BRB10 buffer (ionic strength:
28.85 mM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A). The BRB10 buffer had a 6-fold reduction in ionic strength relative
to the BRB80 buffer, providing a substantially altered electrostatic
environment for kinesin-microtubule interactions. Microtubule gliding
motility was monitored over a period of 30 minutes in both buffers,
which were supplemented with 10 &#x003bc;M taxol, 2 mM MgATP and antifade
agents. The microtubules exhibited consistent gliding under both buffer
conditions throughout the observed period, although significant differences
in gliding speed were observed between the two buffers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B). The microtubule gliding
speeds were calculated from microscopy images as frame-to-frame velocities
using MATLAB (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01188/suppl_file/nl5c01188_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). In BRB80 buffer, the gliding speed was 594 &#x000b1; 46 nm/s (median
&#x000b1; interquartile range, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 477 microtubules)
whereas the speed decreased to 497 &#x000b1; 49 nm/s in BRB10 buffer
(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 373 microtubules). To assess the reversibility
of this slowdown effect, we switched buffer conditions within the
same flow channel, sequentially from BRB80 to BRB10 and then back
to BRB80. Under initial BRB80 conditions, microtubule gliding velocity
was 606 &#x000b1; 44 nm/s (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 274 microtubules). Upon
replacing BRB80 with BRB10, the velocity decreased to 494 &#x000b1; 38
nm/s (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 424 microtubules). And after switching
back to BRB80, the velocity increased again to 622 &#x000b1; 39 nm/s
(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 368 microtubules) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C). These findings confirm that the reduction
in microtubule gliding speed under low ionic strength conditions (BRB10)
is completely reversible, and kinesin motors remain fully functional.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" fig-type="figure"><label>1</label><caption><p>Impact

effect of reduced ionic strength on the kinesin-microtubule
interaction at single molecule level, we performed kinesin steppings
assay under both buffer conditions. Alexa647-labeled microtubules
were immobilized on the surface using anti-&#x003b2;-tubulin antibodies,
and the motion of individual GFP-labeled kinesin-1 motors was tracked
with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A). The experiments
were performed at a controlled temperature of 28 &#x000b0;C. The temperature
was maintained by using an objective heater. Our findings revealed
a significant increase in the run length of kinesin motors in low
ionic strength conditions, as shown in the space-time kymographs and
cumulative distribution frequency plots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B,C). In BRB80 buffer, the average run length
was 951 &#x000b1; 188 nm (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 114), whereas it increased to 2260 &#x000b1; 382 nm (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 116) in BRB10 buffer. Additionally, the interaction time of kinesin
motors with microtubules was increased under low ionic strength conditions
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>D). In BRB80
buffer, the average interaction time was 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.2 s (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 114), which increased to 3.4 &#x000b1; 0.6 s (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 116) in BRB10 buffer. These results align with the enhanced run
lengths observed in BRB10 and indicate a stronger kinesin-microtubule
interaction under reduced ionic strength. Consistent with our gliding
motility assays, the stepping velocity of the kinesin motors was reduced
under low ionic strength conditions. In BRB80 buffer, the stepping
velocity was 904 &#x000b1; 46 nm/s, whereas in BRB10, it decreased to
660 &#x000b1; 21 nm/s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>E,F). These findings are consistent with previous reports<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"/> and strongly support the notion that the reduced
ionic strength buffer used in this study enhances the kinesin-microtubule
interaction, as indicated by the increased interaction times and run
lengths. While the attachment rate (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>
<sub>on</sub>) is influenced by the motor protein concentration in solution, the
detachment rate (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>
<sub>off</sub>) depends solely
on the motor-filament interaction.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr"/> Therefore,
the detachment rate, which is an indicator of kinesin microtubule
affinity, can be calculated as the inverse of interaction time. In
BRB80 buffer, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>

stepping assays demonstrate that reducing the ionic strength increases
the affinity between kinesin motors and microtubules.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2" fig-type="figure"><label>2</label><caption><p>Impact of low ionic strength

t-test, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nl5c01188_0002" id="GRAPHIC-d14e339-autogenerated" position="float"/></fig><p>Next,
we investigated how the buffer&#x02019;s ionic strength impacts
the sensitivity of the roadblock assay. For this experiment, we used
two populations of microtubules: The control group consisted of Alexa647-labeled
microtubules and the test group of Alexa488-labeled microtubules with
different concentrations of anti-Alexa488 antibodies, which acted
as roadblocks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A). To ensure that the number of antibodies bound to the microtubules
was the same in different buffer conditions, which would allow a direct
comparison of the extent of slowdown, anti-Alexa488 antibodies were
always bound to microtubules in BRB80 buffer and incubated for 2 min
in a flow channel already containing kinesin, microtubules, and motility
solution. Subsequently unbound antibodies were removed by flushing
with a BRB80 buffer. The gliding speeds of these microtubules were
monitored in both BRB10 and BRB80 buffers, at varying concentrations
of anti-Alexa488 antibodies, which acted as roadblocks. For each antibody
concentration, the microtubule gliding speed in the two buffers BRB80
and BRB10 was then measured successively in the same flow channel.
As expected, an increase in anti-Alexa488 antibody concentration led
to a reduction in the gliding speed of the test microtubules in both
buffer conditions (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01188/suppl_file/nl5c01188_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). However, the reduction in gliding speed was more pronounced in
the low ionic strength BRB10 buffer compared to BRB80. To quantify
this effect, relative gliding speeds were calculated as the ratio
of the gliding speed of Alexa488-labeled test microtubules to Alexa647-labeled
control microtubules, expressed as a percentage (median &#x000b1; interquartile
range; see <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01188/suppl_file/nl5c01188_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Materials and Methods</ext-link>). The
comparison of relative gliding speeds of the microtubules across varying
anti-Alexa488 antibody concentrations under both buffer conditions
is illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B. At very low anti-Alexa488 antibody concentrations (1 nM),
the difference in relative gliding speeds was small between the two
buffers, with values of 99.8 &#x000b1; 11.0% in BRB80 and 96 &#x000b1; 10%
in BRB10. While the slowdown observed in BRB80 at this concentration
was not significant, BRB10 showed a significant reduction in test
microtubule gliding speed. In BRB80 buffer conditions, a measurable
reduction in the gliding speed of the test population was only observed
for 2 nM anti-Alexa488 antibody concentration (relative gliding speed:
92 &#x000b1; 15%). This indicates that the limit of detection improved
by a factor of 2 in low ionic strength environments. To confirm that
this effect was not simply due to time delays between measurements,
we replaced the BRB10 buffer with BRB80 in the same channel following
imaging at a 1 nM anti-Alexa488 antibody concentration. The gliding
speeds increased, and no reduction in microtubule gliding speed was
observed between the two microtubule populations, supporting that
the observed sensitivity increase was specific to the low ionic strength
environment (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01188/suppl_file/nl5c01188_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3" fig-type="figure"><label>3</label><caption><p>Roadblock

anti-Alexa488 antibody concentrations, the enhanced sensitivity
of BRB10 was more pronounced. For example, at 100 nM anti-Alexa488
antibody concentration, the relative gliding speed in BRB80 was 68
&#x000b1; 10%, while in BRB10 it was further reduced to 57 &#x000b1; 11%.
A linear correlation was observed between relative gliding speeds
and the anti-Alexa488 antibody concentration in the log scale, with
a steeper slope in BRB10 buffer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C). The slope of the linear fit was measured
to be 15.4 &#x000b1; 1.3% in BRB80 buffer and 18.1 &#x000b1; 2.7% in BRB10
buffer. This slope (in units of % relative speed per log&#x000ad;[concentration])
was used as an empirical comparative metric of sensitivity and was
not intended to represent a mechanistic binding model. Since the increase
in slope under low ionic strength conditions was a measure of increased
sensitivity, this result emphasizes the ability of low ionic strength
conditions to detect more subtle differences in roadblock density.</p><p>To validate that the observed enhancement in assay sensitivity
under low ionic strength conditions was actually due to stronger kinesin-microtubule
interactions and not just a result of slower microtubule gliding speeds,
we reduced the ATP concentration in the BRB80 buffer from 2 to 0.15
mM to match the microtubule gliding speeds with low ionic strength
conditions, while maintaining the final MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration
at 3 mM, consistent with standard BRB80 buffer. We then performed
roadblock experiments using 100 nM anti-Alexa488 antibody. The gliding
speed of the control microtubules was matched with 491 &#x000b1; 44 nm/s
(median &#x000b1; interquartile range, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 327 microtubules)
in the modified low ATP BRB80 buffer and 482 &#x000b1; 41 nm/s in BRB10
buffer (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 432 microtubules) quite well. We observed
a significantly greater slowdown under low ionic strength conditions
compared to BRB80 buffer, even with matched gliding speeds. The relative
gliding speed of microtubules in BRB80 buffer was 67 &#x000b1; 10% (median
&#x000b1; interquartile range), and in modified low ATP BRB80 buffer
the relative gliding speed was 65 &#x000b1; 12%, while the relative gliding
speed in low ionic strength BRB10 buffer was 57 &#x000b1; 9% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>A), indicating that
the increased sensitivity was not a mere consequence of slower gliding
speeds in low ionic strength conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4" fig-type="figure"><label>4</label><caption><p>Roadblock assay comparing

investigated the impact of differences in buffer composition
beyond the PIPES concentration. Specifically, while BRB80 contains
1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM EGTA, BRB10 has 0.25 mM of each. To
investigate the role of differences in magnesium concentration (co-factor
for ATP hydrolysis<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/>), we performed roadblock
assay experiments with 100 nM anti-Alexa488 antibodies and compared
BRB10 buffer to both standard BRB80 buffer and modified BRB80 buffer
(Mg<sup>2+</sup> and EGTA concentration matched to BRB10 buffer).
The results demonstrated a significantly greater relative slowdown
under low ionic strength conditions in BRB10, with a relative gliding
speed of 59 &#x000b1; 10%, compared to 68 &#x000b1; 12% in standard BRB80
and 66 &#x000b1; 14% in modified BRB80, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>B. These findings indicate
that the improved sensitivity observed in low ionic strength conditions
was not solely due to the reduced Mg<sup>2+</sup> and EGTA concentrations
in BRB10, highlighting the role of overall ionic strength in enhancing
roadblock assay performance. To further evaluate this, we performed
roadblock assays with an intermediate buffer (BRB20) using a 100 nM
anti-Alexa488 antibody concentration. As shown in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01188/suppl_file/nl5c01188_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>, relative gliding speeds decreased
with decreasing ionic strength across BRB80, BRB20, and BRB10, indicating
a consistent increase in assay sensitivity with lowering the ionic
strength.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that reducing the ionic strength
of the
buffer significantly enhances the sensitivity of roadblock assays
by strengthening the binding affinity between kinesin and microtubules.
Under standard BRB80 buffer conditions, weaker electrostatic interactions
result in a reduced affinity between kinesin and microtubules. In
contrast, the low ionic strength BRB10 buffer promotes stronger interactions,
leading to a more pronounced reduction in microtubule gliding speed
in the presence of roadblocks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). The reduction in ionic strength of the buffer effectively
improves the detection limit of the assay two-folds under low ionic
strength conditions. Although this study used antibodies as roadblocks
to demonstrate improved sensitivity, the enhancement arises from increased
kinesin&#x02013;microtubule affinity; therefore, a similar improvement
could be expected for other analytes that act as roadblocks. While
this improvement may appear modest, this was the first study to demonstrate
sensitivity enhancement in a gliding assay-based biosensor. Further
improvements could be achieved by increasing kinesin&#x02013;microtubule
affinity, for example, by using alternative motors with intrinsically
longer run lengths, i.e., stronger motor-microtubule affinities, or
by engineering motor domains that retain even stronger binding under
low ionic strength conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5" fig-type="figure"><label>5</label><caption><p>Enhanced sensitivity of the roadblock
assay through increased kinesin&#x02013;microtubule
affinity at lower ionic strength. Schematic illustrating the principle
that reducing ionic strength increases the sensitivity of the roadblock
assay by enhancing kinesin-microtubule binding affinity. Top: At higher
ionic strength (BRB80 buffer), the electrostatic interaction between
kinesin and microtubules is reduced due to higher salt concentration,
resulting in weaker kinesin&#x02013;microtubule binding. This lowers
the assay&#x02019;s sensitivity to roadblocks; therefore, the relative
gliding speed difference between control and test population is lesser.
Bottom: At lower ionic strength (BRB10 buffer), decreased salt concentration
strengthens electrostatic interactions between kinesin and microtubules,
increasing kinesin&#x02013;microtubule affinity. This enhanced binding
prolongs kinesin interaction with microtubules, amplifying the roadblock
effect and thereby improving assay sensitivity. Therefore, relative
difference in gliding speed between control and test population is
higher. The insets depict the relationship between salt concentration
and kinesin&#x02013;microtubule affinity, with stronger interactions
observed at reduced ionic strength, leading to improved sensitivity
in detecting analyte binding.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nl5c01188_0005" id="GRAPHIC-d14e433-autogenerated" position="float"/></fig><p>Moreover,
reducing the ionic strength below BRB10 could be of interest.
This was not feasible in our system because lowering ionic strength
reduces buffering capacity, making it difficult to maintain a stable
pH, particularly in fluorescence microscopy assays that rely on oxygen-scavenging
antifade systems. Commonly used agents such as glucose oxidase generate
acidic byproducts, leading to a gradual pH drop that must be compensated
with increased buffer strength. As a potential solution, future studies
could explore alternative antioxidant systems such as pyranose oxidase,
which perform more effectively under low ionic strength condition.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>The sensitivity of the roadblock effect
depends on several factors
including the size, charge and distance of the roadblock from the
microtubule lattice.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"/> Proteins as small
as &#x0223c;15 kDa (e.g., mono-streptavidin) have been shown to cause
measurable slowdown of gliding microtubules.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/> suggesting a lower size threshold for direct detection. For smaller
analytes, detection can still be achieved through secondary binding
to larger molecules such as antibodies, Fab fragments, or aptamers,
similar to amplification strategies in immunoassays, thus broadening
the assay&#x02019;s applicability.</p><p>In terms of binding density,
the assay has been shown to detect
up to &#x0223c;16 streptavidin roadblocks per micron of microtubule
length when biotin is incorporated into the lattice.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/> However, its sensitivity is constrained by the kinetics
of binding of analytes to microtubules at very low concentrations.
Addressing this challenge could enable more analyte binding to the
microtubules. One potential solution is increasing the incubation
time with analytes. While the lowest detectable antibody concentration
in this study was 1 nM, the incubation time with microtubules was
limited to just two minutes. Extending this incubation time could
allow more roadblocks to bind to microtubules, further enhancing the
assay sensitivity. Additionally, using high affinity antibodies or
incubating antibodies in a low ionic strength buffer could strengthen
the interactions, consequently increasing the roadblock density on
microtubules and improving the detection limit, especially at low
analyte concentrations.</p><p>Implementation of alternate readout
methods could broaden the practical
applications of this assay. For instance, performing gliding assays
on the tip of an optical fiber allows estimation of microtubule gliding
speeds based on the decay of fluorescence signal over time, as microtubules
glide off the fiber tip.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/> Such methods
would remove the need for direct imaging, simplifying the implementation.
Assuming a 10% reduction gliding speed as a detectable signal in such
assays, our findings indicate a 2.5-fold improvement in detection
limit while also improving sensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>C).</p><p>While this study was conducted
under controlled conditions, previous
work has demonstrated the compatibility of gliding assays with complex
biological media, including diluted whole blood, serum, and cell lysates.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> Our assay relies on relative gliding speed and
includes an internal control population, which helps compensate for
buffer- or sample-induced variability in absolute gliding speed. This
design makes the assay robust even in less controlled environments.
The extent to which the ionic strength can be lowered in such sample
solutions will depend on the specific application and target analyte.</p><p>In summary, we show that reducing the ionic strength of the buffer
improves the sensitivity and detection limit of the roadblock assay
by increasing the affinity between kinesin and microtubules, establishing
a mechanistic link between kinesin-microtubule affinity and detection
sensitivity. Control experiments confirmed that this improvement is
specifically due to enhanced kinesin-microtubule interactions, independent
of microtubule gliding speed or changes in MgCl<sub>2</sub> (co-factor)
concentrations. These findings present a simple and scalable approach
to increase the sensitivity of motor-based assays for point-of-care
diagnostics requiring high sensitivity and improved detection limits.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sifile1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="nl5c01188_si_001.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK-d14e465-autogenerated"><p>We thank Corina Br&#x000e4;uer for her technical
