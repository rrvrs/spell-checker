In colorectal cancer (CRC), SLC7A7 appears to play a role, but the features and mechanisms are not yet well understood. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis. Enrichment analysis was performed to characterize, immune infiltration, methylation, genetic instability, and crucial pathways of SLC7A7. Afterward, functional experiments were conducted in vitro to investigate how SLC7A7 affects tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot (WB), and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (me-RIP) were carried out to confirm the methylation modification of SLC7A7 and related functions. High levels of expression of SLC7A7 are predictive of a worse prognosis for CRC patients. Enrichment analysis showed that SLC7A7 was significantly enriched during EMT and could be enriched in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, immune infiltration analysis of pan-cancer showed that SLC7A7 was significantly enriched in macrophages, and methylation analysis showed that SLC7A7 methylation modification affected the prognosis of specific cancers. SLC7A7 was indicated to promote the migration and invasion of CRC cells in in vitro functional experiments. Mechanistically, SLC7A7 was observed to potentially interact with the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, possibly by influencing adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) expression. Furthermore, we identified that SLC7A7 undergoes N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification, which may regulate SLC7A7 mRNA stability, with Quaking (QKI) potentially playing a role in this process by recognizing the m7G modification. Our results indicate that SLC7A7 may promote CRC metastasis through the SLC7A7/APC/Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, m7G modification might be involved in regulating SLC7A7 mRNA stability, highlighting a novel layer of regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SLC7A7</kwd><kwd>Colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>Migration</kwd><kwd>Invasion</kwd><kwd>m7g modification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Metastasis</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Cell biology</kwd><kwd>Genetics</kwd><kwd>Systems biology</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Gastroenterology</kwd><kwd>Health care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Henan Provincial Medical Science and Technology Tackling Program Joint Co-construction Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>LHGJ20230214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hairong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>U2004112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Weitang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">CRC is a commonly occurring malignant tumor of the human digestive system, which maintains an increasing trend in morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Due to the low prevalence of colorectal early screening and the lack of obvious early symptoms, the majority of CRC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This group of patients still has a poor prognosis, particularly when they have advanced disease or distant metastatic spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Hence, it is crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the occurrence and development of CRC and identify new biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction, as well as new targets for the potent prevention and treatment of CRC recurrence and metastasis.</p><p id="Par3">SLC7A7 is expressed predominantly in macrophages, enterocytes, and kidney cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The SLC7A7 gene encodes the y&#x02009;+&#x02009;LAT1 light chain of the y&#x02009;+&#x02009;L system, which binds to 4F2hc for the transmembrane transport of amino acids. It is thought that SLC7A7 mutations can lead to LPI, which exhibits symptoms such as hepatosplenomegaly, muscle hypotonia, and growth retardation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. There has been widespread research on the role of SLC7A7 in lysine urinary protein intolerance. Recent studies have revealed that SLC7A7 has other functions in addition to the arginine translocation of y&#x02009;+&#x02009;LAT-1. For example, SLC7A7 mutations lead directly to the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, which contribute to lung disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, SLC7A7 plays a crucial role in cancer initiation and progression. It has been shown that SLC7A7 is transcriptionally upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, causing a rise in arginine synthesis, and that high levels of cytosolic arginine are critical for liver tumor development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It has been shown that high levels of SLC7A7 expression are associated with poorer survival and recurrence-free survival in lung cancer studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The expression of SLC7A7 in non-small cell lung cancer was also highly correlated with various immune marker groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, SLC7A7 is highly expressed in tumor tissues and patients have a poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of clarity about the potential function and mechanism of SLC7A7 in CRC.</p><p id="Par4">The Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway comprises a family of proteins that play critical roles in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. The deregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling often leads to various serious diseases, including cancer and non-cancer diseases. Wnt signaling is activated by binding to its receptor, which induces the binding of AXIN to phosphorylated lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). The destruction complex(GSK-3, AXIN, CK1, APC) is broken, and then &#x003b2;-catenin stabilizes and binds to TCF in the nucleus to regulate the target gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, SLC7A7 was identified as a prognostic factor for CRC in multiple cohorts. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of SLC7A7 inhibited migration and invasion of CRC cells by activating the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. SLC7A7 activated the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, which may be owing to the APC. Moreover, we identified the presence of N7-methylguanosine (m7g) modification on SLC7A7 and that the degradation rate of SLC7A7 was regulated by the m7g recognition protein QKI. Our results indicate that SLC7A7 has the potential to promote tumor progression and serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par6">CRC transcriptome and clinical data were sourced from the following databases: TCGA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>), GTEx (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gtexportal.org/">https://www.gtexportal.org/</ext-link>) and GEO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Survival analysis</title><p id="Par7">The CRC patients in the TCGA and GEO cohorts were divided into the SLC7A7 high-expression group and the SLC7A7 low-expression group according to the optimal cutoff value of SLC7A7, and the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and the log-rank test were used to analyze the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the CRC patients in the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Enrichment and immune infiltration analysis</title><p id="Par8">We used tools such as the DAVID online website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>) to perform Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of SLC7A7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to further explore the SLC7A7 in specific signaling pathway enrichment.

Among the CRC gene mutations, most of the genes showed non-significant differences in expression levels between the low and high SLC7A7 groups. However, higher incidence of APC, TP53, KRAS, SYNE1, RYR2, and LRP1B mutations among CRC patients who express higher levels of SLC7A7. As mentioned above, SLC7A7 can be oncogenic in CRC through these gene alterations. Enrichment analysis results showed that SLC7A7 significantly enriched in EMT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, B), and the WB was performed to detect changes in E-cadherin and ZO-1 in response to SLC7A7 downregulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D &#x00026; Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Therefore, we measured APC mRNA in SLC7A7 knockdown HCT116 and SW480 cells. The results indicated that the expression of si-SLC7A7 was significantly higher in HCT116 and SW480 cell lines compared to the NC group, and the WB results similarly suggest that the expression of si-SLC7A7 was significantly high (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C &#x00026; Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In the si-SLC7A7 group, E-cadherin and ZO-1 were noticed to be increased compared to the si-NC group. Similarly, SLC7A7 can be enriched in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, we detected changes in the &#x003b2;-catenin protein by western blot experiment, and &#x003b2;-catenin decreased with the knockdown of SLC7A7. N7-methylguanosine modification participates in multiple mRNA disorders that impact tumor regression. Check the SLC7A7 for the existence of the m7g modifier via the m7g-hub website (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E).

In this case, it indicated the presence of m7g modification on SLC7A7 mRNA. Recruitment of the m7g reader protein to regulate the fate of mRNAs modified with m7g. To determine that QKI regulates the metabolism of SLC7A7 mRNA, we knocked down the expression of QKI in SW480 cells through transfection of QKI siRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G &#x00026; Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

Similarly, in our study, SLC7A7 was up-regulated in CRC and was also associated with an unfavorable prognosis.</p><p id="Par40">Enrichment analysis indicated that SLC7A7 was positively associated with ECM receptor interactions, focal adhesion, EMT, and cell adhesion molecule cam. These results suggest that SLC7A7 may regulate CRC progression through the EMT process. E-cadherin and ZO-1 were quintessential indicators of EMT. Knocking down SLC7A7 expression in HCT116 and SW480 cells. We can observe that E-cadherin and ZO-1 were upregulated in CRC cells. Our study found that SLC7A7 was associated with the expression of multiple EMT marker genes in CRC, suggesting that it may play an important role in regulating the EMT process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed that SLC7A7 may promote EMT by activating the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, a pathway known to be closely associated with tumor cell migration and invasion. Although the results of functional experiments supported the promotional effect of SLC7A7 on CRC cell migration and invasion, further experiments are needed in the future to validate the specific mechanism by which SLC7A7 regulates EMT through the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. These findings suggest that SLC7A7 could be a potential therapeutic target, and the EMT process could be curbed by inhibiting its function, thus preventing the progression and metastasis of CRC.</p><p id="Par41">In our study, we found that the methylation level of SLC7A7 was significantly elevated in CRC tumor tissues, and this increased methylation was negatively correlated with the expression level of the SLC7A7 gene, implying that methylation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CRC by silencing gene expression. This negative correlation between methylation and gene expression suggests that SLC7A7 methylation in CRC may influence tumor progression by suppressing its expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This is consistent with the known role of DNA methylation as a mechanism of gene silencing, especially in the inactivation of oncogenes and activation of oncogenes, where methylation modifications usually play a key role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, methylation of SLC7A7 may not be merely a concomitant phenomenon but is involved in the development and progression of CRC. Further comparative analyses revealed that although methylation of SLC7A7 occurs in multiple cancer types, its elevation in CRC is specific. This specific elevation may be associated with the unique molecular background of CRC, such as specific oncogenic signaling pathways, unique immune responses in the tumor microenvironment, or other specific epigenetic regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This suggests that the role of SLC7A7 methylation in CRC may be different from that in other cancers and may provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms specific to CRC.</p><p id="Par42">The alteration of the genome, such as mutation, loss, and gain of genes, plays an important role in tumors. Among CRC, one oncogene (KRAS) and three tumor suppressor genes (APC, SMAD4, and TP53) are the main genetic changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In our study, we compared the genetic alterations in patients with differently expressed SLC7A7.

Loss of APC gene function seems to trigger the cascade of events that eventually lead to malignant transformation in the large bowel. We showed that SLC7A7 can affect the process of EMT, which is regulated by various signaling pathways, such as TGF-&#x003b2;, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, Hedgehog, and Notch signaling pathways, and we also found that knocking down SLC7A7 expression increased APC mRNA expression, and combined with the biosignature analysis we believe that SLC7A7 can affect the EMT process by affecting the APC mRNA expression.

Under normal conditions, negative regulators of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, such as APC, glycogen synthase kinase 3 protein (GSK3), and axin, bind to &#x003b2;-catenin to form a complex that undergoes phosphorylation and further degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, enrichment analysis also confirmed that SLC7A7 could be enriched in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signal pathway.
