The aim of this study was to evaluate the metaphorical perceptions of hematology patients living in rural areas in T&#x000fc;rkiye about the disease and their psychosocial support needs during the treatment process with a phenomenological approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, in which the phenomenological research method was used, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 hematology patients receiving treatment in a state hospital in a province in the eastern region of T&#x000fc;rkiye. Criterion sampling method, one of the purposive sampling methods, was used to reach the sample group. Interviews continued until data saturation was achieved. The data of the study were evaluated using thematic analysis. The study was conducted and reported according to the COREQ checklist.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Data analysis revealed two main themes including the following: metaphorical perceptions towards hematologic cancer with the sub-themes of emotional turmoil, social alienation and stigma and physical debilitation, and pathways to resilience with the sub-themes of disease process management, inner resilience and faith, and psychosocial support.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This study revealed that the adaptation process of patients to hematologic cancer is quite difficult, and psychosocial support is an indispensable requirement for them in their lives. In order for patients and their families to cope with this very difficult disease process, it is thought that providing them with a higher level of psychological support will be beneficial in coping with the disease effectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00520-025-09278-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer care</kwd><kwd>Hematologic cancer</kwd><kwd>Metaphor analysis</kwd><kwd>Oncology nursing</kwd><kwd>Phenomenological study</kwd><kwd>Psychosocial support</kwd><kwd>Rural region</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Cukurova University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of T&#x000fc;rkiye (T&#x000dc;B&#x00130;TAK).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Hematologic disease is defined as a group of diseases caused by cells that can start in organs or tissues in any part of the body, grow uncontrollably, proliferate, and metastasize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is the second leading cause of death in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and in T&#x000fc;rkiye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the burden of cancer in the world is gradually increasing. For example, the number of cases of cancer increased from 18.1 million in 2018 to 19.3 million in 2020. In addition, the cancer death rate increased from 9.6 million in 2018 to 10.0 million in 2020. This situation shows that hematologic cancers are among the most common childhood cancers in the world, but they also constitute an important group of adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The incidence of hematologic cancers in T&#x000fc;rkiye has been determined as 13.2 per 100.000 in women and 18.9 in men. Among hematologic cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma ranks first while leukemia ranks second in both men and women in T&#x000fc;rkiye. The mortality rates of hematological cancers in T&#x000fc;rkiye are in parallel with the WHO data with an estimation of 1 out of every 5 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Cancer is not only a physical disease but also a phenomenon that affects the individual psychologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. From the stage of diagnosis to the terminal period, cancer profoundly affects the entire bio-psycho-social life of the individual. With the diagnosis of cancer, the presence of cancer diagnosis, the difficulty of cancer treatment, the side effects of treatment, the fear of the unknown, the fear of recurrence of the disease even if the disease regresses, and the fear of death change the whole life balance of the person and cause psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Cancer is an important disease that causes anxiety and depression, negatively affects the quality of life of patients, and therefore requires the determination of anxiety and depression levels of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hinz et al. (2010) found that the rate of anxiety and depression in cancer patients was 27.7% and 11.2% in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to the results of the study, the prevalence of anxiety and depression disorders in hospitalized cancer patients is approximately twice as high as in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some studies show that in addition to physical consequences, cancer patients have increased levels of anxiety and depression even years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is stated that inadequate pain management in cancer patients causes an increase in anxiety levels, and the presence of high levels of anxiety increases pain and may cause sudden pain attacks in the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Accordingly, effective pain treatment and anxiety management in cancer patients are reported to be important in reducing symptom severity and improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Anxiety decreases the quality of life of patients and may reduce their compliance with treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition to the diagnosis of cancer, treatment-related symptoms also increase the anxiety of the individual with cancer. Considering all these reasons, the process experienced by cancer patients due to the disease itself, the toxicity and symptoms caused by the treatment should be evaluated and their anxiety should be defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Continuing the treatment in parallel with effective care and providing adequate social support to the individual facilitates the patient&#x02019;s adaptation to the disease and makes the treatment process easier to overcome psychologically and physically. In this process, the needs perceived by patients and the service provided must be in harmony. Incompatibility between care and needs leads to unmet needs. Meeting the needs reduces the patient&#x02019;s anxiety and dissatisfaction with care and improves the quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a study by Morrison et al. (2012) investigating unmet needs in cancer patients, it was shown that information and social support were the most needed needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although health services and access to these services have increased worldwide, there are still major barriers to access to health services, especially for rural, poor, and disabled individuals. Since individuals live in rural areas, they face significant problems in reaching the city and applying to health institutions. In addition to transportation barriers, language, culture, and poverty also make it difficult for individuals to use health services adequately. Especially in rural settlements in T&#x000fc;rkiye, the inadequacy of professional psychosocial support systems has a negative psychosocial impact on individuals with cancer. All these negative factors affect how individuals perceive their illness and what their psychosocial needs are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the metaphorical perceptions of hematology patients living in rural areas in T&#x000fc;rkiye about the disease and their psychosocial support needs in the treatment process with a phenomenological approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">Throughout this study, the authors followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and reported accordingly (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par10">This qualitative study was conducted between July and August 2024 using a descriptive phenomenological design.

In determining the hospital where the research will be conducted, the fact that Van province is one of the easternmost provinces of T&#x000fc;rkiye, the province with the highest population in the eastern region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the accessibility of the researcher and the cooperation of the team with the researcher were taken into consideration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par13">The criterion sampling method, which is one of the purposeful sampling methods, was used to determine the study group of the research.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) being diagnosed with hematologic cancer and being in any stage of the disease, (b) being open to communication, (c) residing in a rural area. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) having speech, language, or hearing impairments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection tool</title><p id="Par14">A semi-structured open-ended interview guide was used to collect data. The interview guide was prepared by the researchers based on the literature review and in line with the research aim. In the interviews, the patients were asked to describe their thoughts about the situations experienced by hematology patients. The interview consists of two parts. The first part includes questions such as age, gender, diagnosis, and how many years the individual has been a hematology patient. The second part included six basic open-ended questions in order to ensure the content and face validity of the interview guide, the opinions of 3 faculty members who are experts in the field of mental health nursing were obtained. Based on the expert opinions, the interview guide was finalized by making additions and corrections (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The interview guide was prepared in Turkish, and all interviews with the patients were conducted in Turkish (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

For credibility, all participants were informed about the purpose and study procedure verbally and using an information sheet before inclusion in the study. All participants were asked to sign a consent form. Interviews were conducted at a time and place convenient for both the interviewer and the interviewees. The second researcher had basic knowledge about the conduct of the interview and data collection. The interview instrument was piloted before it was applied to the interview. All interviews were recorded with a digital recorder and transcribed on the day of the interview. For reliability, the transcriptions were re-read to correct all possible errors. Two independent coders read all transcripts, separately identified codes, and discussed differences. For verifiability, all researchers discussed and validated the identified codes, themes, and sub-themes. Transcription was done using purposive sampling and continuing the interviews until data saturation was reached.</p><p id="Par19">Permission to conduct the interview was obtained from the responsible physician in the field of hematology at the selected public hospital.

It is very difficult to treat if it is too late, but it is a treatable disease with early diagnosis. At the beginning, I had extreme fatigue and restricted movement.

Psychologically, I had a serious psychological breakdown at first, but after I recognized the disease, I started to recover because I believed that I could beat this disease (P1, Male).</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par27">It has been determined that cancer means mourning and death for some individuals and that they are negatively affected by the losses they experience due to cancer.<disp-quote><p id="Par28">The word cancer evokes very bad feelings for me.

Although my wife and daughter are health professionals, they were also shocked at first. I shared my illness only with my nuclear family. They supported me and said that we would overcome the treatment process together. I did not want to share it with anyone other than my nuclear family. I didn&#x02019;t want them to look at me as if I had a bad disease and evaluate me like that because it would affect me psychologically worse, so I didn&#x02019;t want to share it with others (P1, Male).</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Subtheme 3.

For me, cancer meant that my hair would fall out. I was very scared when I first learned about it. I never thought it could happen to me.

I had mixed emotions, but I tried to manage it by listening to my doctor and my family without losing my morale. My chemotherapy process lasted four months. During this time, I had moments of psychological decline, but there were also moments when I felt strong. But as a result, I think I successfully overcame the chemotherapy process. My biggest source of support was my family. With the strength they gave me, my belief that I would get through it increased.

I could not manage the first process successfully because I did not have a family to support me. But then I decided to get treatment with the support of my sister and close friends with whom I shared the situation. With their support, I managed the process more successfully. I can say that I am now in a complete adaptation process (P2, Female).</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Subtheme 3. Psychosocial support</title><p id="Par42">Individuals stated that there should be a separate follow-up center for them for the disease process, so that their treatment would be more effective and they would feel better mentally.<disp-quote><p id="Par43">Hospitals should have a separate follow-up center to explain the whole process to hematology patients and follow them. They should deal with patients not only with their medical treatment but also with their mental state. In this process, we may experience psychological decline from time to time, which is reflected in the response we will receive from medical treatment. Therefore, hematology patients should be handled and supported in all aspects. In fact, I think there should be a mobile line that we can always reach and share the problems we experience and ask questions (P8, Male).</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par44">In addition, patients stated that providing them with education on the side effects of medication and things to be considered would provide important psychosocial support for them.<disp-quote><p id="Par45">I had a lot of questions after I received this diagnosis, but I didn&#x02019;t have a doctor who could adequately explain any of them. They only gave me information about the medication I would be taking for treatment, but they didn&#x02019;t give me any holistic information about what I should pay attention to in general from now on. For example, I was wondering how I should eat, or what I should pay attention to in my daily activities. They don&#x02019;t give general information. There is also a psychological dimension to this process. But doctors do not look at it from this perspective. We were told that our mood is very important in the treatment. But the health center did not provide any support for this (P9, Male).</p></disp-quote></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par46">In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the metaphorical perceptions of hematology patient living in rural areas in T&#x000fc;rkiye about the disease and their psychosocial support needs in the treatment process with a phenomenological approach. The discussion was addressed in two themes: metaphorical perceptions towards cancer and pathways to resilience.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Metaphorical perceptions towards hematologic cancer</title><p id="Par47">It was determined that the metaphorical perceptions of hematology patients towards cancer were generally negative themes. When the studies were examined, it was determined that many patients used both journey and war metaphors to make sense of their cancer diagnosis or treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In journey metaphors, patients may have a &#x0201c;challenging road&#x0201d; ahead of them and reach a &#x0201c;crossroads&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;progress&#x0201d; with treatment. In war metaphors, patients have an &#x0201c;enemy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;struggle&#x0201d; with their illness and become a &#x0201c;survivor&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In cancer patients, fear due to the known or unknown characteristics of the disease, the thought that the treatment will not work, thinking that they will get negative results, not receiving enough support from the family while hospitalized, experiencing uncertainty, infections, metabolic disorders, brain metastases, and especially the treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, steroids, antiemetics, etc.) can lead to anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">In line with the results of the study by Johansson et al. (2012), participants with allogeneic stem cell transplantation identified the importance of regaining mental energy and being able to cope with anxiety and uncertainty about the disease and treatment and tried to understand what was happening to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Dunn et al. (2016) reported that they experienced a major disruption in their lives physically, psychosocially, and emotionally, including coming to terms with their own mortality, without a sense of when they would be able to return to normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Cancer is a chronic disease that affects the lives of individuals and their families due to its prognosis and treatment method. In many studies in the literature, it has been found that individuals diagnosed with hematologic cancer are affected by quality of life and experience psychological and social problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although the results of the study are in parallel with the literature, it can be said that cancer affects individuals in all aspects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Pathways to resilience</title><p id="Par49">It was found that patients had great difficulty in disease process management and had problems in coping. It is reported that social support has a significant effect in crisis situations and affects the mental and physical health outcomes of individuals. It is stated to be a source of support that facilitates psychological adaptation, especially in diseases such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. During the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, families are expected to provide emotional, financial, and informational support to the patient to increase patient compliance. Although cancer is seen as a problem that concerns the whole family, there are few studies examining the effect of family relationships on patients&#x02019; adherence to the disease. On the other hand, patients reported more chemotherapy-related physical symptoms when their families lacked such characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the characteristics of family relationships are generally seen as stable, a major stressor such as the occurrence of cancer in a family member can change family relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, social support is thought to be one of the issues that should be supported with more studies. The process of managing the side effects of cancer during and after treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. Individuals are affected both physiologically and psychologically in accepting the disease, in the state of uncertainty caused by the process, and in coping with the side effects of the treatment, especially during the diagnosis and treatment processes. They need family support the most in managing this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Patients who do not receive adequate social support have more difficulty in coping with this already difficult process. Studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between lack of social support and anxiety levels in cancer patients. In patients who do not receive adequate support during the disease process, feelings such as loneliness, feeling incomprehensible, and inadequacy can increase anxiety levels; on the other hand, it can also occur because previous experience of nausea and inability to manage it appropriately cause fear of reliving this symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In line with the results of the study, it can be said that psychosocial support is a very important condition for individuals to cope with the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par50">One of the limitations of the study is that all participants were selected from a province in the eastern region of T&#x000fc;rkiye. The results depend on the participants and the setting in which the study was conducted. The participant group is not representative of the entire population of individuals with hematology cancer.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Implications for nursing policy</title><p id="Par51">Hematologic cancer is a complex health issue with biopsychosocial dimensions that can inflict deep wounds on both the individual and their immediate environment. Although nurses evaluate individual patients with hematologic cancer from a biopsychosocial perspective while fulfilling their responsibilities, they should not forget the impact of their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors regarding cancer on individuals with hematologic cancer. Nurses can use effective psychosocial interventions to impart knowledge related to cancer management, organize group therapy (i.e., peer support), perform to ensure continuity of treatment, and improve individuals&#x02019; self-management skills. In this process, initiatives such as stress management, interpersonal relationship, and problem-solving skill improvement for the individual and family should be planned and implemented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions and recommendations</title><p id="Par52">Patients with hematologic malignancies experience an existential crisis, severe uncertainty, and significant biopsychosocial problems throughout their illness. This study revealed that the process of adaptation to the disease is very difficult, and psychosocial support is very important for individuals in their lives. It is thought that providing higher levels of psychological and social support to patients and their families to cope with this difficult disease process will be beneficial for individuals to cope effectively with the disease. On the other hand, it was concluded that individuals experienced significant problems in disease process management, both in accessing health services and in treatment areas in health centers, and that these problems negatively affected the treatment process<italic>.</italic> In addition, challenges specific to rural areas such as lack of mental health services and cultural stigmatization also negatively affected the way individuals coped with the disease.</p><p id="Par53">To address hematologic patients&#x02019; issues, the government should support and prioritize treatment and follow-up of hematology patients who are living in rural areas. In addition to economic and care support, psychological support should also be provided for the mental health of patients living alone. Patients should easily access comprehensive information about the disease and the treatment process using digital devices and mobile applications. In order to change society&#x02019;s perspective on cancer, it is recommended to develop awareness programs at the community level, to draw attention to the importance of early diagnosis, to ensure that people undergo screenings, to establish awareness-raising centers within hospitals, and to work effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="520_2025_9278_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 18 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I am grateful to individuals who participated in my research for sharing their experiences and feelings.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>S.U., &#x000c7;.E., and M.M. contributed to the study conception and design.
