However, the quality and reliability of videos related to a chalazion, a common eyelid condition, have not yet been thoroughly evaluated.</p><p>Research design and methods: One hundred YouTube videos were evaluated using keywords such as "chalazion surgery" and "chalazion removal". Two ophthalmologists assessed the videos using the DISCERN, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), and Global Quality Scale (GQS) scoring systems and recorded the source of each video.</p><p>Results: Analysis revealed low average DISCERN (33.0), JAMA (2.0), and GQS (2.5) scores, indicating poor quality and reliability. Most videos (64%) were classified as "poor" quality, with only a small percentage rated "good" or "excellent". Higher-quality content exhibited positive correlations with engagement metrics.</p><p>Conclusion: YouTube videos concerning a chalazion generally lack quality and credibility and are not sufficient for providing reliable patient information.

It is one of the most common eyelid diseases and affects individuals of all ages [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 25-50% of chalazia resolve spontaneously or within the first three months after medical treatment [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;Eyelid hygiene, warm compresses, antibiotic ointment, steroid injection, lesion excision with curettage, and total excision are the recommended therapeutic options [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>People widely use the internet to obtain medical information [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to recent studies, the purpose of 80% of internet users is to get medical information [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>YouTube is the world&#x02019;s largest media-sharing website and the second most commonly used site worldwide. It provides free of charge, online video sharing and is the leading information-sharing tool [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has approximately one billion users and attracts some six billion views every month according to recent reports. Physicians, healthcare providers, patients, and healthcare institutions all share videos for advertising and educational purposes.&#x000a0;However, the quality of the videos may vary and may be misleading [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Because YouTube is an easily accessible resource; it is used more and more every day to obtain medical information [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although this is a great opportunity for accurate information to be disseminated to large masses, if incorrect and incomplete information is given, it will not benefit people but may be harmful [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>There are studies in the literature that evaluate the quality of YouTube videos about different diseases [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, we could not find any study evaluating the quality of videos about chalazia. We wanted to evaluate the quality of videos about chalazia, the most common disease of the eyelid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Since the videos are shared with everyone on YouTube, we did not need to obtain ethics committee approval. A search was performed using the keywords &#x0201c;chalazion surgery&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chalazion removal&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chalazion incision&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;drainage of chalazion", and &#x0201c;chalazion excision&#x0201d; on YouTube on 10 September 2024.</p><p>We added 300 frequently watched videos using our search words on YouTube. We excluded videos that were similar, closed to comments and likes-dislikes, and videos under 20 seconds.</p><p>The number of views, comments, likes and dislikes, the time since the upload (age), the length of the video (length), the view rate (the number of views per day), and the source of the videos (doctor, patient, health channel, or health care institute) were&#x000a0;recorded for each video by a technical assistant (ME).&#x000a0;All videos were scored using the DISCERN, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), and Global Quality Score (GQS) systems and misinformation assessment. The videos were evaluated and scored in a double-blind manner by two experienced ophthalmologists (MB and AHR) from different institutions, who collaborated effectively through regular virtual meetings and digital platforms. To minimize potential bias, the ophthalmologists were blinded to the source and context of the videos. The simultaneous assessments were conducted independently, and mean scores were calculated to ensure standardized evaluation metrics.</p><p>This study did not require ethical approval as it did not involve human subjects or animal experiments. Although informed consent was not required, all procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Scoring system</p><p>DISCERN is a scoring system developed by Oxford University. It consists of three sections and 16 questions (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the first part, the reliability of the videos is evaluated by the presence of references given. The second part looks at how many different treatment methods are mentioned. In the third section, the video is evaluated in general. According to the DISCERN scoring system, if the video has a score of 63-75, it is excellent, with 51-62 as good, 39-50 as reasonable, 27-38 as bad, and 15 as very bad [<xref rid="REF15"

the DISCERN criteria, revealing significant differences between physician and non-physician-sourced material. The majority of videos were classified as "poor", accounting for 63% of the total, with marked contributions from both physician and non-physician sources. "Fair" quality videos comprised 20% of the total, and "very poor" videos comprised 13%. Only a small fraction of the videos were rated "good" (2%) or "excellent" (2%). The scatter plot further illustrates the variability in DISCERN scores within each classification, highlighting the preponderance of lower-quality content.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>DISCERN quality classifications and total score distribution</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078043-i01" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study critically examined the quality and reliability of YouTube videos on the subject of chalazia, highlighting the platform's role as a significant, yet often, unreliable source of health information. To the best of our knowledge, no previous investigators have examined the quality of YouTube material concerning chalazia. Since we searched for videos related to surgical methods in chalazion treatment, we did not include videos other than those uploaded by doctors, health channels, and health institutions. Fifty-nine of the 100 videos analyzed were uploaded by physicians and 41 by health institutions or channels. The descriptive statistics of the 100 videos are shown in Table <xref rid="TAB5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. The average video values were 33.0 for DISCERN, 2.0 for JAMA, and 2.5 for GQS. We used these scores to classify the quality of YouTube videos. These scores suggest that chalazion surgery videos on YouTube are generally of low quality. Similarly, Yildiz et&#x000a0;al. showed that soft contact lens videos on YouTube were of poor quality and reliability [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Videos on the subjects of retinal detachment surgery, multifocal intraocular lenses, and pterygium surgery have also been described as being of low quality [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our analysis reveals that the reliability and quality of YouTube videos on the subject of chalazia are low, consistent with previous studies that highlight a lack of comprehensive and accurate information [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This is particularly concerning in light of YouTube's popularity as a source of health information, on which videos by non-medical professionals frequently present biased or incomplete information, potentially misleading patients. While YouTube's accessibility makes it a valuable tool for patient education, the absence of standardized quality control can lead to misinformation, unrealistic expectations, or inappropriate self-diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Additionally, one of the primary factors contributing to the low&#x000a0;scores in our analysis of YouTube chalazion videos was the evaluation criteria focusing on the inadequate provision of comprehensive information regarding the procedure and its potential adverse effects, insufficient elaboration of treatment choices, and limited documentation of whether the interventions were performed under appropriate clinical conditions.</p><p>"Chalazion surgery" was the most frequently used search term in this study, representing 48% of queries. This finding echoes the observations of Erdem et al. [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in their study of thulium laser enucleation of the prostate (ThuLEP) videos, in which the authors noted that many YouTube videos were more focused on surgical technique rather than patient education. This suggests a broader trend in medical YouTube content, where videos may not always align with patients&#x02019; information needs [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The most important indicator of the popularity of a YouTube video is the view count [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, our chalazion video analysis revealed no significant differences in view counts, likes, or comments between physician and non-physician videos.</p><p>The analysis of YouTube videos from the perspective of medical content, specifically comparing physician and non-physician creators, has been a subject of particular interest in recent studies. Our analysis of chalazion videos revealed no statistically significant difference in quality measures such as DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS scores between physician and non-physician content creators. This appears to indicate that both groups struggled to provide high-quality, reliable information on chalazia. Similarly to our own findings, a study of pterygium videos by Ozturkmen et al. observed no significant difference in quality measures such as DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS scores between physician and non-physician content creators [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This finding contrasts with a fibromyalgia study, in which physicians were found to produce content that was mostly of high and medium quality (70.2%), while non-medical users largely produced low-quality content (86.7%) [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This discrepancy suggests that the quality gap between physician and non-physician creators may vary depending on the medical topic or condition being discussed.</p><p>The longer durations of videos uploaded by physicians may be attributable to their wish to provide more information without seeking to advertise. No difference was found between physicians and other uploaders in terms of other parameters. Healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of online medical information, particularly on platforms such as YouTube. As Altunel et al. suggest, medical experts should actively create and curate high-quality, unbiased video content that addresses patient concerns in a comprehensive manner [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Ramadhani et al. emphasized the importance of physicians recognizing the limitations of online videos and directing patients toward more reliable sources of information. This dual approach involving content creation and patient guidance is crucial to ensuring access to trustworthy information, ultimately supporting informed decision-making in healthcare&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of DISCERN quality classifications for YouTube videos on a chalazion reveals a concerning trend in the quality of health information available online. The distribution of videos across quality categories revealed a significant skew toward lower-quality content, with the majority of videos falling into the "poor" category (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Similarly to our findings, Sledzi&#x00144;ska et al. reported that the overall quality of meningioma treatment videos was poor, with only 16.4% being rated as "good" or "excellent&#x0201d;&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].&#x000a0;This trend is particularly pronounced among physician-uploaded videos, which counterintuitively dominate the lower-quality categories. Conversely, videos classified as "good" or "excellent" are markedly scarce, indicating a substantial gap in high-quality, reliable health information on this platform. This prevalence of poor-quality videos, especially those from ostensibly authoritative sources such as physicians, raises serious concerns about the reliability of online health resources. This situation may lead to misinformation, potentially affecting patient understanding and decision-making on the subject of chalazion treatment. The scarcity of high-quality content also suggests a critical need for improvement in the creation and curation of health-related videos. By focusing on creating more "good" and "excellent" quality videos, content creators can improve viewer engagement and also contribute to a more reliable and trustworthy online health information ecosystem.</p><p>Correlation analysis of the YouTube chalazion videos reveals a complex interplay between quality and engagement metrics. DISCERN and GQS scores exhibited moderate-to-strong positive correlations with one another and with engagement metrics such as view rate and view count, suggesting that higher-quality content tends to attract more viewers and engagement. Interestingly, these quality metrics also correlated negatively with misinformation, indicating their potential role in identifying reliable health information. JAMA scores, however, exhibited a weaker correlation with engagement metrics, implying that these may not align as closely with viewer preferences. Engagement metrics (view rate, view count, and likes) were strongly correlated with one another, reinforcing the interconnected nature of viewer interaction and approval. The age of the video exhibited weaker correlations overall, highlighting that content quality and relevance, rather than longevity, represent key drivers of popularity on YouTube. These findings underscore the importance of producing high-quality, reliable content in order to effectively engage viewers and combat misinformation in online health videos.</p><p>The study has several limitations. First, the analysis was limited to videos in English, and the inclusion of material in other languages might have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the global landscape of chalazion-related content on YouTube. Second, the study did not evaluate the actual impact of these videos on patient knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors, which may constitute an important area for future research. Furthermore, the lack of detailed analysis regarding the specific content issues contributing to the low quality of videos limits the applicability of the findings in addressing these deficiencies effectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our analysis of YouTube videos on the subject of chalazia reveals a concerning preponderance of low-quality and unreliable content, with the majority of videos, regardless of their source, failing to meet adequate standards of medical information dissemination. This study highlights the need for healthcare professionals not only to guide patients toward more credible information sources but also to actively contribute to the creation and curation of high-quality, unbiased video content on platforms such as YouTube. The research also highlights the critical need for healthcare professionals to enhance the quality of YouTube content on the subject of chalazia, since improved online medical information can significantly bolster patient education and informed decision-making, ultimately leading to better health outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve human participants or tissue.</p><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; M&#x000fc;beccel Bulut, Ali Hakim Reyhan</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; M&#x000fc;beccel Bulut, Ali Hakim Reyhan</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; M&#x000fc;beccel Bulut, Ali Hakim Reyhan</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; M&#x000fc;beccel Bulut, Ali Hakim Reyhan</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; M&#x000fc;beccel Bulut, Ali Hakim Reyhan</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Chalazion treatment</article-title><source>Orbit</source><person-group>
