However, successful regeneration requires addressing space provision, wound stability, undisturbed healing, and availability of specific cell types (Stavropoulos et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Nibali et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Sanz et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This can only be successfully applied to periodontal defects with intrabony patterns of bone resorption (Kyung et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>Most research in this field has focused on interdental intrabony defects associated with the papilla, as papillary management is considered a crucial aspect of regeneration. Many different surgical approaches have been proposed, evaluated, and compared to preserve the stability of related soft tissues and provide an appropriate environment for regeneration. Several studies have confirmed that stable soft tissues, specific flap designs, and minimally invasive microsurgical techniques are crucial for periodontal regeneration, irrespective of the biomaterials used (Cortellini and Tonetti&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Aslan et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Trombelli et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). On the other hand, some studies did not find significant differences in clinical outcomes between minimally invasive and conventional surgical approaches (Windisch et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Schincaglia et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, very little attention has been paid to defects associated with edentulous ridges. For example, little effort has been made to develop specific flaps for soft tissue management in cases where the papilla is not involved. To date, the widely accepted and unchallenged gold&#x02010;standard flap design for such cases, as described by Cortellini and Tonetti (<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), includes a crestal incision right above the treated site, sulcular incision, and, if necessary, release of vertical incision(s) and reflection of both buccal and oral flaps. The most common complications of this approach are membrane exposure, graft contamination, and marginal flap dehiscence, leading to improper healing and insufficient results (Machtei&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Cortellini et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; De Sanctis et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). In cases treated with membranes, the occurrence of such complications ranges from 50% to 100% (Cortellini and Tonetti&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Sanz et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Jepsen et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>We propose a novel surgical technique with a specific flap design, called the &#x0201c;lateral approach for edentulous ridge,&#x0201d; to prevent these complications and guarantee an undisturbed healing environment (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for comparison; see also Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="cre270094-fig-0001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of incision lines and flap designs.

A full&#x02010;thickness flap was raised and hyper&#x02010;mobilized, ensuring proper access while maintaining the uncut soft tissues above the defect. For flap elevation, both sharp and blunt dissections were performed using instruments such as a periosteal elevator, a micro&#x02010;blade, and/or tunneling instruments. After removing the granulation tissue, an adequate view of the distobuccal, distal, or even distolingual aspects of the treated molar was obtained using a micro&#x02010;mirror, and checked for possible calculus deposits (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The affected root surface was scaled using an ultrasound device (slim and furcation&#x02010;dedicated tips) and a Gracey curette. Subsequently, a regenerative strategy was applied. Amelogenins (Emdogain; Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) and bovine bone xenograft (BioOss; Geistlich, Wolhusen, Switzerland) were used for all the cases treated within this series. Amelogenins were applied to dry root surfaces for 4&#x02009;min and suctioned. A mixture of bone graft and amelogenins was used to fill the defect, and a slight overfill was accepted. Re&#x02010;adaptation of the flap was passive. The vertical incision was closed with interrupted sutures (Resolon 5&#x02010;0; Resorba, Doma&#x0017e;lice, Czechia).

This is the first technique specifically designed for these neglected defects, in contrast to the various approaches for papilla&#x02010;associated lesions (Cortellini and Tonetti&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Aslan et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Nibali et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>Defects at the distal aspect of the lower second molars were chosen as suitable study models. Such defects represent intrabony lesions next to the edentulous ridge, and present a challenging clinical situation. They are also often resistant to nonsurgical therapeutic efforts. They usually occur in conjunction with the removal of third molars, particularly when they are impacted mesially or horizontally (Singh et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Kan et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). This is due to their relationship with the periodontium of the second molar (Yang et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). The development of a post&#x02010;extraction periodontal defect on the distal aspect of the second molar is presumed if there was a pre&#x02010;extraction probing pocket depth (PPD) of &#x02265;&#x02009;7&#x02009;mm and a history of periodontitis (Kugelberg et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Passarelli et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Analysis of this association was not within the scope of this trial.</p><p>In this prospective case series, clinical efficiency of the approach was shown, as evidenced by a statistically significant positive change in both CAL and PPD, and primary healing. In all cases, the general clinical objective of periodontal therapy (PPD&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;5&#x02009;mm) (Chapple et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) was met, maintainable sulci were created, and good self&#x02010;performed plaque control levels ensure stable results (Matuliene et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Comparable results were obtained in a previously reported pilot case, which was not included in the present case series (Hrom&#x0010d;&#x000ed;k and Haluskov&#x000e1;&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>The lateral approach, similar to other &#x0201c;conservative&#x0201d; or papilla&#x02010;preserving approaches in periodontal surgery, shares the common aim of creating a clinical environment in which the delicate biological process of regeneration occurs in a space where a very stable flap provides the room and stability of the clot and its biological protection. This was secured by only one vertical incision away from the defect, elevation of only the buccal flap, and preservation of the intact soft tissues above the defect. This resulted in primary healing, flap integrity, and no dehiscence, graft exposure, or infectious complications in all our cases. Studies using other &#x0201c;conservative&#x0201d; techniques have confirmed that intact soft tissues covering the defect led to comparable results with or even without the use of biomaterials (Cortellini and Tonetti&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Trombelli et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>During the 6&#x02010;month observation period, this study successfully demonstrated reduction of PPD to &#x02264;&#x02009;5&#x02009;mm in 100% cases and achieved the overall clinical objective of periodontal therapy. The rather short study period of 6 months was sufficient to produce relevant data and show clear CAL gain and PPD reduction, which is likely to become even more evident with time. A 6&#x02010;month observation period is typically considered the minimum interval for evaluating periodontal healing after regenerative treatment (Carvalho Dutra et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Saito et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>The radiographic evaluation documents partial remodeling of bone graft and residual intrabony defects (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The effect of grafting was more evident in the deeper lesions. Defects related to third molar extraction generally extend from the distal to the mid&#x02010;buccal aspect of the second molar. Micro&#x02010;CT imaging may also be appropriate for assessing bone healing in the buccal part of the lesion. Intraoral radiographs were analyzed to illustrate the bone changes in the distal part of the defects. Drawing conclusions regarding bone regeneration or gain was beyond the scope of this study. However, the specific flap design of the presented lateral surgical approach seems to be responsible for the improved graft and wound stability.</p><p>The goal of the technique is not only to reduce probing and create more favorable conditions for healing but also to prevent the most common complications of the gold&#x02010;standard flap design for this indication (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These are mostly related to the incision immediately above the defect and use of membranes, leading to flap dehiscence and membrane exposure in 50%&#x02013;100% of cases (Machtei&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Cortellini et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Sanz et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In this case series, no complications have been observed at all (as shown in Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="cre270094-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>); suturing was performed only where the former buccal vertical incision was away from the actual defect and distant from the regenerative materials. Therefore, even in cases of suture failure and marginal flap dehiscence, the defect itself would not be affected, materials would not be exposed or infected, and regeneration would not be jeopardized.</p><p>In contrast to the gold&#x02010;standard technique defined by the crestal approach, as described in an epoch&#x02010;making clinical guideline by Cortellini and Tonetti (<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the lateral approach does not require the use of a membrane. The intact flap above the defect serves as an additional stable &#x0201c;wall,&#x0201d; confers stability to the blood clot underneath, supports undisturbed healing, and provides membrane&#x02010;like protection of the grafting material. The lateral approach appears to be less costly, easier to perform, and less prone to complications. Similar to the lateral approach for papilla&#x02010;associated defects, described as &#x0201c;entire papilla preservation flap&#x0201d; by Aslan et al. (<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), healing in this case series occurred with no complications and by primary intention in all of the cases. Within the limitations of this study, the presented lateral approach was shown to be safe and predictable, with a reasonable operation duration, low levels of morbidity, and consistent results.</p><p>The lateral surgical approach is suitable for intrabony defects with 1&#x02013;3 bony walls, which generally have good regenerative potential (Cortellini and Tonetti&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), preferably with disto&#x02010;buccal extension. Suprabony residual defects associated with the edentulous ridge should preferably be treated with access flaps or resective periodontal surgery (Graziani et al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="cre270094-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In cases of a rather lingual extension of the treated intrabony defect, the lateral approach would not be feasible, and a crestal approach would be required instead. Buccal placement of the crestal incision should then be preferred, depending on the extent of the actual defect.</p><p>Based on clinical experience, the lateral approach is better and easier to perform if there is at least 1&#x02009;cm of the horizontal bony crest at the ramus mandibulae distal to the second molar and a minimal amount of 2&#x02009;mm of keratinized gingiva surrounding the treated tooth. Access to the defect may be adequate in all cases with the use of a curved vertical incision extending 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;mm past the MG junction, abundant distal mobilization of the flap, and a micro&#x02010;mirror.</p><p>The limitations of the present study included the lack of a control group, a minimal acceptable observation period, and a relatively small sample size. The sample size was determined according to the anticipated CAL gain and adjusted to match the ethical criteria for testing a previously undescribed surgical method.</p><p>The main strengths of this study are its focus on previously neglected defects, innovative flap design for edentulous ridge, its prospective design, which included a systematic evaluation of very similar defects treated using the same uniform approach by the same operator, and a strict follow&#x02010;up protocol.</p><p>Future studies may further assess our findings, compare the outcomes of the lateral approach to other techniques, and extrapolate the principles of the lateral approach to localizations unrelated to the second lower molars. Future studies should also evaluate whether the technique is relevant for both mesial and distal defects in both frontal and distal areas, and whether the use of biomaterials is necessary for clinical success.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="cre270094-sec-0170"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the limitations of this prospective case series, the following conclusions were drawn:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The lateral approach is a valid technique for regenerative periodontal surgery, specifically tailored for the regenerative treatment of intrabony periodontal defects associated with an edentulous ridge, achieving the goals of clinical attachment gain, PPD reduction, bone grafting, and enhancement of periodontal regeneration with little predisposition to failure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Common complications of a gold&#x02010;standard flap design can be prevented by shifting the most vulnerable area away from the regenerated site. The intact soft tissue above the defect protects the wound and keeps the regenerative material undisturbed during healing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The procedure is not time&#x02010;consuming or difficult to perform.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We suggest using this approach especially in distobuccal intrabony defects in the second molars, which frequently develop after third molar removal. Similarly, it may also be suitable for regenerating any intrabony lesions associated with an edentulous ridge. Further studies are required to validate these findings.</p></sec><sec id="cre270094-sec-0180"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
