In 2021, CVDs accounted for 20.5 million deaths worldwide, highlighting their pervasive impact on public health [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, they continue to be leading causes of mortality globally and in the United States [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CVDs, including conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension, involve complex pathophysiological mechanisms like inflammation, oxidative stress, and dyslipidemia, collectively posing significant threats to human health [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recent decades have seen increasing attention towards nutritional and pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing CVD risk factors and improving cardiovascular outcomes [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a vital antioxidant and bioenergetic compound, has garnered substantial interest for its potential cardioprotective effects [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CoQ10 plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism, maintaining mitochondrial function, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating inflammation pathways relevant to cardiovascular health [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of CVDs involves intricate interactions among genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and environmental influences. This complexity underscores the importance of exploring adjunctive therapies that complement conventional treatments by targeting underlying mechanisms contributing to CVD development and progression [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CoQ10 supplementation has emerged as a promising candidate in this regard, with preliminary evidence suggesting beneficial effects on lipid profiles, glycemic control, blood pressure regulation, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>While several systematic reviews and meta&#x02010;analyses have explored CoQ10 supplementation's effects, they have predominantly focused on isolated outcomes or specific populations, resulting in fragmented and sometimes inconsistent evidence. Previous reviews examined narrow aspects such as liver enzymes (reporting significant reductions in ALT, AST, and GGT levels), athletic performance (focusing on oxidative stress and anaerobic performance), or individual biomarkers of inflammation (showing variable effects on inflammatory markers like CRP, TNF&#x02010;&#x003b1;, and IL&#x02010;6) [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Studies in specific populations, such as NAFLD patients, yielded inconsistent results regarding CoQ10's effects on lipid profiles and liver function, with outcomes varying based on dosage and intervention duration [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis protocol addresses these limitations through several innovative methodological approaches that distinguish it from previous research. First, we uniquely combine the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) framework with dose&#x02013;response meta&#x02010;analysis, providing both rigorous evidence quality assessment and practical insights into optimal dosage regimens &#x02010; a methodological advancement absent in previous reviews. Second, while prior studies typically focused on single outcomes like liver enzymes or specific inflammatory markers, our protocol encompasses a comprehensive range of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including lipid profiles, glycemic control parameters, inflammatory biomarkers, adipokines, oxidative stress markers, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, and liver function. This holistic approach enables a more nuanced understanding of CoQ10's overall impact on cardiovascular health. Third, our protocol employs advanced statistical methods to systematically investigate sources of heterogeneity through detailed subgroup analyses and meta&#x02010;regression, addressing a critical gap in previous research where heterogeneity sources were often unexplored or inadequately addressed. Fourth, our methodology includes extensive strategies to minimize publication bias, including comprehensive database searches, inclusion of gray literature, and rigorous statistical assessment of reporting bias &#x02010; elements often overlooked in previous reviews. Additionally, our protocol's adherence to PRISMA&#x02010;P guidelines and PROSPERO registration ensures unprecedented transparency and reproducibility in the review process. This integrated, methodologically robust approach will provide clinicians and policymakers with more comprehensive and actionable evidence regarding CoQ10 supplementation in cardiovascular disease prevention, advancing beyond the limited scope and methodological constraints of previous studies.</p><p>Despite the existing literature, a comprehensive systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis integrating high&#x02010;quality evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), using the GRADE approach, is warranted. This approach ensures rigorous evaluation of CoQ10's efficacy across diverse populations, encompassing individuals of varying health statuses, ages, and genders. By employing meta&#x02010;regression and dose&#x02013;response analyses, this study aims to provide nuanced insights into the relationship between CoQ10 supplementation dosage, duration, and cardiovascular outcomes, thereby enhancing the precision and applicability of its findings.</p><p>In light of these considerations, this protocol outlines a methodologically robust framework for conducting a systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis of RCTs, adhering to international standards of evidence synthesis. By critically appraising available data, our meta&#x02010;analysis seeks to advance our understanding of CoQ10 supplementation as a potential adjunctive therapy in the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease, ultimately informing clinical practice and guiding future research endeavors.</p><sec id="hsr270452-sec-0060"><label>1.1</label><title>Objectives</title><p>Our comprehensive meta&#x02010;analysis aims to assess the efficacy of CoQ10 supplementation in modifying cardiovascular disease risk factors across both healthy and unhealthy populations. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the impact of CoQ10 on adipokines, anthropometric indices, lipid profiles, blood pressure, inflammation indicators, glycemic control, oxidative stress, and liver function tests, while also investigating heterogeneity across primary studies and other sources.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="hsr270452-sec-0070"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>The methodology employed in this systematic review aligns with the recommended standards outlined in the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta&#x02010;Analyses (PRISMA) checklist [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

This tool evaluates bias risk across seven domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias. Before full application, the tool will be piloted on five primary articles to ensure consistency in assessment. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer. Bias within each domain will be categorized as low, moderate, or high. The Risk&#x02010;of&#x02010;bias VISualization (robvis) tool [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] will be utilized to present bias assessments.</p></sec><sec id="hsr270452-sec-0230"><label>2.5</label><title>Data Synthesis</title><p>The software Stata (Version 15.0) (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas) will be employed for the purpose of meta&#x02010;analysis. Data will be collected on the means of pre and posttreatment, standard deviations (SDs), and participant numbers in both intervention and placebo groups for various clinical outcomes including lipid profile, glycemic control, anthropometric indices, inflammation, blood pressure, oxidative stress, liver function, and adipokines. The impact of CoQ10 supplementation will be evaluated by analyzing the changes between the intervention and placebo groups. If unit conversion between variables is feasible, the analysis will utilize the weighted mean difference model; otherwise, the standardized mean difference (SMD) model will be applied to account for differences in measurement units. Due to the diversity in populations and settings of the included RCTs, a random effects model will be used to determine the overall effect from the SMDs using the DerSimonian&#x02013;Laird weighting method. The SDs of the change difference will be calculated using the formula: (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;square root [(SD pretreatment) 2&#x02009;+&#x02009;(SD posttreatment) 2&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;(2&#x02009;R&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;SD pretreatment&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;SD posttreatment)], with a correlation coefficient (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>) assumed to be 0.5. The I&#x02010;square (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) statistic will be utilized to evaluate between&#x02010;study heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity will be considered substantial if the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value is &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 or if <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup> value exceeds 50%. Subgroup analyses will be conducted to explore the effects of CoQ10 on clinical outcomes by considering study characteristics like population, follow&#x02010;up duration, and CoQ10 dose as potential sources of heterogeneity. Meta&#x02010;regression will be used to assess the impact of CoQ10 dosage (g/d) and duration on risk factors related to CVDs. Additionally, a nonlinear model will be applied to combine dose&#x02013;response data from multiple studies to evaluate the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on CVD risk factors [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To examine the influence of individual trials on the meta&#x02010;analysis results, the meta&#x02010;analysis statistic will be recalculated by omitting one study at a time (leave&#x02010;one&#x02010;out).</p><p>In response to the potential heterogeneity arising from the inclusion of both healthy and unhealthy participants, we will conduct subgroup analyses based on baseline health status. These analyses will differentiate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on clinical outcomes (e.g., lipid profiles, glycemic control, inflammatory biomarkers) in healthy versus unhealthy populations, allowing for a better understanding of the physiological differences between these groups. Furthermore, we will use meta&#x02010;regression techniques to investigate the influence of baseline health status as a covariate, assessing whether variations in population characteristics contribute to heterogeneity in treatment effects.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses will be performed to test the robustness of the findings by systematically excluding studies involving specific population subsets, such as those focusing only on healthy or unhealthy participants. This approach will help ensure that the results are not disproportionately influenced by any particular subgroup. All subgroup, meta&#x02010;regression, and sensitivity analyses will be transparently reported, with detailed tables and figures illustrating how the effects of CoQ10 supplementation may differ across these populations. This comprehensive approach will enhance the clarity and reliability of our conclusions.</p><p>To handle the breadth of outcomes, we will focus on a structured and domain&#x02010;specific synthesis of results. This approach ensures that outcomes are presented in a way that aligns with the clinical significance of CoQ10 supplementation, with adjustments made for multiple comparisons and clear reporting of both primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="hsr270452-sec-0240"><label>2.6</label><title>Assessment of Possible Reporting Bias</title><p>An assessment will be conducted to determine the likelihood of bias in reporting outcomes, which encompasses publication bias and other forms of reporting bias. This assessment will involve the use of the counter Funnel plot technique, contingent upon having a sufficient number of studies included in a meta&#x02010;analysis (around 10 studies). Begg's test and Egger's test will also be utilized to detect any asymmetry. A significance level of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 will be employed to indicate a statistically significant association.</p></sec><sec id="hsr270452-sec-0250"><label>2.7</label><title>Assessing the Quality of the Evidence</title><p>GRADE guidelines [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] will assess evidence quality related to CoQ10 effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors.

First, it incorporates advanced methodologies such as the GRADE framework and dose&#x02013;response meta&#x02010;analysis, which are rarely combined in previous reviews. The use of GRADE ensures a systematic evaluation of evidence quality, providing robust and reliable guidance for clinicians and policymakers. Simultaneously, the dose&#x02013;response meta&#x02010;analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between CoQ10 supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes, offering practical insights into optimal dosages and intervention durations. These methodological innovations position the study as a benchmark for future research in this domain.</p><p>Additionally, the protocol addresses gaps in previous research by encompassing a comprehensive range of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including lipid profiles, glycemic control parameters, inflammatory biomarkers, adipokines, oxidative stress markers, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, and liver function. Unlike prior studies that focused narrowly on select outcomes or populations, this approach allows for a holistic assessment of CoQ10's potential health benefits. The rigorous adherence to PRISMA&#x02010;P guidelines, PROSPERO registration, inclusion of gray literature, and strategies to minimize publication bias further reinforce the methodological rigor and transparency of this protocol, ensuring its findings will be both comprehensive and clinically relevant.</p><p>Systematic reviews and meta&#x02010;analyses are pivotal in synthesizing and summarizing the most robust evidence from healthcare research, effectively bridging the gap between research findings and clinical practice [<xref rid="hsr270452-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This study presents a protocol for a systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis aimed at comprehensively evaluating the impact of CoQ10 supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk factors. The findings from this review are anticipated to provide nuanced evidence that can guide healthcare administrators and policymakers in making informed decisions related to cardiovascular disease prevention and public health strategies.</p></sec><sec id="hsr270452-sec-0290"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
