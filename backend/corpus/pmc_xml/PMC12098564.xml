In China, there were 1.26 million people living with HIV, with the improvements in ART efficacy and reduced side effects (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Advancements in ART have transformed HIV into a manageable chronic condition, allowing people living with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. Consequently, many parents living with HIV (PLH) are raising their children into adolescence and beyond. As children mature, parents may increasingly consider disclosing their HIV status, believing that older children possess greater cognitive and emotional capacity to understand the implications of HIV. However, this decision presents significant challenges, including determining the optimal timing, appropriate content, and manner of disclosure. Parents must navigate a delicate balance between honesty and protection, fearing potential stigma or emotional distress. Parental HIV disclosure remain a complex and often distressing process for many PLH.</p><p>Despite international guidelines emphasizing the importance of HIV disclosure, disclosure rates remain low in China. According to the China Stigma Index Report, less than half of PLH reported that their children were aware of their parents' HIV status (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends parental HIV disclosure for school-aged children, citing mutual benefits for both caregivers and children, including improved emotional support, better understanding of health conditions, and greater adherence to treatment regimens (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, disclosure is often fraught with fear, including concerns about stigma, secondary disclosure by children, and potential negative emotional responses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A 2012 survey revealed that only 25% of Chinese parents with children aged 5&#x02013;16 had disclosed their HIV status to their children, showing the hesitance among PLH to engage in this process (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The process of HIV disclosure is complex and involves multiple stages, requiring careful planning and preparation, particularly when disclosing to children. Since children's cognitive and emotional capacities vary by developmental stage, disclosure requires tailored strategies that take these differences into account. The Disclosure Decision-Making Model (DDMM) and the Disclosure Process Model (DPM) were used to guide the development of the intervention, providing a structured foundation for decision-making and communication strategies in parental HIV disclosure (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Studies have shown that unplanned or forced disclosures, often driven by external pressures, tend to result in poorer psychosocial outcomes for both the parent and the child (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, a significant gap exists in intervention evaluation studies regarding the consideration of HIV disclosure as a staged process. A systematic review identified four intervention studies aimed at promoting parental HIV disclosure, but all treated disclosure as a single event, rather than a multi-state process (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For example, two studies measured HIV disclosure action as a binary outcome (yes-or-no event), while other used simple categorical scales to assess whether disclosure had occurred (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These approaches fail to capture the complexity of the disclosure process, which includes intention formation, preparation, and gradual disclosure, often spread over time.</p><p>To address this gap in intervention evaluation, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) was adopted as the theoretical framework for this intervention evaluation due to its explicit focus on stage transitions and its well-established application in health behavior change interventions. HAPA's emphasis on self-efficacy, intention formation, and action planning allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of how participants progressed through the disclosure process over time (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). HAPA posits that individuals move through an ordered set of qualitatively distinct stages (i.e., pre-intention, intention, and action), each requiring tailored strategies to facilitate progression (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This distinction is particularly relevant to parental HIV disclosure, where PLH may remain in a particular stage due to psychological, social, or structural barriers, necessitating specific interventions to facilitate progression. In the context of parental HIV disclosure, HAPA suggests that PLH progress through three key stages: (1) the pre-intention stage, in which people have not yet decided to act; (2) the intention stage, in which people have decided to act but have not yet started action; (3) the action stage, in which individuals make actual behavior change (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Given the central role that stage transitions play in models like HAPA, this study applies the HAPA framework to access the efficacy of a theory-based intervention aimed at facilitating parental HIV disclosure among PLH in Guangxi, China. Specifically, this study examines where the intervention influences stage transitions between pre-intention, intention, and action, and whether it affects the overall pattern of forward and backward transitions. By focusing on stage transitions, this study aims to provide more comprehensive understanding of the HIV disclosure process and offer insights into how interventions can be optimized to support PLH at different stages of disclosure. The primary research questions are: (1) Does the intervention affect specific stage transition probabilities? (2) Does the intervention affect the overall pattern of HIV disclosure stage transition, including forward or backward transitions?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Study setting and participant recruitment</title><p>The parental HIV disclosure intervention, known as <italic>Interactive Communication with Openness, Passion, and Empowerment</italic> (iCOPE), was implemented in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (&#x0201c;Guangxi&#x0201d;), a southwestern province of China with the third-highest HIV prevalence (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The iCOPE intervention was designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at helping PLH disclose their HIV status to their uninfected children in a culturally and developmentally appropriate manner. The intervention targeted both PLH and health care providers, focusing on improving disclosure communication skills and fostering psychosocial support (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The cluster RCT, conducted from 2012 to 2018, evaluated the efficacy of intervention by comparing outcomes between an intervention group and a control group (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>To ensure comprehensive coverage, the study selected the top two cities (urban centers) and the top eight rural counties with the highest reported HIV/AIDS cases in Guangxi as study sites. From these areas, 40 clinics were randomly selected with at least 200 HIV/AIDS cases. Within each clinic, 20 PLH who had not yet disclosed their HIV infection to their seronegative children aged 6 to 15 years were randomly recruited. Cluster randomization was applied to assign each clinic to either the intervention or control group.</p><sec id="s2a1"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>Clinics were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group using a randomization sequence. Assignment was concealed from participants and facilitators until after baseline data collection to prevent bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><label>2.1.2</label><title>Blinding</title><p>Survey interviewers (i.e., CDC staff) were blinded to the intervention assignment, ensuring that data collection was unaffected by group allocation. However, facilitators (i.e., health educators from the provincial CDC) were not blinded due to the nature of the intervention, as they were directly involved in the delivery of the intervention or control conditions.</p><p>To be eligible for the iCOPE intervention, PLH needed to meet the following criteria: (1) be at least 18 years of age, (2) have a confirmed diagnosis of HIV or AIDS, (3) reside with at least one child aged 6&#x02013;15 years, and (4) have not disclosed their HIV status to their child. Both biological and non-biological parents, if they were the legal and primary guardians of the child, were eligible to participate, although the number of non-biological parents was small. Exclusion criteria included (1) having linguistic, cognitive, or physical impairments that could hinder participation, (2) being currently incarcerated or institutionalized due to drug use or commercial sex work, and (3) having plans to permanently relocate outside the province within a year. Potential participants were referred by medical staff or case managers at the 40 selected clinics (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Local team members screened individuals for eligibility and provided detailed information about the study's design, potential risks and benefits, and confidentiality protections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2</label><title>Description of intervention</title><sec id="s2b1"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Intervention condition</title><p>The intervention comprised five interactive training sessions, each lasting two hours. The sessions focused on three core components. First, parents were introduced to the stages of childhood cognitive development in relation to parental illness, emphasizing the concept of a child's readiness for disclosure. Second, the intervention aimed to enhance parents' cognitive and behavioral skills concerning HIV disclosure. Specific topics included understanding the benefits and risks of disclosure, practical guidance on how and what to disclose, and recognizing disclosure as an ongoing, evolving process. Third, the sessions provided support to improve parents' psychosocial well-being, helping them adapt to living with HIV/AIDS through discussions and strategies focused on coping with their infection or illness.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><label>2.2.2</label><title>Control condition</title><p>The control group participated in a series of five interactive training sessions on nutrition education, with each session lasting two hours. The sessions were designed to address three key areas: enhancing parents' knowledge of nutrition, including the importance of food variety and proper nutrition for a growing child; promoting healthy diet and cooking practices, such as managing fat, salt, sugar intake, and the inclusion of fruits, vegetables, and minerals; and ensuring food safety. The decision to use nutrition education as the control condition was informed by community needs and stakeholder input. While all participants living with HIV receive routine HIV care through government-sponsored programs, many lack access to supplementary resources such as nutrition education. Furthermore, selecting nutrition education as an active and attention-matched control condition was intended to minimize placebo or expectancy effects, as participants in both groups received an intervention that required active engagement.</p><p>At each participating clinic, a minimum of two health care providers were recruited and trained to serve as facilitators for the intervention. These facilitators were responsible for administering either the parental HIV disclosure program or the nutrition education program, depending on the condition allocated to their clinic. Both the intervention and control sessions were conducted once a week over five weeks at the clinics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><label>2.3</label><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were collected through a baseline survey and six follow-up surveys conducted every six months (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Trained survey interviewers (CDC staff) administered surveys to the parents individually in private rooms, such as doctors' offices, at the district or township clinics. Each question in the survey was read aloud by the survey interviewer, and participants provided verbal responses. Clarifications were provided when needed. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation in the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Wayne State University, University of South Carolina, and Guangxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><sec id="s2c1"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Sample size and power analysis</title><p>The sample size estimation was based on a power analysis accounting for the clustered design of the study. Given the lack of empirical data on the effects of parental disclosure interventions in China or other low- and middle-income countries, we conservatively assumed a smaller-than-medium effect size (Cohen's d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.35) for the long-term intervention effect. The initial sample size was 791 participants at baseline, with 690 remaining at the 36-month follow-up. Since the unit of randomization was the clinic rather than individual participants, the sample size calculation was adjusted for clustering effects using an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.10, following standard procedures for determining an effective sample size in cluster-randomized trials. After this adjustment, the effective sample size was 363. According to power calculations, this sample size provided 91% power to detect an effect size of 0.35 at a significance level of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, ensuring adequate statistical power to assess the intervention's efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2.4</label><title>Measures</title><sec id="s2d1"><label>2.4.1</label><title>HIV disclosure stage</title><p>To assess the stage of HIV disclosure, a single question was asked during each follow-up period. Participants were asked to select their current disclosure status based on the following six categories: 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;No disclosure in the past six months and no intention to start&#x0201d;, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;No disclosure in the past six months but intends to start&#x0201d;, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;No disclosure in the past six months but has made a plan&#x0201d;, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Started disclosing but has not mentioned HIV&#x0201d;, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Started disclosing with the mention of HIV&#x0201d;, and 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Started disclosing, and including mentioning HIV and how I was infected&#x0201d;. These categories were then collapsed into three broader stages based on the HAPA (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Participants were classified as pre-intenders (response 1), intenders (responses 2&#x02013;3), or actors (responses 4&#x02013;6). These three disclosure stages were used for further statistical analysis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><label>2.4.2</label><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Baseline characteristics were collected at the parent and child levels. Parent-level variables included socio-demographic and HIV-related factors. Socio-demographic data included age, gender, marital status, and level of education. HIV-related variables captured included route of HIV infection, time since diagnosis, ART uptake, CD4 count (used as an indicator of immune function), and viral load (the concentration of HIV in the bloodstream). Child-level variables included the child's gender and age. Age groups were categorized into three brackets: 6&#x02013;9 years, 10&#x02013;12 years, and 13&#x02013;15 years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><label>2.5</label><title>Analysis</title><p>Baseline characteristics (W1) and HIV disclosure stages from the first two follow-up assessments (W2 at 6 months and W3 at 12 months) were utilized for this analysis. A total of 791 participants completed the baseline survey. However, participants who did not respond to the HIV disclosure question at both W2 and W3 were excluded. This resulted in a final sample of 374 participants from the intervention group and 377 from the control group, as depicted in the CONSORT flow diagram (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of 791 participants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="frph-07-1499481-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>Data analysis was performed using Stata 13.0 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Mplus 7.4 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Prior to the main analysis, a randomization check and attrition analysis were conducted. The distribution of HIV disclosure stages by intervention group was compared using Somers' D test.</p><sec id="s2e1"><label>2.5.1</label><title>Markov chain model of disclosure transitions</title><p>The transition between HIV disclosure stages was modeled using a first-order manifest Markov Chain. The model assumed two conditions: (1) the stage occupied at W3 was dependent solely on the stage at W2 (first-order assumption), and (2) no measurement error occurred in the disclosure stages (manifest assumption). This approach involved two multinomial logistic regressions:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p>U1: Modeled the stage membership at W2.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p>U2: Modeled the transition between stages from W2 to W3, conditional on the stage at W2.</p></list-item></list>No restrictions were imposed on stage membership at W2. However, the action stage was treated as an absorbing state, meaning that participants who reached this stage could not regress to earlier stages. This modeling allowed for six possible transition patterns: (1) static at pre-intention, (2) forward transition from pre-intention to intention, (3) forward transition from pre-intention to action, (4) static at intention, (5) backward transition from intention to pre-intention, and (6) forward transition from intention to action.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><label>2.5.2</label><title>Comparison of transition matrices by group</title><p>To assess whether the intervention influenced the transitions between stages, two models were compared:

Our findings emphasize the theoretical relevance of HAPA in understanding how PLH navigate disclosure processes, demonstrating differential intervention efficacy based on participants' initial stages of disclosure readiness. Specifically, the intervention was more effective among pre-intenders, who were more likely to progress to the action stage rather than remaining static at the pre-intention stage. This finding highlights the potential of targeted interventions to facilitate action-oriented outcomes in PLH who have not yet formed an intention to disclose their HIV status. However, the intervention did not show statistically significant efficacy for those who were already in the intention stage, suggesting that different or additional strategies may be needed to support this group in transitioning to action.</p><p>A notable observation in this study is that stage transitions in the disclosure process do not always follow a sequential pattern. Some participants were found to move directly from the pre-intention to the action stage within six months. One possible explanation for this non-sequential transition could be measurement error of stage membership (i.e., misclassification) which has been found to impact the smallest response category (i.e., the pre-intenders) most (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Another explanation is that the six-month follow-up window was too broad to capture their sequential changes in participants' stages. Therefore, more frequent follow-ups (e.g., every three months) may be necessary in future longitudinal studies to determine whether individuals progress sequentially through the ordered stages within a short time frame or if they tend to skip certain stages.</p><p>Moreover, it is possible that participants have disclosed their HIV status without detailed planning and preparation, perhaps due to unexpected circumstances leading to unintended disclosure. This aligns with findings from the transtheoretical transition model (TTM), a widely applied stage-based framework, which suggests that stage transitions may not always be sequential (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Studies have found that individuals are most likely to skip the preparation stage in TTM and try to move directly from contemplation into action (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Although the HAPA is conceptualized as a two-stage or three-stage model, limited research has been conducted to examine whether stage skipping is possible in HAPA. Most studies guided by HAPA have posited transition patterns as a sequence from static, regression, to progression without exploring stage skipping (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Future research should investigate the implications of stage-skipping by comparing transition models that constrain movement between stages with those that allow direct transitions from pre-intention to action. In addition, incorporating qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviews, would provide a deeper understanding of the motivations and circumstances influencing changes in disclosure status, thereby informing the development of more targeted interventions.</p><p>The lack of a significant intervention effect on the transition from pre-intention to intention may be attributed to a combination of psychological and social factors. Information deficits, including limited knowledge of the potential benefits of disclosure or uncertainty about how to initiate the conversation, may prevent parents from forming a concrete intention to disclose. In addition, persistent stigma may create hesitation about potential negative consequences, such as discrimination or altered family dynamics, thereby inhibiting progression from pre-intention to intention. Furthermore, parents may not perceive immediate benefits in disclosing their status, especially if they anticipate challenges in their child's emotional processing or fear unintended disclosure by the child to others. Future interventions should incorporate targeted stigma reduction strategies, educational resources that emphasize the advantages of disclosure, and structured decision-making tools to facilitate intention formation and subsequent disclosure planning.</p><p>The mixed findings reported in the literature regarding the efficacy of parental HIV disclosure interventions further highlight the complexities of this research area (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For example, Rotheram-Borus et al. found no statistically significant differences in parental HIV disclosure status between intervention and control conditions over a 24-month period (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Moreover, previous research has shown that parental HIV disclosure rates are higher among parents with older children, as parents often decide not to disclose to younger children, considering them &#x0201c;too young to understand&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Research found that parents of younger children (ages 6&#x02013;9) demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, action self-efficacy, and action planning following the intervention, while parents of older children (ages 10&#x02013;12 and 13&#x02013;15) showed different patterns of change, including a reduction in perceived benefits of disclosure for the 10&#x02013;12 age group (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These results suggest that the efficacy of parental HIV disclosure interventions may vary by child age, with interventions potentially requiring adaptation to address the unique needs of parents depending on the developmental stage of their child.</p><p>Our findings suggest that integrating the iCOPE intervention into routine HIV care services could significantly enhance support for parental disclosure. This integration could be accomplished through provider training focused on stage-specific counseling and by incorporating disclosure planning into maternal and child health programs. Notably, the Guangxi CDC has already incorporated our findings into their training plans, manuals, and guidelines for parental HIV disclosure, demonstrating the real-world applicability of our approach within local healthcare systems. However, scaling this intervention will require addressing systemic barriers, including stigma and limitations in healthcare resources. Future research in implementation science is critical to capture the lessons learned from scaling up this intervention, which will be essential for adapting and sustaining the intervention within broader HIV care and maternal-child health programs across various contexts.</p><p>Several limitations of this study need to be acknowledged, as they may influence the interpretation of our findings. First, while the intervention and control sessions were conducted with equal intensity, factors such as differential engagement, facilitator variability, or session adherence could introduce bias. Future studies should monitor and address these factors to mitigate potential bias. Second, we assumed no measurement error in categorizing participants' HIV disclosure stages. However, the occurrence of backward stage transitions (i.e., from intention to pre-intention) suggests that measurement error may have been present. To address measurement error, future research should focus on developing and validating more precise stage algorithms that accurately reflect PLH's different stages in the HIV disclosure continuum. Incorporating more complicated latent Markov models that estimates item-response probabilities could also help address this change. Third, due to the limited sample size, we were unable to test whether other stage models with finer stage classifications (e.g., the five-stage TTM) might offer a better fit than the three-stage HAPA in framing HIV disclosure stages. Fourth, due to the small number of participants who reported remaining in the action stage, we were unable to further differentiate these parents based on their disclosure scope (i.e., the specific topics they covered in the disclosure). Lastly, as the question regarding HIV disclosure stage was not asked at baseline, we were unable to depict the full transition profile from baseline to W2, limiting our understanding of early-stage transitions.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this study offers significant contribution to the field and highlights important considerations for future research. First, our findings suggest that the three-stage HAPA can be applied to frame and measure HIV disclosure as a process. Second, when assessing the intervention efficacy on stage transitions, considering both specific transition probabilities and overall forward or backward transition patterns in the evaluation enables a more comprehensive investigation of intervention efficacy. Third, the stage-specific intervention efficacy detected in this study indicate that interventions should be tailored to address the unique needs of participants at different stages of behavioral transition. To develop such staged-specific interventions, further research is needed to identify the key predictors of each stage transition, with particular attention to the role of psychosocial factors. Investigating these underlying mechanisms will not only deepen our understanding of the disclosure process but also inform the development of more effective, targeted interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We greatly appreciate the staff at Guangxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention for their efforts in participant recruitment and data collection.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The data analyzed in this study is subject to the following licenses/restrictions: Due to sensitive information from participants, the data is not publicly available.
