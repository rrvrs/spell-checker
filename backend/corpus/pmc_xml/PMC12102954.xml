Separation was carried out on Inertsil C<sub>18</sub> column (150 mm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4.6 ID; Particle size 5 &#x000b5;m) and a mobile phase composed of ethanol and 30mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer, adjusted to pH 2.5 using ortho-phosphoric acid (40:60, v/v) was used. A constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at an ambient temperature was adopted. Method validation was performed according to the ICH Q2 R2 and bioanalytical method validation was done according to FDA guidelines for determination of both drugs simultaneously in biological matrices. The method demonstrated excellent linearity over the concentration range of 0.01&#x02013;1.00 &#x000b5;g/mL and 0.003&#x02013;1.00 &#x000b5;g/mL that were selected with accordance to the C<sub>max</sub> of both drugs with a correlation coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) of 0.9998 and 0.9999 for felodipine and metoprolol, respectively in human plasma.

It was observable that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death, mainly in low and middle-income countries. Mortality rate reached 17.9 million death per year worldwide resulting from CVDs; 85% were because of heart attack and stroke. As a result, the WHO is trying to raise the chances of survival through programs that permit patients to access technology and essential medications in various countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Essential medications that the cardiologists are concerned about encounter classes such as beta-blockers, statins, and blood thinners. Cardiovascular diseases include angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and heart attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Angina pectoris and myocardial infarction are ischemic heart diseases characterized by insufficient blood flow pumped to the heart due to narrowed heart arteries, resulting in diminished oxygen and blood levels received by the heart muscle. The narrowing of blood vessels can be due to hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Cardiovascular disease therapy depends on drug combinations from diverse classes. The American Heart Association guidelines claim that treating patients rely on numerous factors, including comorbidities that affect the overall disease state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">It is common in various diseases that the treatment requires to administer two or more drugs in the same pharmaceutical dosage form concomitantly which enhance patient compliance and make it easier to stick to the treatment regimen.

No official analytical methods are present for simultaneous determination of FDP and MTP. Several spectrophotometric methods have been reported for the simultaneous determination of FDP and MTP in bulk samples and pharmaceutical preparations. Rontogianni et al.

The pKa values of the compounds of interest are 5.07 and 9.60 for FDP and MTP, respectively. Trials on different pH values were adopted, and the optimum pH was 2.5. FDP and MTP are weak bases with pKa values of 5.07 and 9.60, respectively. Below its pKa, FDP remains neutral and hydrophobic, strongly interacting with the stationary phase, leading to longer retention times. As pH nears 5.07, partial ionization reduces these interactions, shortening retention time. Above this pH, FDP becomes mostly ionized, further decreasing retention but potentially causing peak broadening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similarly, MTP remains protonated below pH 9.60, resulting in weak interactions and short retention times. As pH increases toward neutrality, MTP interacts more strongly with the column, increasing retention. However, high pH conditions may compromise column stability and peak shape, making them less ideal for analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Effect of different pH values upon several trials on the retention time presented in Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.</p><p id="Par32">Multiple of organic solvents were tested to achieve optimum separation in a short run time for both drugs. Ethanol was satisfactory as it is a green solvent yielding a satisfactory chromatogram. The ratio of the phosphate buffer to ethanol and the isocratic elution were optimized after different trials to obtain the best separation and resolution of the three compounds. Ethanol, as an organic modifier, reduces polarity and shortens retention times by weakening drug interactions with the stationary phase. The phosphate buffer maintains a stable pH of 2.5, ensuring optimal ionization for both drugs, improving peak shape, and enhancing separation. FDP, being more hydrophobic, interacts strongly with the column, leading to a longer retention time, while the more polar MTP elutes faster. This 40:60 ratio balances resolution, peak shape, and analysis time, making it ideal for effective separation.

While GAPI provides a quick visual overview to evaluate and improve the greenness of methods, its main drawback is the lack of a total score, making it difficult to directly compare methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">To address this limitation, the Modified GAPI (MoGAPI) tool and software were modified. MoGAPI combines the visual appeal of GAPI with a calculated total score, like the analytical Eco-Scale. Credits were assigned to each step based on its environmental impact, with higher scores given to greener practices of the method. The total score is then converted into a percentage, excluding non-applicable steps to ensure fairness. Greenness classification system categorizes methods as excellent green (&#x02265; 75), moderately green (50&#x02013;74), or insufficiently green (&#x0003c; 50) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">MoGAPI software was applied to evaluate the greenness approach of this proposed HPLC-FD method, providing a more precise and comprehensive assessment of its greenness profile impact. Evaluation of key aspects such as sampling, sample preparation, reagents and solvents, instrumentation, energy consumption, waste production and quantification were taken into consideration and incorporated into the software to generate a visual pentagram with a greenness score of 77% that signifies the method with high green profile shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c.</p><p id="Par65">An RGBfast method was applied to study and evaluate both the greenness and whiteness profile of the proposed HPLC-FD method and has been compared to the reported method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. RGBfast is a simplified evaluation tool to assess the environmental impact of analytical methods. It uses color codes, red for less green, green for eco-friendly, and blue for balanced profiles to rate methods. This simple approach aids researchers in assessing and improving sustainability. The RGBfast model utilizes an automated Excel spreadsheet where analysts can input relevant data. It includes guidelines for assessment and displays the results through automatically formatted tables and pictograms. The RGBfast model evaluates analytical methods using six criteria. Three red criteria focus on validation: trueness (R1) recovery as relative error, precision (R2) as relative standard deviation, and limit of detection (R3) as the LOD. For greenness (G1), the ChlorTox Scale measures chemical risk based on the amount and hazards of reagents, with calculations done in an Excel tool. Energy use (G2/B2) is assessed for both carbon footprint and cost, while sample throughput (B1) estimates the number of analyses that can be carried out in 24 h. This simplified model balances effectiveness, sustainability, and efficiency, making evaluations quicker and easier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

Additionally, while LC-MS/MS has been applied to drug analysis in dog plasma, it is costly and complex, whereas the proposed HPLC-FD method is simpler, more cost-effective, and highly sensitive. Furthermore, a comprehensive stability study was performed in our work, unlike the previously reported LC-MS/MS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par71">The application of this method for bioanalytical validation in spiked human plasma has confirmed its suitability for bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic studies. It provides high sensitivity, acceptable recoveries, and low %RSD values, making it a promising tool for therapeutic drug monitoring. Although early elution of MTP was observed, the method still ensured acceptable recoveries in pure form, pharmaceutical dosage forms, and spiked human plasma. Several optimization attempts including the use of cationic and anionic ion-pairing agents, pH adjustments, and flow rate modifications were explored to delay MTP elution, but these did not significantly improve retention times. Nonetheless, the method remains highly effective for the intended analytical applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
