In this context, studies using sensors to measure factors such as ambient temperature or lighting are key to understanding their impact on the emotional wellbeing of older individuals. These technologies offer opportunities to monitor and adapt environments in real-time, enabling targeted interventions. It is widely recognised that aspects like noise levels, ambient temperature, or lighting can influence an individual&#x02019;s mood and overall wellbeing; however, it is crucial to further explore the effect of less studied factors. This review not only validates and questions popular beliefs about these factors but also highlights how the results can be useful for designing living environments that enhance the emotional wellbeing of the elderly and for establishing new directions in related research. By addressing these factors, this review provides actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and care providers to design environments that enhance the emotional wellbeing of older adults. Furthermore, this study not only validates previous knowledge but also highlights the need for future interdisciplinary interventions that integrate these factors holistically.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>designing for the elderly</kwd><kwd>environmental design</kwd><kwd>sensors</kwd><kwd>home health</kwd><kwd>information processing</kwd><kwd>knowledge acquisition</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-sensors-25-01071"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>It is now well recognised that when an individual performs a task, the ambient factors around them can influence the development and outcome of the activity. On occasions, the individuals may already be aware of these factors, and on others, they may be completely unforeseeable, making it even more complex to anticipate or mitigate the potential effects of the presence of such factors. The relationship between ambient factors and human wellbeing has been widely studied in environmental psychology, urban planning, and gerontology. Research has consistently shown that certain environmental conditions play a crucial role in shaping emotional and cognitive health. For older adults, these factors are particularly critical, as aging often brings increased vulnerability to environmental stressors, including sensory impairments, mobility limitations, and heightened physiological responses to temperature fluctuations.</p><p>Despite the growing recognition of these effects, much of the existing research has focused on younger and middle-aged populations, leaving a gap in understanding how ambient factors uniquely impact older adults. Furthermore, studies have traditionally examined individual environmental variables in isolation, rather than exploring their combined and interactive effects on wellbeing. Addressing these gaps is essential for developing comprehensive intervention strategies that can enhance the quality of life for aging populations, particularly in urban settings where environmental stressors are more pronounced.</p><p>Being aware of how environmental factors can affect the well-being of older adults is especially important and interesting in seeking to establish environments that enhance comfort, positive emotions, and a sensation of control or safety, key aspects in achieving greater physical and mental wellbeing, especially in older persons. The development and deployment of sensor-based technologies provide a unique opportunity to capture and analyse ambient factors in real-time. By leveraging data from environmental sensors, it becomes possible to design adaptive systems that respond to the specific needs of older adults, ensuring environments conducive to their emotional and physical wellbeing. For this reason, one of the primary research lines in applied psychology is the evaluation of the possible impact of certain factors on an individual&#x02019;s mood or mental state, being an area of great interest for numerous researchers [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, the number of works focusing on groups of older adults is limited and there exists no review of the literature on this topic.</p><p>Thus, the aim of the current research is to review, analyse, and interpret the results of the studies in the field. To this end, we analyse both the works focused on the ambient factors traditionally addressed, such as temperature or lighting, and those that examine factors we consider to be important and which are not typically assessed, specifically engagement in activities that combine physical and mental activity, the presence of natural environments, or the influence of the social environment.</p><p>To guide this review, we address the following research question: &#x0201c;How do ambient factors influence the emotional wellbeing of older adults, and what implications do these findings have for designing environments that foster their psychological health?&#x0201d;. By answering this question, this review aims to synthesize existing evidence, identify research gaps, and propose strategies for integrating environmental considerations into urban planning, healthcare settings, and policy frameworks.</p><p>The knowledge gained will be useful to design living environments for older people that favour a greater sensation of emotional wellbeing as well as also to establish new lines of future research.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-sensors-25-01071"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>Between June 2024 and October 2024, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. For the exploratory search, we established the following MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms: Built Environment, Home Environment, Social Environments, Well Being, Health Status, Physical Health, Mental Health, Spiritual Well Being, Life Satisfaction. The types of studies considered were controlled clinical trials and observational studies, case series and case reports, all conducted with older adult populations, excluding bibliographic reviews and articles reporting experts&#x02019; subjective opinions. Additionally, other inclusion and exclusion criteria were established, depending on format or content, as defined in <xref rid="sensors-25-01071-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The procedure implemented to conduct the systematic review followed the protocols of the PRISMA declaration (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the analysis was performed using the Covidence<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> platform [<xref rid="B8-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Particular attention was given to studies that utilized sensor technologies to measure environmental factors such as noise levels, temperature, and lighting. These studies were included due to their potential to inform real-time interventions through objective and continuous data collection. The studies retrieved were independently assessed by expert reviewers for possible publication bias.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-sensors-25-01071"><title>2.1. Data Collection</title><p>Before beginning the systematic review process, as a preliminary step, an initial search of studies related to the analysis of possible factors impacting the wellbeing of older adult populations was conducted in order to exclude terms that were found to be too broad and unnecessarily increased the sensitivity of the search. We were thus able to select more precise terms to enhance the specificity of the results. We selected the Scopus and PsycInfo databases for this search procedure.</p><p>As each database has its own thesaurus, each of the proposed search strings was adapted, combining indexed works and free terms. <xref rid="sensors-25-01071-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the strategy used in PsycInfo.</p><p>Finally, after selecting the most appropriate keywords, the strategy implemented in the definite search strategy was as follows: (&#x0201c;Physical Surroundings&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Living Conditions&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Family Environment&#x0201d;) AND (&#x0201c;Wellness&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Welfare&#x0201d;) OR (&#x0201c;Health Condition&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Physical State&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Physicals Conditions&#x0201d;) OR (&#x0201c;Psychic Well-Being&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Personal Satisfaction&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Emotional Stability&#x0201d;).</p><p>In addition to conducting the searches in the selected databases (Scopus and PsycInfo), we included the results of manually conducted searches of the foremost journals in the field (<xref rid="sensors-25-01071-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, an analysis of the grey literature (material not indexed by major databases) related to the area was conducted by consulting the opengrey.eu website.</p><p>After the search was completed, the results were exported to Covidence<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a tool designed to support the process of evaluating the studies retrieved through a systematic review.</p><p>Following the phases defined in <xref rid="sensors-25-01071-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the first step was to eliminate any duplicate publications. Then, we read the title and abstract in detail, excluding those that failed to match the topic matter under study. Finally, we reviewed the complete text of each publication, eliminating works that were found to be irrelevant according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Additionally, the process to select and exclude publications was assisted by the presence of two expert reviewers in the context, and a third reviewer, whose intervention was eventually unnecessary due to the high value of inter-rater reliability obtained, higher than 0.9 according to Cohen&#x02019;s kappa coefficient.</p><p>Especially important for the final selection of the qualitative, quantitative, and mixed studies was the assessment of their quality, for which we followed the protocol of &#x0201c;Questions to ask of research or evaluation evidence&#x0201d; from BEME Guide No. 1 [<xref rid="B9-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This yielded the final set of studies, and the data analysis phase could then begin.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-sensors-25-01071"><title>2.2. Data Analysis</title><p>In order to detect recurrent topics in the set of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed studies that could be summarised and catalogued under thematic headings, we used the Nvivo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 15 software [<xref rid="B10-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for the process of extracting and synthesising information. To ensure a systematic and structured analysis, we used Nvivo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 15 software, which facilitates the organization, coding, and synthesis of large volumes of qualitative data. Compared to manual reading, Nvivo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> offers greater consistency and efficiency, reducing the risk of human bias and enabling the identification of patterns and co-occurrences across multiple studies. One key advantage of Nvivo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is its ability to quantify qualitative trends, providing insights into the prevalence of specific ambient factors. However, its reliability depends on the quality of the initial coding framework. To mitigate this, we developed a predefined thematic structure based on prior literature and refined it iteratively through manual validation. While alternative software solutions such as ATLAS.ti and MAXQDA exist, we selected Nvivo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> due to its robust analytical capabilities and visualization tools, which allowed for a deeper exploration of relationships between environmental factors and emotional wellbeing. By combining Nvivo-assisted analysis with researcher validation, we ensured that the extrapolations were both accurate and contextually meaningful.</p><p>As part of this process, we categorized environmental factors as &#x0201c;influential&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;non-influential&#x0201d; based on their reported impact on emotional wellbeing in the reviewed studies. This classification does not imply statistical significance, as not all studies performed quantitative hypothesis testing. Instead, a factor was considered influential if multiple studies consistently reported qualitative or quantitative evidence of its effect, even in the absence of formal statistical validation. Conversely, a factor was classified as noninfluential if the reviewed studies provided either weak or inconclusive evidence regarding its impact. This distinction is essential to prevent misinterpretation, particularly in contrast with statistical significance, which applies only to studies with hypothesis-driven analyses. Our classification is based on a qualitative synthesis of the existing literature, ensuring that the findings reflect the weight of reported evidence rather than a purely statistical evaluation.</p><p>With the classification framework established, the analysis proceeded in three phases.</p><p>The aim of the first phase was to synthesise all the information obtained from the final selection of the 33 relevant retrieved studies. To this end, an open coding process was conducted, whereby the different categories related to each of the studies were recorded.</p><p>In the second phase, the categories were described and organised by topic, depending on the what, why, and how of the analysis of the factors influencing the wellbeing of older persons.</p><p>Finally, in the third phase, an interpretative process was conducted, with the aim of generating a summary report of the information obtained from each study and its conclusions. This final report was elaborated following the STORIS protocol (structured approach to the reporting in healthcare education of evidence synthesis) [<xref rid="B12-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-sensors-25-01071"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>The analysis of the impact of ambient factors on older persons&#x02019; wellbeing is currently a research area of significant interest, given that all the studies extracted were published after 2009, and eight between 2021 and 2024. The growing interest in this area aligns with the accelerated ageing of the global population, which presents unique challenges for creating environments that foster emotional wellbeing. Understanding how ambient factors influence older adults has not only scientific implications but also practical ones, such as informing public policy and developing targeted intervention strategies. Building on this growing interest, the studies reviewed exemplify the increasing focus on understanding the nuanced ways ambient factors shape wellbeing and provide critical insights into their psychological and physical impacts on older adults.</p><p>The reviewed studies highlight that interventions such as improved ventilation, noise reduction strategies, and access to natural environments can significantly enhance older adults&#x02019; emotional wellbeing. In practice, this means that urban planning should prioritise pedestrian-friendly, quieter zones with integrated greenery, while healthcare settings should leverage sensor-based monitoring to adjust indoor conditions in real time. These targeted interventions can help mitigate environmental stressors and promote sustainable, health-oriented design solutions for ageing populations.</p><p>As regards the target of the selected studies, although only 8 of the 33 works analyse both the impact on physical and mental wellbeing, it should be noted that the aim of the present review was primarily to retrieve research on the psychological influence. Thus, it is reasonable to expect a smaller number of studies assessing both aspects, and hence, we are unable to conclude which perspective, mental or physical wellbeing, generates greater research interest. This limitation presents an opportunity for future research to adopt a more holistic approach by integrating both physical and mental wellbeing outcomes. Examining these domains in conjunction would provide a more comprehensive understanding of how ambient factors influence older adults&#x02019; overall quality of life. For instance, chronic exposure to environmental noise has been shown to not only induce stress and anxiety but also contribute to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Similarly, inadequate lighting may negatively impact circadian rhythms, leading to disruptions in both sleep and mood regulation. By analysing these interactions, researchers can better understand the bidirectional relationships between physical and mental health and identify potential mediating variables. However, implementing such an integrative approach presents methodological and practical challenges. First, it requires multidisciplinary methodologies, incorporating physiological health assessments (e.g., biomarkers, sleep quality metrics, cardiovascular indicators) alongside psychological evaluations (e.g., mood scales, cognitive function tests). This necessitates collaboration across fields such as gerontology, psychology, medicine, and environmental science. Additionally, longitudinal study designs may be needed to track the long-term interactions between ambient factors, physical health deterioration, and mental wellbeing changes over time. Future studies could benefit from holistic approaches that examine how these domains interact, particularly in the context of ageing, where physical limitations often have cascading effects on emotional health. For instance, chronic exposure to environmental noise has been shown to exacerbate stress responses, potentially triggering both physical and psychological health declines. Older adults may be particularly susceptible to such effects due to age-related sensory and cognitive changes. Understanding these vulnerabilities highlights the importance of designing interventions that mitigate such environmental stressors. For instance, interventions could include soundproofing measures in care homes or promoting quieter community spaces to reduce stress and improve quality of life.</p><p>As regards the methods used, 32% of the studies administered questionnaires designed by the authors, while 7% employed standardised scales to measure capacities, and 13% relied on expert evaluations. The remaining studies focused on statistical analyses of specific events, such as hospitalisations, mortality rates, or the measurement of environmental parameters like noise or temperature levels. Consequently, nearly half of the studies (52%) were based on participants&#x02019; self-assessments through various questionnaires, while the remaining 48% relied on objective criteria, such as expert assessments or causal event analysis.</p><p>Self-assessments provide valuable insights into subjective experiences, but their reliance on individual perception introduces potential biases, including memory distortion and social desirability effects. To address these limitations, future research should adopt hybrid methodologies that integrate self-reports with objective physiological and behavioural data. Experience Sampling Methods (ESM), for instance, allow participants to provide real-time emotional state reports, reducing recall bias while maintaining subjective nuance. Additionally, passive data collection using wearable sensors&#x02014;such as heart rate variability monitors, accelerometers, and sleep trackers&#x02014;can offer physiological indicators that complement self-reported measures of emotional wellbeing.</p><p>A significant portion of the studies reviewed leveraged sensor technologies to enhance objectivity. These technologies enable the continuous and real-time monitoring of environmental and physiological variables, offering granular insights into how ambient conditions impact wellbeing. For example, calibrated sound level meters have provided precise measurements of noise exposure, photometric sensors have quantified lighting conditions, and thermal sensors have tracked temperature fluctuations. Moreover, AI-driven analytics allow for the identification of subtle patterns within these datasets, refining the correlation between environmental factors and emotional responses. Despite these advantages, implementing sensor-based research with older adults necessitates careful ethical considerations. Issues such as informed consent, data privacy, and potential discomfort with continuous monitoring must be addressed. Researchers should ensure clear and transparent communication about data collection procedures, emphasising how information will be used and securely stored. Employing robust anonymisation protocols and encryption techniques can help safeguard participants&#x02019; privacy while maintaining data integrity. Additionally, tailoring consent processes to the cognitive and technological literacy levels of older adults will enhance participant understanding and engagement. By balancing technological advancements with ethical responsibility, future research can maximise the benefits of sensor-based methodologies while preserving the autonomy and dignity of older individuals. The integration of advanced technologies, including big data analytics and AI-enhanced environmental monitoring, could further enrich the reliability of findings. Such methodological advancements will not only mitigate self-reporting biases but also pave the way for scalable and personalised interventions that optimise living environments for ageing populations.</p><p>Regarding the factors analysed and the results obtained, it is significant that weather, noise, and the social environment are by some distance the most widely studied elements and are all robustly associated with emotional wellbeing, although the works provide no clear conclusions on their level of effect on physical wellbeing due to a lack of research focus on this perspective. The influence of weather, noise, and social environment on emotional wellbeing in older adults can be explained through distinct psychological and physiological mechanisms. Weather conditions, particularly temperature extremes, have been linked to mood fluctuations due to their effects on thermoregulation and physiological stress responses. High temperatures can exacerbate discomfort, dehydration, and cardiovascular strain, which in turn may heighten anxiety and irritability. Conversely, exposure to natural light has been associated with improved mood regulation through its role in circadian rhythm alignment and serotonin production. Environmental noise primarily affects emotional health through its impact on stress and cognitive load. Chronic exposure to high noise levels has been shown to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to elevated cortisol levels and an increased risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Noise pollution also disrupts sleep quality, which is a critical factor for emotional stability, particularly in older adults who are more susceptible to sleep disturbances. Additionally, cognitive decline may reduce the ability to filter out background noise, making older individuals more vulnerable to the negative effects of persistent environmental noise. The social environment plays a dual role, acting as both a protective and a risk factor for emotional wellbeing. Strong social networks and frequent social engagement have been linked to lower rates of depression and anxiety, as they provide emotional support, cognitive stimulation, and a sense of belonging. On the other hand, social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased stress, higher levels of systemic inflammation, and an elevated risk of cognitive decline, highlighting the importance of social connectivity in later life. Moreover, the effects of these ambient factors are not uniform across all older adults. Subgroups such as individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions, those with sensory impairments (e.g., hearing loss), and those living in urban environments may experience heightened sensitivity to noise and environmental stressors. For example, older adults with cognitive decline may struggle more with noise pollution, as it can exacerbate confusion and agitation. Similarly, those with mobility issues may be more affected by extreme weather conditions due to limited access to temperature-controlled environments. Socioeconomic status also plays a role, as individuals in lower-income communities may have reduced access to quiet living spaces, green environments, and social engagement opportunities. Recognising these subgroup variations is crucial for designing targeted interventions. Urban planning strategies, such as creating quiet zones, integrating green spaces, and improving community infrastructure, can help mitigate environmental stressors. Additionally, personalised interventions, such as soundproofing solutions for individuals with hearing loss or structured social programs for isolated older adults, could enhance emotional resilience in specific populations. Future research should explore how multi-factorial interventions&#x02014;combining environmental modifications, social support, and adaptive technologies&#x02014;can more effectively promote emotional wellbeing across diverse older adult populations.</p><p>The only study that argues against weather having an impact on emotional wellbeing is that by [<xref rid="B28-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which is an especially significant work given the size of the sample, namely a million inhabitants of the United States over five years. Nonetheless, as underlined by the authors themselves when describing the limitations of their study, despite the conclusions being robust, studies have shown that the effects of climate can be substantially affected by moderator variables when making life satisfaction judgements. For example, ref. [<xref rid="B46-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported gender differences in the links between weather and life satisfaction, while [<xref rid="B47-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported significant random variation across individuals as regards the effects of weather. Thus, in the study by [<xref rid="B28-sensors-25-01071" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we cannot rule out the possibility of weather having substantial effects on significant subgroups, such as older persons, within our sample. A promising direction for future research lies in exploring the interactions between multiple ambient factors. For instance, how environmental noise might moderate the positive effects of green spaces. Additionally, it is essential to consider cultural and geographical differences, as perceptions of the environment and its impact can vary significantly across regions. Ensuring the representativity of diverse populations in future research requires methodological adjustments, including cross-cultural comparative studies, the use of region-specific datasets, and the incorporation of community-driven research approaches. Collaborating with local researchers and stakeholders can help design studies that account for culturally specific perceptions of environmental factors. Additionally, employing multi-site research designs across different geographical contexts can provide a broader understanding of how ambient factors influence wellbeing in varied settings. Cultural and geographical differences also play a crucial role in shaping the effectiveness of environmental interventions. For instance, while green spaces have been shown to improve emotional wellbeing, their impact may be moderated by cultural attitudes towards nature or the availability of public recreational areas. Similarly, social environments may have differing effects depending on societal norms surrounding ageing and community engagement. Recognising these variations is essential for tailoring interventions that are both effective and contextually relevant, ensuring that strategies such as urban planning, noise reduction measures, and social programs align with the specific needs and expectations of older adults in diverse populations. Understanding these interactions could guide the development of multifactorial interventions, such as combining noise reduction strategies with green space enhancement, to maximise benefits for emotional wellbeing. For instance, urban designs incorporating sound barriers alongside green spaces may amplify their individual benefits, creating restorative environments for older adults. Such designs would not only benefit older adults but also contribute to healthier, more inclusive urban environments for all age groups.</p><p>Finally, although the number of studies retrieved is smaller than for the previous factors, there is a clear consensus on the association between stress, lighting conditions, air quality, greenness, and music therapy and individuals&#x02019; psychological wellbeing. The findings on these factors highlight the need to consider these elements in the design of environments tailored for older adults. For example, personalised music therapy programmes in care homes or accessible green spaces in urban areas could serve as effective strategies to enhance the emotional wellbeing of this population. These findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to develop practical solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications, ultimately improving the quality of life for older adults. To foster effective interdisciplinary collaboration, structured frameworks such as living labs, joint research initiatives, and policy-driven partnerships should be implemented. Living labs bring together researchers, urban planners, healthcare professionals, and technologists to co-design and test environmental interventions in real-world settings. Similarly, joint research initiatives can be promoted through funding agencies and academic-industry partnerships, encouraging cross-disciplinary studies that integrate environmental design, psychological wellbeing, and healthcare innovations. Policy-driven collaborations with municipal governments and urban developers can help translate research findings into actionable public policies. The insights from these collaborations can be translated into practical solutions by designing restorative environments tailored to older adults&#x02019; needs. For instance, integrating sensor-based adaptive environments&#x02014;where real-time monitoring of noise, lighting, and air quality informs automated adjustments&#x02014;can enhance comfort and emotional wellbeing. Additionally, incorporating biophilic urban design, such as increased green spaces and therapeutic gardens, can promote relaxation and cognitive health. Community-based interventions, including structured social engagement programs and mobility-friendly urban planning, can further enhance the psychological resilience of older adults. By leverageing interdisciplinary expertise, future research can move beyond theoretical discussions to implementable solutions that improve the everyday experiences of ageing populations. Further longitudinal and large-scale studies are essential to validate these findings and refine interventions for diverse older populations. This calls for collaboration among urban planners, environmental psychologists, geriatricians, and technologists to ensure comprehensive and impactful solutions.</p><p>The findings of this review offer a clear response to the research question, confirming that ambient factors such as noise, weather, and social environment significantly shape the emotional wellbeing of older adults.

However, their relationship with physical health remains a less explored area, leaving open questions regarding the potential cumulative effects of prolonged exposure to certain environmental factors on the physical condition of older adults.</p><p>From an application perspective, these findings can be translated into concrete interventions across various domains. In urban planning, reducing noise levels, increasing access to green spaces, and designing environments that promote social interaction may enhance the wellbeing of this population. In healthcare and care institutions, the implementation of sensor-based environmental monitoring systems would allow real-time adjustments to optimise environmental conditions, while strategies such as music therapy could be integrated into psychological wellbeing programmes to reduce anxiety and improve emotional regulation. Furthermore, from a public policy perspective, it is crucial to develop regulations that ensure age-friendly environmental standards in residential areas and public spaces, fostering settings that minimise environmental stressors and promote emotional stability.</p><p>Despite advances in research on these topics, multiple questions remain that require further exploration in future studies. Firstly, most studies have addressed environmental factors in isolation, without considering their interactions. It is essential to investigate how the combination of factors, such as the joint influence of noise and greenery in stress reduction or the relationship between lighting and circadian rhythm regulation, may amplify or mitigate their effects on health. Additionally, while the link between environmental factors and mental wellbeing is well documented, their relationship with physical health remains an open question. Longitudinal studies analysing the long-term impact of these factors on cardiovascular, metabolic, or neurological health in older adults would provide a deeper understanding of their cumulative effects.</p><p>While previous studies have typically examined ambient factors in isolation, future research should explore how multiple factors interact to affect emotional wellbeing. For example, analysing the combined effects of noise reduction and green space exposure could offer valuable insights into how urban design can mitigate environmental stressors holistically. Similarly, investigating the interplay between lighting conditions and circadian rhythm regulation could enhance strategies for improving sleep quality and emotional stability in older adults. By incorporating multidisciplinary methodologies&#x02014;including sensor-based monitoring, longitudinal studies, and machine learning analytics&#x02014;future research can uncover hidden patterns and optimise interventions for ageing populations.</p><p>Another key aspect for future research is the evaluation of mitigation strategies. Although various interventions have been proposed, such as incorporating biophilic design in urban environments or applying music therapy programmes in care homes, empirical validation of their effectiveness across different contexts is necessary. Similarly, advances in smart technologies and the use of sensors to assess environmental parameters in real-time offer new opportunities to design adaptive environments that optimise temperature, noise, or lighting according to the specific needs of older adults. The application of big data analytics and machine learning in this field could revolutionise the way spaces are designed for healthy ageing.</p><p>Finally, it is essential to expand the representativeness of studies, as most reviewed research has been conducted in Western contexts, leaving unexplored how environmental factors affect older adults in different cultural and socio-economic settings. The inclusion of more diverse populations would allow for the development of more inclusive and tailored intervention strategies.</p><p>Overall, these findings provide a solid framework for future research at the intersection of environmental psychology and the wellbeing of older adults. The combination of traditional methodologies with emerging technological approaches will enable the design of more precise and effective interventions, moving towards the creation of environments that not only minimise the negative impacts of environmental factors but also actively enhance wellbeing and quality of life in an ageing population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
