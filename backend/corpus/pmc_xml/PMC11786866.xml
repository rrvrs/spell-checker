Conflicting priorities arose from differences in safety norms, worries about time, and beliefs about what saves time. Addressing these conflicting priorities, however, was rare.

New routines were often compromised under time pressure, while established habits showed resilience to time constraints.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rather than being workload-driven, time pressure emerged as a co-constructed outcome of conflicting priorities and the preservation of affective relationships. The imperative to save time motivated shared situational awareness and the formation of new mindful routines.

While patient safety was defined as the absence of harm, it is now seen as an active capability rooted in both system robustness and human behaviours [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>]. Adaptability and resilience have become recognised as essential capacities, enabling effective responses to unexpected events within an increasingly complex environment shaped by demographic changes, technological advancements, and specialised practices. Evidence suggests that hospitals with lower mortality rates do not necessarily experience fewer errors but are more adept at recovery and rescue [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The patterns of thought and action that underpin this adaptability are known as mindful practice [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, hospitals fail to turn periodic mindful practice into a consistent enduring habit of action and thought [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Surgical complication rates, for example, have remained largely unchanged over the past two decades [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In other words, hospitals fail to make the transition from episodic mindful practice to enduring mindful routines. Such routines might include performing safety checks with fidelity, habitual cross-monitoring during procedures, and inviting to speak up.</p><p id="p0040">Research suggests that a key barrier to this transition lies in the increasing focus on cost efficiency and revenue by senior managers, which contributes to time pressure [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At the team level, frontline workers often attribute suboptimal checklist performance and quality improvements to time pressure&#x02014;the sense of having too many demands on limited time [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The sense of time pressure can be caused by a high workload, but not necessarily [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0045">Most quality and safety improvement studies regard time pressure as an unavoidable constraint within which individuals must perform reliably to ensure patient safety [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Consequently, many studies focus on developing individual resilience and competence to handle substantial workloads [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>] and on mitigating adverse effects like fatigue and burnout [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective: we view time pressure not as an inevitable barrier to patient safety, nor solely as a matter of individual competence, but rather as a dynamic factor in developing mindful routines.</p><p id="p0050">The purpose of this article is to understand time pressure and how it interacts with the development of mindful routines in the context of patient safety.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Research team reflexivity</title><p id="p0055">The research team comprised five authors from diverse backgrounds: change management and psychology, medical humanities, educational sciences, surgery, and nursing studies. All data were collected by Mrs A. van Harten, the lead researcher, who acted as a senior change facilitator and crew resource management (CRM) trainer. As such she was familiar with the field and several participants of the specialty of the case. She had a trusting relationship with the management of the operating rooms and anaesthesia and gained trust from the management of the surgeons by presenting her plans and intentions on two occasions. During the CRM training she introduced herself and her motivations. The core team was informed in more detail about the theoretical and methodological background of the researcher.</p><p id="p0060">Given the importance of strong relationships with participants before, during, and after the study, there was a risk of biased observations and interpretations. However, as a trained consultant, coach, and psychologist, Mrs van Harten was equipped to reflect on her emotions, power dynamics, and interests. Throughout the study, she recorded reflections in a diary and discussed her role and observations in biweekly sessions with Dr L. Fluit who deliberately acted as a critical friend asking questions about presumptions and methodological decisions [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Setting</title><p id="p0065">The study was done in a Dutch academic hospital. The case entails the interprofessional surgical team of one specialty (approximately 45 persons) involving all surgeons, residents, operating room (OR) nurses, anaesthetists and anaesthesia nurses. The surgeons were mostly male the nurses mostly female. The anaesthesia nurses and physicians were mixed male and female.</p><p id="p0070">The team enrolled in a CRM training programme involving 1&#x000a0;h of e-learning followed by a one-day group training. The training aimed to enhance awareness of their own human fallibility, risky team behaviours, and safe practices. Some surgeons viewed the CRM training as an externally imposed obligation. A core team, formed from team representatives, was tasked with improving work methods. They prioritised enhancing Situational Awareness (SA) through daily briefings at the start of the day and encouraging "speak-up". These briefings&#x02014;distinct from the pre-incision time-out&#x02014;enabled the team to know each other, align on daily planning, and discuss patient procedures, risks, and resource availability. While familiar to the anaesthetists and nurses, this routine was new to most surgeons.</p><p id="p0075">Each surgical specialty has a multidisciplinary workplace management team (comprising a nurse, anaesthetist, and surgeon) that coordinates weekly operating room schedules. Members of this team also participated in the core team.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0080">A naturalistic case study design [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] suits the explorative aim of the study. This means that we studied the setting in-depth to understand a single demarcated entity. This multidisciplinary surgical team, chosen for their commitment to implementing Crew Resources Management (CRM) and a new mindful routine (a daily briefing), provided an ideal context for studying time pressure and its relation to mindful routines. Furthermore, we wanted to study time pressure in a surgical specialty with almost only elective patients instead of a specialty with many acute patients. This surgical team met that requirement. This way the case offered most learning potential, one of the main selection criteria in case study research [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This academic hospital was chosen, because the researcher was familiar with the culture and procedures of the operating rooms as a result of her position as a consultant in this hospital.</p><p id="p0085">Data were collected by the first author over ten months through participant observations in the operating room, handovers, morbidity and mortality meetings, and CRM training sessions; semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders; and informal conversations (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Observations and self-reflections were recorded in a field diary. The stakeholders interviewed at the start of the study were selected to gain insight in: all perspectives on safety, their perceptions of their influence, their interest in and comments on the (preliminary) research question.

The prevailing belief was that &#x0201c;a good surgeon is a quick surgeon.&#x0201d; Delays in induction adversely impacted the average operating time, defined as the interval from the start of induction to the closure of the wound. Consequently, some surgeons exhibited irritability and restlessness when induction took longer than anticipated, even during periods of low workload. The waiting period induced a sense of pressure for both those waiting and those being waited on (quote 1). This deference to speed was evident across all professions, including anaesthetists (vignette 1).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.1.2"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Preoccupation with productivity</title><p id="p0115">Another significant cultural aspect was a preoccupation with productivity, defined as the amount of work completed within a given timeframe. This preoccupation was reflected in the managerial language used by Nurse Jennifer and Surgeon Jeroen when discussing operating room occupancy (vignette 2). It was also reflected in Jeroen's tendency to weigh the opinions of fellow surgeons, some of whom considered the briefing a waste of time, against the nurses' perspective, who viewed the briefing as a time-saving measure. The briefing helped the nurses in anticipating on required materials later in the day. Most surgeons were benevolent towards the new routine due to its potential to expedite processes and because their surgical specialty was among the last to adopt this routine.</p><p id="p0120">Quote 2 from the medical head illustrates that the preoccupation with productivity stemmed not from economic motives but from professional pride. The department manager made clear (quote 3) that the urge to &#x02018;produce&#x02019;, was not imposed on the team by her. In fact, she preferred lower production rates, as overproduction was not being paid for.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.1.3"><label>3.1.3</label><title>Avoiding conflict and pursuing conflicting priorities</title><p id="p0125">A third characteristic of the team was the tendency to avoid conflict while pursuing conflicting priorities. The value placed on team cohesion, especially between surgeons and operating room nurses, was significant (quote 4). The core team routinely engaged in small talk to strengthen bonds, fostering numerous personal connections among surgeons and surgical nurses. Surgeons expressed a reliance on nurses for smooth and efficient processes (quote 5). However, the focus on maintaining affective relationships led to tension when team members faced conflicting priorities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Preventing or responding to time pressure</title><sec id="sec3.2.1"><label>3.2.1</label><title>Creating Situational Awareness</title><p id="p0130">Team members endeavoured to avoid conflicts regarding their priorities when possible.

He adhered to a long-standing personal habit of calling the nurses the day before to inform them of the materials and instruments he would require. Vignette 4 highlights how he established SA, control, and pacing for himself during procedures. The spinoff was that he created SA for the team as well, effectively preventing time pressure.

In contrast, the established routine of weekly morbidity and mortality meetings was consistently conducted and usually attended by all residents and most consultants, even though participants did not regard them as particularly informative (quote 6). These meetings were mandatory for all departments involved in accredited training programmes for interns and residents, though their frequency varied by department. The established time-out procedure before incision was also always executed, regardless of its perceived contribution to safety (quote 7).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0145">This paper emerges from findings indicating that frontline workers often cite time pressure as a barrier to achieving quality and safety improvement goals at the team level.

Lingard et al. [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] describe this careful interrelating in the operating room as: &#x02018;a complicated &#x0201c;dance&#x02019;&#x02019; that maintains relationships and minimises tension while still achieving goals.&#x02019; Edmondson [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] suggests that strong affective relationships enhance the willingness to assist one another, contributing to the psychological safety necessary for sharing information across professional and hierarchical boundaries.</p><p id="p0155">However, our findings suggest that this approach also inhibited team members from addressing conflicting priorities and signalling time-related issues. &#x0201c;It had to be in your character and your age&#x0201d; (vignette 3) to dare addressing the issue of ending in time. This distinguishes careful from heedful relating. Careful relating aims to establish affective relationships. Heedful relating [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] aims to connect distributed activities and information in which individuals subordinate their personal interests (such as avoiding conflict) to those of the system. The more heedfully the interrelating is done, the more capable of intelligent action the collective mind is [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Collective mind conceptualized as a pattern of actions driven by connected distributed knowledge.</p><p id="p0160">Both Nurse Jennifer and Surgeon George fostered SA through their unique styles of heedful relating, effectively mitigating time pressure. Yet, these approaches were perceived as privileges associated with their positions, rather than as exemplary practices. Such a culture sustains time pressure.</p><p id="p0165">We conclude that time pressure did not stem from a workload imposed by management; rather, it was co-created through the pursuit of differing priorities while maintaining affective relations. Therefore, addressing conflicting priorities and practising heedful relating sometimes alleviated time pressure, though these practices were not standard.</p><p id="p0170">Further qualitative research is needed to explore how teams can develop skills to address conflicting priorities, engage in heedful relating, and develop collective mind.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Time pressure as a motivator for mindful routines</title><p id="p0175">Our observations revealed that the team was preoccupied with time, speed and productivity [vignette 1, 2 and 4, quote 1, 2].

At this level maximum working hours, CRM training programmes, obligatory morbidity and mortality meetings, redundant staffing are secured. Other studies indicate that a preoccupation with productivity or profitability at the organisational level can undermine the conditions necessary for effective functioning in the operating room [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Habits for withstanding time pressure</title><p id="p0190">Our results suggest that once a habit is established - such as the time out (quote 7) or the morbidity and mortality meeting (quote 6)- the original rationale for the habit may become irrelevant to its execution, and time pressure ceases to be a threat. Neal et al. [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] state that habits are not influenced by people's goals. Even moderately strong habits require substantial conscious effort to change [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

As noted by Resident Jorin (vignette 2), the anaesthetic team had developed differing convictions regarding safety and excellence compared to surgeons (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In the Netherlands, these beliefs have been embedded in anaesthetic training for decades. An article discussing the evolution of the patient safety movement highlights the long-standing connection between anaesthesiology and patient safety [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Yet, as indicated by Bernhard's quote (vignette 1), not all anaesthetists have yet altered their unconscious convictions.</p><p id="p0200">Creating cues to draw attention to patient safety risks requires less time than changing ingrained social behaviours. All elements of the new briefing routine pertained to patient safety risks. However, signalling the same risks for identical procedures daily can feel like "ticking boxes," leading to procedural decay [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesise that merely creating cues to signal risks is insufficient to support a consistent daily briefing. The immediate reward of saving time&#x02014;a strong preoccupation receiving considerable conscious attention&#x02014;contributed to the establishment of the new routine, alongside the fact that the routine was cued and repeated daily. The subsequent challenge is to execute all aspects of the briefing attentively and to prevent procedural decay, as noted by core team members (vignette 2) and supported by other studies [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p id="p0205">It is practically relevant for designing routines, that the likelihood of consistent performance increases when a routine is positively associated with a preoccupation.</p><p id="p0210">The observation that the established routine of morbidity and mortality meetings was not highly valued aligns with findings from other studies [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Nonetheless, this existing routine is performed automatically, even under time pressure, as it does not demand significant conscious attention (bandwidth) [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This presents an opportunity to optimise the routine. Promising initiatives regarding morbidity and mortality meetings include involving patients in discussions, conducting online meetings, and evaluating successful procedures through resilience concepts [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>].
