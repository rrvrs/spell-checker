To verify CiPSCs&#x02019; capacity to differentiate into retinal organoids (ROs), we induced CiPSCs from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by defined small-molecule compounds and successfully differentiated the CiPSCs into three-dimensional ROs, in which all major retinal cell types and retinal genes were in concordance with those in vivo. We transplanted retinal photoreceptors from ROs into the subretinal space of <italic>retinal degeneration</italic> mouse models and the cells could integrate into the host retina, establish synaptic connections, and significantly improve the visual functions of the murine models. This proof-of-concept study for the first time demonstrated that CiPSCs could differentiate into ROs with a full spectrum of retinal cell types, and provided new insights into chemical approach-based retinal regeneration for degenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Reprogramming</kwd><kwd>Induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>Stem-cell differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100010905</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China | Major Research Plan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>92368206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Zi-Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100010909</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China | Young Scientists Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82125007</award-id><award-id>82201205</award-id><award-id>82101137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Chang-Jun</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Zi-Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z231100007223005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Zi-Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004826</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality (Beijing Natural Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z200014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Zi-Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Since the adult mammalian retina holds negligibly intrinsic regeneration capacities, retinal degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), and Stargardt&#x02019;s diseases, could lead to an irreversible loss of photoreceptor cells, thereby causing vision impairment and eventual blindness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Currently, clinical interventions can temporarily slow down, but not reverse the deterioration of the diseases, and even worse is that there is no efficacious treatment for patients in the advanced stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The introduction of pluripotent stem cell-derived photoreceptors for cell replacement therapy provides a promising way to cure retinal degenerative diseases.</p><p id="Par3">Photoreceptors play critical roles in the visual formation and physiology of the retina. Photoreceptors are the primary light-sensing cells and reside at the outer layer of the neural retina. The human retina contains one type of rod and three types of cones. The rods are responsible for dark vision, providing vision in low-intensity light conditions, whereas cones are responsible for bright vision, allowing trichromatic and high-acuity visual perception. Photoreceptors have obvious polarity with the outer segments at the apical side for photoelectric conversion and photoreceptor hyperpolarization. Then the hyperpolarization signal is transmitted through bipolar, and amacrine cells to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and the signal finally is transferred in the form of diverse parallel processing channels to the brain. As the central unit of visual perception, photoreceptors play an absolutely vital role in visual formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Nowadays, various studies are focusing on obtaining donor photoreceptor cells for transplantation through three-dimensional (3D) retinal organoids (ROs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The RO is an organic conjugate of various cell types formed by the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in a specific induction environment, exhibiting somewhat similar functionality as the retina in vivo. The ROs have shown great potential in cell transplantation studies. In 2011, Sasai team demonstrated the differentiation of first 3D ROs from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. They generated fully stratified ROs which closely mimicked in vivo retinogenesis and consisted of all major neural retinal components including photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, revealing a new approach for the production of photoreceptors in vitro. Subsequently, other groups transplanted mouse ESC- and mouse induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal cells into the subretinal space of advanced <italic>retinal degeneration</italic> mouse. The implanted graft survived well and formed direct synaptic connections with the host bipolar cells, which shed light on a more effective and lasting therapy strategy for advanced retinal degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Currently, several studies have been carried out to explore the application of human PSCs-derived 3D ROs in transplantation therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">ESCs and iPSCs are frequently used in generating ROs, ensuring an almost infinite supply of cells for regenerative treatments. ESCs are established by expanding the inner cell mass cells isolated from blastocyst in vitro. However, in order to obtain ESCs, the embryo must be destroyed, which would lead to ethical problems. Moreover, ESCs are allogeneic sources which would trigger the acute and chronic immune rejection responses in host. Currently, a majority of iPSC lines are obtained through the ectopic expression of defined factors (Yamanaka factors). Although patient-specific iPSCs can avoid immune rejection and ethical problems, the genetic manipulation in reprogramming could potentially alter the genome which limits their clinical applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Recently, Rouhani et al. found that strong selection pressure during somatic cell reprogramming to iPSCs by Yamanaka factors could introduce somatic mutations in iPSC lines, such as mutations in BCOR, a cancer-related gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This calls for more secure reprogramming methods such as using small chemical compounds which can redirect cell signaling pathways and thereby replace exogenous transcription factors to transform cell fates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In 2013, Deng and colleagues successfully reprogrammed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) using a cocktail of seven small molecules without any exogenous genes. The CiPSCs resemble ESCs in terms of their gene expression profile, epigenetic status, and potential for differentiation and germline transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, CiPSCs can be established from autologous somatic cells, and consequently no ethical issues or immune rejection problems will occur. Meanwhile, there are no exogenous transcription factors introduced during the reprogramming procedure. Therefore, it addresses the safety concerns that exogenous DNA fragments or viruses would disrupt genome integrity. Overall, this chemical reprogramming strategy is of great potential in generating functional cell types for clinical applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">However, CiPSCs were successfully established rather recently, and little is known about its in vitro differentiation capacity, specifically on 3D retinal differentiation. It is intriguing to identify the differentiation efficiency, the sensitivity to various small molecules, the expression of the related genes, and the functional integrity of tissues during CiPSCs differentiation. The CiPSC-derived 3D ROs constitute ideal cell sources for cell transplantation treatment, thereby providing a new strategy for retinal transplantation therapy for retinal degenerative diseases.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, CiPSCs were established from MEFs by the chemical reprogramming method described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and differentiated in 3D ROs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> with optimized protocols. It was observed that CiPSC-derived 3D ROs were polarized, stratified and contained all retinal cell types. The expression patterns of retinal genes were similar to those of in vivo. Importantly, the visual function of retinal degenerative mice was partially rescued by transplanted CiPSC-photoreceptors. This study established new approaches to induce somatic cells into retinal organoids by relying entirely on small molecules and thus provided new cell sources for clinical replacement therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of CiPSCs by defined small-molecule compounds</title><p id="Par9">In order to effectively trace the generation of CiPSCs, <italic>Oct4</italic> promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter MEFs (OG-MEFs), a reporting system for pluripotent marker, were employed. According to the previously developed method, it takes about 40 days to induce MEFs into CiPSCs by small-molecule compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). As early as day 5 (D5, same abbreviation in below), there were a number of epithelial colonies formed.

Next, the pluripotent cell markers of CiPSCs were determined at mRNA and protein levels. The pluripotency-associated proteins Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA4 could be identified by immunostaining of CiPSCs colonies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).

Last, the differentiation potentials of CiPSCs were further examined. In vitro differentiation test showed that CiPSCs could differentiate into different cell types of three germ layers (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>). As previously described, teratoma formation experiment is the gold standard for verifying whether the cells possess pluripotency, and HE staining is a commonly used method for identifying the germ layers of teratoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. CiPSCs were able to form teratoma after injected into immune-deficient SCID mice, and we could identify representative tissues of the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm in the generated teratoma by HE staining, such as the endoderm: pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelioid respiratory epithelium, and stratified squamous epithelioid gastrointestinal epithelium, the mesoderm: the large, round and empty adipose tissue, and cylindrical, multinucleated, striated muscle tissue, the ectoderm: blackened melanin tissue, and rich cytoplasm, acidophilic keratinized beads, which confirmed that the injected cells have the ability to differentiate into three germ layers, demonstrating their pluripotency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>).

During the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), the majority of cell aggregates developed neuroepithelium at D5, and a few optic vesicle-like structures appeared at D7 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). For ROs differentiation, the D7 EBs were transferred into retinal maturation medium, and more optic cup-like structures formed at D10 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).
