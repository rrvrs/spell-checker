Approximately 30% of the global human population is infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, primarily through ingestion of food and water contaminated with sporulated oocysts shed by infected cats, consumption of undercooked or raw meat containing tissue cysts, or via congenital transmission from infected mothers to their fetuses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection has significant veterinary (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and public health implications, often remaining asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals but causing severe disease in those with compromised immune systems, such as HIV-infected patients and other immunocompromised individuals (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In pregnant women, primary infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> can result in tachyzoite invasion across the placental barrier, potentially leading to spontaneous abortion or congenital birth defects (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The parasite's broad host range is attributed to its effective mechanisms for host invasion and immune modulation.</p><p>Within the cytoplasm of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, three types of secretory organelles are present: micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. Micronemes and rhoptries release their contents from the apical pole of the parasite, while dense granules discharge from the apical, lateral, and posterior regions (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The release of these organelles' contents follows a well-defined cascade. Upon contact with host cells, micronemes are involved in the trafficking and sequestration of binding ligands for host cell receptors, and ensure the appropriate release of these ligands in high concentration at the very tip of the parasite, in response to external stimuli that sense contact with the host cell surface (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Subsequently, the contents of the rhoptries (ROP1-ROP9) are secreted, rhoptries are unique secretory organelles shared by all Apicomplexan invasive stages. They are exocytosis upon host cell invasion and their contents are involved in creating the moving junction that propels the parasite in the cell and in building the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in which the parasite will develop (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The exocytosis of dense granule proteins occurs both during and after parasite invasion into the PV (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These proteins either remain soluble within the PV lumen or associate with the PV membrane and the tubulo-reticular membrane network within the PV. It is believed that these GRA proteins modify the PV environment, contributing to the parasite's intracellular survival and replication. Notably, GRA proteins are constitutively released in a calcium-independent manner prior to host cell entry and form a significant portion of the excretory/secretory proteins (ESP) of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><p>Several GRA proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic> have been extensively studied for their roles in various cellular processes. For instance, GRA2, GRA4, GRA6, and GRA12 are involved in constructing the intravacuolar network, enabling interparasite connectivity within the parasitophorous vacuole and bridging them to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). GRA7 facilitates the formation of tubulo-structures sequestering host organelles at the PVM, and GRA15, a polymorphic effector, activates the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). GRA16, 18, and 24 extend modulating host gene expression (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). GRA22 and GRA41 are crucial for parasite egress, whereas GRA25, mainly stimulates the expression of chemokines (Such as CCL2 and CXCL1) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Recently, GRA23 has been identified as a secretory protein in <italic>T. gondii</italic> that facilitates the transfer of small molecules between the PV and the host cell cytoplasm, providing a molecular basis for how the parasite acquires nutrients from host cells (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, the specific host proteins interacting with GRA23 remain unidentified. Therefore, we designed this study to identify these interacting proteins, aiming to provide deeper insights into the functional mechanisms of GRA23 and enhancing our under-standing of the interplay between <italic>T. gondii</italic> and its host proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Ethical statement</title><p>All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by Animal Welfare and Research Ethics Committee at Jilin University (IACUC Permit No. SY202407014).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Parasite, cell culture and antibodies</title><p>The serial propagation of tachyzoites from the <italic>T. gondii</italic> RH strain was conducted in monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs).

The HEK293T cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, USA). The antibodies used in this study included anti-HA tag (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-GST tag (Abcam), and rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant GRA23 (prepared as described below).</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 Production of recombinant GST-tagged GRA23 protein</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using an Ambion RNA kit and reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers with the SuperScript&#x02122; II kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. PCR primers were designed (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) to amplify the GRA23 gene using <italic>T. gondii</italic> genomic DNA as template. The amplicons were digested with <italic>Sma</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I restriction enzymes and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified DNA was ligated into the pET-41a expression vector (pre-digested with the corresponding enzymes) using T4 DNA ligase at 16&#x000b0;C overnight. The constructed plasmids were extracted and verified by sequencing. The successfully constructed expression plasmid was designated pET-41a-GRA23.</p><p>For protein expression, pET-41a-GRA23 was transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells, with the empty pET-41a vector serving as negative control and non-transformed cells as blank. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM Isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16&#x000b0;C for 8 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed by sonication, and the expressed proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant GRA23-GST fusion protein was purified using glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. The purified protein was validated by Western blot analysis using anti-GRA23 antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Preparation of GRA23 polyclonal antibody</title><p>To generate polyclonal antibodies against GRA23, purified recombinant GRA23-GST fusion protein (immunogen) was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (1:1 ratio) and thoroughly emulsified. New Zealand white rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 400 &#x003bc;g of protein per rabbit at multiple sites. For booster immunizations, the GRA23 protein was mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (1:1 ratio), emulsified, and administered weekly for three consecutive weeks. One week after the final immunization, blood was collected by cardiac puncture to obtain immune serum, which was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The specificity of the anti-GRA23 polyclonal antibody was confirmed by Western blot analysis using <italic>T. gondii</italic> whole protein lysate, with goat anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher) as the secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 GST pull-down and LC-MS/MS analysis</title><p>Recombinant GRA23-GST protein was immobilized onto Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin and equilibrated with GST binding buffer. Vero cell lysate was used to extract total proteins, and then incubated with the immobilized GRA23-GST fusion protein or GST alone (control) at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h with gentle rocking. After incubation, the resin was washed thoroughly with GST binding buffer to remove non-specifically bound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted using reduced glutathione solution and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for further analysis. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands unique to the GRA23-GST pull-down (compared to GST control) were excised and submitted to Shanghai Bio-profile Biotechnology Co., Ltd. for identification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</p></sec><sec><title>2.6 Gene ontology /Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis</title><p>Mass spectrometry data were analyzed using ProteinPilot software to identify proteins, followed by Wayne diagram analysis. After subtracting proteins identified in the control group, the remaining proteins from the experimental group were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) annotation to elucidate their molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes.

Its intricate pathogenicity hinges significantly on the interactions with host cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Recent advancements in molecular biology and proteomics have substantially facilitated profound investigations into the <italic>T. gondii</italic>-host cell dynamics (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). GRA23, as an integral component of the dense granule protein family, potentially modulates host cell bioactive factors, thereby impacting metabolic pathways and immune responses, which consequently may promote <italic>T. gondii</italic>'s intracellular invasion, parasitism, and proliferation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This study expands on earlier research by Gold et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) by identifying GRA23-interacting proteins using proteomics and biochemical approaches. The current study employs robust experimental techniques, including pull-down assays, mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), to validate interactions. These methodologies are appropriate and consistent with those used in leading research on <italic>T. gondii</italic> virulence factors (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, a more detailed analysis of the functional consequences of these interactions, such as their impact on host cell viability, immune evasion, or parasite replication, would strengthen the scientific merit. Additionally, integrating data from high-confidence protein-protein interaction mapping (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) could provide a more comprehensive view of GRA23&#x02032;s role in host modulation.</p><p>In the GST pull-down screening for interacting proteins, the procurement of purified fusion proteins is fundamentally essential (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In order to preserve the biological activity of these proteins, we specifically focus on obtaining soluble fusion proteins during the purification process, thus effectively reducing the incidence of false positives in our screenings. Through the systematic employment of GST pull-down and mass spectrometry methodologies, we utilized GRA23 as bait to identify interacting host proteins. Following stringent screening protocols, we successfully identified 35 candidate proteins that interact positively with GRA23. Subsequent GO and KEGG analyses prominently highlighted significant enrichment of these proteins in metabolic and immune-related pathways, such as dicarboxylate metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby suggesting substantial shifts in <italic>T. gondii</italic>'s biosynthesis and metabolism subsequent to host cell invasion.</p><p>Notably, we confirmed the precise interactions between GRA23 and two candidate proteins, PEX3 and TRAP1, through the utilization of BiFC and co-IP methodologies. PEX3 and TRAP1, which are implicated in peroxisome biogenesis and modulation of host inflammatory responses, respectively, strongly suggest that GRA23 might strategically modulate peroxisomal functions through PEX3, thereby altering host metabolic pathways and potentially redirecting resources to support parasitic growth or undermining host defense mechanisms. Additionally, PEX3 play a critical role in lipid metabolism, and lipids are essential nutrients required for the proliferation of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. By affecting the function of PEX3, GRA23 may alter the lipid metabolism of host cells, providing more lipid resources to support the growth and reproduction of the parasite. These findings are aligned with recent discoveries in <italic>T. gondii</italic> secretory protein functions (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Furthermore, TRAP1, predominantly localized within mitochondria, functions as a crucial chaperone facilitating protein folding and protecting cells from stress-induced damage (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Although this study identified the interaction between <italic>T. gondii</italic> GRA23 and host proteins, there are still some limitations. The research primarily relied on <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture models, which cannot fully replicate the complex physiological environment of the host during natural infection. Additionally, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments often use high-expression systems or artificially induced conditions, which may lead to protein overexpression or non-physiological localization, thereby affecting the authenticity and functional interpretation of the interactions. The observed GRA23-TRAP1 interaction therefore suggests that the parasite may advantageously leverage TRAP1&#x02032;s chaperoning capabilities to stabilize its proteins within the host environment, potentially compromising cellular stress defense mechanisms and consequently increasing susceptibility to damage. Subsequent studies could involve constructing <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains with GRA23 gene knockout to observe changes in their proliferation, survival, and virulence within host cells. Additionally, analyzing the expression levels of peroxisomal and chaperone-related markers in infected animal tissues would help validate the functional significance of the GRA23-PEX3 and GRA23-TRAP1 interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>. In summary our study has successfully identified and rigorously validated interactions between GRA23 and host proteins PEX3 and TRAP1, thereby elucidating GRA23&#x02032;s multifaceted role in key host cell processes such as reproduction, growth, and development. This research not only significantly deepens our understanding of GRA23&#x02032;s molecular mechanisms but also provides critical insights and potential therapeutic targets for developing novel strategies against <italic>T. gondii</italic> infections, thus offering promising new avenues for its prevention and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5 Conclusions</title><p>This study identified and validated novel interactions between <italic>T. gondii</italic> GRA23 and host proteins PEX3 and TRAP1 through pull-down assays, mass spectrometry, BiFC, and Co-IP.
