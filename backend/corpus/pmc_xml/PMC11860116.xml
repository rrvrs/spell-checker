4.3%(58) of students&#x02019; inherent anxiety was low, 62.3%(845) was moderate, and 33.4%(453) were high, while 4.2%(57) had low anxiety and 42.4% (575) were anxious due to the student&#x02019;s situation. had moderate anxiety and 53.4% (724) had high anxiety.</p><p>According to the research, 69.9% (948) had a low level of motivation, 23.4% (317) had a below-average level, 5.6% (76) had an average level, and 1.1% (15) had an above or higher level.</p><p>There is a weak inverse relationship between congenital anxiety and the course of study (r=-0.054*), and a weak inverse relationship between age (r=-0.048).
