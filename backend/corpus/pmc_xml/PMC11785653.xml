Patients who experience HSCT report considerable negative psychological effects from the need for protective isolation.

It is used to treat haematological malignancies which are now the 5th most common cancer in the UK. Approximately 37,320 cases are diagnosed every year and 1 in 19 people will be diagnosed with a haematological malignancy at some point during their life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Between 2006 and 2019, the average annual number of HSCTs increased by 5% per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HSCT involves suppressing the immune system through &#x02018;conditioning therapy&#x02019; (chemotherapy and possibly total body irradiation) to minimise the risk of healthy new stem cells being rejected by the body&#x02019;s immune system. However, this does increase the risk of infection and can lead to neutropenic sepsis, which is the prominent cause of death for patients receiving HSCT.</p><p id="Par6">Consequently, protective isolation is used for infection control during HSCT. Protective isolation typically involves single-occupancy rooms for strict isolation and the restriction of visitors, and when discharged, standard practice requires patients to continue rigorous self-isolation for at least 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The intensity of this isolation in addition to treatment effects makes HSCT immensely challenging for patients.</p><p id="Par7">It has been suggested that 20% of patients who experience ongoing health challenges, such as a haematological disorder or malignancy, have an increased risk of developing depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This probability may be increased during HSCT due to the strict conditions of protective isolation and inadequate and controlled interaction with friends, family, and staff. There is also a concern that mental health issues may affect a patient&#x02019;s health and recovery. This may potentially lead to longer stays in hospital and further costs to healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. After HSCT, patients were found to be at greater risk of negative psychological effects due to low satisfaction with visiting hours and not receiving adequate emotional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When asked about visiting hours, most patients wanted less restrictions and the ability to spend more time with their loved ones. However, in contrast, other patients chose not to socialise with visitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] as they perceived family and friends as a cause of further distress and so preferred to be alone. Importantly for most patients, their emotional well-being depended on contact with friends and family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, visitors are prospectively a source of infection as pathogens have been identified in the hands of visitors and emphasised the need for immunocompromised patients to have restrictions on visitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Search strategy</title><p id="Par8">This integrative, descriptive review followed the five stages proposed by Whittemore and Knafl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]: namely (1) problem identification, (2) literature search, (3) data evaluation, (4) data analysis, and (5) presentation. An integrative review is a specific review method that allows for the inclusion of a range of methodologies and combines empirical or theoretical literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of a particular phenomenon of concern. This review aimed to be as comprehensive as possible. The review focused on qualitative studies&#x02014;those that use open-ended techniques, such as interviews and non-statistical techniques for analysis as qualitative studies allow concepts to be evaluated in context (e.g. how the experiences of patients in protective isolation impact psychological health). Searches were completed between November 2022 and March 2023. After an initial scoping search, inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> in the Appendix) were developed to assist with refining the search. Using these criteria, a search of academic databases including CINAHL, Proquest, Medline, and ASSIA was performed using the keywords HSCT, protective isolation, psychological effects, and synonyms haematological stem cell transplant, bone marrow transplant, BMT, psychological impact, and emotional impact (both independently and combined using Boolean operators, such as &#x02018;and&#x02019;). Parameters of the search strategy were a date restriction from 2016 to 2023, research written in English, and included published peer-reviewed papers. Reference lists provided further sources of information through cited articles and books authored prior to 2016. These were included only if the title focused on psychological challenges that HSCT patients may face or added benefit or clarity to the review.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study selection</title><p id="Par9">Screening of research gathered from the search was completed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which also enabled the different phases of the search, application of inclusion/exclusion criteria, omission of unsuitable papers, and final included studies to be clearly documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>PRISMA flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="520_2025_9186_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Quality appraisal and data extraction</title><p id="Par10">The final included papers were reviewed for quality using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The CASP tool consists of 10 questions: 9 addressing quality and 1 addressing &#x02018;value&#x02019; (contribution to existing literature). All studies used a qualitative approach due to the focus of the research being on patient experiences and were considered to be of mixed quality by both authors (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> in the Appendix). Study risk of bias was also assessed using CASP and each author assessed each study independently and in duplicate with disagreements resolved through consensus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Findings</title><p id="Par11">The initial search strategy identified 154 records. The PRISMA flowchart (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) demonstrates the process used to exclude studies. Five studies remained and were used in this review. The findings of the primary papers are summarised in tabular form with descriptions of the key characteristics of each (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> in the Appendix).</p><p id="Par12">The five studies included all used qualitative methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The studies were carried out in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Iran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There were no studies identified that have been completed in the UK. Four of the studies involved semi-structured interviews with 60 patients who had received HSCT treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One study was conducted by a survey completed by 441 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Two of the interviews were carried out by nurse researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], one was by a trained psychiatrist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and one was by the author who had 10&#x000a0;years&#x02019; experience within the subject area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One study focused on patients throughout treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The other four studies were carried out post-HSCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Two studies explored the impact of protective isolation during HSCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The other three studies explored the overall impact of HSCT treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Inductive thematic analysis was performed following the three stages described by Thomas and Harden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The first author applied the process outlined by Thomas and Harden and identified themes based on the psychological effects of protective isolation in HSCT. The second author independently reviewed each paper assessing for common themes, and after discussion, the final four themes were agreed upon: (1) feeling disconnected, (2) contemplation, (3) loss of control, and (4) negative emotional states.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Theme 1: feeling disconnected</title><p id="Par14">All five studies demonstrated how being confined to a room with limited contact resulted in a feeling of disconnection from others and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This resulted in patients experiencing immense loneliness during their time in the hospital and afterwards in the community: <italic>The isolation is heavy, because you are actually alone and you lack support</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Loneliness was often felt after just a few days of isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the mental pain of being lonely and homesick was identified as being even less bearable than the physical pain: <italic>I felt that the physical pain was bearable. However, the mental pain and stress broke me down. I&#x02019;m so lonely and so homesick</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Patients also expressed feeling disconnected from society. They reflected on how their social world had diminished due to the physical restrictions of isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, it was identified that protective isolation created a feeling of alienation from other human beings and suppressed emotions which would normally be shared with others: <italic>After the transplantation I felt that I have become another human being and I should suppress these emotions</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Protective isolation gave some patients a sense of safety claiming that being disconnected from the outside world also protected them from its demands, making them feel safe and even described being alone as a salvation: <italic>Being in isolation is a salvation, because you could not cope being with others</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, in contrast, other patients felt unsafe and frightened. They perceived the isolation as a <italic>dangerous trap</italic> or as <italic>being imprisoned</italic> which contributed to the negative emotions they experienced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Theme 2: contemplation</title><p id="Par17">Spending long periods alone in protective isolation provided many patients with time to spend in deep, reflective thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">During protective isolation, HSCT patients felt discouraged and uncertain about their treatment and whether it would be successful and fear about cancer recurrence: <italic>Tremendous fear that the cancer would come back</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the inability to return to their pre-cancer level of functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thinking about, and fear of death was also common: <italic>I thought that I would die. I thought that it would end like that, as I was so bad!</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Overall, it was acknowledged that fear and uncertainty are two main emotions experienced by patients during protective isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">It needs to be acknowledged though, that, contemplation during protective isolation, for some patients, produced positive psychological effects. Patients stated they felt lucky to be <italic>given a second life</italic> and were grateful for the care they received [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Other patients developed <italic>strong positive emotions</italic> due to recovery and sensing that <italic>new life had begun</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Theme 3: loss of control</title><p id="Par20">Four papers revealed that patients experienced a loss of control during protective isolation. This may be a loss of identity due to the implications of being in isolation, a loss of their old selves before treatment, or a feeling of <italic>losing one&#x02019;s mind</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">During HSCT treatment and recovery, patients lost the capacity to work, became reliant on others, and lost their independence. This led to a loss of self-worth. Patients stated that they noticed large changes in their personalities. They also <italic>felt like a non-entity</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], felt they had lost their old selves and needed to rediscover who they were. This feeling of powerlessness and loss of control was heightened due to the added restrictions and isolation: <italic>I did not expect it to be so difficult to feel so powerless</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Patients also experienced cognitive symptoms during isolation, such as confusion and aprosexia. The confusion was facilitated by intense treatment and anxiety and this often prevented planned isolation activities to be completed. One patient expressed that they were unable to use the Wi-Fi stating, <italic>it was impossible because I was completely out of my mind</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Other patients reported symptoms of aprosexia and memory loss. The physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms experienced by patients during isolation were unpredictable and changed throughout the treatment process suggesting a loss of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Theme 4: negative emotional states</title><p id="Par23">All studies revealed that patients experienced a range of negative emotional states including guilt, anxiety, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Patients stated how family and friends played a large part in providing emotional support throughout treatment. However, this could have a terrible impact on loved ones causing huge disruption to their lives. Patients often felt guilty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and a &#x02018;burden&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] due to how their illness and treatment had impacted their family. These feelings were amplified for patients who had children<italic>: I couldn&#x02019;t see my daughter and be close to her. That hurt me most</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Stress and anxiety were commonly experienced and severity increased with the time spent in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition to feeling anxious about treatment and future outcomes, patients felt stress and worry about loved ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Protective isolation was seen to increase the level of this stress. Anxiety was also experienced about the transition from being in isolation in the hospital, to being at home and having reduced restrictions: <italic>Well, I&#x02019;ve just been anxious to getting back to being allowed to do things</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Depression was experienced and increased with time spent in isolation: <italic>Now I feel like time is getting longer and longer, and I feel very depressed and lonely</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Patients felt that depression had an impact on their interaction with their family or carers. Some patients chose to have no interaction with their loved ones or the outside world: <italic>I couldn&#x02019;t even Facetime with them [family] because I was so depressed</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Depression had a varying impact on recovery, function, and quality of life throughout HSCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">All five of the studies identified patients feeling disconnected from others and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This feeling of disconnection resulted in extreme loneliness after only a few days in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and mirrors findings in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">To maintain social effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], stay connected to society, and receive necessary social support, it is important for patients to maintain relationships with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These may be loved ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], members of staff, peer support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], or volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, it has been acknowledged that some patients are more at risk of having problems in maintaining relationships during isolation. These include being a male patient, patients with lower education levels, those with higher levels of pain post-transplant, those having had fewer chemotherapy cycles before HSCT, and those with low satisfaction with visiting hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This suggests that it is necessary to ensure that all HSCT patients have access to ongoing social support and access to enhanced psychological services during protective isolation to mitigate and minimise these recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Safety was also identified as an issue for patients in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] both negatively experienced as imprisonment and positively experienced as an enhanced feeling of protection due to the sterile conditions and the private environment. Earlier literature found that being cared for in a single bedroom enabled patients to feel secure and able to focus on themselves and their recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It may also help to make improvements to the isolation room itself to make it more comfortable and homely for the patient. Art interventions, such as the study <italic>Open Window</italic>, have been shown to have a positive influence on the patient experience and QoL through enhancing the environment and providing stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Protective isolation provided patients with time to contemplate on their present circumstances and future lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Patients were found to either spend time feeling fearful and uncertain or were enabled to find ways of feeling positive and hopeful. Previous research reported patient&#x02019;s experiences of fear during HSCT and the significant influence of the fear of recurrence on&#x000a0;patient&#x02019;s psychological well-being and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This was magnified in female patients and those with pre-existing subclinical depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Various activities have been suggested to help occupy and refocus patient&#x02019;s thoughts to more positive areas including therapeutic music videos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and creative arts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Nonetheless, contemplation is important and required to enable some patients to regulate their own thoughts and feelings and to enable effective adaptation to the isolation environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is suggested that for effective coping, patients are required to find meaning in the experience&#x02014;this meaning making is considered essential in HSCT to minimise the psychological impact of HSCT isolation and assist patients in finding positive personal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Experiencing loss of control of both identity and minds was often reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. After HSCT, patients return home to live very different lives to pre-treatment. They are unable to socialise and return to work for some time. It is evident that this leads to a loss of independence, identity, and self-worth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Other studies have discussed the challenges post-HSCT has regarding career and financial domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and how this affects the ability to provide family support leading to a sense of uselessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">A review which examined the effects of isolation on memory found that social isolation combined with loneliness had an adverse effect on cognitive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It suggested that cognitive symptoms reduce confidence in the ability to manage other symptoms experienced during HSCT, thus affecting physical and psychological well-being of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Negative emotional states, such as guilt, anxiety, and depression, are commonly reported as part of the HSCT protective isolation patient&#x02019;s experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and referred to as <italic>isolation as a source of suffering</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], linking psychological distress to both the emotional and physical demands of isolation. Other studies provide evidence that protective isolation can lead to depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In fact, it has been posited that 20% of patients develop a psychological disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] with female patients being more at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Pre-transplant psychosocial issues also predict patients experiencing depression and poor quality of life during isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], highlighting a need to be aware of the patient&#x02019;s mental health before transplant to predict those at increased risk of psychological issues especially given that pre-transplant depression and anxiety may decrease a patients&#x02019; overall survival time after transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Evidence from the wider literature, combined with the findings from this review, acknowledge that there are considerable psychological effects of being in protective isolation for patients during HSCT. Findings have enabled several suggestions to improve the experience of patients in protective isolation post-HSCT. These include pre-HSCT mental health assessments to identify patients at risk, increasing staff knowledge of the potential psychological impacts, clear referral pathways if required, and increased support and education for family and loved ones of HSCT patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">This review explored research on the psychological impact of protective isolation for HSCT patients. It addressed the need for an increased focus on this area of care after HSCT, particularly in the UK where research is lacking, as outlined by the Clinical Commissioning Policy on HSCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It compared findings to an earlier review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and made recommendations for improving the management of patients&#x02019; post-HSCT experiencing protective isolation to contribute to an improved quality of life.</p><p id="Par37">This review had several limitations. There was a paucity of available research that focused on the psychological impact of protective isolation in HSCT. This is not surprising due to the limited patient population and their vulnerability which may have affected participation in research. This resulted in only five studies being included in the thematic analysis. Sample sizes were also small in the reviewed studies, although this is not unusual for qualitative methods and only three databases were searched meaning quality studies could have been missed. Importantly, no appropriate studies were found based on patient experiences in the UK. However, recommendations may still be useful and provide insight into enhanced practice in the NHS and UK healthcare delivery around improving the patient experience. Nevertheless, the findings from all studies were complimentary and, when taken together, have provided useful insight into the psychological experience of HSCT patients. It demonstrated that there are considerable psychological effects of being in protective isolation during HSCT and made recommendations for future management to minimise the impact on patients.</p><p id="Par38">Due to the increasing number of HSCTs being carried out in the UK, it is essential that more research is conducted that focuses on this impact of treatment and patient management. Further research on protective isolation in the hospital and at post-discharge for patients in the UK is urgently required as currently there is little evidence available to inform effective patient support or best practice care within the context of the NHS. Additionally, more research focus is required on the psychological impact of protective isolation. This should cover all aspects of mental health conditions, including the impact on cognitive function. A previous review, which was conducted 8&#x000a0;years ago, identified similar psychological effects impacting HSCT patients, suggesting that little progress has been made to improve the management of these symptoms or improve the patient experience. HSCT is undoubtedly a necessary treatment approach for haematological disorders but when combined with the treatment process, symptoms produced, and protective isolation&#x000a0;it is an extremely difficult and intense experience.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Appendix</title><p id="Par40">See Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.
