To optimize pregnancy outcomes, maternal weight gain should be kept within a healthy range [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Numerous studies suggest that gestational weight gain (GWG) below and above recommendations may be associated with short and long-term deleterious consequences to mothers and their offspring [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, gaining more weight than recommended has been linked with gestational diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], preeclampsia [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], large-for-gestational-age neonates [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], macrosomia [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], higher rates of cesarean delivery [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], childhood obesity [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and impaired cognitive skills in children [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Meanwhile, gaining less weight than recommended is associated with small-for-gestational-age neonates [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and prematurity [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The importance of attaining a healthy weight gain during pregnancy has been increasingly recognised in recent decades. Nevertheless, the number of women with GWG below or above the recommended 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) limits remains remarkably high [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2017 estimated that the overall prevalence of weight gain within the recommended range during pregnancy was only 30%, while 23% of women gained less weight than recommended, and 47% gained more weight than recommended [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Considering the potential detrimental impact of unhealthy GWG, it is imperative to identify which risk factors are associated with &#x02018;less than recommended&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;more than recommended&#x02019; maternal weight gain. Previous studies have attempted to pinpoint these determinants, and various potential risk factors have been suggested, spanning physical, psychological and socio-economic characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, findings are not consistent across the literature. This heterogeneity may be partially explained by differences in population characteristics and/or different definitions and measurements of GWG.</p><p>Despite the global efforts to identify such determinants, there is a scarcity of data from the United Kingdom (UK) [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where only four other studies [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have addressed this topic &#x02013; two of them with small sample sizes. Additionally, most of the international literature focuses on determinants of GWG above the reference ranges, while the determinants of GWG below the reference ranges are under-explored.</p><p>The present study aims to overcome these deficits by investigating the potential determinants of GWG below and above IOM recommendations in an ethnically diverse cohort in the city of Bradford (England, United Kingdom). The main objective was to examine the potential impact of a wide range of factors &#x02013; including demographic characteristics, socio-economic status, physical and mental health, anthropometric measurements, ethnicity, lifestyle and reproductive history &#x02013; on unhealthy GWG.</p><p>By contributing to the literature on this topic, this study could potentially help inform evidence-based health promotion strategies, as well as facilitate the identification of groups at risk and ensure better surveillance, follow-up and counselling to pregnant women and their families.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Setting and study design</title><p>The present study utilises data from the Born in Bradford (BiB) birth cohort study. This is a longitudinal research programme established in a large and economically deprived city in the north of England, aiming to investigate diverse aspects of maternal and child health. The population of Bradford is predominantly comprised of young individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds (mainly White-British and Pakistani) [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from this birth cohort study.</p><p>All pregnant women who received antenatal care in the city of Bradford from 2007 to 2011 and planned to give birth at the Bradford Royal Infirmary (the only maternity unit in the city) were invited to participate. Most women were typically enrolled at 26&#x02013;28 weeks of gestational age when they attended an &#x02018;oral glucose tolerance test&#x02019; (oral GTT) appointment. The oral GTT was offered to all pregnant women booked for delivery at the Bradford Royal Infirmary, with an uptake of approximately 80% [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>At the time of enrolment, participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire (administered mainly in English, Urdu or Mirpuri) and had their weight and height measured and recorded. They were then followed-up through linkage to maternity notes. Further details on enrolment and follow-up of participants have been extensively described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>The present analysis included women with singleton pregnancies and live, term births (&#x02265;37 to &#x02264;42 weeks&#x02019; gestation at birth). Participants were excluded if they experienced hyperemesis gravidarum or if their GWG could not be adequately calculated. This encompassed women who initiated antenatal care after 14 weeks gestation, those who lacked information on baseline BMI and those who had less than two weight measurements during pregnancy. Additionally, participants were excluded if the interval between the initial and final weight measurement was less than eight weeks, if information on gestational age at the time of measurement was lacking, or if weight gain was implausible (&#x000b1;4SD from the mean weight gain standardised by gestational age at final weight measurement). Participants who moved outside of Bradford shortly after giving birth and those whose infants died on the day of birth were also excluded from the analyses (<xref rid="pone.0323278.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Outcome</title><p>Maternal weight was measured at three times points during pregnancy: (1) during the first antenatal appointment by a midwife; (2) along with height, at study recruitment by a research nurse (~26&#x02013;28 weeks&#x02019; gestation); and (3) during a routine antenatal appointment in the third trimester by a midwife. Median gestational age at the first and third trimester antenatal appointments were 11 weeks (IQR 10&#x02013;12 weeks) and 36 weeks (IRQ 35&#x02013;37 weeks), respectively. Average weekly weight gain was calculated as follows: (final weight - weight at first antenatal appointment)/ number of weeks between the two time points. For those without a third trimester measurement, weight at recruitment was used as the &#x0201c;final weight&#x0201d; for this calculation. The median gestational age at final weight measurement was 35 weeks (IQR 26&#x02013;36). The number of weeks between initial and final weight measurements varied from 8 to 33 weeks, with a median of 23 (IQR 16&#x02013;26).</p><p>The main outcome consisted of a three-level categorical variable representing the adequacy of GWG: &#x02018;less than the recommended weight gain (RWG)&#x02019;, &#x02018;recommended weight gain (RWG)&#x02019; and &#x02018;more than the recommended weight gain (RWG)&#x02019;. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] criteria were used to categorize participants according to their average weekly weight gain. Results were then compared to IOM thresholds for recommended weekly GWG throughout the second and third trimesters, which vary according to baseline BMI, as follows &#x02013; underweight: 0.44 to 0.58&#x02009;kg/week; healthy weight: 0.35 to 0.50&#x02009;kg/week; overweight: 0.23 to 0.33&#x02009;kg/week; and obese: 0.17 to 0.27&#x02009;kg/week (<xref rid="pone.0323278.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Women&#x02019;s weight measured during their first antenatal visit (~11 weeks&#x02019; gestation) was used to calculate baseline BMI. Considering that weight gain during the first trimester is usually small (0.5 to 2&#x02009;kg in total) [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], early pregnancy weight was used as a proxy of pre-pregnancy weight.

Means and standard deviations were computed for variables with normal distribution, and median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for variables with skewed distributions. After the completion of the exploratory analyses, chi-square tests and ANOVA were performed to assess whether differences in baseline characteristics across GWG groups were statistically significant. Crude multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate the unadjusted associations between each potential determinant and GWG categories. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for &#x02018;less than the RWG&#x02019; and for &#x02018;more than the RWG&#x02019; (compared to RWG) were estimated for each level of the determinants.

All categories of parity were associated with increased odds of gaining less weight than recommended, ranging from 23% [OR=1.23 (95% CI 1.03&#x02013;1.46, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022)] for women who had given birth once before to 46% [OR=1.46 (95% CI 1.11&#x02013;1.92, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007)] for those who had previously given birth three or more times, when compared to nulliparous women.

Five of the twelve potential determinants under investigation were found to be independently associated with gaining gestational weight below and/or above the IOM guidelines: baseline BMI, parity, socioeconomic position, age and mental health. Lower socioeconomic position, higher parity, unhealthy BMI (underweight, overweight or obese) and young maternal age were associated with higher odds of experiencing less than the recommended GWG. Meanwhile, being overweight, obese or having poor mental health were determinants of having &#x02018;more than the RWG&#x02019;, whereas multiparity and underweight were associated with a lower risk of gaining more weight than the recommendations.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], baseline BMI was a consistent and important determinant of a GWG above the recommended range. In a meta-analysis that categorized overweight and obese women into a single group, the OR for excessive weight within this category was 2.49 (95% CI 0.92&#x02013;1.21) when compared to those with a healthy BMI [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Within our cohort, the effect was even stronger: OR=3.56 for baseline overweight, and OR=5.86 for baseline obesity. In the same meta-analysis [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as in the present study, having an underweight baseline BMI nearly halved the odds of experiencing higher than recommended GWG. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between BMI and gestational weight gain above the recommended range are probably multifactorial, encompassing biological and behavioral aspects [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the nature of the relationship between BMI and &#x02018;less than the recommended RWG&#x02019; is more heterogeneous in the literature. Some studies reported higher odds of experiencing a GWG below the recommended range among obese [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and underweight [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] women, and lower odds among overweight participants [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, others failed to detect any association between BMI and less-than-recommended GWG [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, all categories of &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019; baseline BMI were associated with higher odds of acquiring less weight than the reference range when categories of average weekly weight gain were used as the outcome. However, baseline overweight or obesity were associated with decreased odds of gaining less than the RWG in a sensitivity analysis using overall weight gain as the outcome (<xref rid="pone.0323278.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). The difference in findings did not seem to be due to selection bias, since an analysis of the weekly rate of weight gain restricted to the 3,271 women in this subgroup yielded similar results as the main analysis involving the total sample (results not shown). Possible reasons for the different results may include a lack of a perfect correlation between total pregnancy weight gain and weekly average weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the possibility of a non-linear weight gain throughout the second and third trimesters [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and/or weight gain during the first trimester outside the 0.5&#x02013;2&#x02009;kg range assumed by IOM guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between mental health morbidity and higher odds of having &#x02018;more than the RWG&#x02019; identified in the present study supports the literature. A greater risk of GWG above recommendations among participants with anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or depression [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has been described. Interestingly, in the present study, the influence of impaired mental health on GWG seemed to be particularly important among women of non-white British ethnic origin. This opens space for future studies addressing this topic in South Asian populations, migrants and ethnic minorities, which are consistently underrepresented in studies on this subject. Although various studies also identify a link between mental health morbidity and less-than-recommended weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], such an association was not found in the present study.</p><p>With regard to socioeconomic status, we noted a relevant impact of economic hardship on the odds of gaining less than the recommended GWG.

These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis of 25 studies from middle and low-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but differ from a meta-analysis of more than 70 studies [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that concluded that multiparous women were at higher risk of excessive GWG and from another meta-analysis that failed to find a significant association [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. When exploring the association between parity and GWG, Hill et al [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] identified remarkable levels of heterogeneity across studies.

It included more than seven thousand participants, which is a large sample size when compared to similar studies. Moreover, we investigated a wide variety of potential determinants of gestational weight gain, from classical to novel factors (such as psychiatric morbidity) [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, there was a great effort from the BiB cohort to include women from diverse ethnicities, including the administration of questionnaires in various languages [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is a substantial advantage in contrast to other studies, which frequently exclude non-English speakers, even when performed in multi-ethnic populations [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], leading to an under-representation of ethnic &#x02018;minorities&#x02019; in most investigations.</p><p>Additionally, while some studies rely on self-reporting of weight (which has been shown to lead to underestimation of the actual values [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]), our investigation used objective measurements and linkage to maternity notes that included information obtained from antenatal records. This is especially important considering that body weight is vulnerable to social desirability bias [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>However, some methodological limitations must be acknowledged. Obtaining an accurate assessment of gestational weight gain is challenging [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Such limitations arise from the differential timing (gestational week) at measurement and a lack of universal pre-pregnancy weight ascertainment. As pre-pregnancy weight is seldom available for the vast majority of participants and the amount of weight gain during the first trimester is small (0.5 to 2&#x02009;kg) [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], many studies - including the present one - rely on weight at the first antenatal appointment as a proxy for pre-pregnancy weight [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This approach can lead to some level of misclassification of baseline BMI. However, as this would mostly impact the categorization of BMI among participants with values close to the category thresholds, the impact of misclassification is likely small in this context and is unlikely to cause major changes in the nature of the associations.</p><p>Additionally, the IOM-recommended criteria, although widely used in the literature, might not be optimal for non-US populations, and does not originally account for ethnic differences [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As almost half of the participants are from a Pakistani background, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using different cut-offs for BMI categories and a subgroup analysis by ethnicity in an attempt to overcome this limitation.</p><p>In addition to the under-representation of individuals from diverse ethnical/racial backgrounds, the IOM guidelines have other inherent limitations. For example, recommendations do not distinguish between class I, II and III obesity. The 2009 guidelines state that available evidence was &#x0201c;insufficient to develop more specific recommendations for GWG&#x0201d; among women with class II and III obesity [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Considering the significant prevalence of severe obesity among women of childbearing age and the growing number of studies investigating the impact of GWG on pregnancy outcomes within different obesity strata, thoroughly readdressing the current evidence base in search of optimal GWG ranges stratified by obesity class would be of value. It is also worth noting that the IOM guidelines were primarily based on observational data [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], thus limiting the assessment of causal effects between GWG and pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, there are knowledge gaps about how ideal weight gain may vary not only by pre-pregnancy BMI but also in relation to other characteristics such as maternal age, height or comorbidities [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite these limitations, a decision was made to use the 2009 IOM guidelines in the present study, as they are thoughtfully developed, widely adopted in both the literature and medical practice, and enable comparisons across various studies.</p><p>Since information on late-third trimester weight was not available for more than half of the sample, we were unable to calculate absolute weight gain for many participants and relied on the rate of weight gain in the main analysis. However, for some pregnant women, the average weekly weight gain might not reflect the rate of weight gain across the whole pregnancy, due to fluctuations at different stages of development. We partially addressed this issue by selecting participants with at least 8 weeks between the initial and final weight measurement and by conducting a sensitivity analysis in the subgroup of women with available late-third trimester data (see sensitivity analysis 3 in supplementary information).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We believe the present study is an important addition to the literature. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggested that most women should not be repeatedly weighed during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, Garay et al claim that &#x0201c;women in the UK may benefit from a revised approach towards GWG in the various levels of the NHS&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0323278.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our results may help inform organisations on which groups of women are at greater risk of unhealthy weight gain during pregnancy, such as those with mental health issues, unhealthy baseline BMI, and/or facing economic deprivation. These individuals could be prioritized on intervention programs and receive tailored counseling and follow-up of weight gain during pregnancy as part of their antenatal care.</p><p>Finally, the heterogeneity in findings across different studies indicates there may be population-level particularities that mediate the relationships, and this would be an interesting topic for future studies.

</p><p>2. When completing the data availability statement of the submission form, you indicated that you will make your data available on acceptance. We strongly recommend all authors decide on a data sharing plan before acceptance, as the process can be lengthy and hold up publication timelines. Please note that, though access restrictions are acceptable now, your entire data will need to be made freely accessible if your manuscript is accepted for publication. This policy applies to all data except where public deposition would breach compliance with the protocol approved by your research ethics board. If you are unable to adhere to our open data policy, please kindly revise your statement to explain your reasoning and we will seek the editor's input on an exemption. Please be assured that, once you have provided your new statement, the assessment of your exemption will not hold up the peer review process.</p><p>3. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article&#x02019;s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p><p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;This is a good population-based study,all ares of reseach are done properly, the objective of the the study is as very important one as it reflects the the outcome of pregnancy in both maternal and fetal aspects in different ethnic groups living in UK</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;I read this study with much interest and wish to congratulate the authors for addressing a research gap, especially exploring the multi ethnic cohort and including many more determinants than the previous studies. The study certainly deserves dissemination to Plos one readers and the scientific community.</p><p>I have a few comments to make.</p><p>Use of IOM guidelines is inevitable as this is the best available reference on GWG. Although IOM has strong evidence on &#x0201c;normal weight&#x0201d; followup and evidence base, only moderate evidence base is used for under and overweight/ obese groups. As authors themselves stated, IOM may not be externally valid outside of a USA population.</p><p>Therefore, I suggest the use of the term "recommended weight gain (RWG)" instead of &#x0201c;adequate weight gain&#x0201d;, and describe the populations with terms "less than the RWG"(instead of &#x0201c;insufficient weight gain&#x0201d;) and "more than the RWG" (instead of excessive weight gain) to reflect the fact that there is currently no universally agreed "adequate weight gain".</p><p>Consider adding a brief discussion of the limitations of IOM guidelines</p><p>I note that the study population had "universal screening for gestational diabetes with 75g OGTT". Although this is the recommended current practice, UK in 2007 was using "two step screening" (?). If the BiB population was considered to have a different guideline to be adopted locally, a brief discussion of this fact in the limitations would be of value.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Dear Editor and Reviewers,</p><p>Thank you for your time and thoughtful analysis of the manuscript. We greatly appreciate your insightful feedback, and we are confident that implementing your suggestions will strengthen the quality of the work.</p><p>As requested, we are submitting a revised version of the manuscript (including a marked-up version with track changes and an unmarked version). Additionally, we are uploading marked and unmarked revised versions of the &#x02018;supporting information&#x02019; file and a revised version of figures 1 and 2.</p><p>Below, we outline how each of the suggestions and comments has been addressed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>1) &#x0201c;I suggest the use of the term "recommended weight gain (RWG)" instead of &#x0201c;adequate weight gain&#x0201d;, and describe the populations with terms "less than the RWG"(instead of &#x0201c;insufficient weight gain&#x0201d;) and "more than the RWG" (instead of excessive weight gain) to reflect the fact that there is currently no universally agreed "adequate weight gain".</p><p>a. We appreciate this important advice, and have removed the terms &#x0201c;insufficient&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;adequate&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;excessive&#x0201d; weight gain when referring to our participants throughout the main manuscript and supporting information. These terms have been replaced with "less than the RWG", "recommended weight gain (RWG)", and "more than the RWG" as well as other similar expressions or synonyms, in order to align with sentence structure and syntax, ensure clarity and avoid repetition. Alternative terms used include &#x0201c;GWG below/above the recommended range&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;higher than/lower than recommended&#x0201d;, for example. Figures 1 and 2 (as well as the supplementary figures within the supporting file) have been edited to change the headings from &#x0201c;insufficient weight gain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;excessive weight gain&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;less than the RWG&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;more than the RWG&#x0201d;.</p><p>Please note that there are two sentences where the term &#x0201c;excessive&#x0201d; appears in the manuscript, but specifically when referring to the results of other studies that have employed this nomenclature (lines 484 and 554).</p><p>2) &#x0201c;Consider adding a brief discussion of the limitations of IOM guidelines&#x0201d;</p><p>a. We approached this recommendation by including a paragraph in the Discussion section, under the &#x02018;Strengths and limitations&#x02019; subheading (lines 601 to 615).</p><p>&#x0201c;In addition to the under-representation of individuals from diverse ethnical/racial backgrounds, the IOM guidelines have other inherent limitations. For example, recommendations do not distinguish between class I, II and III obesity. The 2009 guidelines state that available evidence was &#x0201c;insufficient to develop more specific recommendations for GWG&#x0201d; among women with class II and III obesity [19]. Considering the significant prevalence of severe obesity among women of childbearing age and the growing number of studies investigating the impact of GWG on pregnancy outcomes within different obesity strata, thoroughly readdressing the current evidence base in search of optimal GWG ranges stratified by obesity class would be of value. It is also worth noting that the IOM guidelines were primarily based on observational data [19], thus limiting the assessment of causal effects between GWG and pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, there are knowledge gaps about how ideal weight gain may vary not only by pre-pregnancy BMI but also in relation to other characteristics such as maternal age, height or comorbidities [19]. Despite these limitations, a decision was made to use the 2009 IOM guidelines in the present study, as they are thoughtfully developed, widely adopted in both the literature and medical practice, and enable comparisons across various studies&#x0201d;.</p><p>We hope that this additional paragraph, along with the one precedes it (lines 596 to 600), helps to highlight key concerns related to the IOM guidelines.</p><p>3) I note that the study population had "universal screening for gestational diabetes with 75g OGTT". Although this is the recommended current practice, UK in 2007 was using "two step screening" (?). If the BiB population was considered to have a different guideline to be adopted locally, a brief discussion of this fact in the limitations would be of value.</p><p>The BiB protocol for the recruitment phase (available on <ext-link xlink:href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-8-327)" ext-link-type="uri">https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-8-327</ext-link>) states that &#x0201c;Bradford is served by a single maternity unit, at the Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI)&#x0201d; and that &#x0201c;almost all women resident in Bradford book, and give birth, in the maternity unit&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;All women booked for delivery at the BRI are offered an oral glucose tolerance test (oral GTT) at 26 to 28 weeks gestation. When they attend for the oral GTT, women are invited to participate in the Born in Bradford cohort&#x0201d;.</p><p>Therefore, at the time of the study recruitment, oral GTT was being offered universally for pregnant women in the city of Bradford. We have revised the sentences regarding this topic in the methods section, to provide clearer explanation. This now reads as follows (lines 151 to 154):</p><p>&#x0201c;Most women were typically enrolled at 26-28 weeks of gestational age when they attended an &#x02018;oral glucose tolerance test&#x02019; (oral GTT) appointment. The oral GTT was offered to all pregnant women booked for delivery at the Bradford Royal Infirmary, with an uptake of approximately 80% [18]&#x0201d;.</p><p>We believe that offering the oral GTT to all pregnant women in Bradford did not negatively impact the results of our study neither led to bias. We feel that it provided an opportune moment to recruit a large number of potential participants, improving the representativeness of the study sample. Additionally, it may have enhanced the detection of gestational diabetes mellitus, thereby improving the accuracy of the sensitivity analysis in which women with gestational diabetes were excluded. As a result, instead of addressing this topic in the &#x02018;limitations&#x02019; section, we opted to rephrase the excerpt in the methods section, as noted above. We kindly hope this will be an acceptable alternative.</p><p>4) In addition to the aforementioned modifications, the following formatting changes have been made:</p><p>a. We adjusted the font sizes in the manuscript body as follows: 18pt for Level 1 headings, 16pt for Level 2 headings, and 14pt for Level 3 headings. Additionally, we replaced headings in italics with bold type, in accordance with the PLOS ONE style templates.</p><p>b. The "References" section has been moved to appear before the supporting information, in accordance with the PLOS ONE style templates.</p><p>We would like to sincerely thank you once again for your thoughtful comments and constructive feedback. We hope that the revisions we have made address your concerns effectively.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323278.s014" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323278.s014.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0323278.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323278.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Guoying</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Guoying Wang</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Guoying Wang</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323278" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
