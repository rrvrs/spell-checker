</self-uri><abstract><p>This study aims to explore whether the impact of varying aerobic exercise intensities on knowledge acquisition is influenced by exercise intensity and gender. The results lay the groundwork for selecting suitable aerobic exercise intervention programs, considering exercise intensity and gender, to enhance knowledge acquisition. Employing a mixed-design approach, a sample of 569 college students engaged in 8 weeks of aerobic exercise sessions with moderate and low intensity, incorporating basketball and badminton. Knowledge acquisition effects were assessed using questionnaires targeting distinct knowledge levels. Declarative and procedural knowledge levels across different acquisition types were evaluated pre and post-exercise intervention for the low-intensity, moderate-intensity, and control groups. The findings reveal that both moderate and low-intensity aerobic exercises distinctly and positively impact college students&#x02019; knowledge levels, with no discernible gender-related alterations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the Beijing Social Science Foundation</institution>

Introduction</title><p>Cognitive psychologists categorize knowledge into two fundamental forms: declarative and procedural. Declarative knowledge refers to knowledge about &#x0201c;what&#x0201d; something is, while procedural knowledge pertains to knowledge about &#x0201c;how&#x0201d; to perform a task [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Procedural knowledge builds upon declarative knowledge by providing the information required for executing a procedure. In the context of classroom learning, students primarily acquire procedural knowledge in its declarative form [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The theoretical framework for this study is grounded in the Information Processing Theory, which posits that cognitive processes underlie the acquisition and application of knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the process of motor learning, knowledge forms the foundation for acquiring motor skills, which, in turn, contribute to knowledge mastery. This theoretical perspective emphasizes the critical role of cognitive structures in mediating the relationship between exercise engagement and academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The depth of knowledge mastery has a significant impact on students&#x02019; learning outcomes, as scientifically grounded knowledge acquisition promotes holistic student development [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Building on this foundation, the Cognitive Load Theory suggests that the complexity of cognitive tasks can be influenced by the manner in which exercise is integrated into learning environments [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The relationship between knowledge acquisition and the holistic development of students&#x02019; physical and mental well-being has become an area of interest among experts in education, psychology, and sports science. Exploring effective means to enhance students&#x02019; knowledge acquisition has become a frontier and a focal point of interdisciplinary research trends [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several studies from the field of sports science have discovered that physical exercise can improve students&#x02019; academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Shephard, R. J.,. and Bouchard, C, conducted a 6-year longitudinal study on first-grade elementary school students and found that participation in physical exercise had a positive impact on academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A study by Guest et al. (2003) involving 6,458 American high school students found that engaging in physical exercise was associated with improved academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Research by Welk et al. (2010) investigating the physical health and academic performance of middle school students in Texas revealed a positive correlation between physical health and academic performance, emphasizing the significant impact of improved physical health on academic outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Jacobs et al. (1994), in a study conducted on American college students, found that setting academic goals while establishing exercise intensity and mode could enhance learning outcomes after a semester-long exercise intervention [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Horton et al. (2009), through a questionnaire survey on three American universities, discovered that participation in sports activities can enhance academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, Shea and Morgan (1979) examined the learning and mastery of motor skills and found that the experimental group, which received declarative knowledge learning, outperformed the control group in a task involving knocking down obstacles, demonstrating superior transfer effects [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In light of these theoretical perspectives and empirical findings, the current study posits the following research hypothesis: Moderate and low-intensity exercise will differentially impact the acquisition of procedural and declarative knowledge, thereby influencing learning outcomes. In summary, based on the aforementioned studies, it can be concluded that exercise can enhance students&#x02019; academic performance. However, the extent to which intervention through different intensities of exercise improves learning outcomes remains unclear, hindering the scientific understanding and practical application of exercise as an effective means for knowledge acquisition and physical and mental well-being. This hypothesis is derived from the Interaction Hypothesis, which suggests that the interaction between exercise and cognitive engagement may be necessary for achieving optimal learning benefits [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Exercise intensity refers to the degree of physiological stimulation caused by engaging in physical activities, and different intensities of exercise have varying effects on students&#x02019; physical and mental development [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Currently, research in this field mainly focuses on the impact of exercise on students&#x02019; learning outcomes, without comprehensive empirical studies exploring the effects of different intensities of exercise on learning outcomes. Therefore, this study hypothesizes that moderate and low-intensity exercise can influence learning outcomes by affecting the process of acquiring procedural and declarative knowledge. Specifically, exercise can modulate the levels of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, promoting neuroplasticity in the hippocampal region, including the growth of dendrites and the strengthening of synapses, thereby enhancing memory and learning capabilities [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Concurrently, exercise improves blood circulation and increases cerebral blood flow, providing ample oxygen and nutrients for cognitive processes [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, exercise has anti-inflammatory effects, elevating the levels of anti-inflammatory factors in the plasma, such as clusterin, reducing brain inflammation, and improving cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Emotional regulation is also a significant aspect, as exercise can alleviate symptoms of depression, which is associated with declines in cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Executive functions, including inhibitory control, working memory, and task switching, are also core components of cognitive function, and exercise has been shown to enhance these functions [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, exercise can improve the capacity for working memory and long-term memory, which is crucial for the learning process [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lastly, there is a positive correlation between exercise and academic performance, providing a reference for the appropriate dosage of exercise for adolescents to achieve optimal cultural learning benefits [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hence, this study posits the following research hypothesis: Under interventions of different exercise intensities, moderate and low-intensity exercise will impact the process of acquiring procedural and declarative knowledge, thereby influencing learning outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The present study&#x02019;s findings underscore the significant positive impact of an 8-week exercise training regimen, varying in intensity, on college students&#x02019; knowledge acquisition outcomes. This outcome aligns with the burgeoning research consensus that physical activity induces neuroplastic changes, thereby enhancing learning, memory, and a spectrum of cognitive faculties. A pivotal factor in this enhancement is the integration of executive function operations within the exercise program, necessitating repeated practice and utilization of these functions. Executive functions, which orchestrate and direct goal-oriented behaviors, encompass complex, non-automated processes that integrate an individual&#x02019;s lower-level cognitive processes within purposeful activities [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The prefrontal cortex, crucial for these functions, is activated by physical exercise, leading to improved performance in executive function-related tasks during the learning process [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Impact of exercise intensity on knowledge acquisition</title><p>Further analysis within this study revealed that exercise interventions of varying intensities significantly influenced the level of declarative knowledge, while procedural knowledge levels remained relatively stable. This finding is consistent with Schack research, which also observed a notable enhancement in declarative knowledge following exercise interventions of diverse intensities [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This suggests that exercise interventions may impact cognitive processes such as working memory and long-term memory, thereby affecting the acquisition outcomes of declarative knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Implementation of exercise interventions</title><p>To modulate the intensity of basketball and badminton interventions, factors such as exercise velocity, content, and frequency were meticulously adjusted. This approach parallels strategies employed by Johnson and Brown in their research on skill acquisition across different sports [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], where they controlled the intensity of interventions by manipulating similar variables.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Specific effects of exercise interventions on cognitive functions</title><p>Research by Chen further substantiates the positive effect of moderate and low-intensity exercise interventions on declarative knowledge acquisition, with no significant changes observed in procedural knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This indicates that exercise interventions may influence the cognitive processes associated with working memory and long-term memory, which are critical for declarative knowledge acquisition.</p><p>Consistent with the findings of Ghasemzadeh and Saadat, who highlighted the critical role of cognitive psychology in sports performance, our study&#x02019;s results suggest that cognitive processes are significantly enhanced through moderate and low-intensity exercise interventions [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

This finding highlights the potential of sustained exercise interventions to facilitate skill acquisition and knowledge learning.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Limitations of exercise interventions</title><p>Moreover,In this study, we observed an imbalance in the gender distribution of the sample, with a higher number of female participants than male, a phenomenon that reflects the gender ratio of our liberal arts institution. Despite this imbalance, our statistical analysis indicated that gender did not significantly influence the effectiveness of the exercise intervention. Therefore, we did not include gender as a covariate in our analysis. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the uneven gender distribution may limit the generalizability of our findings. Consequently, we recommend that future studies should strive for a more balanced gender distribution or employ more sophisticated statistical methods to control for the potential impact of gender differences, thereby enhancing the representativeness and applicability of the research outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Educational and psychological perspectives</title><p>From an educational standpoint, exercise can promote the learning of declarative knowledge through various pathways. Physical activities can provide a positive context and experience, stimulating students&#x02019; interest and engagement, thereby enhancing their acceptance and retention of knowledge. Additionally, exercise can enhance students&#x02019; attention and concentration, creating a cognitive state conducive to information processing and retention [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>From a psychological and sports science perspective, the enhancement of declarative knowledge through exercise may be related to its impact on students&#x02019; emotional states and self-confidence. Physical activities can release endogenous hormones such as endorphins and dopamine, generating positive emotions and a sense of pleasure [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This positive emotional state can increase students&#x02019; motivation and learning effectiveness, promoting the absorption and memory of declarative knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0294381.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Future research directions</title><p>These results suggest that future research on exercise interventions should focus more on the design and selection of exercise programs. Further investigation is needed to explore the other constituent elements of aerobic exercise, such as exercise type and content, as well as their individual and interactive effects on knowledge learning. It is also recommended that future studies explore the potential moderating effects of individual differences, including the development of gender-sensitive exercise intervention measures, and assess the effectiveness and acceptability of these interventions in different gender groups. This approach will ensure that the research findings are universally applicable and applicable to diverse populations. By focusing on these aspects, future research can provide more targeted and effective exercise recommendations that take into account the unique characteristics and needs of different gender groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study has demonstrated that physical activity interventions, particularly those of varying intensities, significantly enhance knowledge learning among college students. This effect is selective, with more pronounced impacts on declarative knowledge acquisition as opposed to procedural knowledge. The key finding that moderate and low-intensity exercises can positively influence cognitive processes such as working memory and long-term memory, which are essential for declarative knowledge, underscores the importance of integrating physical activity into educational strategies. This integration not only boosts students&#x02019; cognitive abilities but also aligns with the broader goals of developing well-rounded individuals capable of lifelong learning. The implications of these findings for the field of sports science are profound, suggesting that tailored exercise programs could be a valuable adjunct to traditional academic instruction. By understanding the specific effects of exercise on cognitive functions, sports scientists can work collaboratively with educators to design interventions that maximize learning outcomes. Educators can leverage these insights to foster a more dynamic and interactive learning environment that stimulates cognitive development alongside physical health. For educational research and practice, the study highlights the potential of physical activity as a tool for enhancing cognitive skills and academic performance. It suggests that by incorporating exercise into the curriculum, educators can potentially improve students&#x02019; ability to absorb and retain information, thereby contributing to more effective teaching strategies and better learning outcomes. This approach may also offer insights into how to address learning disparities across different student populations and subject areas, providing a basis for more inclusive and personalized educational practices.&#x0201d;Looking ahead, future research should delve deeper into the moderating effects of individual differences on the relationship between exercise interventions and knowledge acquisition. Investigating how variables such as age, gender, and initial fitness levels might influence the success of these interventions can offer a more nuanced understanding of their applicability across diverse populations. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of combining exercise with other cognitive strategies could reveal new pathways for optimizing learning and cognitive development.</p><p>In conclusion, the significant positive impact of physical activity on knowledge learning, as demonstrated by this study, has broad implications for both sports science and educational research and practice. By more clearly articulating these key findings and their potential impacts, we can better appreciate the role of physical activity in enhancing educational outcomes and student development. This study paves the way for further exploration into the design of physical activity programs that are not only effective in promoting cognitive skills and academic performance but also in shaping the future of educational strategies that prioritize both physical and mental well-being.</p></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0294381.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Raw data from the study on the effects of prolonged aerobic exercise and training intensity on memory cognition.</title><p>This file contains the raw data collected during the study, including cognitive test scores, exercise duration, training intensity levels, and demographic information of participants.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0294381.s001.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0294381.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name>. <source>Language, memory, and thought</source>. <publisher-name>Psychology Press</publisher-name>; <year>1976</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0294381.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <article-title>Implicit and explicit processes in learning from examples: a case study in geometry</article-title>. <source>J Learn Sci</source>. <year>2000</year>;<volume>9</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>321</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>47</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0294381.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shephard</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Physical activity of children and academic achievement</article-title>. <source>Med Sci Sports Exerc</source>. <year>2014</year>

The study benefits from a significantly large subject pool, which is advantageous.</p><p>However, several limitations in the study preclude me from proposing its acceptance:</p><p>The methodology description for assessing declarative and procedural memory is unclear (page 4). It seems unlikely that the procedure could be replicated solely from the provided text, restricting a fundamental aspect of science&#x02014;study replication.</p><p>Although the study mentions evaluating declarative and procedural memory pre and post physical exercise intervention, it's unclear if different texts were used for student assessment at each stage.</p><p>Additionally, the evaluation method for procedural memory and the distinction between "Experiment 1" and "Experiment 2" lack clarity.

</p><p>Response to reviewers</p><p>Reviewer 1:&#x000a0;</p><p>Question1:</p><p>The methodology description for assessing declarative and procedural memory is unclear (page 4). It seems unlikely that the procedure could be replicated solely from the provided text, restricting a fundamental aspect of science&#x02014;study replication.</p><p>Answer1:</p><p>"The materials used in our experiment are primarily derived from declarative</p><p>knowledge related to the human blood circulation. These materials consist of 71 sentences</p><p>designed to comprehensively cover the subject matter, emphasizing the system's composition,</p><p>structure, function, and interrelationships among components. However, recognizing the</p><p>complexity of these relationships, we intentionally omitted explicit explanations for certain</p><p>relationships. To provide participants with more opportunities for reflection, we will further clarify</p><p>this point in the paper and provide additional details."</p><p>Question 2:</p><p>Although the study mentions evaluating declarative and procedural memory pre and post physical exercise intervention, it's unclear if different texts were used for student assessment at each stage.</p><p>Answer2:</p><p>The reviewer raised a question about whether different texts were used for assessing students' declarative and procedural memory and found this aspect unclear.</p><p>"Indeed, we used different texts to assess students' declarative and procedural memory before and after the exercise intervention. In Experiment 1, we employed declarative knowledge related to human blood circulation, while in Experiment 2, we shifted to procedural knowledge in geography education, specifically addressing the formation of air pressure and wind zones. We will emphasize this aspect more clearly in the paper to ensure a transparent understanding of the assessment process."</p><p>"Refer to the revision section in detail, specifically section 2.6 of the revised manuscript."</p><p>Question 3:</p><p>Additionally, the evaluation method for procedural memory and the distinction between "Experiment 1" and "Experiment 2" lack clarity. Is Experiment 1 the pre-test and Experiment 2 the post-test for declarative memory?</p><p>Answer3:</p><p>The reviewer expressed concerns about the distinction between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 and whether they represent pre-test and post-test for declarative memory.</p><p>I see, Experiment 1 involves the assessment of declarative knowledge, while Experiment 2 focuses on procedural knowledge. Both knowledge assessments require pre- and post-tests, a clarification that I will elaborate on further in the manuscript&#x03002;</p><p>"Refer to the revision section in detail, specifically section 2.6 of the revised manuscript."</p><p>Question 4:</p><p>How is procedural memory assessed? Is there a motor task involved? What does it entail?</p><p>Answer4:</p><p>About the assessment of procedural memory:For the evaluation, we employed specific tasks in the field of geographic education, mainly covering the following aspects:</p><p>Task types:"Experiment 2 aims to examine high school students' understanding of atmospheric pressure and the formation of wind zones. The assessment tasks include symbol comprehension, fill-in-the-blank exercises, picture interpretation, reasoning tasks based on visual stimuli, and discussions."</p><p>Procedural learning process:</p><p>"In the context of the origin of geography, the procedural learning process can be divided into three stages: acquisition, consolidation and transformation, and transfer and application. Our experiment focuses on three key aspects:"</p><p>Understanding of atmospheric structure:</p><p>"This aspect involves understanding the composition of the atmosphere, vertical stratification, atmospheric heating processes, thermal circulation principles, distribution of air pressure belts, wind zones, etc. Students are required to explain relevant phenomena, analyze the impact of air pressure belt and wind zone distribution on climate formation, and comprehend the causes of common weather phenomena through the principle of heat circulation."</p><p>Interpreting charts and images:</p><p>"Students provided schematic diagrams, including vertical wind layers in the atmosphere, insulation effects, thermal circulation patterns, global pressure zone distribution, wind zone formation and distribution, pressure zone charts, seasonal movement diagrams of wind zones, etc. We assessed their ability to interpret and analyze these diagrams, as well as their skills in drawing analysis and spatial positioning. Additionally, we examined students' logical reasoning abilities through explanations of phenomena based on the principle of thermal circulation."</p><p>Understanding of environmental and natural laws:</p><p>"This aspect emphasizes the significance of following the laws of nature and living in harmony with the environment, building upon an understanding of climate formation principles."</p><p>No, our procedural memory assessment does not involve specific motor tasks. Our research primarily focuses on the field of geographic education, evaluating students' understanding of concepts such as atmospheric pressure and the formation of wind zones. The assessment tasks mainly include symbol comprehension, fill-in-the-blank exercises, picture interpretation, reasoning tasks based on visual stimuli, and discussions. Students' tasks involve answering questions based on theoretical knowledge and charts, without the need for specific physical sports or motor tasks. We will provide further detailed explanations of our assessment approach in the paper to ensure readers have an accurate understanding of the experimental design.</p><p>It is important to note that we will provide further detailed explanations of these aspects in the paper to ensure readers have a clearer understanding of our procedural memory assessment approach.</p><p>"Refer to Section 2.5 for the introductory description of procedural knowledge measurement under Figure 1."</p><p>Question 5:</p><p>Beyond explanatory errors, there are challenging issues. Table 1 (page 3) mentions "Cardiorespiratory Fitness Assessments," yet there are no indications of fitness evaluated.</p><p>Answer5:</p><p>At the beginning of each academic semester, students undergo a comprehensive health examination, including screening for cardiorespiratory function, as documented in the medical examination report. To ensure the suitability of students participating in this research for relevant physical activities and courses before the initiation of exercise intervention, they are required to provide information related to cardiorespiratory function from their medical examination reports. The purpose of this step is to verify the normalcy of students' cardiorespiratory function, ensuring their safe participation in the experiment. The information in these medical examination reports is sourced from specialized medical institutions to guarantee the objectivity and scientific rigor of the assessment.</p><p>&#x0201c;Refer to Section 2.2&#x0201d;.</p><p>Question6:</p><p>The absence of fitness evaluation leads to the use of generic intensity values that might not correspond accurately to the actual fitness levels, especially with a significantly large student cohort where fitness variability is expected to be high. Individual intensity thresholds, as defined in exercise physiology, can vary considerably.</p><p>Answer6:</p><p>While we mentioned "Cardiorespiratory Fitness Assessments" in Table 1, the nature of our study didn't involve providing detailed reports on the specific health conditions of each participant in the manuscript. Instead, we used cardiorespiratory fitness assessments as a screening tool to ensure that participants met the criteria for the experiment's intensity requirements. The purpose of this assessment was to identify students suitable for participation and ensure a reasonable range of health conditions. We will further clarify this point in the paper to elucidate our methodology and the key steps in the assessment.</p><p>Additionally, we acknowledge that this approach might lead to some generalization of intensity levels. In our discussion, we have already highlighted this potential limitation, emphasizing the variability that can exist in individual intensity thresholds according to exercise physiology. We will ensure to express these nuances more clearly in the final paper to address the reviewer's concerns.</p><p>Question 7:</p><p>Moreover, if the study presupposes that 8 weeks of cardiorespiratory exercise will enhance memory, shouldn't the study analyze whether there's been any cardiorespiratory improvement?</p><p>Answer7:</p><p>About your concern regarding the assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness, we understand your apprehension. Our study focuses on exploring the potential impact of exercise on memory rather than specifically assessing changes in cardiorespiratory health. The reason we did not conduct cardiorespiratory fitness assessments is that our primary emphasis is on changes in memory performance, and the specific effects on cardiorespiratory health fall beyond the scope of our study.</p><p>We want to emphasize that the purpose of our research is to investigate the relationship between exercise and memory, not to directly intervene in cardiorespiratory health. Future studies may consider including more detailed assessments of cardiorespiratory health to comprehensively understand the potential benefits of exercise on the body. We will carefully consider your suggestions and explicitly address the limitations of our study in the discussion to ensure that readers have a clearer understanding of our research design and objectives.</p><p>Question 8:</p><p>While the study identifies improvements in declarative memory, are they solely due to physical exercise practice or a change in fitness? If improvements are only related to activity, why wait for 8 weeks?</p><p>Answer8:</p><p>We appreciate your concerns, and from a scientific perspective, there is substantial evidence supporting a positive correlation between the duration of exercise intervention and improvements in cognitive function. Long-term exercise interventions are believed to facilitate lasting changes in neural plasticity and sustained improvement in brain function.</p><p>Previous research suggests that improvements in cognitive function, including memory, may take some time to manifest, and longer-term exercise interventions provide more extensive opportunities for these effects to become apparent. For instance, studies indicate that structural and functional changes in the brain may require a relatively extended period, further supporting the effectiveness of long-term exercise interventions.</p><p>Furthermore, research indicates that the impact of exercise on cognitive function may involve complex interactions across multiple physiological and neural systems, and these effects may take time to manifest at the cognitive level. Therefore, choosing an 8-week period for the exercise intervention is aimed at allowing sufficient time to observe the potential emergence of these effects.</p><p>We believe that through a more extended period of exercise intervention, we are likely to observe more enduring and significant improvements in memory, which can have positive implications for students' long-term cognitive health and academic achievements. We will extensively discuss the scientific support for this in the paper to better explain the rationale behind our study design and the expected outcomes.</p><p>Question9:</p><p>Regarding procedural memory, the lack of details in the method hinders thorough evaluation.</p><p>Answer 9:</p><p>Regarding details on procedural memory:We appreciate the reviewer's attention to the methods section. We will provide more detailed information on procedural memory in the revised manuscript to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the methods.</p><p>Response to minor issues:</p><p>Question&#x0ff1a;Figures 3, 4, and 5 will be revised to include standard deviations.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>In the field of psychological statistics, it is customary to present comprehensive numerical data, including standard deviations, in data tables. This presentation method is advantageous for readers to conduct in-depth analysis and understanding of the specific data conditions. In contrast, when it comes to figures, our emphasis lies in the visual representation of data to ensure clarity and simplicity, facilitating readers in intuitively grasping data trends and key information.</p><p>Therefore, we avoid excessive presentation of detailed numerical data in figures to maintain readability and conciseness. It's worth noting that the data tables in our paper provide a clear presentation of standard deviations. We appreciate your valuable suggestions and thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p><p>Question:Post-hoc analyses will be conducted for a clearer presentation of changes.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>Thank you for your attention to our study and your valuable suggestion regarding post-hoc tests. In response to your query, we would like to clarify that in analyzing the interaction effect, we opted for simple effects analysis and simple simple effects analysis to comprehensively explore the impact between different levels of factors.</p><p>Simple effects analysis allows us to examine whether one factor has a significant effect on the dependent variable at a specific level of another factor. The extension to simple simple effects analysis further enables us to test the significance of effects across all possible combinations of factor levels.</p><p>We believe that the choice of these two analysis methods provides a more thorough and comprehensive understanding, particularly when dealing with situations involving interaction effects.</p><p>Question&#x0ff1a;On page 1, The abstract requires rewriting due to inherent repetitiveness.</p><p>Answer&#x0ff1a;The abstract will be rewritten to address repetitiveness.</p><p>Question:On page 1, Citations supporting claims are missing from lines 7 to 17 in the introduction.</p><p>Answer&#x0ff1a;Citations will be added in the introduction to support claims (lines 7-17).</p><p>Question:On page 2, In the introduction, Shephard is cited without the year, assuming it is the second reference in the bibliography, but this needs to be clarified.</p><p>Answer: Shephard's citation will be clarified, including the publication year.</p><p>Question:The bibliography lacks ordering and needs to be alphabetized for author traceability.</p><p>The bibliographic format needs to be clarified.</p><p>Answer:The bibliography will be alphabetized for author traceability and the format clarified.</p><p>Question&#x0ff1b;</p><p>On page 4, In the section "2.5 Measure tools," Chi et al. lack a publication year.</p><p>In the Discussion, BEST and MCMORRIS are cited in uppercase.</p><p>Paragraph spacing in the discussion appears arbitrary and inconsistent at times.</p><p>Answer:The citation for Chi et al. in the "2.5 Measure tools" section will include the publication year.</p><p>Paragraph spacing in the discussion will be adjusted for consistency.</p><p>Reviewer 3:&#x000a0;</p><p>Question1:</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The opening sentences is too strong, make it more consistent with your actual work. After all you are only studying healthy young people and this does not apply to other populations.</p><p>Please add numbers to support you claims, this now looks very vague. Also add a conclusion to this paragraph, by identifying the magnitude of the effect(s).</p><p>Answer1:</p><p>Opening Sentences:</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: "The opening sentences are too strong, make it more consistent with your actual work."</p><p>Your Response: "Thank you for the feedback. We appreciate your perspective.

Just one recommendation, please give a final version of this MS to a native speaker.</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#x000a0;The research title "The Influence of Long-term Aerobic Exercise and Exercise Intensity on Exercise Memory Effect" could be improved with a few critiques:</p><p>The term "exercise" is repeated multiple times, which may seem redundant and could reduce the clarity and impact of the title. A streamlined version could remove unnecessary repetitions. The title could benefit from being more specific about what aspects of "exercise memory effect" are being studied. For example, does it refer to cognitive memory improvements, muscle memory, or some other type of memory effect? An improved version of the title might be: "Long-term Aerobic Exercise and Intensity: Their Impact on Cognitive and Muscle Memory." This version avoids redundancy, increases clarity by specifying what types of memory are affected, and is more concise and to the point. additionally, the relationship of exercise and cognitive functions should be fully explained in introduction and discussion. the following references are recommended:</p><p>Ghasemzadeh, A., &#x00026; Saadat, M. .

It is essential for the methodology to be described in a way that allows for replication by other researchers. This is a fundamental aspect of scientific research.</p><p>- The study mentions "Cardiorespiratory Fitness Assessments" but fails to provide detailed evaluations of fitness levels. Considering the large cohort, individual fitness variability could significantly impact the results, necessitating a more nuanced approach to assessing intensity levels.</p><p>- The introduction does not clearly state the study hypothesis. A well-defined hypothesis is critical for guiding the research and providing a basis for the study design.</p><p>- Figures 3, 4, and 5 lack standard deviations, which are necessary for understanding the variability in the data. Including them would enhance the rigor of the statistical analysis.</p><p>- There are typographical errors and inconsistencies in formatting, such as extra spaces and inconsistent citation formatting. These should be corrected for clarity and professionalism.</p><p>- The discussion is lengthy and often vague. It would benefit from being more concise and focused on interpreting the results in the context of existing literature. Additionally, the speculative nature of some conclusions should be tempered given the study's cross-sectional design.</p><p>Specific Comments</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>The abstract should clearly state the objectives, methods, key results, and conclusions. Currently, it lacks specific details about the findings and their implications.</p><p>The opening sentences are too strong and should be more aligned with the study's focus on healthy young individuals (Page 1, Lines 1-3).</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The introduction should be written from a more scientific perspective. The opening lines need proper referencing (Page 1, Lines 7-17).</p><p>The introduction would benefit from a more structured presentation of the research gap and the study's contribution to the field.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>The criteria for selecting participants need more detail, especially regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>Specify the Polar device used, including sampling rate and data extraction details (Page 4).</p><p>Correct the presentation of VO2 to &#x00056;&#x00307;O2 throughout the manuscript (Page 4).</p><p>The description of exercise intensity should be aligned with standard guidelines, and it would be helpful to include a justification for the chosen intensities. Please note that: while maintaining analogous intensity indices for endurance (e.g., %HRreserve) is crucial to recognize that equivalent percentages across intensities may not result in comparable physiological stress or recovery demands.</p><p>Check references: Matom&#x000e4;ki P, Nuuttila OP, Heinonen OJ, Kyr&#x000f6;l&#x000e4;inen H, Nummela A.

The study has several strengths, including a large sample size, a well-designed intervention, and the assessment of both declarative and procedural knowledge. However, there are also some significant limitations and areas for improvement.</p><p>Major weaknesses:</p><p>1. The theoretical framework and hypotheses are not clearly articulated in the introduction. The rationale for examining different exercise intensities and their potential effects on declarative vs. procedural knowledge needs stronger justification.</p><p>2. The methodology section lacks sufficient detail in some areas, particularly regarding the assessment tools for declarative and procedural knowledge. More information is needed on the validity and reliability of these measures.</p><p>3. The statistical analyses are not fully explained, and some results are presented without adequate interpretation or context.</p><p>4. The discussion section is overly long and at times speculative. It does not always clearly link the findings to the original research questions or existing literature.</p><p>Minor weaknesses:</p><p>1. There are some inconsistencies in formatting and minor typographical errors throughout the manuscript.</p><p>2. Figures could be improved for clarity, including the addition of error bars to show variability.</p><p>3. The conclusion section is somewhat vague and could be more focused on the specific implications of the study's findings.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>- Lines 25-27: The distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge needs more explanation and context.</p><p>- Lines 48-52: The review of previous studies is somewhat superficial. More critical analysis of these findings would strengthen the rationale for the current study.</p><p>- Lines 78-85: The research hypothesis is not clearly stated. This section should be more explicit about the expected outcomes and why.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>- Section 2.2: More details are needed on how participants were recruited and screened for inclusion.</p><p>- Section 2.4: The justification for the chosen exercise intensities and durations should be explained more thoroughly.</p><p>- Section 2.5: The validity and reliability of the knowledge assessment tools should be addressed. How were these measures developed or adapted for this study?</p><p>Results:</p><p>- Table 3: Include effect sizes alongside p-values to provide a more complete picture of the results.</p><p>- Figures 3-5: Add error bars to show variability in the data.</p><p>- The analysis of gender differences (Table 5) seems somewhat disconnected from the main research questions and could be better integrated into the overall narrative.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>- Lines 421-435: This paragraph is speculative and not well-supported by the study's data. Consider revising or removing.</p><p>- Lines 456-470: The discussion of the mechanisms underlying the observed effects is interesting but could be more tightly linked to the specific findings of this study.</p><p>- The limitations of the study should be more thoroughly addressed, including potential confounding factors and generalizability of the results.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>- The conclusion could be strengthened by more explicitly stating the key findings and their implications for both research and practice in sports science and education.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

</p><p>PONE-D-23-32650R3Effects of Prolonged Aerobic Exercise and Training Intensity on Memory CognitionPLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Zhonghui He</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>Several methodological issues demand serious consideration. Firstly, the gender imbalance in your sample (191 males vs. 378 females) is particularly worrying. This disparity may skew your findings and undermine the results unless adequately addressed through appropriate statistical controls. Moreover, the validation of exercise intensity appears to lack the rigor necessary to uphold internal validity, which could compromise the overall integrity of the study.</p><p>Additionally, it may be beneficial to collect further data to achieve a more balanced gender distribution or to employ advanced statistical techniques to account for this imbalance.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Dec 12 2024 11:59PM.

</p><p>Response to Reviewers</p><p>Response to the Academic Editor's Inquiry:</p><p>Q1&#x0ff1a;Firstly, the gender imbalance in your sample (191 males vs. 378 females) is particularly worrying. This disparity may skew your findings and undermine the results unless adequately addressed through appropriate statistical controls.</p><p>Answer1:</p><p>In this study, we noted an uneven gender distribution in the sample, which is consistent with the overall gender ratio of our college, where there are more females than males. Although our sample reflected this gender imbalance, when we conducted a 3 (exercise intensity) &#x000d7; 2 (knowledge test time) &#x000d7; 2 (gender) analysis of variance (ANOVA), we found that the interaction between gender, exercise intensity, and knowledge measurement time was not significant. This suggests that, within the current study's design and analytical framework, gender differences did not significantly affect learning outcomes.</p><p>Nevertheless, we recognize that the gender distribution in the sample may have affected the generalizability of the study results. To further explore the potential impact of gender differences, we suggest that future research should strive for a more balanced gender representation or employ more sophisticated statistical methods to control for potential biases in gender distribution. Additionally, we consider this characteristic of gender distribution as a limitation of the present study and have thoroughly considered the possible impact of this factor in the discussion section.</p><p>In the limitations section of this study, we further discuss the potential impact of the uneven gender distribution on the interpretability of the study results and emphasize the need for deeper exploration of this issue in future research. We believe that although gender differences did not significantly affect the main results in this study, this finding does not entirely rule out the role that gender factors may play in other research contexts or with different samples. Therefore, we encourage subsequent researchers to continue to pay attention to the potential impact of gender differences on research results and to adopt appropriate methodological strategies to address this issue.</p><p>Q2:A Rational Explanation for the Verification of Exercise Intensity:</p><p>Answer2:</p><p>In this study, The RS800CXSD heart rate telemetry monitor (manufactured in Finland was used to monitor varying intensities of aerobic exercise loads.</p><p>Through this dual monitoring approach, we were able to monitor and record participants' heart rate changes in real-time, ensuring precise control of the exercise intensity.</p><p>We understand your concern regarding the rigor of the verification process. To enhance the transparency and reproducibility of our research, we have included additional details in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we have detailed the model of the Polar heart rate monitor used and provided an exhaustive description of the monitoring frequency and data recording procedures. Moreover, we have supplied an intensity monitoring record form for participants, which illustrates the real-time fluctuations in heart rate data throughout the study, thereby enhancing the credibility of our data.</p><p>Response to the Reviewer #5:</p><p>Q1:Gender Distribution Imbalance:</p><p>Answer1:Thank you for highlighting the issue of gender distribution. In the revised manuscript, we have included an in-depth analysis of the potential impact of gender distribution on the results and have thoroughly considered this factor's possible influence in the discussion section. Although the gender interaction was not significant, we still explored the potential impact of gender differences using advanced statistical methods.</p><p>Q2&#x0ff1a;Insufficient Theoretical Basis:</p><p>Answer2:Your question about the theoretical basis for the intervention duration is crucial. We have included more relevant studies in the revised manuscript to support the theoretical basis for our chosen 8-week intervention period, ensuring that our study design is scientifically sound.</p><p>Q3:Inadequate Control of Confounding Variables:</p><p>Answer2:We recognize the insufficiency in controlling potential confounding variables. In the revised manuscript, we have added control for sleep, nutrition, and academic workload and considered these variables in our analysis to reduce their potential impact on the results.</p><p>Q4:Lack of Detail in Heart Rate Monitoring Method:</p><p>Answer4&#x0ff1a;Thank you for your attention to the heart rate monitoring method. In the revised manuscript, we have detailed the device model (Polar H10) used for heart rate monitoring and included a graph of the intensity changes of the participants, as well as how we ensured the accuracy of heart rate data through a combination of Polar heart rate telemetry and manual radial artery pulse measurements.</p><p>Q5:Statistical Analysis Issues:</p><p>Answer5:We appreciate your focus on statistical analysis. In the revised manuscript, we have ensured adequate testing of MANOVA assumptions, consistently reported effect sizes, and included statistical power analysis.
