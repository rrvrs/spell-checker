Drawing inspiration from the moonlight proteins, we developed a cerium (Ce)-based nanozyme CF, featuring multiple enzymatic activities along with robust cargo-loading and transport capabilities. The CF was synthesized through a one-step assembly between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and a phosphorylated amino acid derivative, achieving high biostability through a simple heat treatment. The nanozyme possesses both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, enabling scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulation of inflammation by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activation. Besides its enzymatic activities, CF can also serve as a versatile nanocarrier for various cargoes through one-pot co-assembly. Herein, the CF-based nanoassembly loaded with a near infrared fluorescent dye was demonstrated to work well for the diagnosis of atherosclerotic plaques. The nanoassembly co-assembled with probucol exhibited superior ROS-scavenging and anti-inflammatory effects compared to either CF nanozyme or probucol, attributed to the synergy of the nanozyme and the drug, thus facilitating a highly efficient treatment of atherosclerosis. This work introduces a novel Ce-based nanozyme with multifunctional properties, providing a promising approach to endow nanozymes with moonlighting protein-like characteristics, thereby enhancing their functional capabilities and broadening their application potential in various fields.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Fabrication of multifunctional cerium-based nanozymes as moonlighting protein mimics for atherosclerosis diagnosis and therapy.<graphic xlink:href="d5sc01014d-ga.jpg" id="ga" position="float"/></p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

They not only form the basis of cells and tissues, but also are involved in numerous physiological processes. Besides typical proteins that play a single, well-defined role, these are many multifunctional proteins that can perform two or more distinct functions.<sup><xref rid="cit1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> For instance, lactoferrin possesses both deconjugating enzyme and nuclease activities, contributing to the degradation of DNA and RNA, while also functioning as an Fe<sup>3+</sup> transporter.<sup><xref rid="cit2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> ABC transporter proteins not only exhibit ATPase activity but also transport a variety of molecules, including ions, small-molecules, lipids, and drugs.<sup><xref rid="cit3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis, can also act as a transporter protein by transporting tRNA into the nucleus.<sup><xref rid="cit4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> These multifunctional proteins, named moonlighting proteins, play crucial roles in many physiological processes, including metabolism, signaling, and cellular stress responses, highlighting the complexity and adaptability of biological systems.<sup><xref rid="cit5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Inspired by this phenomenon in nature, integrating multiple biological functions into nanomaterials to mimic moonlighting proteins is a highly promising direction for future research.</p><p>Nanozymes are a class of nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme-like catalytic activities,<sup><xref rid="cit6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref></sup> providing an alternative to natural enzymes and holding significant promise for the development of moonlighting protein-like nanomaterials by integrating additional functions and their enzymatic activities. Some recent reports of multifunctional nanozymes have compellingly demonstrated this potential.<sup><xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9,10</xref></sup> Cerium (Ce)-based nanozymes, in particular, can embody multiple enzymatic activities, including oxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), because the coexistence of two oxidation states, Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>, enables reversible redox reactions.<sup><xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;16</xref></sup> This versatility not only renders Ce-based nanozymes highly effective in the treatment of various diseases, but also offers a compelling opportunity to develop moonlighting protein-like nanosystems.<sup><xref rid="cit17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref></sup> However, reports in this area remain scarce, highlighting a significant gap in research.</p><p>In this work, we aim to incorporate additional functions, such as drug loading and delivery capabilities, into Ce-based nanozymes to create moonlighting protein-mimic nanosystems for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. To achieve this, a novel Ce-based nanozyme with high biological stability and multiple enzymatic activities was developed through a one-step assembly between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and a phosphorylated amino acid derivative (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>), followed by a straightforward heat treatment at 95 &#x000b0;C. The use of the amino acid derivative not only ensures the biocompatibility, but also facilitates the efficient loading of various cargoes into the resultant nanozyme through a simple one-pot co-assembly, thus endowing the nanozyme with dual functionalities: enzymatic activity and the ability to act as a nanocarrier. After a comprehensive study of the nanozyme's enzymatic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, biostability, and cargo-loading and delivery capacities, we loaded the fluorescent probe IR780 or the clinical drug probucol into the nanozyme, and investigated the feasibility of resultant nano-assemblies for the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis, a disease of the large arteries that is the leading cause of heart disease and stroke. The results demonstrated that the nano-assemblies could efficiently accumulate at the sites of atherosclerotic plaques for imaging diagnosis, and enabled highly effective treatment of atherosclerosis by utilizing the synergy of the nanozyme and the drug.</p><fig position="float" id="sch1" fig-type="scheme"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the synthesis of the Ce-based nanozyme and the loading of cargoes in the nanozyme through one-pot co-assembly for synergetic therapy of atherosclerosis.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="d5sc01014d-s1" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Construction and characterization of Ce-based nanozymes</title><p>A moonlighting protein-mimic Ce-based nanozyme (referred to as CF) was prepared by the one-step assembly between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and a phosphorylated amino acid derivative (Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The use of the amino acid derivative is based on two main considerations: one is to ensure the good biocompatibility of the synthesized nanozyme, and the other is that its aromatic groups can provide cargo-loading sites, which allow cargoes to be easily and efficiently loaded into the CF nanozyme through &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking and hydrophobic interactions, thus endowing the CF nanozyme with moonlighting protein-like multifunctionality.<sup><xref rid="cit21" ref-type="bibr">21,22</xref></sup> To obtain the CF nanozyme with homogeneous spherical morphology, the feeding ratio of Ce<sup>3+</sup> to Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine was optimized by keeping the amount of Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine constant. As shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>), when the molar ratio of Ce<sup>3+</sup> to Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine was changed from 0.1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to 0.2&#x02009;:&#x02009;1, the particle size of CF was increased from 76.8 &#x000b1; 15.8 nm to 117.9 &#x000b1; 25.5 nm. With the further increase of the feeding ratio to 0.4&#x02009;:&#x02009;1, however, large aggregates were observed, accompanied by the formation of precipitation in the reaction solution (Fig. S1<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). Correspondingly, the hydrated particle size of CF, measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), was changed from 134 nm to 235 nm and then to 1.2 &#x000b5;m (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Since the feeding ratio of 0.1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 gave highly monodispersed CF nanoparticles with the narrowest size distribution, this ratio was used in the subsequent experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Characterization of the CF nanozyme.

In order to elucidate the assembly mechanism of CF, other two amino acid derivatives, Fmoc-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine (without the phosphate group) and <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine (without the Fmoc-group), were used to replace Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine (Fig. S2<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). By comparing the Tyndall effect of the reaction solutions (Fig. S3<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>), it was found that neither Fmoc-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine nor <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine could efficiently assemble with Ce<sup>3+</sup>, meaning that both phosphate and Fmoc-groups play crucial roles in the assembly of CF nanoparticles, thus indicating that the assembly reaction is synergically driven by the coordination between the phosphate group and Ce<sup>3+</sup> and the &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking effect of the Fmoc aromatic structure (Fig. S4<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). By simulating the dynamic formation of the CF assembly using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it was clearly illustrated that Ce<sup>3+</sup> could coordinate with the O atoms of carboxyl and phosphate groups in Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine. During the formation of the nanoassembly, the Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine molecules started to aggregate and appeared to attach with other aggregates, followed by coordination with surrounding Ce<sup>3+</sup>, leading to the formation of the nanoassembly eventually.</p><p>High stability in circulation systems is a prerequisite for nanomaterials as drugs and drug carriers. Due to the crucial role played by Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;O coordination during the assembly of CF nanoparticles, the presence of phosphate in the blood circulation system (0.97&#x02013;1.61 mmol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<sup><xref rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> may adversely affect the integrity of the nanoparticles. By following the escape behavior of fluorescent dye molecules (Fig. S5a<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>) from the CF nanoparticles, it was found that the CF nanoassembly showed good stability in water, but would be destroyed in PBS buffer, which was clearly reflected by the fluorescence decline due to the release of fluorescent dyes from the nanoassembly (Fig. S5b<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). The poor stability in PBS buffer might be attributed to the material disintegration caused by the competition for Ce<sup>3+</sup> between the buffer's phosphates and Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine molecules. In fact, unsatisfactory biostability is a common problem faced by many coordination-assembled nanomaterials. Fortunately, we found that the biostability of the CF nanoassembly could be significantly improved by an easy way that is, incubation of the nanoassembly at a relatively high temperature for an appropriate time.<sup><xref rid="cit24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> As shown in Fig. S6,<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> after being heated at 95 &#x000b0;C for 45 min, the obtained CF nanoassembly showed excellent stability in different systems, including water, 0.9% NaCl solution, DMEM medium and 2 mM PBS buffer.</p><p>Several characterization techniques and MD simulation were used to explore the underlying mechanism. The results of DLS, TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization demonstrated that the monodispersity, size, chemical components and crystallinity of CF were barely changed after heat treatment (Fig. S7&#x02013;S10<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping images clearly showed the homogeneous distribution of C, N, O, P and Ce elements in heat-treated CF nanoparticles (Fig. S11<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). Having excluded the effect of topology change, we used MD simulation to study the coordination between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and O atoms of the carboxyl group, as well as between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and O atoms of the phosphate group in Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine. Fig. S12<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> displays the radial distribution functions (RDF), represented as <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>), for the Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;carboxyl, Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;phosphate, and the total interactions. Based on these RDFs, the coordination numbers of Ce<sup>3+</sup> were determined. The total coordination number of Ce<sup>3+</sup> was increased from 1.32 to 3.58 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), thus signifying a transition to a more stable state as a result of the heat treatment.<sup><xref rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Examples of typical coordination of phosphate and carboxyl around Ce<sup>3+</sup> in the heated or unheated CF are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g and h</xref>. Notably, the coordination number involving carboxyl groups rose from 1.05 to 2.11 (a 1-fold increase) (Fig. S13<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>), while the coordination number involving phosphate groups increased from 0.25 to 1.48 (a 4.9-fold increase) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p>In order to visualize the main source of the increased stability, we calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) for Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;carboxyl and Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;phosphate. It was found that heat treatment changed the PMF of Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;carboxyl from 18.5 to 19.1 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Fig. S14<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). Meanwhile, the PMF of Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;phosphate rose from 25.2 to 31.4 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). The increased PMF values suggest that the coordination of Ce<sup>3+</sup> has attained greater energetic stability following the heat treatment.<sup><xref rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr">26,27</xref></sup> A substantial reduction in the average energy was also observed for the CF nanoassembly after heating, further underscoring the elevated stability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;phosphate exhibits greater changes in both the coordination number and PMF value than Ce<sup>3+</sup>&#x02013;carboxyl, suggesting that phosphate contributes more to the improvement of stability during heat treatment. Collectively, Ce<sup>3+</sup> preferentially coordinates with carboxyl groups during the CF formation at room temperature, and heat treatment contributes more to the coordination between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and phosphate, which may endow the CF nanoassembly with greater resistance to phosphate-induced disintegration. Overall, a simple heat treatment can greatly promote the coordination of central metal ions, indicating that such treatment may serve as a general strategy to improve the biostability of coordination-assembled nanomaterials.</p><p>From the high-resolution Ce 3d XPS spectrum, it could be found that the Ce element in the CF nanoassembly existed in two valence states (Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>) (Fig. S15<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). The reversible interconversion between these two valence states may endow the CF nanoassembly with multiple enzyme activities, such as SOD and CAT activities.<sup><xref rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Therefore, CF may function as a multifunctional nanozyme to catalyze cascade chemical reactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>). The SOD activity and CAT activity could be demonstrated by the nitrogen tetrazolium blue (NBT) photoreduction method and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex&#x02122; Red) assay, respectively.<sup><xref rid="cit20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Due to the scavenging of the superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>&#x002d9;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), which was produced by the oxidation of riboflavin, by the SOD activity of CF, the blue color of the NBT-O<sub>2</sub>&#x002d9;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> solution faded significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l</xref>). The CAT activity of CF catalyzed the conversion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub>, thus quenching the fluorescence response of Amplex&#x02122; Red to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1m</xref>), accompanied by the generation of O<sub>2</sub> bubbles in the reaction system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1n</xref>). O<sub>2</sub>&#x002d9;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are both crucial ROS involved in cellular oxidative damage and inflammation formation. The synergy of SOD and CAT enzymes in organisms can efficiently maintain the redox balance in organisms, which makes CF hold great promise in the treatment of ROS-related diseases, including atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>CF nanoassembly as a nanocarrier</title><p>The Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine monomer used for the CF assembly contains an aromatic Fmoc structure unit, which can produce strong interactions with many small molecule probes and drugs through synergetic interactions of &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking, hydrophobic interaction and so on, thus realizing the loading of these probes and drugs in the CF nanoassembly.<sup><xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> To verify this, various small probes and drugs, including coumarin 6, rhodamine B, IR780, indocyanine green (ICG), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and probucol, were individually mixed with Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Fmoc-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-tyrosine for the co-assembly reaction. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, all these small molecule cargoes could be efficiently loaded in the CF nanoassembly through a simple one-pot co-assembly reaction, giving highly monodisperse nanoparticles with enlarged particle size, which was related to the increase of molecular weight and hydrophobicity of the loaded cargoes. These experiments demonstrate that the CF nanozyme holds great potential to work as a general nanocarrier to load different cargoes, thus building different types of moonlighting protein-like multifunctional nanoassemblies. The morphology, monodispersity, and enzymatic activities of CF were well maintained after the co-assembly of different cargoes. As an example, the CFP nanoassembly (P = probucol), which was prepared by co-assembling probucol, a clinical small molecule drug for atherosclerosis treatment, into CF nanoparticles had a regular spherical morphology with a particle size of &#x0223c;109 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). It showed a hydrodynamic diameter of &#x0223c;202 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and a relatively homogeneous particle size distribution, with a polymer dispersity index (PDI) of 0.16. Its XRD pattern displayed no obvious crystallization peaks, indicating the amorphous state of the nanoassembly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The emergence of the characteristic peak of the S element in the XPS spectrum verified the successful co-assembly of probucol in CFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), and EDS elemental mapping images demonstrated the homogeneous distribution of Ce, C, N, O, P and S elements in the nanoassembly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify the amount of probucol in the nanoassembly, and the encapsulation rate was calculated to be &#x0223c;50.8% (Fig. S16<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). The stability of CFP was investigated in 2 mM PBS and 0.9% NaCl solution. After a 24 h incubation, the hydrodynamic diameters of CFP were almost unchanged, accompanied by &#x0003c;5% probucol leakage from CFP (Fig. S17<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). It has been reported that atherosclerosis, particularly in its early stages, is accompanied by an increase in phosphate concentration.<sup><xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> To investigate the release behavior of probucol from CFP, we employed the commonly used experimental conditions reported in the literature (10 mM PBS).<sup><xref rid="cit31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref></sup> As shown in Fig. S18,<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref> probucol could be released from CFP at a relatively constant rate in an elevated phosphate environment, achieving an approximately 75% release rate within 24 hours.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Moonlighting protein-like multi-functions of CF nanoassembly.

By using the JC-1 kit to detect the MMP changes, it was found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment resulted in the decrease of red fluorescence (aggregates) and the increase of green fluorescence (monomers), indicating ROS-induced MMP depolarization. Such a MMP depolarization could be alleviated by CF, CFP and probucol.

It has been reported that ROS can regulate the secretion of downstream inflammatory factors and trigger an inflammatory response, thus promoting the development and progression of atherosclerosis by activating the intracellular NF-&#x003ba;B inflammatory pathway.<sup><xref rid="cit43" ref-type="bibr">43,44</xref></sup> The activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is typically characterized by the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B p65,<sup><xref rid="cit45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;47</xref></sup> a subunit of the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor family. Thus, the inhibiting abilities of CFP to NF-&#x003ba;B p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were studied. The western blot test showed that LPS induced the improvement of the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 phosphorylation level in RAW 264.7 cells, which is reflected by the increased phosphorylation product of NF-&#x003ba;B p-p65 (the p-means phosphorylated), but such a phosphorylation process could be efficiently overcome by the CF nanozyme, probucol and their assembly CFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and S20<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). In the immunofluorescence assay, obvious fluorescence, which was caused by the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 nuclear translocation, was observed in the nucleus of LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. And again, such a nuclear translocation was significantly inhibited by CF, CFP and probucol, especially CFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). The phenomenon could be seen more clearly in the enlarged images. The extracted fluorescence intensity of p65 in the plot profile is also shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>. Collectively, the highly efficient inhibiting capabilities to NF-&#x003ba;B p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation mean that CFP can turn off the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, thus holding great promise in regulating the secretion of downstream inflammatory factors, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and iNOS. The results of qPCR and the western blot test demonstrated that CFP could indeed down-regulate the expression levels of inflammatory factor-related genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>) and corresponding proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref> and S21<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>), thus holding great promise in anti-inflammatory therapy. Upon a thorough evaluation of the above experimental results, it is evident that CFP demonstrates superior anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that the development and progression of atherosclerosis is inflammation-related, and atherosclerotic plaques originate from the formation of foam cells.<sup><xref rid="cit48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> The excellent anti-inflammatory activity makes CFP a promising candidate drug for atherosclerosis prevention and treatment.

This experiment confirmed the potential of CFP for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis at the cellular level.</p></sec><sec><title>Biocompatibility, intracellular uptake and accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques</title><p>The exciting <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> results encouraged us to validate the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> potential of CFP for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Before this, the toxicity, biocompatibility and atherosclerotic plaque-targeted ability of the CFP nanoassembly were examined. Cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated that the CFP nanoassembly presented very weak or negligible cytotoxicity (Fig. S23<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). Hemolysis experiments showed that CFP had no hemolysis reaction even at the concentration up to 200 &#x000b5;M (Fig. S22<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). To visually observe the atherosclerotic plaque-targeted ability of CF-based nanoassemblies, near infrared fluorescent probe IR780 was co-assembled into CF to prepare the CFIR nanoassembly. Similar to CFP, the obtained CFIR also showed the spherical morphology with good monodispersity (Fig. S25<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). The results of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that the CFIR nanoassembly could be taken up by macrophages, and a sufficiently high uptake rate was achieved after incubating the cells with CFIR for 3 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). By following the co-localization of lysosomes with the CFIR nanoassembly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), it could be found that the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PC) increased from 1 h to 3 h and then declined from 3 h to 6 h (0.38 &#x02192; 0.62 &#x02192; 0.47), indicating that CFIR nanoparticles were taken up through lysosomal endocytosis then escaped from lysosomes to the cytoplasm.<sup><xref rid="cit47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Biocompatibility and intracellular uptake of CFIR and its accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques.

The accreditation number of the laboratory is SYXK(Jin) 2019-0002 promulgated by Tianjin Science and Technology Commission. After the successful establishment of atherosclerotic plaques models, CFIR was administered to mice <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> tail vein injection. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, enhanced IR780 fluorescence was clearly observed in the atherosclerotic plaques of apolipoprotein E-deficient (<italic toggle="yes">ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice (atherosclerosis model mice) within 1 h, and obvious IR780 fluorescence could still be observed after 24 h, indicating the accumulation of the nanoassembly in the plaque area. In contrast, no obvious CFIR accumulation was observed at the carotid artery in healthy C57BL/6J mice. IR780 fluorescence and Oil red O (ORO) staining analysis of the isolated aorta further corroborated the enrichment of CFIR in the plaque region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Tissue section staining of the aortic arch and brachiocephalic artery clearly showed the nanoassembly (red) uptake by macrophages (blue) in the plaques (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), and such an uptake resulted in the accumulation of the CFIR nano-assembly in the atherosclerotic plaques. The targeted accumulation may be attributed to the enhanced endothelial permeability and active macrophages uptake in the plaque area.<sup><xref rid="cit50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> These results not only demonstrate the targeted enrichment ability of cargo-loading CF nanoassemblies in atherosclerotic plaque regions, but also suggest the wide application potential of the CF nanozyme due to its broad cargo-loading capacity. That is, when fluorescent probes are loaded, the obtained CF-based nanoassemblies may be used for the imaging analysis of diseases. If drugs are loaded, highly efficient treatment of diseases may be realized through the synergy of the drug and nanozyme.</p><p>Next, the metabolic pathway of cargo-loaded CF nanoassemblies was examined. <italic toggle="yes">Ex vivo</italic> experiments showed that the CFIR nanoassembly was enriched in macrophage-rich clearance organs, such as liver (Fig. S26<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>). To reveal the metabolic pathway of CF and CF-based nanoassemblies, we collected feces and urine samples of C57BL/6J mice at different time points after tail vein injection of CF and analyzed the Ce contents in these samples by ICP-MS. The results showed that a considerable amount of Ce was detected in the feces (Fig. S27<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">&#x02020;</xref>), suggesting that the nanoassemblies were mainly metabolized through the hepatobiliary system and excreted through the feces.<sup><xref rid="cit51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Similar ICP-MS results were obtained from the feces and urine samples of CFP-injected mice, suggesting that CF and cargo-loaded CF nanoassemblies follow the same metabolic pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-atherosclerotic efficacy <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic></title><p>As a moonlighting protein-like nanozyme, CF holds great promise for various biological and biomedical applications. Having demonstrated its application in imaging diagnosis of diseases by coassembling a fluorescent probe into the CF nanoassembly, we next aim to explore its feasibility for disease treatment by loading therapeutic drugs. In the above experiments, we have found that the probucol-loaded CFP nanoassembly exhibits superior ROS-eliminating ability and enhanced anti-inflammatory efficiency compared to the CF nanozyme and probucol. Based on the targeted accumulation behavior of CF-based nanoassembies in atherosclerotic plaques, CFP has shown great potential for the synergistic atherosclerosis treatment. To demonstrate this, the <italic toggle="yes">ApoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> model mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks to develop atherosclerotic plaques,<sup><xref rid="cit52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and then divided into 4 groups. Each group received twice-weekly treatment with different formulations for 10 weeks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Compared to the control group without any treatment, in which the plaque area accounted for 35% of the total aorta area, probucol and CF nanozyme treatment could decrease the plaque area to 25% and 15%, respectively. It was exciting that CFP treatment was able to significantly minimize the plaque area to &#x0223c;9%. The markedly enhanced efficiency can be attributed to moonlighting protein-like properties of the nanoassembly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). That is, its drug-loading and delivery capabilities enhance the enrichment of probucol at targeted sites, and the multiple enzyme activities in conjunction with the encapsulated probucol enable a synergistic treatment for atherosclerotic plaques. The sections of aortic roots in different groups were further analyzed to quantitatively assess the necrotic core, collagen deposition, and macrophage infiltration. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, CFP was more effective than the CF nanozyme and probucol in reducing the necrotic core area (marked by black dashed lines), showing the largest reduction degree from &#x0223c;25% to &#x0223c;4% of the total aortic area. Masson staining was used to observe the collagen deposition in the aortic lesion region. And again, the CFP-treated group showed the highest levels of collagen deposition, suggesting that CFP treatment may activate the repairing mechanism of the blood vessel wall, promoting the production of collagen and thus repairing damaged blood vessels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). The increased collagen deposition can also stabilize the plaques, reducing the risk of plaque rupture and thrombosis. CD68 immunohistochemical staining can quantify macrophages in the plaque area, thus evaluating the development and deterioration of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). It was observed that treatment with CFP effectively reduced the macrophage infiltration area in the plaque region, preventing the pathological progression of atherosclerotic disease.<sup><xref rid="cit52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Collectively, CFP can efficiently reduce the necrotic core area, promote the deposition of collagen, and inhibit macrophage infiltration, thus holding great promise for atherosclerosis management.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Anti-atherosclerotic efficacy <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.
