Given that community care can be paid by the VA or Medicare, there is potential for payer substitution or cost shifting for ED care from Medicare to the VA.<sup><xref rid="ald240034r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Understanding changes in ED payer source post&#x02013;MISSION Act implementation is critical to inform national efforts to improve health care delivery for veterans and ensure optimal use of federal funds.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-ALD240034"><title>Methods</title><p>Using linked Medicare-VA data between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021, we identified veterans (aged &#x02265;18 years) covered by both programs. In accordance with the Common Rule, this cross-sectional study was exempt from ethics review and informed consent requirement because it was classified as nonresearch by the VA. We followed the <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link> reporting guideline.</p><p>From the Program Integrity Tools database, we obtained the number of VA ED visits at VA or community facilities purchased by the VA.<sup><xref rid="ald240034r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Using ED revenue center codes from traditional Medicare (TM) and Medicare Advantage (MA) data, we identified Medicare-purchased community ED visits. We calculated the number of yearly ED visits per 1000 veterans in Medicare overall and by VA ED visits, VA-purchased community ED visits, and Medicare-purchased community ED visits. We ascertained yearly percentage of ED visits across these 3 categories. We estimated total costs shifted from Medicare to VA post&#x02013;MISSION Act implementation (eMethods in <xref rid="note-ALD240034-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).

The percentage with at least 1 ED visit was 37.0% in 2016 and 37.6% in 2021.

Results suggest a substitution effect and cost shifting from Medicare to VA following MISSION Act implementation, which we estimated as approximately $2 billion in 2021. This shift is particularly concerning among veterans enrolled in MA since plans receive capitated payments regardless of actual use of VA- or Medicare-covered services.<sup><xref rid="ald240034r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Policymakers and VA leaders should consider health reforms to improve care efficiency for veterans.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s observational design limited our ability to infer causality between MISSION Act implementation and payer change. Nevertheless, using comprehensive data on Medicare and VA enrollees, this study showed that costs of community ED care for veterans are shifting from Medicare to the VA.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ALD240034"><title>References</title><ref id="ald240034r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name><surname>Massarweh</surname>
