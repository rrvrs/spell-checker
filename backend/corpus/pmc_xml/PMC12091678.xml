1. Introduction</title><p>Acute infarction of the brainstem, which occurs mainly in elderly patients, has high rates of incidence, disability, and mortality; pulmonary embolism (PE) is among its serious complications and is one of the main causes of death following acute cerebral infarction.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The peak incidence of PE is mainly in the second to 4th weeks after cerebral infarction, partly owing to stroke, which leads to a limitation of activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> In the acute phase of stroke, once PE has developed, anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated because it would increase the risk of cerebral infarction bleeding conversion.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> In patients with high-risk PE, thrombolysis is contraindicated during the acute phase of cerebral infarction, making the choice of treatment more challenging. To the best of our knowledge, there are as yet no clinical reports on acute large-area brainstem infarctions complicated by high-risk PE. Here, therefore, we report such a case in order to improve clinicians&#x02019; understanding of similar situations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>
2. Case presentation</title><p>A 63-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on August 11, 2021, with a main complaint of partial paralysis, saying that his left leg had become unresponsive. He had a history of hypertension, which had been controlled with nifedipine. He had also smoked some 20 cigarettes/day for more than 30 years. Upon admission to the hospital, he reported having experienced 7 hours of weakness in his left leg, and he was unable to get up. Moreover, his responses were slow and his voice was unclear. His score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 14, and his NIH Strike Scale and Rankin scores were 8 and 4, respectively. He was therefore sent to the emergency department, where he immediately underwent computed tomography (CT) and computed tomography angiography of the head and neck. The CT scan showed no obvious cerebral hemorrhage, while the computed tomography angiography suggested irregular thickening and calcification of the wall at the bifurcation of the right common carotid artery, with mild stenosis of the lumen. Also noted were calcified plaques in the siphon area of the internal carotid arteries, with mild narrowing of the lumen; the left vertebral artery was also slender. These findings indicated that the acute cerebral infarction should be considered first. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed multiple recent infarcts in the brainstem and right cerebral hemisphere (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The patient was therefore given enteric-coated aspirin tablets (100&#x02009;mg) and clopidogrel bisulfate (150&#x02009;mg) to oppose platelet aggregation and atorvastatin (40&#x02009;mg) to stabilize the plaque. He was then transferred to the neurology ward, where urinary kallidinogenase and edaravone were administered intravenously for almost a week. As a result, the patient condition improved significantly; his left leg gained muscle strength and his speech gradually returned to near normal. During hospitalization, this patient had a padua score of 4, suggesting a high risk of venous thrombosis, but because of the high risk of anticoagulant bleeding, a plantar vein pump was given for physical prophylaxis of venous thrombosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>On admission, magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed recent multiple infarcts in the brainstem and right hemisphere.

Physical examination: BP 72/52&#x02009;mm Hg; P, 96 beats/min; R, 24 beats/min; SO<sub>2</sub>, 88%; clear consciousness. Clear breath sounds in both lungs, with no dry or moist rales. A regular heart rhythm, soft abdomen, no edema in the limbs, and with negative Babinski sign on both sides. As a result, the patient immediately received treatment with a high-flow oxygen mask to enhance oxygenation and an intravenous injection of norepinephrine (1.6&#x02009;mg/h) to maintain blood pressure. However, his condition did not improve. Laboratory examination: arterial blood gas analysis showed that when the oxygen concentration was 33%, the blood oxygen partial pressure was 62.7&#x02009;mm Hg, the carbon dioxide partial pressure was 31.9&#x02009;mm Hg, the oxygenation index was 190&#x02009;mm Hg, and the blood lactate was 1.5 mmol/L, indicating type I respiratory failure; the levels of white blood cells, C-reactive protein, and calcitonin were basically normal. Blood chemistry examination indicated only hypercalcemia, while other indicators were within the normal range. The level of serum D-dimer increased significantly, to 14.76 &#x000b5;g/mL, while the normal range was &#x0003c;0.5 &#x000b5;g/mL. The levels of plasma pro-brain natriuretic peptide and troponin-T were 243.7 pg/mL and 0.016&#x02009;ng/mL, respectively (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Bedside electrocardiography showed typical SIQIIITIII changes (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Color Doppler ultrasound of the heart showed aortic sclerosis. The ejection fraction was 76%. Color Doppler ultrasound of blood vessels in both lower limbs revealed thrombosis of the left posterior tibial vein. Considering the patient bedridden state after cerebral infarction, acute onset of shock after getting out of bed, and characteristic changes on electrocardiography, the presence of a high-risk PE became the first consideration. Therefore, emergency computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was immediately performed. It showed that the left and right pulmonary artery trunks were obstructed and that there was a grade II&#x02013;III PE in a major branch (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A1&#x02013;5). Ultimately, the diagnosis of high-risk PE was clear. However, the patient was in the acute stage of a massive brainstem infarction, and thrombolysis was contraindicated. Therefore, anticoagulation therapy was given with unfractionated heparin (first dose, 4000 IU IV; maintenance dose, 900 IU/h; followed by micropump maintenance). However, the blood pressure could not be stabilized, even with anticoagulation. After a joint consultation with experts from cardiac surgery, interventional department, and respiratory department, it was decided to perform pulmonary artery thrombectomy. Pulmonary angiography during the operation showed multiple thromboses in the main pulmonary artery and branches of the left and right pulmonary arteries (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A&#x02013;C). We used a 6F catheter to enter the left and right pulmonary artery trunks and branches and repeatedly pushed and pulled the catheter to break the thrombus; a large portion of thrombus was then extracted by manual thrombus aspiration. reexamination of pulmonary angiography revealed that the left and right pulmonary arteries and their main branches were unobstructed, and no obvious thrombosis was found (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). Postoperatively, urokinase (200,000 U) was given for selective transcatheter thrombolysis by the neurologist. After the procedure, the pulmonary artery pressure was measured at 45/28&#x02009;mm Hg. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). After the norepinephrine was stopped, his blood pressure returned to normal and his vital signs remained stable.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Laboratory

3. Discussion</title><p>This study reports a 63-year-old male with acute massive brainstem infarction and high-risk PE. Due to thrombolysis contraindication, multidisciplinary pulmonary thrombectomy with local urokinase thrombolysis achieved rapid hemodynamic stabilization. Stepwise anticoagulation led to complete thrombus resolution on 3-month CTPA and neurological recovery. The case validates mechanical thrombectomy as pivotal for high-risk PE when thrombolysis is contraindicated, highlighting multidisciplinary collaboration and precision anticoagulation in managing complex dual pathologies.</p><p>Cerebral infarction and PE are the second and third fatal acute cardiovascular diseases after myocardial infarction.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> To the best of our knowledge, the acquired risk factors for pulmonary thrombosis include aging, hospitalization, surgery, tumors, limb immobilization, infection, and others.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Most stroke patients have multiple risk factors for venous thrombosis, among which inactivity is particularly important.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> A fatal PE usually occurs 2 weeks after stroke and reaches its peak at the end of 2 weeks.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Studies have shown that without prompt intervention, about 30% of such patients develop pulmonary emboli, and the incidence of severe hemiplegia can be as high as 70%.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The patient in the case presented here was elderly; he was bedridden after stroke and had limited left-leg mobility; all these factors contributed to his pulmonary thrombosis. The PE appeared in the second week after stroke, which is consistent with the peak time of onset reported in the literature.</p><p>The clinical symptoms of PE are often atypical, leading to 13% to 25% of early deaths after stroke, and PE is also the most common cause of death in the early stages of stroke.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the early prevention and identification of PE are crucial. For individuals at high risk for venous thrombosis &#x02013; after fully evaluating the bleeding risk of anticoagulant therapy &#x02013; appropriate measures should be taken as early as possible to prevent the development of thrombosis.</p><p>In terms of treatment, patients with acute cerebral infarction combined with high-risk PE have complex conditions. How to balance anticoagulant therapy with secondary intracranial hemorrhage is a particular challenge. At present, the guidelines do not explicitly propose treatment strategies for such patients; thus, the approach has been based mainly on case reports.</p><p>Pavesi et al<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> reported on a patient with high-risk PE complicated by cerebral infarction, who, after receiving thrombolytic therapy, received unfractionated heparin anticoagulation for 72 hours and was then started on oral warfarin therapy for 3 months. He underwent surgical closure of the foramen ovale 3 months later. No bleeding events occurred during this period, and the prognosis was good. Similarly, Fujino et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> reported on a patient with cerebral infarction complicated by PE, who was treated with continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin until the condition stabilized; he was then switched to oral anticoagulant therapy with edoxaban, which finally led to a good result. However, Nam et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> reported on another patient with a high-risk PE, who, after pulmonary artery thrombectomy, developed right hemiplegia and was unable to recover neurologic function over the long term. Eventually, he was transferred to a hospital specializing in conservative treatment. Our case was complicated by a pulmonary artery embolism accompanied by a large area of brainstem infarction, a condition known to have a high mortality rate, and the risk of bleeding during thrombolytic therapy in the acute stage of brainstem infarction is extremely high. Once such bleeding occurs, the consequences are unimaginable. According to the PE guidelines, unfractionated heparin is recommended as the first choice for patients with acute high-risk PE who require initial anticoagulation prior to thrombolytic therapy. In our case, therefore, anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was given first, and once initial anticoagulation had failed, pulmonary artery thrombectomy was performed immediately.</p><p>From the perspective of cerebral infarction, some scholars hold that low-molecular-weight heparin is not useful for preventing deep veinous thrombosis because it increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Others suggest that in patients with cerebral infarction, the use of unfractionated heparin after thrombolysis versus simple thrombolysis would not increase the risk of bleeding.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> From the perspective of PE, they hold that if there is no contraindication to thrombolysis, systemic thrombolysis is the preferred strategy for patients with high-risk PE. We, however, maintain that surgical thrombectomy or interventional thrombectomy should be the first choice.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> The advantages and disadvantages of these 3 approaches are shown in Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Our patient with a high-risk PE was in the acute stage of a massive brainstem infarction, thrombolysis was contraindicated, and his clinical symptoms still deteriorated under anticoagulation therapy; thus, we realized that it would be useless to rely solely on anticoagulant treatment. Patients with a hemodynamically unstable PE in whom thrombolysis is contraindicated should immediately undergo pulmonary artery thrombectomy.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> This is a mechanical interventional procedure that, under the guidance of imaging, uses endovascular devices to remove a blood clot or thrombus.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Thrombectomy is commonly used in acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and PE.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Therefore, after discussion with a multidisciplinary team, we decided to perform pulmonary artery thrombectomy in our case. After the procedure, urokinase was administered via a catheter for selective thrombolysis, followed by intravenous maintenance anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. This therapeutic schedule not only avoids the high risk of bleeding caused by intravenous thrombolysis in the acute stage of stroke but also greatly reduces the load of thrombi in the patient pulmonary arteries, thereby buying the time for subsequent anticoagulation and ultimately improving the patient prognosis. Of course, this study is a single-center case report with a sample size limited to one patient. The generalizability of the findings and conclusions is inherently constrained. Due to individual variability and the complexity of comorbid conditions, the efficacy and safety of the described therapeutic strategy require validation through larger cohort studies.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Advantages and disadvantages of reperfusion regimens for high-risk pulmonary embolism of this patient.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reperfusion regimens</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Advantages</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disadvantages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Systemic thrombolysis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Noninvasive</td><td align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">High risk of bleeding</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low-cost</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Highly efficient in vascular recanalization</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Percutaneous catheter-directed treatment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimally invasive</td><td align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Higher cost</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Highly efficient in vascular recanalization</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low risk of bleeding</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Surgical embolectomy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Highly efficient in vascular recanalization</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Invasive; high cost</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low risk of bleeding</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Many complications: vascular rupture, vascular dissection, vascular wall damage, etc</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>
4. Conclusion</title><p>In summary, early prevention and identification of PE are crucial in patients with acute stroke. In treating PE, the pros and cons should be weighed based on the severity of the patient condition, and personalized treatment strategies should be developed. Once a high-risk PE has developed in a patient with acute stroke, thrombolytic therapy is an absolute contraindication. When intravenous anticoagulants cannot improve hemodynamics, pulmonary artery thrombectomy is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the nurses and residents of the emergency department and the neurology ward of the Affiliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Dongyang, China, who were involved in the management of the patient.
