This pioneering law in the region enhanced the protection of women and girls&#x02019; rights and introduced harsher penalties for perpetrators of sexist violence. However, the journey toward eradicating violence against women is complex and multifaceted.</p></sec><sec id="sec9125"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our aim is to explore how tunisian women perceive gender-based violence and their attitudes towards it.</p></sec><sec id="sec9126"><title>Methods</title><p>A cross sectional online survey designed using Google Forms and distributed on social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram) was conducted from August&#x000a0;30<sup>th</sup> to September 25<sup>th</sup> 2023. The questionnaire, presented in the tunisian dialect, included questions about personal experiences with violence, knowledge of gender-based violence laws as well as their&#x000a0;perceptions and attitudes towards gender-based violence. The sample consisted of women from various regions of Tunisia.</p></sec><sec id="sec9127"><title>Results</title><p>In our study, we analyzed a sample comprising 110 tunisian women, with 46.4% falling within the 20 to 30 age bracket and 36.4% belonging to the 30 to 40 age range. Half of the survey participants were unmarried, and the majority of them (97.3%) had attained a university-level education.</p><p>Our research revealed that 45.5% of the surveyed women reported instances of gender-based violence in Tunisia. However, only a minority of these individuals (22.2%) initiated legal proceedings, primarily citing a lack of confidence in the judicial system and fear of potential reprisals as their reasons.</p><p>A majority of the participating women expressed deep concern regarding the issue of violence against women in Tunisia.</p><p>When asked about their perceptions of the most prevalent types of violence in Tunisia, 76.36% believed that psychological violence was the most common, followed by sexual violence (21.3%). Economic and physical violence were perceived as less frequent (9.9%; 12.6%). These women attributed the primary factors contributing to violence against women in Tunisia to cultural norms and laws that they considered inadequately stringent. Indeed, 83.3% of them believed that the current legislation was not stringent enough to deter potential perpetrators, and 37.3% indicated that they were unaware of the existing legal framework.</p></sec><sec id="sec9128"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite legislative advancements, gender-based violence remains a pressing concern in Tunisia. These findings underscore the importance of increasing awareness about available resources for victims, educating individuals about women&#x02019;s rights and mental health, and building trust in the judicial system.</p></sec><sec id="sec9129"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
