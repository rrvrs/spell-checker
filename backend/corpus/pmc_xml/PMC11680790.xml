Characterisation of naturally occurring apelin receptor variants from the UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project, and AlphaFold2 modelling, identifies T89<sup>2.64</sup> as important in the ELA binding site, and R168<sup>4.64</sup> as forming extensive interactions with the C-termini of both peptides. Base editing to introduce an R/H168<sup>4.64</sup> variant into human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrates that this residue is critical for receptor binding and function. Additionally, we present an apelin receptor crystal structure bound to the G protein-biased, small molecule agonist, CMF-019, which reveals a deeper binding mode versus the endogenous peptides at lipophilic pockets between transmembrane helices associated with GPCR activation. Overall, the data provide proof-of-principle for using genetic variation to identify key sites regulating receptor-ligand engagement.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">This study explores apelin receptor&#x02019;s role in cardiovascular function, identifying residues critical for binding through genetic variants, AlphaFold2 modelling and base editing in cardiomyocytes.

Canonical G<sub>i</sub> protein signalling mediates physiological effects of the apelin receptor, including increasing cardiac contractility, inducing vasodilatation, and antithrombotic action. Prolonged binding of an agonist can facilitate phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), and subsequent recruitment of &#x003b2;-arrestin protein. This typically desensitises and &#x02018;switches off&#x02019; receptor signalling by sterically hindering engagement with G protein complexes and inducing internalisation of the receptor.

In the adult cardiovascular system, both apelin and ELA importantly induce antihypertensive effects, mediating venous and arterial vasodilatation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the heart, apelin induces potent positive inotropy, increasing cardiac contractility and output through activation of apelin receptors present on cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Apelin signalling also plays a role in haemostasis, exerting antithrombotic effects through activation of apelin receptors present on platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Beyond the cardiovascular system, the apelin signalling axis is widely distributed in peripheral and central tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Dysregulation of apelin receptor signalling can, therefore, contribute to a range of disease states, and there is much interest in the apelin receptor as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, renal, and neurological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Downregulation of apelin signalling in pulmonary arterial hypertension has gathered significant interest, and targeting the apelin receptor with agonists forms a future potential therapeutic strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, whilst exogenous peptide agonists are widely used as therapeutic agents, they typically exhibit poor absorption and stability in vivo, severely affecting receptor engagement and, therefore, efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, treatment with agonists can be associated with secondary processes such as receptor desensitisation, typically in the form of internalisation, which can limit their effectiveness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Several distinct small molecule agonists targeting the apelin receptor have been developed in recent years, including AMG 986<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, cmpd644<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and the G protein-biased agonist CMF-019 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), which triggers less receptor internalisation and desensitisation, providing an interesting profile worth further examination, notably around structure activity relationships at the apelin receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Previously, experimental structures of the apelin receptor have been reported for complexes with the synthetic peptide AMG3054<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, a synthetic single-domain antagonist antibody (JN241)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the endogenous peptide ELA and small synthetic agonist cmpd644<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and more recently with the endogenous peptide apelin and the G protein-biased small synthetic agonist CMF-019 by cryoEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. While these structures have provided insights into receptor binding modes, key determinants of engagement with endogenous peptides versus small synthetic agonists remain largely uncharacterised.</p><p id="Par8">To provide further clarity on peptide versus small molecule binding at the apelin receptor, we used a combinatorial approach. The UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project was developed to carry out the sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes from National Health Service patients with rare diseases and cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and provides the opportunity to identify naturally occurring variants within functional regions, including endogenous ligand and drug binding sites, of protein targets such as GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, naturally occurring human apelin receptor variants have not been investigated, so here we explored several rare variants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) identified in the 100,000 Genomes Project that were predicted to be deleterious to receptor function in an in vitro setting. AlphaFold2 modelling was then used to propose a structural rationale for the impact of receptor variants on ligand binding. Additionally, we leveraged Nxera Pharma (formerly Sosei Heptares) proprietary technology to generate a stabilised receptor (NxStaR&#x000ae;), enabling the determination of an apelin receptor crystal structure in complex with the G protein-biased, small molecule agonist CMF-019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of ultra-rare apelin receptor variants identified in individuals recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project NBR</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th>Protein location</th><th>Genomic coordinates (chr:position)</th><th>Variant type</th><th>HGVS coding sequence</th><th>Codon change</th><th>HGVS protein sequence</th><th>SIFT</th><th>Poly Phen-2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>V/L38<sup>1.42</sup>*</td><td>TM1</td><td>11:57004367</td><td>missense</td><td>112G&#x0003e;C</td><td>GTC &#x02192;CTC</td><td>V38L</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.931</td></tr><tr><td>G/X45<sup>1.49</sup>*</td><td>TM1</td><td>11:57004344</td><td>frameshift</td><td>134delG</td><td>GGC&#x02192;GC&#x00394;</td><td>G45X</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>D/V65<sup>2.40</sup></td><td>TM2</td><td>11:57004285</td><td>missense</td><td>194A&#x0003e;T</td><td>GAT&#x02192;GTT</td><td>D65V</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.999</td></tr><tr><td>V/M79<sup>2.54</sup></td><td>TM2</td><td>11:57004244</td><td>missense</td><td>235G&#x0003e;A</td><td>GTG&#x02192;ATG</td><td>V79M</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>T/M89<sup>2.64</sup>*</td><td>TM2</td><td>11:57004213</td><td>missense</td><td>266C&#x0003e;T</td><td>ACG&#x02192;ATG</td><td>T89M</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>R/H127<sup>3.50</sup></td><td>TM3</td><td>11:57004099</td><td>missense</td><td>380G&#x0003e;A</td><td>CGC&#x02192;CAC</td><td>R127H</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>R/W139<sup>34.55</sup></td><td>ICL2</td><td>11:57004064</td><td>missense</td><td>415C&#x0003e;T</td><td>CGG&#x02192;TGG</td><td>R139W</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>R/H168<sup>4.64</sup>*</td><td>TM4</td><td>11:57003976</td><td>missense</td><td>503G&#x0003e;A</td><td>CGC&#x02192;CAC</td><td>R168H</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>T/X227<sup>5.64</sup>*</td><td>TM5</td><td>11:57003799</td><td>frameshift</td><td>679delA</td><td>ACC&#x02192;&#x00394;CC</td><td>T227X</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>R/W243<sup>6.30</sup></td><td>TM6</td><td>11:57003752</td><td>missense</td><td>727C&#x0003e;T</td><td>CGG&#x02192;TGG</td><td>R243W</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>T/M269<sup>6.56</sup></td><td>TM6</td><td>11:57003673</td><td>missense</td><td>806C&#x0003e;T</td><td>ACG&#x02192;ATG</td><td>T269M</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.000</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The table summarises the variants, providing the residue sequence location and Ballesteros&#x02013;Weinstein numbering, genomic co-ordinates (chromosome#:position#), the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) coding and apelin receptor sequence mutations codon changes.

As a relatively hydrophobic compound (Chrom logD 3.14), CMF-019 makes mostly Van der Waals contacts with the receptor. The isobutyl, thiophene, and isopentyl moieties bind to various hydrophobic side chains lining lipophilic sub-pockets at the interfaces between TM6 and TM7, and TM2 and TM3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">The binding pocket is also lined by several polar residues from TM3, TM4, ECL2, and TM5, notably including the tyrosine residues Y185<sup>ECL2</sup> and Y264<sup>6.51</sup> that form hydrogen-bonds with the CMF-019 carboxylic group in the extracellular vestibule (ECV) and core amine, respectively. Interestingly, a significant portion of the orthosteric site, near the interface between TM3, TM4, and TM5, is occupied by an oleic acid molecule. Whilst it corresponds to the monoolein molecule observed in the previously reported AMG3054 and cmpd644 apelin receptor crystal structures, in our structure it protrudes somewhat deeper towards the agonist, and lines the CMF-019 binding site between sub-pocket II and the ECV. Its carboxylic head group stacks onto the CMF-019 aromatic core and forms a salt bridge with R168<sup>4.64</sup>, which makes a direct contact with an outer edge of the CMF-019 central aromatic ring.</p><p id="Par24">The pose of CMF-019 in our crystal structure is in agreement with that observed in the recent G protein complex cryoEM structure, although there were some notable differences.

The bulkier CMF-019 thiophene moiety binds deeper into sub-pocket III at the TM6-TM7 interface. However, cmpd644 presents more bulkiness in sub-pocket I, higher at the interface between TM6 and TM7, and its dimethoxy-phenyl moiety binds much deeper into sub-pocket II at the TM2-TM3 interface. It is within this area of the orthosteric site that notable differences for side chains are observed due to some induced-fit. W261<sup>6.48</sup> and Y299<sup>7.43</sup> in sub-pocket III show different rotamers, due to the differences in moiety chemical structure between these small molecule agonists. Also, the W85<sup>2.60</sup> side chain shows two very distinct conformations, one facing the TM1-TM2 interface in the inactive crystal structure, and the other lining the equivalent of sub-pocket II at the TM2-TM3 interface in the active G protein-bound cryoEM structure, which is also the W85<sup>2.60</sup> side chain conformation observed in our apelin receptor NxStaR CMF-019 structure.</p><p id="Par30">Another major difference was observed around R168<sup>4.64</sup> at the bottom of the ECV. This residue makes a cation-pi interaction with the cmpd644 dimethoxy-phenyl moiety in the inactive crystal structure, but this interaction is not observed in the active G protein-bound state, because the dimethoxy-phenyl has moved more towards the TM1-TM2 interface. The most striking similarity is observed between sub-pocket II and the ECV, despite the difference in core structure between these small molecules. Whilst the cmpd644 core is built in part around a sulfonamide, this acid group ends up in a position similar to that of the CMF-019 carboxylic group and the head group of the oleic acid molecule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Small molecule agonists bind deeper at TM interfaces versus peptides</title><p id="Par31">We further compared our apelin receptor NxStaR CMF-019 crystal structure with previously reported apelin receptor-peptide bound experimental structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Overall, peptides engaged with the receptor via the large space at the interface between TM7, TM2, TM3, and ECL2, with their C-termini reaching down in the orthosteric pocket at a site lying at the interface between TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

Compared to the small molecule agonist complex structures, this corresponds roughly to where the small agonist cores are positioned. In this configuration, the conformation of the ELA F10 side chain across the cryoEM structures, for example, is such that it visited either sub-pocket II or III, and the location of the C-terminal carboxylate overlapped with that of the oleic acid head group. Similar to the recent apelin bound cryoEM structure, the M11 side chain overlapped with the CMF-019 thiophene moiety, and P12 and F13 locations overlapped with that of the oleic acid.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Comparison of the CMF-019 complex apelin receptor structure with peptide bound complexes emphasises the deeper reach of the small molecule agonist at the TM6-7 and TM7-2 interfaces.</title><p>Panels show overlay of the apelin receptor NxStaR crystal structure (rainbow colours) in complex with CMF-019 (magenta) with the previously reported AMG3054 (blue) bound crystal structure (left), the higher resolution cryoEM ELA (dark teal) G protein bound monomeric complex (7W0P, middle), and the apelin (brown) bound apelin receptor complex (right).

Additionally, as mentioned above, the R168<sup>4.64</sup> side chain showed different positions and conformations, with some positioning the guanidinium group of R168<sup>4.64</sup> closer to peptide C-termini, so that it interacted with backbone oxygens. In the recent apelin cryoEM structure, such an interaction is only observed with the peptide S6 sidechain. Of interest, the R168<sup>4.64</sup> residue only formed a minor direct interaction with the core of CMF-019, engaging mostly indirectly via a salt bridge with the oleic acid molecule that was observed to protrude into the binding site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">In summary, our comparisons showed that CMF-019 binding sites overlap in part with that of the C-terminal residues of the endogenous peptides, but the small molecules reach deeper down the orthosteric pocket to bind into lipophilic sub-pockets at the interfaces between TM6, TM7, TM1, TM2, and TM3.

Our models reveal further that the T/M89<sup>2.64</sup> variant would greatly narrow the interface between TM7 and TM2, creating a steric clash with ELA, particularly at F13 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), but less so with apelin, which presents a less bulky proline at this interface, explaining the differentiated effect of the T/M89<sup>2.64</sup> variant on ELA and apelin binding.</p><p id="Par45">Additionally, our models show agreement with the previous peptide structures (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) that R168<sup>4.64</sup> can interact extensively with the peptide backbone. In fact, R168<sup>4.64</sup> is known to be key for endogenous peptide binding, as the artificial R/A168<sup>4.64</sup> substitution has been shown to abolish peptide binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This may be common across other GPCRs, where, for example, an artificial substitution at this amino acid position (R/C167<sup>4.64</sup>) abolished binding of endogenous peptide at the angiotensin II type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Strikingly, we observe here a complete loss of peptide binding, even for a conservative arginine to histidine replacement, further emphasising the importance of hydrogen-bonding interactions formed by the guanidinium group of R168<sup>4.64</sup> with the peptide backbone. Moreover, this binding mode involving the peptide backbone also explains why the loss of binding is not sequence-specific, thus affecting both apelin and ELA at the R/H168<sup>4.64</sup> variant. This AlphaFold2 modelling complements previous experimental structures to predict the detrimental impact of the variants on endogenous peptide binding, consistent with our in vitro data showing notably reduced binding of ELA only at the T/M89<sup>2.64</sup> variant, and of both peptides at the R/H168<sup>4.64</sup> variant.</p><p id="Par46">The crystal structure of the apelin NxStaR in complex with CMF-019 presented here, in agreement with the recent CMF-019 cryoEM structure, expands our understanding of binding modes of small synthetic agonists and emphasizes strongly differentiated binding modes between peptides and drug-like agonists. Despite their different chemotypes, CMF-019 and cmpd644 share overlapping binding sites, as well as binding modes involving mostly hydrophobic contacts. Not unexpectedly, this synthetic agonist binding site overlapped with that of hydrophobic and C-terminal residues of apelin and ELA, suggesting that, within the large orthosteric site of this peptidergic receptor, this location is an important site for agonist peptides, as supported by our SPR data using truncated apelin peptides (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). However, small synthetic agonists likely compensate for their small size compared to peptides by reaching even deeper to bind to lipophilic sub-pockets at interfaces between transmembrane helices, such as TM6 and TM7, for which conformational changes are typically associated with GPCR activation.</p><p id="Par47">Another key difference with peptides is the different side chain conformation of Y299<sup>7.43</sup>, which has been linked to bias. Here, we observed CMF-019 stabilising a rotamer of Y299<sup>7.43</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) that is distinct from the rotamer observed in the peptide complex structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The Y299<sup>7.43</sup> residue is conserved among other class A GPCRs, where it plays an important role as a &#x02018;bias switch&#x02019;. For instance, ligand-induced conformational changes in the corresponding Y291<sup>7.43</sup> residue in the chemokine receptor CCR1 allosterically regulate &#x003b2;-arrestin activation to drive signalling bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Additionally, mutagenesis in the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor has previously demonstrated an impairment of a Y/F292<sup>7.43</sup> mutant to recruit &#x003b2;-arrestin in response to a benchmark &#x003b2;-arrestin-biased ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, binding in this sub-pocket III at the interface between TM6 and TM7 may contribute to G protein-bias in the apelin receptor, and warrants further investigation in order to inform the design of biased drugs that might offer better therapeutic outcomes.</p><p id="Par48">Next, we aimed to pharmacologically characterise the R/H168<sup>4.64</sup> variant in a more relevant setting in human cells by using CRISPR base editing to introduce the variant into a hESC-CM model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Whilst the R/H168<sup>4.64</sup> variant was expressed similarly to the wild-type receptor, its engagement with ligands was significantly reduced, consistent with our data in CHO-K1 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Furthermore, the R/H168<sup>4.64</sup> variant induced a perturbed phenotype in the hESC-CMs. Differentiation efficiency was significantly reduced. However, time-to-peak voltage in cells that were visibly contracting and therefore differentiated, was prolonged compared to wild-type, closely phenocopying a previously reported inducible apelin receptor knockdown system in the same cell model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

This is consistent with the hypothesis for a role for apelin receptor signalling in modulating cardiomyocyte sodium currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The data highlight the potential of using genetic editing to generate &#x02018;disease-in-a-dish&#x02019; models for the apelin receptor.</p><p id="Par49">Finally, one of our key observations was that the R168<sup>4.64</sup> residue is not a key contributor to the binding of CMF-019 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), in agreement with the previous active cryoEM structure with cmpd644, and our SPR data further confirmed that the R/H168<sup>4.64</sup> variant retains nanomolar binding affinity for small synthetic agonists (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). It is interesting to consider that small synthetic ligands might be able to bind and exert agonist activity in individuals harbouring variants that reduce or even abolish endogenous ligand binding, potentially providing a personalised medicine strategy to rescue disease phenotypes in these patients.</p><p id="Par50">GPCRs form the largest class of therapeutic drug target for currently approved medicines.
