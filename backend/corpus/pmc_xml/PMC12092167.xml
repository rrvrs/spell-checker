Social media, the most popular of these methods, commonly described as web-based technologies or software applications, allows for connection, communication and shared multimedia-based content through online communication channels.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>From a technological standpoint, social media allows users to create new profiles, make friends, create content and create pages and groups while remaining behind the keyboard. They do not need to engage in face-to-face communication.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Indeed, people who are dissatisfied with their physical characteristics, such as height and weight, or who suffer from voice disorders, have stated in previous studies that they feel more comfortable, confident and &#x02018;normal&#x02019; when communicating online.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It is also known that people with hearing loss have a similar tendency.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Even though the prevalence of hearing loss increases with age, it remains one of childhood's most important and frequently encountered problems.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It is thought that globally 34 million children have hearing problems, affecting their quality of life.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Generally, the effectiveness of interventions such as hearing aids and cochlear implants may change depending on the type and degree of hearing loss, the choice of intervention and the accuracy of the fitting strategies. While some interventions can help children to achieve the communication and academic skills of their peers with normal hearing, in some cases children do not use their devices effectively or hearing close to normal hearing cannot be achieved. Aside from these issues, the appearance of devices can cause embarrassment, depression, exclusion and social isolation in the individual.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Hearing-impaired people can use the internet for various purposes, including communication, learning, teaching, education and participation in online psychotherapy support groups and sign language communication. They can socialise on platforms including email, forums and social media just like people with normal hearing, without specifying their health conditions.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This is an important area of research because internet and social media use has become increasingly prevalent among adolescents, and it is important to understand how hearing loss may impact their use and behaviours online. This study aimed to provide valuable insights into potential differences or challenges that may arise by comparing the internet and social media use of adolescents with hearing loss to their peers with normal hearing.</p><p>This research aims to address the inconsistencies in existing literature regarding social media usage patterns among individuals with hearing loss compared with those with normal hearing. While some studies suggest similarities in social media involvement between deaf and hard of hearing people and their hearing counterparts,<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> one study demonstrated differences impacted by the presence of deafness or degree of hearing loss.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In light of these differences, our study aimed to compare the internet and social media use of adolescents with implants and hearing aids, as well as those who do not rely on sign language, to that of their normally hearing peers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The Ethics Committee of Hacettepe University approved this study (GO 21/158).

Individuals with normal hearing who met the inclusion criteria were found among those who applied to the audiology clinic for various reasons (hoarseness, dizziness, etc.) for the control group. The study was explained to all participants and materials were sent to them via email between March and September 2021.

The subdimension of social competence (six positive items) includes questions about the desire to express oneself, to be noticed and to gain prestige. The subdimension of the need for sharing (eight positive items) refers to sharing on social media sites, being aware of the shares and evaluating the claims. The subdimension of relationships with teachers (three positive items) assesses communication with teachers on social media and satisfaction. Finally, the social isolation subdimension (six negative items) addresses social media's impact on isolating individuals from their surroundings and diminishing their focus on lessons (reverse coding).</p><p>A high score indicates that students who answered the questions have positive attitudes toward social media. The scale's lowest score is 23 and its highest is 115.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2-3-2"><title>Purposes of internet use</title><p>Akar developed the Internet Use Purposes Scale to assess adolescents&#x02019; internet usage motivations, encompassing communication, entertainment and information-seeking purposes.

The overall Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient is 0.86.</p><p>Within the education subdimension, questions pertain to activities such as homework and researching unfamiliar course topics. The entertainment sub-dimension addresses activities such as watching movies and serials, and playing video games. The psychological needs subdimension includes questions about alleviating loneliness and making new friends. The socialisation subdimension questions cover activities such as talking with friends and watching videos on video-sharing sites. Lastly, the information access subdimension encompasses activities such as staying updated on the news and learning new technologies.</p><p>The students were questioned about their agreement with the internet use purposes listed in the scale subdimensions. The scale responses range from 1 to 5, with 1 being &#x02018;I strongly disagree&#x02019; and 5 being &#x02018;I strongly agree.&#x02019; A high score indicates that the internet usage purpose in the subdimension is strong.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2-3-3"><title>Problematic internet usage</title><p>Ceyhan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. created the Problematic Internet Use Scale, for which the alpha value was calculated as 0.93.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The Problematic Internet Use Scale is a validated scale that measures different facets of individuals&#x02019; internet usage behaviour and the corresponding psychological implications, including potential negative consequences, social benefits and excessive use tendencies.</p><p>Problematic Internet Use Scale includes 33 items and 3 subcategories. The negative consequences of internet use subscale evaluates the adverse outcomes and potential drawbacks arising from individuals&#x02019; internet use. It assesses behaviours and attitudes related to online interactions and their impact on individuals&#x02019; offline lives. The social benefit and/or social comfort subscale focuses on gauging the extent to which individuals turn to the internet for comfort and social support, particularly during times of emotional distress or when faced with personal problems. Finally, the excessive use subscale seeks to identify instances of internet overuse and their potential consequences on individuals&#x02019; daily lives. It examines respondents&#x02019; perceptions of disparities between their online and offline lives.</p><p>The scoring range for the scale is between 33 and 165, with higher scores indicative of potentially unhealthy internet usage, associated with adverse effects on one's life and an increased susceptibility to internet addiction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2-3-4"><title>Loneliness status</title><p>The University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale is a validated instrument designed to measure feelings of social isolation and disconnection.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The Turkish version of the scale, which underwent validity and reliability assessments conducted by Demir, was employed in this study.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Its internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was found to be 0.96. The scale comprises 20 items, each describing situations reflecting thoughts and feelings concerning social relations. Respondents use a 4-point scale (1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;never, 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;often) to report the frequency of their experiences with these situations. The scale consists of 10 positive items indicating the absence of semantic loneliness and 10 negative items suggesting the presence of semantic loneliness. The scale yields a maximum score of 80 and a minimum score of 20. A high score is regarded as indicating that loneliness is felt more intensely.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The SPSS statistics 25.00 analysis program (IBM SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical evaluation.

An independent samples <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test was used for between-group comparisons. Categorical variables were compared between groups using a chi-square test. Finally, the Pearson test was used to examine the relationship between the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale and the other questionnaires.</p><p>The statistical program G* Power 3.1 (Universitat Dusseldorf, Germany) was used to calculate the sample size.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> When the literature was examined, it was found that a significant difference between the internet usage habits of children with hearing loss and hearing peers has been reported, with an effect size of 1.0 (Cohen's <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>).<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> It was therefore predicted that a similar level of difference would be detected between the problematic internet usage habits of the case and control groups in our study.

The second significant finding was that teenagers with hearing impairment use the internet for entertainment, socialisation and psychological well-being, similar to their peers with normal hearing. However, research has also shown that adolescents with hearing loss have a higher risk of developing problematic internet usage and experiencing negative consequences. At the same time, those who feel more isolated tend to use the internet for socialising purposes.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-1"><title>Social media attitude</title><p>Social engagement is a motivating strategy encouraging teenagers to actively use the internet.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> When we examined the teenagers&#x02019; attitudes toward social media, we found no significant differences between adolescents with normal hearing and those with hearing loss in terms of social competence, relationships with teachers and the need for sharing attitudes towards social media. Nevertheless, our study results indicate that adolescents with normal hearing experience less social isolation than their hearing-impaired peers, as reflected in their Social Media Attitude Scale scores. This result is consistent with the findings of Patel <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., who conducted a systematic review demonstrating that hearing impairment is associated with a higher prevalence of social isolation and loneliness.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-2"><title>Purpose of internet use</title><p>The internet has evolved into a versatile platform for those who are deaf or have hearing loss, providing a variety of opportunities ranging from educational opportunities to online support groups and sign language-based communication. While the internet has many benefits, it also has limitations, most notably the potential of encountering misinformation, which is a concern for this generation.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>The balance between educational and social pursuits is an important consideration in the context of internet usage among people with hearing loss. Disruptions in this balance can have a major influence on academic achievement and learning behavior.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Our findings support this hypothesis, demonstrating that teenagers with hearing loss utilise the internet for entertainment, socialising, to access information and for psychological well-being at levels comparable to their peers. However, there is a distinct difference in educational internet use, with children with normal hearing making greater use of online resources for educational purposes. The difference may be linked to children with normal hearing having greater access to auditory information, which helps in their comprehension of online auditory resources.</p><p>The restricted use of the internet for educational reasons among people with hearing loss is an interesting finding in our study. The problem may be attributed in part to the absence of elements such as subtitles created specifically for this group in educational resources, a gap that remains in Turkey.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Individuals with hearing loss can benefit greatly from the inclusion of online educational materials with captions or sign language interpretation, which can dramatically improve understanding of complicated topics and facilitate content consumption. In support of this notion, Kruger and Steyn highlighted the positive association between reading subtitles and academic achievement, implying that subtitles could give advantages in an academic setting.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, Chan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.'s study emphasises the importance of the language used in subtitles, demonstrating that learners who read subtitles in their first language can improve their academic performance.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> As a result, providing accessible educational resources, such as subtitles and sign language interpretation, can be critical in fostering academic inclusion for those with hearing impairment.</p><p>With differences in internet usage purpose, people with hearing loss have a stronger tendency for personal and group contact online than their peers with normal hearing.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Importantly, our study found no significant differences in daily internet usage time and frequency of internet use per week between the hearing loss group and their peers with normal hearing. These findings are consistent with recent research by Thor&#x000e9;n <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., who found that individuals with hearing loss and their age-matched counterparts with normal hearing use computers and the internet at comparable rates.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> This consistency in findings highlights the potential of technology as an effective tool for bridging the knowledge and communication gap between those with hearing loss and the general population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-3"><title>Problematic internet usage</title><p>The increase in internet use and the advancement of digital communication platforms have resulted in problematic internet use, which is characterised by individuals&#x02019; inability to control their online activities, causing distress and interfering with daily functioning.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Wu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. conducted a study investigating the prevalence of internet addiction and its association with social support and other related factors among adolescents in China. The findings revealed that the prevalence of internet addiction among adolescents was 10.40 per cent, with boys exhibiting a higher susceptibility than girls. Several significant factors were identified as contributors to internet addiction, including poor self-control, low self-esteem, feelings of loneliness, a lack of parental care and the pressures of academic demands. Additionally, the study emphasised the protective impact of social support, emphasising its ability to reduce the risk of internet addiction.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Michalczyk's study extended the investigation of problematic internet use to those with hearing loss, revealing a higher tendency for problematic internet use, a pervasive sense of loneliness and negative emotional experiences among the participants.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>In line with previous research, our study found that adolescents with hearing loss had higher levels of excessive internet use, negative consequences and total Problematic Internet Use Scale score than their counterparts with normal hearing. Notably, there was no significant difference between the two groups on the social benefit or comfort subscale. Excessive internet use resulted in increased social isolation and negative consequences, emphasising the significance of promoting balanced and appropriate internet and social media use among teenagers. This highlights the importance of advice and support, especially for children with hearing impairments, in ensuring healthy and productive involvement with digital platforms.</p><p>Our findings emphasise hearing-impaired adolescents&#x02019; risk of problematic internet use, emphasising the importance of designing educational and intervention programmes specific to this community. Adolescents with hearing loss who are struggling with internet addiction need the support and encouragement of their parents, teachers and classmates. A previous study showed that social support is a protective factor against problematic internet use.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Further research in this area is required to clarify the complex aspects that contribute to problematic internet use, particularly among adolescents with hearing loss.

This finding contrasts with the findings of Majorano <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., who found that teenagers with cochlear implants experienced higher degrees of loneliness than their hearing peers.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> A scoping study of social isolation and loneliness among hearing-impaired children and adolescents also showed a possible relationship between hearing loss and social isolation, with negative consequences for overall well-being.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Conversely, Adigun <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. presented a different perspective, demonstrating no significant relationship between social media use and loneliness in hearing-impaired students.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> On a similar subject, Barak and Sadovsky reported surprising findings demonstrating that deaf participants with reduced internet use had higher feelings of loneliness and poorer self-esteem than their hearing counterparts. Those who used the internet more frequently, on the other hand, had higher overall well-being.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Our study found that there was a negative relationship between the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale and the social benefit and/or social comfort subscale and the total score of the Problematic Internet Use Scale. This shows that the individual's tendency for internet addiction was connected to lower feelings of loneliness. Furthermore, people who used the internet to get comfort and social support had decreased levels of loneliness. In addition, there was a moderate and positive correlation between the socialisation subdimension of the Internet Use Purposes Scale and the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale loneliness score. This suggests that the internet and social media can be important tools for social connection and communication for children, including those with hearing impairment.</p><p>Individuals who experience higher levels of loneliness tended to use the internet more frequently for socialising purposes, such as chatting with friends and watching videos on video-sharing websites. Based on this data, we can conclude that internet use among our participants reduced feelings of loneliness. However, it is important to note that while the internet may temporarily relieve loneliness, excessive internet use can worsen feelings of isolation and lead to negative consequences, such as social withdrawal and reduced face-to-face interactions.

However, the study also has several limitations. The major limitation is only using the questionnaires and performing them via the online platform. In addition, our analysis was limited to the data documented in patient self-reported information. Another limitation of the study is the absence of consideration of the age at which hearing loss began and the duration of the hearing loss. Future research should concentrate determining the age at which hearing loss begins.

We found that children with normal hearing have more access to educational resources online, while those with hearing loss may face limitations. Additionally, our research emphasises the dangers of problematic internet use among hearing-impaired adolescents, underlining the significance of educational activities and social assistance. Furthermore, while internet use can help to reduce loneliness among all participants, excessive use can have negative consequences. Exploring alternative ways for adolescents with hearing loss to build social connections and address feelings of loneliness is therefore important.</p><p>Our findings have implications for educators and mental health professionals working with adolescents with hearing impairment and suggest a more inclusive educational and social media resource design.
