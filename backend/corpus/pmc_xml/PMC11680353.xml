Limited information is available regarding T cell responses to BA.2.86 and JN.1 variants, particularly in elderly individuals. Methods: We evaluated T cell and total IgG responses against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as BA.2.86 and JN.1 omicron subvariants, in two groups of subjects. One group consisted of SARS-CoV-2-exposed elderly individuals who were fully vaccinated with the BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine, with a booster dose of the updated 2023&#x02013;2024 COVID-19 vaccine (XBB.1.5) at least 15 days after receiving a booster dose of the updated 2023&#x02013;2024 COVID-19 vaccine. The second group consisted of healthcare workers who were unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 one month after the booster dose of the first-generation BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. T cell activation-induced markers (AIM) and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion were evaluated by flow cytometry and ELISpot assays, respectively. Results: Elderly subjects showed reduced IgG levels against JN.1 compared with the ancestral strain. BA.2.86 stimulation resulted in lower IFN-&#x003b3; levels in the elderly versus the COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve group. AIM analysis showed that among T cells, CD4+ were the most responsive, with a reduced proportion of JN.1-reactive CD4+ T cells compared with the ancestral strain in the SARS-CoV-2-unexposed group. Despite receiving the updated booster, the elderly group showed reduced CD4+ T cell reactivity to BA.2.86. Conclusions: The XBB.1.5-containing vaccine induced lower CD4+ T cell responses against BA.2.86 in the elderly. CD4+ T cells from BNT16b2-vaccinated, COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve subjects recognized ancestral and BA.2.86 RBD strains while showing reduced responses to JN.1. These results emphasize the need for tailored vaccine strategies for emerging variants, particularly in vulnerable populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>BA.2.86</kwd><kwd>JN.1</kwd><kwd>elderly</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>EU funding</funding-source><award-id>PE00000007</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by EU funding within the Next Generation EU-MUR PNRR Extended Partnership initiative on Emerging Infectious Diseases, project no.

Introduction</title><p>mRNA vaccines have revolutionized the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, saving millions of lives. The first vaccines were developed less than one year after the onset of the first pandemic wave, demonstrating an unprecedented speed of development. The virus seems to have hit a dead end with the omicron variant, acquiring less aggressive features and by and large limiting the extension to the upper respiratory tract. However, omicron subvariants are continuously emerging, posing challenges to vaccine efficacy. Indeed, different studies have shown that primary vaccinations and initial boosters exhibit reduced efficacy against Omicron and its subvariants [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The updated 2023 vaccine targeting the XBB.1.5 variant also showed decreased efficacy against newer variants that emerged later in 2023, including EG.5, XBB.1.16, BA.2.86, and JN.1 [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This highlights the ongoing struggle between the emergence of new variants and the effectiveness of vaccines and further emphasizes the concept that COVID-19 vaccines are unable to provide sterilizing immunity. Mutations may affect the virus&#x02019;s ability to infect cells, to propagate the infection, and to evade the host&#x02019;s immune responses. Indeed, it has been shown that Omicron variants increase innate immune evasion by increasing viral protein expression [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several SARS-CoV-2 variants caused significant outbreaks of infection since the emergence of the ancestral wild-type strain, SARS-CoV-2, in late 2019 (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In August 2023, the BA.2.86 subvariant emerged in Denmark and Israel and rapidly spread in several countries [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Compared to the XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant, BA.2.86 carries 35 mutations within the spike protein [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], including 10 within the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and shows increased receptor affinity and enhanced lung cell infectivity [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite these advantages, BA.2.86 did not become prevalent, possibly due to its relatively lower immune evasion compared to the XBB.1.5 strain [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During the following months, the BA.2.86 descendant JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), characterized by a solitary additional mutation in the S protein, L455S, emerged as the predominant lineage [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. L455S is located in the RBD, in a key place for viral binding to its ligand, ACE2. Surprisingly, although JN.1 showed increased infectivity, its binding affinity for ACE2 was reduced compared to BA.2.86 [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>However, some reports indicated that, despite its reduced capacity to bind the receptor, the L455S mutation conferred increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), enhancing the virus&#x02019;s ability to evade immune responses [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Given the continuous emergence of viral variants, vaccines have been updated over time to target new variants. The last vaccine, targeting the XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant, was introduced in September 2023. However, COVID-19 vaccine coverage in 2023&#x02013;2024 was notably lower than during the initial campaign. The recent ECDC report on COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the European Union between 1 September 2023 and 15 April 2024 shows a median coverage of only 12.0% among people aged &#x0003e; 60 years and 17.1% for people aged &#x0003e; 80 years, with high variation among countries [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, responsiveness to vaccines may be reduced in elderly individuals, resulting in a lower level of protection compared to younger individuals [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Understanding the immune response in elderly individuals is crucial for developing targeted interventions and vaccine strategies to protect this vulnerable population from COVID-19. Although different studies have demonstrated neutralizing activity against BA.2.86 and JN.1 following XBB vaccination [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], limited information is available regarding T cell responses to these variants [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], particularly in elderly individuals. In this study, we assessed T cell responses to RBD proteins from the ancestral wild-type, BA.2.86, and JN.1 in a group of fully vaccinated elderly subjects (&#x02265;three doses of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), who received one booster dose of the updated 2023&#x02013;2024 COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) targeting the XBB.1.5 Omicron variant. This group includes multiply exposed subjects, reflecting the current situation of hybrid SARS-CoV-2 natural and vaccine-induced immunity in a frail population. Simultaneously, we evaluated T cell responses in a group of healthy adults, SARS-CoV-2-unexposed healthcare workers who were vaccinated during the initial 2021 campaign, one month after the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. This group of COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve individuals represents an interesting control group of healthy subjects with no hybrid immunity to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01451"><title>2.

The first 15 vaccinated healthcare workers who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG and who gave consent to participate in this study were consecutively enrolled.

Anti-RBD IgG Antibodies</title><p>Compared with BA.2.86, the JN.1 spike protein is characterized by a solitary additional mutation, L455S, located in the RBD. This mutation provides JN.1 with enhanced infectivity, retaining the immune-evasive mutations of BA.2.86. This prompted us to assess the impact of this mutation on T and B cell responses to the RBD in the two groups. To assess the development of RBD-specific IgG antibodies to BA.2.86 and JN.1 variants following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we used a qualitative ELISA assay. Serum samples from the two groups of subjects were incubated in wells coated with RBD proteins of the ancestral wild-type, BA.2.86, or JN.1 variants. Comparable IgG reactivities were found in the elderly group for the wild-type strain and the BA.2.86 subvariant, while JN.1 subvariant-specific IgG reactivities were lower compared with the wild-type (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01451-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A).

Discussion</title><p>The immune system tends to weaken with aging, leading to a reduced ability to mount a robust immune response to pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, responsiveness to vaccines may be reduced in elderly individuals, resulting in a lower level of protection compared with younger individuals [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, we assessed T cell responses to the RBD of ancestral and current Omicron subvariants in a group of elderly subjects who recently received a booster dose containing mRNA encoding for the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant. These subjects represent the frail group who developed hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and vaccination. Simultaneously, we also evaluated T cell responses in a group of healthy adults, previously unexposed to SARS-CoV-2, who received two doses of the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine during the initial 2021 campaign. Serological analysis revealed that the levels of anti-RBD antibodies in the elderly subject group were equivalent for all three tested variants, indicating a broadly uniform B-cell immune response against each variant. However, despite being vaccinated with the most recent omicron XBB.1.5 mRNA-containing vaccine, elderly subjects did not show increased frequencies of reactive T cells to current variants. Specifically, IFN-&#x003b3; secretion and AIM SI by CD4+ T cells following BA.2.86 stimulation were reduced in these subjects compared with the COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve group.</p><p>Interestingly, an epidemiological study showed reduced XBB.1.5 vaccine-induced immune protection in subjects aged 65 or older infected with BA.2.86 or JN.1 strains. However, the relative risk of hospitalization was not increased compared with other variants [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These data should be interpreted with caution in view of the high prevalence of the less aggressive Omicron subvariants in the general population.</p><p>The COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve group showed robust CD4+ T cell responses against the BA.2.86 RBD strain. This is in line with a study showing that T cells from subjects with an unknown history of infection or vaccination were able to recognize the BA.2.86 variant [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Accordingly, a study from another group observed sustained CD4+ and CD8+ spike-specific T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including BA.2.86, in vaccinated healthcare workers. However, unlike our study, the healthcare workers had experienced at least one prior SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study compared adaptive immune responses to circulating variants (XBB.1.5, EG.5, and BA.2.86) versus previous variants (ancestral, Delta, and BA.5) in subjects with a hybrid SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection history. The study showed consistent CD4+ T cell responses across all variants, but a significant reduction in antibody titers, neutralizing antibody levels, and CD8+ T cell responses against circulating variants compared with previous ones [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, our study found that serum anti-RBD IgG from the COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve group showed a reduced ability to recognize BA.2.86 RBD, despite being able to recognize the JN.1 subvariant.</p><p>Interestingly, it has been shown that repeated COVID-19 mRNA vaccination causes an increased level of IgG4 spike-specific antibodies, which is associated with the reduced capacity of these antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and complement deposition [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and with reduced Ab-mediated natural killer cell activation in older adults [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, these findings suggest that IgG4 spike-specific antibodies may play a mechanistic role in dampening the immune response to vaccines in elderly subjects.</p><p>Few studies have analyzed T cell responses to the JN.1 subvariant. According to recent findings, T cells from vaccinated individuals are predicted to recognize multiple epitopes on the spike protein of BA.2.86 and JN.1, suggesting that widespread loss of T cell recognition is unlikely [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, we observed reduced CD4+ T cell responses against the JN.1 subvariant compared with the ancestral strain, specifically in the COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve group. Notably, when we assessed immune responses using ELISpot assays, no differences were observed in IFN-&#x003b3; secretion from PBMCs stimulated with ancestral and JN.1 variants in the COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve group, suggesting that other cells may contribute to IFN-&#x003b3; production, such as natural killer (NK) cells. Indeed, we and others have shown that NK cells exhibit higher effector function upon restimulation with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or peptides in BNT162b2-vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Although there were no differences in reactivity between wild-type and JN.1 CD4+ T cells in elderly subjects, it is important to note that only low frequencies of reactive CD4+ T cells were induced by ancestral RBD stimulation in this group. This suggests the existence of broadly reduced immune responses, highlighting the impact of age-related immune senescence. The reduced reactive CD4+ T cell response is indeed clinically relevant because the efficacy of a vaccine depends on the breadth and strength of T cell responses. A reduction in CD4+ T cells has been associated with lower vaccine efficacy, particularly in elderly subjects [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Studies have also shown that higher proportions of virus-specific CD4+ T cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are associated with milder COVID-19 symptoms [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as well as a slower decline in humoral immunity [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, strong CD4+ T cell responses have been associated with better clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, while reduced levels of CD4+ T cells correlated with higher rates of breakthrough infections or more severe disease [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Another important factor that can explain the lower immune response in the elderly is that mRNA vaccines targeting only one single protein may not provide sufficient protection for older individuals. This is because reliance on a single protein may not account for variants that evade other immune mechanisms, especially against emerging variants or in populations with weaker immune responses. New vaccines using bioengineered attenuated viruses carrying multiple antigens are now under study and may offer stronger immune protection for older adults.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is small. This was due to the need to specifically evaluate the contribution of the ancestral vaccine to the recognition of current variants, which required a population of COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve individuals. Second, a control group of younger individuals vaccinated with the XBB.1.5 mRNA-containing vaccine is missing. However, this was due to the fact that in Italy, the XBB.1.5 vaccine campaign was not mandatory, and was primarily recommended for individuals aged 65 and older. As a result, COVID-19 vaccine coverage during 2023&#x02013;2024 was significantly lower than during the initial vaccine rollout. Additionally, vaccination campaigns for younger subjects are no longer managed by hospital clinics but rather by pharmacies and general doctors, which made recruitment more challenging. Consequently, in the European Union, the median COVID-19 vaccine coverage during 2023&#x02013;2024 was only 12.0% among people aged over 60 years and 17.1% among people aged over 80 years, with considerable variation among countries [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01451" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Italy, at the time of this study, even among patients &#x0003e; 60 years of age, the median vaccination coverage of the XBB vaccine was lower than in the average European population (&#x0003c;10%). This indicates that many individuals remain unprotected from current variants, highlighting the importance of evaluating the ability of the immune system to recognize new variants based on previous vaccines. Despite not being the ideal control group, we think that a group of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals represents a referral group to assess immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-na&#x000ef;ve vaccinated persons.</p><p>Another limitation is that we did not use overlapping peptides from JN.1, since they were not commercially available at the time of this study. However, whole proteins provide a broader assessment of T cell responses, mimicking natural antigen processing and presentation. This approach captures a wider array of T cell responses, enhancing the understanding of how vaccines or infections elicit hybrid immunity. While overlapping peptides offer precise epitope mapping, whole proteins ensure a comprehensive and natural evaluation of T cell activation, being particularly useful in studies aiming to understand the overall efficacy of vaccines and immune responses to pathogens.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows reduced T cell responses to the BA.2.86 variant in elderly individuals, despite vaccination. These results mirror the age-related decline in immune function. The robust T cell responses in the COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve group to the BA.2.86 variant, comparable to those shown against the ancestral strain, support the idea that initial and booster vaccinations can induce broad and effective T cell-mediated immunity in younger, healthier populations.</p><p>CD4+ T cell responses against the JN.1 subvariant were reduced compared with the ancestral strain in COVID-19-na&#x000ef;ve individuals. In elderly subjects, reactive CD4+ T cell frequencies were low even with ancestral RBD stimulation, suggesting a generally diminished immune response due to age-related immune senescence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to all subjects who participated in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
