We found lactylation-related genes (<italic>PFKM</italic>, <italic>TXN</italic>, <italic>AKR1A1</italic>, <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>MDH1</italic>, <italic>GPI</italic>, <italic>GOT2</italic>, and <italic>COX4I1</italic>) that play a role in the occurrence and development of EC and constructed a lactylation score model. The lactylation score has a strong correlation with the clinicopathological features, immune cell infiltration, and genetic instability of EC based on the data in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Our research showed that PFKM (phosphofructokinase, muscle) underwent lactylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, which promoted colony formation, invasion of Ishikawa cells, and angiogenesis of HUVEC cells. Our findings provide new molecular prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for EC, thereby contributing to the identification of potentially effective drugs for EC.</p><p id="p0015">We identified 26 lactylation-related pathways from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) database, among which six GSEA results showed up-regulation in EC tissue (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>). Then, we identified eight prognostic lactylation-related genes and plotted a forest map (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref>). In addition, we plotted a copy number variant dumbbell diagram of single gene mutation frequency for the eight lactylation-related genes. The frequency of acquired copy number changes in <italic>AKR1A1</italic> (Aldo-Keto reductase family 1 member A1), <italic>GPI</italic> (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), and <italic>MECP2</italic> (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) genes was lower than that of loss in the population of endometrial cancer patients (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1C</xref>). We constructed a waterfall plot (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1D</xref>) of the single-gene mutation frequency for the eight lactylation-related genes. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis for the overall survival of lactylation-related genes revealed statistically significant differences in the survival curves, except for <italic>COX4I1</italic> (cytochrome C oxidase subunit 4I1) (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1E</xref>). We constructed a prognostic network graph (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1F</xref>), which showed that <italic>PFKM</italic>, as a risk factor, positively correlated with other <italic>MECP2</italic> and <italic>MDH1</italic> (malate dehydrogenase 1) risk factors and significantly negatively correlated with the three favorable factors.</p><p id="p0020">Cluster analysis of lactylation-related genes was used to divide all uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) samples into two clusters (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2A</xref>). Survival analysis showed significant differences between the two groups, with cluster 2 having a lower survival rate than cluster 1 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2B</xref>). We used single sample gene set enrichment analysis to determine the proportions of the 28 different immune cell types in the two EC clusters, which showed that cluster 1 had a higher overall immune cell type than cluster 2 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2C</xref>). The clinicopathological features heatmap showed that <italic>PFKM</italic> and <italic>MECP2</italic> were highly expressed in the cluster 2 group (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2D</xref>). Using the GSVA algorithm, the results showed that the pathways in cluster 1 were mainly focused on the exogenous metabolism pathway (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2E</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">We performed <italic>t</italic>-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding dimensionality reduction on the eight lactylation-related genes and extracted their main features (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3A</xref>). The lactylation score of cluster 2 was considerably higher than that of cluster 1 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3B</xref>). The high-expression lactylation score group had a poor prognosis and survival (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3C</xref>). Additionally, tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis revealed a negative correlation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3D</xref>) between the two groups of patients. The results showed that the high-expression lactylation score group had a lower TMB. Additionally, lactylation score and TMB showed a significant negative correlation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3E</xref>). Here, we further classified the lactylation score group according to the level of TMB, and the results showed that patients with higher lactylation scores and lower TMB had worse prognosis survival (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3F&#x02013;H</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">We predicted patient survival by constructing a column chart to statistically score the clinicopathological features and lactate levels, and the results showed that poor prognosis, advanced tumor age, stage, and grade, and lymph node metastases were closely related to a high lactylation score (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4A&#x02013;C</xref>). We estimated the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the predictive model for the four chemotherapy drugs in the TCGA dataset. Doxorubicin and cyclopamine showed higher sensitivity in the low-lactylation score group, whereas cisplatin and paclitaxel showed higher sensitivity in the high-lactylation score group (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4D</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">According to the ESTIMA-TE algorithm, the high-lactylation group exhibited lower matrix and immune scores than the low-lactylation group, indicating higher interstitial and immune cell infiltration in the low-lactylation group (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S5A</xref>). Analysis of the correlation between lactylation scores and immune cell infiltration revealed a negative correlation with CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S5B, C</xref>). We also studied the lactylation score and microsatellite instability, with the MicroSatellite Instability-High and MicroSatellite Stability groups having the lowest and highest lactylation scores, respectively (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S5D</xref>). From the TIDE database, high levels of ips_ctla4_pos_pd1_pos indicate a response to both anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4) and anti-PD-1 (programmed death-1) therapy. We integrated the four immunophenotypic scores with the lactylation score group, and as shown by <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S5E</xref>, patients with low lactylation scores may be more sensitive to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibody therapy (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).</p><p id="p0040">High expression of <italic>PFKM</italic>, <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>MDH1</italic>, and <italic>GPI</italic> in EC tissue was associated with poor prognosis (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1E</xref>). We conducted quantitative reverse transcription PCR to determine the expression of <italic>PFKM</italic>, <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>MDH1</italic>, and <italic>GPI</italic> in 19 normal endometrial tissues and 36&#x000a0;EC tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). The results revealed significant overexpression of <italic>PFKM</italic>, <italic>MECP2</italic>, and <italic>GPI</italic> in EC tissues. To further investigate lactylation modification in PFKM, we performed liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify the lactylated tyrosine K-678 site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B). PyMOL was used to visualize the PFKM and ATP complexes before and after lactate modification and these sites and the lactylation-modified sites on PFKM in the spatial structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C). The PFKM levels were assessed in 20 normal endometrial and 30&#x000a0;EC tissues using immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the positive expression rate of PFKM expression was significantly higher in the EC group (70.0% [21/30]) than in the normal control group (40.0% [8/20]; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). High PFKM expression levels may be positively correlated with poor patient prognosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E). We investigated the carcinogenic effects of PFKM lactylation in EC. Wild-type and mutant PFKM (K678R) plasmids were constructed for transfecting Ishikawa cells. Differences in glucose uptake and lactylation production between the wild-type and mutant PFKM (K678R) plasmids were determined using the <italic>in vitro</italic> glucose oxidase-peroxidase and lactate-oxidase methods, respectively. The results showed that after mutant PFKM (K678R) treatment, glucose uptake and lactate production in the cell line decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>F, G). Moreover, western blot results showed reduced pan-Kla expression in the PFKM (K678R) group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>H). Transfection of Ishikawa cells with mutant PFKM (K678R) plasmids significantly reduced proliferation, clonogenesis, and invasiveness of the EC cell line and reduced angiogenesis of HUVEC cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>I&#x02013;L). Finally, we explored potential therapeutic drugs targeting PFKM using virtual screening. After docking, the data were scored based on energy (binding energy &#x0003c; &#x02212;6&#x000a0;kcal/mol), and 1260 high-ranking compounds were selected (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). By comparing the docking score, we identified six compounds making potential PFKM inhibitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>M, N).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>PFKM lactylation promotes the progression of endometrial cancer cells. <bold>(A)</bold> Expression of the four genes in 19&#x000a0;EC and 36 normal tissues was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. <bold>(B)</bold> Collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis for identifying modification sites. <bold>(C)</bold> Ribbon diagram of the human PFKM protein crystal structure. <bold>(D)</bold> PFKM expression in 30&#x000a0;EC and 20 normal tissues was determined with immunohistochemistry. <bold>(E)</bold> DFS curves for PFKM expression levels in 30 patients with EC. &#x02217;<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05. <bold>(F)</bold> Glucose uptake by Ishikawa cells. <bold>(G)</bold> Lactate production in Ishikawa cells. <bold>(H)</bold> Western blot analysis of pan-Kla abundance in response to PFKM treatment of Ishikawa cells. <bold>(I, J)</bold> Effect of PFKM expression on Ishikawa cell proliferation detected with EdU and colony formation assays. <bold>(K)</bold> Transwell assay was used to determine the number of invading cells. <bold>(L)</bold> Angiogenesis evaluation of HUVEC cells with a tube formation assay. <bold>(M)</bold> (a) Overall three-dimensional structure of the PFKM complex.
