It is mainly reported in Indian, Latino, American, and Middle Eastern patients.&#x000a0;This paper aims to document the clinicopathological characteristics of LPP.</p><p>Materials and methods: A five-year retrospective study from January 2017 to December 2021 analyzed 42 patients diagnosed with&#x000a0;LPP&#x000a0;who presented with idiopathic, itchy/asymptomatic, hyperpigmented/violaceous macules at the Dermatology outpatient department. The study excluded those with melasma, post-inflammatory pigmentation, or cases where a skin biopsy was unavailable. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data, including age, sex, residence, site of involvement, pigmentation pattern, and biopsy results, were reviewed. Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed on all biopsies, with special stains such as Masson's trichrome and Congo red used in selected cases to assess fibrosis and to rule out amyloid.</p><p>Results: The study involved 42 patients, with a higher prevalence in female patients, 29 (69.0%) compared to 13 (30.9%) male patients, and an average age of 34.2 years. The majority of patients were from urban areas (28, 66.7%), with the most common sites of involvement being the head and neck (14, 33.3%), upper limbs (nine, 21.4%), and back (eight, 19%). Pigmentation patterns were predominantly diffuse (29, 69%), with less common patterns including reticular (seven, 16.7%) and blotchy (four, 9.5%). Histopathological findings included orthokeratosis, epidermal thinning, and melanin incontinence, with Masson's trichrome staining indicating fibrosis in nine (21.4%) cases. Civatte bodies were present in 33 (78.3%) cases. Direct immunofluorescence showed IgM positivity in one of six cases.</p><p>Conclusion: LPP is a common pigmentary disorder characterized by persistent, asymptomatic, slaty-gray pigmentation, mainly in sun-exposed areas. Histopathologically, it features orthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, dense dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, melanin incontinence, and frequent Civatte bodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>diffuse</kwd><kwd>histopathology (hp)</kwd><kwd>lichen planus pigmentosus</kwd><kwd>melanin incontinence</kwd><kwd>skin pigmentation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is an uncommon variant of lichen planus, characterized by the insidious onset of dark-brown&#x000a0;to gray pigmented macules in sun-exposed areas and flexural folds with or without pruritus. It is a chronic, relapsing condition characterized by worsening symptoms alternating with periods of remission, during which symptoms may decrease or disappear [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its evolution is chronic and progressive, marked by unpredictable remissions and exacerbations [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The term "lichen planus pigmentosus"&#x000a0;was first introduced by Shima in 1956, initially thought to be a variant of lichen planus [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bhutani et al. later reported it in India and described the clinical and histopathological features in 40 patients in 1974 [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2003, Kanwar et al. conducted a significant study in India with 124 patients, detailing the clinical, epidemiological, and histopathological aspects of LPP [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>LPP typically presents as pigmentation of insidious onset without inflammation or preceding raised lesions. It is usually asymptomatic but may occasionally cause mild pruritus [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The histopathological features of LPP are well documented and include epidermal atrophy, basal cell degeneration, band-like infiltrates, and melanophages in the upper dermis [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Most reports of LPP come from Japan, Korea, the Middle East, and Latin America, with a notable absence of studies from North-East India despite the significant research conducted in other regions of India [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

It is characterized by persistent, asymptomatic, slaty-gray pigmentation primarily affecting photo-exposed areas, particularly the face and neck, and occasionally extending to the upper limbs [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over time, involvement may also extend to the upper extremities and the upper parts of the back and trunk [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Lesions are typically bilaterally symmetrical and predominantly located in sun-exposed areas. These observations are consistent with findings reported by Bhutani et al. [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Vega et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which align with the results of our study.</p><p>Classically, the pigmentation pattern is "actinic" with symmetric and diffuse pigmentation,&#x000a0;commonly seen in dark&#x02011;skinned individuals and can also rarely present as a macular pigmentation of the flexural region in the lighter&#x02011;skinned population [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pigmentation is dermal, and there are no signs of inflammation on clinical presentation [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the pigmentation is usually diffuse, blotchy, reticular, perifollicular, inversus, segmental, annular, and gyrate patterns have also been described [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There are isolated case reports of linear unilateral hyperpigmentation in the extremities (Blaschkoid) and segmental patterns on the trunk [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Kanwar et al. revealed diffuse (77.4%), followed by reticular (9.7%), blotchy (7.3%), and perifollicular (5.6%) patterns of pigmentation [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The pigmentation patterns observed in the present study were predominantly diffuse, followed by reticular, blotchy, perifollicular, and localized presenting on one side of the face. Other patterns of pigmentation were not encountered in our study.</p><p>Consistent with other studies, our research found that in 40% of cases, symptoms first began in the third or fourth decade of life [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Vega et al. reported a female preponderance similar to that observed in the present study [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the contrary, Bhutani et al. observed no difference in sex distribution in their patients [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>LPP is insidious in onset and has a chronic relapsing course. Some patients continue to develop new lesions while the old ones gradually enlarge with a deepening in color. Generally, the lesions are asymptomatic, although mild pruritus and burning sensations are present in about one-third of patients [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consistent with other studies, our research found no preceding or associated erythema around the lesions [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The majority of our patients were from urban areas (66.7%) compared to rural areas (33.3%). This finding corroborates with the increased prevalence of lichen planus and its variants among the urban population. Factors contributing to this causation require further studies [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The histopathology of LPP forms a continuous spectrum, with the earliest lesions showing marked inflammation at the interface, which later subsides, leaving behind the characteristic dermal pigmentation in older lesions [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which was also noted in our study.</p><p>The inflammatory phase is characterized by a dense band-like or perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary dermis with prominent basal-vacuolar degeneration. In older lesions or the burnt-out inflammatory phase, marked melanin incontinence with many interstitial and perivascular melanophages is seen with only a mild superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and focal to absent basal&#x02011;vacuolar degeneration [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The epidermis is usually atrophic, with orthohyperkeratosis in some cases [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The histological findings correlated with the clinical picture, i.e., the majority of the cases presented with hyperpigmentation rather than the typical violaceous skin lesion.</p><p>Civatte bodies are a common finding in LPP [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the present study, epidermal thinning was seen in less than 50% of cases; however, most cases showed orthokeratosis and hypergranulosis. Basal vacuolization was observed in a small number of cases, while melanin incontinence was a prominent finding in the majority of cases. A moderate to marked inflammatory infiltrate was observed, with the majority located in the perivascular regions. Similar to other studies, Civatte bodies were observed in most cases in the present study.</p><p>The comparative analysis of different demographic, clinical, and histopathological findings of the present study with those of other similar studies on LPP is summarized in Table <xref rid="TAB3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Comparison of clinical and histopathological findings with other similar studies on LPP</title><p>LPP: Lichen planus pigmentosus</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age Range</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender Preponderance</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Common Sites of Involvement</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Most Common Pigmentation Pattern</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Histopathology</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bhutani et al.

Approximately 15% of cases show immune deposits. The patterns seen include IgM and, less commonly, C3 deposits along the dermo-epidermal junction [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the present study, only one case showed a deposit of IgM at the dermo-epidermal junction.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>The limitations of the study include its retrospective nature and small sample size. As a retrospective study, it was not possible to obtain detailed information regarding the prior use of topical agents. Additionally, the small sample size was due to the study period coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>LPP is a prevalent pigmentary disorder with distinctive clinical and histological characteristics. This study highlights the clinical and histopathological patterns of LPP observed at a tertiary care hospital in Northeast India. The findings are similar to the studies in other parts of the country.&#x000a0;LPP typically presents as persistent, asymptomatic, slaty-gray pigmentation predominantly on sun-exposed areas such as the face and neck, with lesions often bilaterally symmetrical. Pigmentation patterns vary but commonly include diffuse, reticular, blotchy, and perifollicular types. Histopathologically, it features orthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, dense dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, melanin incontinence, and frequent Civatte bodies.</p><p>The present study shows a higher prevalence in the urban population, which warrants further studies to determine its relation to the causative factors in LPP. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are required to better understand the disease and, hence, better treatment options.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Mary Z.
