Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is the predominant form of dementia, constituting approximately 60% to 80% of all cases. From 2000 to 2019, there has been a significant rise in AD-related deaths, with a notable surge during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As the population ages, particularly with the baby boom generation reaching over 65, AD is emerging as one of the most burdensome and fatal diseases [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, AD has become the third leading cause of death and disability among the elderly, surpassed only by cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, as well as malignant tumors [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. AD is a multi-factorial disease, implicating aspects such as amyloid beta (A&#x003b2;) peptides aggregation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, inflammatory responses, reactive oxygen species accumulation and cholinergic dysfunction, etc. [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among these etiological mechanisms, the amyloid cascade hypothesis is most widely accepted [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The hypothesis underscores the abnormal accumulation and folding of amyloid beta outside the neurons in the brain as a critical pathological feature of AD [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The excessive production and misfolding of amyloid beta peptides play a pivotal role in the formation of amyloid plaques [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These plaques are considered to trigger a series of subsequent adverse reactions, including inflammatory responses, progressive synaptic injury and tau hyperphosphorylation, ultimately leading to widespread neuronal dysfunction and death [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given the significance of A&#x003b2; fibrils and plaques in inducing pathological alterations and cognitive deficits, drugs candidates capable of inhibiting aggregation of A&#x003b2; present hopeful prospects for effective AD treatment.</p><p>Curcumin (Cur), a natural polyphenolic compound, has garnered significant interest among researchers due to its profound anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, inhibitory properties against A&#x003b2; folding and fibril formation [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, its therapeutic potential is hindered by its poor bioavailability and limited aqueous solubility [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another obstacle is the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB), a protective mechanism that restricts the entry of most substances, resulting in extremely low drug permeability [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To address these challenges, numerous research strategies have been explored. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a hydrophilic polymer, has been extensively utilized in nanodrug delivery systems due to its low immunogenicity, biocompatibility, and strong clinical conversion ability [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets has a superior loading ability and absorption efficiency compared to other 2D nanomaterials, owing to its higher surface-to-volume ratio [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Notably, a considerable number of studies have demonstrated that BP nanosheets enabled increased drug permeability through opening the BBB photothermally, leveraging their excellent photothermal properties under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Most importantly, BP also has the unique ability to suppress A&#x003b2; self-aggregation under photothermal conditions and can decompose into physiologically compatible phosphates and phosphites [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Compared to other penetrating and targeting transport peptides, BP exhibits greater stability, reducing immune system clearance and thus optimizing therapeutic effectiveness [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recent studies have identified a series of cinnamic acid derivatives with effective anti-cancer, anti-inflammation and antioxidant properties, as well as the ability to improve the pathological condition of AD models [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some studies proposed that the probe containing the dimethyl amino group has higher affinity for the A&#x003b2; aggregates [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], suggesting that cinnamic acid derivatives may offer a concurrent approach to achieve anti-inflammatory, antioxidant ability and enhanced aiming function.</p><p>In this work, a nanodrug with a potential treatment effect was successfully synthesized by integrating the BP nanosheets, curcumin, and 4-(Dimethylamino) cinnamic acid. The synthesis approach for BP-PEG-Tar@Cur entails harnessing the photothermal properties of black phosphorus (BP) to permeabilize the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB), modifying curcumin (Cur) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for enhanced biocompatibility, and integrating 4-(Dimethylamino) cinnamic acid (Tar), a derivative of cinnamic acid, to bolster the targeting precision towards amyloid-beta (A&#x003b2;) plaques. The partial therapeutic effects of this nanodrug have been concisely and clearly illustrated in the graphical abstract. Our finding revealed that BP-PEG-Tar@Cur effectively suppressed the excessive inflammatory response triggered by A&#x003b2; aggregation in astrocytes and microglia. In addition, this nanodrug not only inhibited A&#x003b2; aggregation, but also facilitated the disassembly of existing A&#x003b2; aggregates. Most importantly, the inclusion of 4-(Dimethylamino) cinnamic acid and a BP nanosheet significantly enhanced the targeting of A&#x003b2; and BBB penetrating rate. The beneficial impact of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur on spatial learning and memory impairment was verified in an APP/PS1 mice model using a behavioral test (Morris water maze). This nanodrug, with the capability of photothermal BBB penetration and A&#x003b2; targeting, can actively ameliorate the A&#x003b2; burden, representing a promising A&#x003b2; aggregation inhibitor for AD treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>2.

Preparation of the Nanoparticles</title><p>The synthesis of PEG-Tar was achieved through the employment of the EDC/NHS reaction. A molar ratio of 1:1:1 was used, combining 38 mg of 4-(Dimethylamino) cinnamic acid (Tar), 23 mg of N-Hydroxy succinimide (NHS), and 38 mg of 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in a round-bottom flask. Subsequently, 2 mL of DMF was added, and the mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer to activate the (carboxylic acid group) COOH of Tar via the EDC/NHS reaction. After 5 h, 200 mg of DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2</sub> (PEG) was introduced, enabling the EDC/NHS reaction to facilitate the connection of the COOH bond on the activated Tar with the NH<sub>2</sub> bond on the PEG, thereby resulting in the synthesis PEG-Tar. The subsequent phase of the synthesis involved the formation of PEG-Tar@Cur through a hydrophobic reaction. A total of 10 mg of Cur was added to the PEG-Tar solution and stirred for 12 h. Subsequently, the entire reaction solution was gradually added to 12 mL of water while rapidly stirring and heating at 40 &#x000b0;C until all DMF had evaporated. During this process, the Cur was encapsulated within the hydrophobic ball formed by the C<sub>18</sub> chain on PEG. Subsequently, the insoluble Cur was separated from the solution by centrifugation to purify the PEG-Tar@Cur. This was accomplished by transferring the solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and collecting the supernatant contained PEG-Tar@Cur after centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The final synthesis of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur utilizing phosphorus&#x02013;oxygen bonding entailed the resuspension of 4 mL BP (NMP,1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) (1 mg/mL) in ultrapure water after centrifugation and added to the PEG-Tar@Cur solution. After 12 h, the reaction solution was extracted and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min to remove the uncombined BP. The supernatant was removed after centrifugation, and 5 mL of ultrapure water was added to resuspend the remaining material. This step was repeated to ensure the thorough washing of any unbound PEG-Tar@Cur. Ultimately, the BP-PEG-Tar@Cur suspension was obtained by resuspension in ultrapure water.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>2.3. Characterization of the Nanoparticles</title><p>The zeta potentials and size distribution of the synthetic particles were determined by Malvern Zetasizer Pro (Malvern, UK). The morphology was analyzed with a FEI Talos F200 X G2 transmission electron microscope (TEM) in Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA, USA). A small amount of the sample was dispersed in ethanol, and then a few drops were added to the copper net. After drying, the sample was imaged under the condition of an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was conducted on the Science Nicolet iS20 in Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA, USA). Prior to analysis, the attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory in the spectrometer&#x02019;s optical path performed an initial scan of the air background in a moisture-free environment. Subsequently, a sample droplet was placed on the ATR accessory&#x02019;s crystal face, enabling the collection of the infrared spectrum.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.1. Preparation and Characterization of the Nanodrug</title><p>The synthesis route of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur is illustrated in the graphical abstract. In brief, PEG-Tar@Cur was synthesized through activation of the carboxyl group on the target 4-(Dimethylamino) cinnamic acid and the amino group on PEG through EDC/NHS reaction. Subsequently, Cur was encapsulated with PEG-Tar using the hydrophobic interaction facilitated by the C<sub>18</sub> chain on PEG, resulting in the formation of PEG-Tar@Cur. Finally, the addition of BP resulted in the formation of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur through a phosphorus&#x02013;oxygen bond reaction and static adsorption effect. The TEM images in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A show the morphological characteristics of BP and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur. The Malvern Zetasizer Pro was used to evaluate the zeta potential, size distribution density, and stability of the nanodrug in different solvents. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B, BP exhibits an inherent potential of approximately &#x02212;64.42 mV, which shifts to &#x02212;25.32 mV upon combination with positively charged PEG-Tar@Cur, confirming successful synthesis. The particle size density distribution plot of the material is shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C. Initially, the BP nanosheets measured approximately 280 nm, but their size reduced to approximately 210 nm after modification and folding. This reduction is beneficial for enhancing circulation and metabolism of the material in vivo. Additionally, the stability of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur in PBS and DMEM was evaluated (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). The data show that BP-PEG-Tar@Cur maintains good stability in both media for over 7 days.</p><p>For deeper insight into the nanodrug synthesis, UV&#x02013;vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and FT-IR spectroscopy were used for comprehensive characterization. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, the UV&#x02013;vis spectra show that Cur has a maximum absorbance peak at 425 nm. After combination with PEG-tar, the peak shifts to 382 nm, indicating the successful synthesis of PEG-Tar@Cur. Furthermore, the addition of BP to PEG-Tar@Cur results in the appearance of a new absorbance peak at 378 nm, demonstrating the successful integration of BP with PEG-Tar@Cur. The Raman spectrum of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E shows characteristic peaks aligned with both BP at 361 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 465 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and PEG-Tar@Cur at 667 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. This alignment indicates the successful synthesis of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur. In addition, the FT-IR spectrum is shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F, which provides further evidence. The spectrum of PEG-Tar appears a peak at 3460 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> corresponding to -NH, indicating the successful reaction between -COOH and -NH<sub>2</sub> activation via EDC/NHS chemistry. Moreover, the strong absorbance band at 1095&#x02013;1107 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> underlines the presence of the P-O bond, confirming the integration of BP and PEG-Tar@Cur. Collectively, these spectroscopic techniques provide robust evidence for the successful synthesis and integration of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur, underscoring the precision and reliability of our novel nanodrug.</p><p>In order to standardize drug release calculations, standard curves were derived by diluting Cur and PEG-Tar@Cur at varying concentrations (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G,H). These curves served as the foundation for accurate statistical analysis of drug release kinetics. The encapsulation and drug loading efficiency of Cur within BP-PEG-Tar@Cur were determined to be 22.75% and 20.6%, respectively, based on the aforementioned curves. It is noteworthy that this loading efficiency was 4% higher than that of the curcumin-loaded nanodrug prepared by an alternative method [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, the in vitro drug release profile of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur, depicted in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>I, revealed an initial rapid release phase within the first 6 h, followed by a plateau, ultimately achieving a total release efficiency of 45%. Moreover, as evident from the data presented in the figure, the drug release amount of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur is higher than that of PEG-Tar@Cur, demonstrating the advantages of BP as a carrier. To assess the photothermal characteristics of the nanodrug, solutions with varying concentrations of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur were exposed to an 808 nm NIR laser (1.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 10 min, with PBS serving as the control. As demonstrated in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>, the 0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL concentration exhibited superior photothermal effects compared to PBS, manifesting a more pronounced temperature increase. Notably, at a concentration of 20 &#x003bc;g/mL, BP-PEG-Tar@Cur elicited an even more dramatic temperature surge of approximately 12 &#x000b0;C within 10 min. Additionally, the results of the in vivo photothermal effect are presented in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>. Thermal imaging maps revealed that the temperature in the control group remained stable, whereas in the two groups receiving NIR treatment, the group treated with BP-PEG-Tar@Cur and NIR exhibited a larger temperature change compared to the pure NIR group, with a temperature difference of up to 2.9 &#x000b0;C. Furthermore, photographic documentation of the extracted brains revealed that the control group and the pure NIR group exhibited minimal Evans blue penetration. However, the BP-PEG-Tar@Cur +NIR group displayed a noticeable blue distribution, confirming the photothermal effect of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur. These remarkable photothermal properties of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur provide a promising foundation for future in vivo BBB opening studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.2.

This result determined the suitability of the nanodrug for further experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.3. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur Effectively Inhibits A&#x003b2; Aggregation and Dissociates A&#x003b2; Fibrils</title><p>A&#x003b2; is widely acknowledged as a crucial element in the pathogenesis of AD within the scientific community [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This peptide has a proclivity to aggregate, forming profibrils which subsequently evolve into amyloid plaques, ultimately leading to neuronal damage [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Current therapeutic strategies targeting A&#x003b2; primarily seek to disrupt its aggregation process, thus preventing the development of harmful substances.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of the synthesized materials on A&#x003b2; aggregation was initially evaluated through a soluble A&#x003b2; experiment. Soluble A&#x003b2; monomers were incubated with various materials (Cur, PEG-Tar@Cur, BP-PEG-Tar@Cur) for 72 h. In the absence of treatment, A&#x003b2; monomers spontaneously aggregated into profibrils. Subsequently, the incubated mixtures were centrifuged and the remaining soluble monomers were quantified by BCA in order to evaluate the inhibitory capacity of each compound. As illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E, the levels of soluble A&#x003b2; in the untreated control group decreased to 32.86%, while in the Cur-, PEG-Tar@Cur-, and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur-treated groups, the levels were at 54.06%, 67.77%, and 76.51%, respectively. These findings suggest that the tested compounds exhibit inhibitory effects on A&#x003b2; aggregation, with BP-PEG-Tar@Cur demonstrating the most significant inhibitory activity.</p><p>To further validate our previous findings, we conducted a Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay. ThT is an exogenous fluorescence probe that exhibits a high degree of affinity for A&#x003b2; fibrils. The fluorescence intensity is proportional to the beta sheet structure of the fibrils [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This enabled an indirect assessment of the quantity of A&#x003b2; fibrils based on the fluorescence intensity. Aliquots of the mixed solution were extracted at different time intervals for the purpose of analyzing the tendency of A&#x003b2; protofibril formation. As illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F, minimal alternations in fluorescence were discerned during the initial stages (up to 4 h), indicating a minimal level of A&#x003b2; protofibrils formation. However, 4 h later, the aggregation process accelerated rapidly and reached a plateau phase after 12 h. Notably, the PEG-Tar@Cur- and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur-treated groups reached this plateau more rapidly than both the untreated and Cur groups, suggesting at their potential for curtailing A&#x003b2; aggregation duration. Additionally, the fluorescence intensity for the BP-PEG-Tar@Cur group was reduced by 50% at 24 h in comparison to the untreated group, indicating its excellent inhibitory capacity against A&#x003b2; aggregation.</p><p>Furthermore, the capability of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur to dissociate A&#x003b2; protofibrils was assessed through A&#x003b2; fluorescence-based depolymerization experiments. After 24 h of co-incubation with Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur, the formation of A&#x003b2; protofibrils was observed under a fluorescence microscope. Images were randomly captured under the microscope and photographed, as presented in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G. The formation of protofibrils in the untreated group was observed to occur in densely populated large patches. In contrast, both the Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur treatments were found to considerably reduce the density of these patches. Remarkably, the BP-PEG-Tar@Cur group displayed only minor patches, suggesting its efficacy in dissociating A&#x003b2; protofibrils. These findings provide compelling evidence that BP-PEG-Tar@Cur not only effectively suppresses aggregation of A&#x003b2;, but also possesses a remarkable ability in dissociating A&#x003b2; protofibrils.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.4. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur Enhances the Ability of A&#x003b2; Targeting and Cellular Uptake</title><p>Cur is renowned for its exceptional biological activity, yet its applications have been hindered by low solubility and suboptimal bioavailability. To address these limitations, we modified Cur with PEG to enhance its biocompatibility and solubility. In addition, to enlarge the target ability of the nanodrug, 4-(Dimethylamino) cinnamic acid was introduced as a mediator for A&#x003b2; targeting. Cinnamic acid, an aromatic carboxylic acid, is recognized for its multifarious biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous research combining cinnamic acid and curcumin has demonstrated promising results [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Building upon this existing literature, we found that ThT fluorescence binds to fibers due to its co-folding with the beta sheet through its dimethylamine group [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Inspired by this, we adopted a 4-(Dimethylamino) cinnamic acid, structurally akin to ThT, in order to achieve targeting. To evaluate the targeting efficacy, the samples of Cur, BP-PEG@Cur, PEG-Tar@Cur, and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur were incubated with A&#x003b2; fibrils and visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy. The resulting images (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) indicate the presence of A&#x003b2; in red and Cur in green. Remarkably, after the addition of PEG-Tar@Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur, an extensive overlapping area of green and red is discernible&#x02013;significantly more than with Cur and BP-PEG@Cur group. This experimental result validates our hypothesis that the Tar has the ability to enhance A&#x003b2;-targeting ability. Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed that the fluorescence intensity in the compound group with Tar was fourfold that of pure Cur group, indicating the superior cellular uptake proficiency of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.5. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur Effectively Removes Mitochondrial ROS In Vitro</title><p>To investigate the antioxidant properties of the synthesized nanodrug, a co-incubation study was conducted, whereby both Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur were incubated with A&#x003b2; fibrils. Subsequently, the levels of mitochondrial ROS were quantified using the Mito-SOX mitochondrial red fluorescence probe (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). The treatment of cells with A&#x003b2; fibrils resulted in the generation of extensive red fluorescence, indicating a pronounced ROS generation by the induction of A&#x003b2; fibrils. As has been demonstrated in previous studies, the group treated with Cur exhibited a reduction in ROS levels. However, the most noteworthy observation was that cells treated with BP-PEG-Tar@Cur exhibited a marked decrease in red fluorescence, approximately one-third lower than those of the untreated group. These results suggest that BP-PEG-Tar@Cur effectively curtails mitochondrial ROS levels induced by A&#x003b2; aggregation. The evidence also spotlighted the synergistic benefits derived from cinnamic acid, which elevated the efficacy of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur beyond that of the Cur alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.6. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur Effectively Opens BBB Under NIR Irradiation and Enhances Drug Permeability</title><p>The BBB has historically been regarded as a significant obstacle in AD research, frequently impeding the effective delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain and consequently limiting their therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we employed the photothermal properties of BP nanosheets under NIR irradiation to transiently open the BBB, thereby creating a temporary drug window that facilitates drug permeability. To validate the efficacy of BBB penetration in vitro, an in vitro BBB model was constructed using a transwell device (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). In the upper chamber of the device, bend.3 cells were seeded in order to simulate human brain vascular endothelial cells. Once the optimal cell density had been reached, the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured using a cell resistance meter. Equal concentrations of Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur were added to the upper chamber once the TEER reached 200 &#x003a9;&#x000b7;cm<sup>2</sup>. The NIR group was subjected to 10 min of NIR irradiation (808 nm, 1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) following the administration of the drug. Subsequently to a 2 h incubation period, samples from the lower chamber were collected and analyzed, and the penetration rate (illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) was calculated. The results demonstrated that the penetration rates of Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR were 8.13% and 36.84%, respectively. These findings highlight the efficacy of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur in facilitating BBB opening under NIR irradiation. After giving NIR irradiation and drug treatment, the resistance value of each group was measured and recorded (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). The change in the resistance was negligible, with a slight upward trend. It is hypothesized that this may be a self-regulating feedback mechanism that is activated in order to enhance protective capabilities following any potential damage. Therefore, it is inferred that the short-term NIR irradiation may not compromise the integrity of the BBB. To further verify whether NIR irradiation caused cell damage, the calcein acetoxymethyl ester/propidium iodide (calcein-AM/PI) assay was utilized. The cells extracted from the transwell model experiment were digested and resuspended, and a calcein-AM/PI working solution was subsequently added. In healthy cells, calcein-AM is converted to the fluorescent molecule calcein, which indicates cell viability. In contrast, PI stains dead or damaged cells, emitting red fluorescence. The fluorescence images (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>) revealed no significant signs of cell damage in the NIR-treated group, indicating that NIR irradiation did not cause appreciable cellular harm.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.7. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR Alleviates the Burden of A&#x003b2; and Associated Proteins in AD Mice</title><p>To investigate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the synthesized nanodrug, we selected APP/PS1 mice as an AD model. After 3 weeks of drug treatment, the hippocampal tissue was extracted and subjected to quantitative analysis via the Western blot (WB) assay. As is widely known, APP is a precursor protein of A&#x003b2;. BACE1 and PS1 are crucial enzymes in the generation of A&#x003b2; through the APP cleavage process [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In order to study the impact of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur on the A&#x003b2; production pathway, APP, A&#x003b2;, BACE1, and PS1 sites were selected for investigation. The protein bands are shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C, with their corresponding statistical analysis results in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;G. As illustrated in the figure, the protein expression levels in the APP/PS1 mice were markedly elevated in comparison to the wild-type group, confirming the authenticity of the AD model. Notably, the mice treated with Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur + NIR exhibited reduced A&#x003b2; levels, with the latter displaying a more pronounced decline. This phenomenon was also observed in the other three proteins, indicating that both Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur + NIR can reduce the deposition of A&#x003b2; and its related proteins accumulated in the hippocampus of AD model mice. Furthermore, the outcomes achieved with BP-PEG-Tar@Cur + NIR were superior.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.8. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR Mitigates the Inflammatory Response Induced by Microglia and Astrocytes</title><p>We conducted a more thorough investigation into the potential of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur + NIR in mitigating inflammatory responses within the mouse brain. Given that microglia and astrocytes are the primary immune cells implicated in AD progression, recent studies suggest that reducing their activation may alleviate AD symptoms [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, in our investigation, we chose Iba-1 as a microglia marker and GFAP as an astrocyte marker to quantitatively analyze the inflammatory response. Following the conclusion of the treatment period, the mouse brain tissue was subjected to immunostaining with GFAP and Iba-1 antibodies, with observations conducted via a fluorescence microscopy. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,C, the AD model mice exhibited a pronounced red fluorescence, which underscored the significant activation of microglia and astrocytes. However, the brains of mice treated with either Cur or BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR resulted in diminished red fluorescence, indicating a significant reduction in the inflammatory response caused by the activation of these immune cells. Although BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR demonstrated superior efficacy in clearing the inflammatory response, the numerical difference between it and Cur was not as substantial as anticipated. This may be attributed to the potential combined effect of curcumin and cinnamic acid in BP-PEG-Tar@Cur in reducing inflammation. However, as illustrated by the statistical data in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B,D, the number of positive cells in the BP-PEG-Tar@Cur group was nearly equivalent to that of the wild-type group. This suggests that a potential bottleneck effect may have contributed to the apparent lack of significant anti-inflammatory effects of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot9-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.9. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR Effectively Improves Memory and Behavioral Impairment in AD Mice</title><p>A prominent pathological characteristic of AD is cognitive dysfunction, typified by deteriorating memory and learning capabilities. The water maze test is the most commonly used method to evaluate spatial memory and learning ability in mice [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-17-00177" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, following the completion of the drug treatment, the mice were subjected to a week-long training session on the water Morris maze, with their movements being analyzed using a video analysis software (2860). The distinct swimming trajectories depicted in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A illustrate notable differences among the groups. It is obvious that the wild-type mice displayed more purposeful routes towards the platform (crossed the platform more than three times), while the AD mice meandered aimlessly (never crossed the platform). Both the Cur and BP-PEG-Tar@Cur + NIR groups demonstrated improvement, with the latter exhibiting superior memory retention. The escape latency, which is defined as the time taken by mice to locate the platform upon entering the water, serves as a crucial indicator of memory performance. A shorter escape latency indicates better memory function. All treatment groups exhibited a reduction in escape latency over the 5-day training period (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Especially by the end of training, the BP-PEG-Tar@Cur + NIR group exhibited pronounced improvements in memory and learning ability. The superiority of the wild-type groups was evident, with a shorter escape latency than the other groups. Notably, the BP-PEG-Tar@Cur + NIR groups had a similar escape latency to the AD group at the outset of training, but demonstrated a marked reduction by the conclusion of training, indicating a certain degree of improvement in learning and memory ability. There was no significant difference in the swimming speed among the four treatment groups, suggesting that the observed variations in results were not attributed to exercise deficits (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D). The mean escape latency, which is the average value of escape latency, reflects the accuracy of the data (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). The frequency of crossings over the platform serves as an additional indicator of memory performance in mice (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E). In addition, a longer duration spent within the platform&#x02019;s quadrant suggested superior spatial memory (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F). The collective data demonstrated a substantial improvement in spatial learning and memory performance in mice treated with BP-PEG-Tar@Cur+NIR, suggesting the promising effect of the synthesized nanodrug in ameliorating behavioral deficits in AD mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot10-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>3.10. In Vivo Safety Evaluation</title><p>To ascertain the biocompatibility and potential toxicity of our synthesized nanodrug, we conducted an in vivo analysis of its impact on visceral organs using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. During the post-experimental period, organs&#x02014;brains, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys&#x02014;were harvested from the mice that had been assigned to various treatment groups, and processed for HE staining. As illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00177-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>G, the histological analysis reveals no discernible indications of tissue damage in the treated organs after treatment in comparison to the control group. This observation strongly indicates that neither Cur nor BP-PEG-Tar@Cur induced toxic reactions after intravenous injection. Thus, the synthesized nanodrug has been demonstrated to exhibit low toxicity and possess robust biocompatibility, paving the way for further preclinical and clinical evaluations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-pharmaceutics-17-00177"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, a nanodrug that is specifically designed to target A&#x003b2; was reported to provide synergy treatment for AD. In addition to inhibiting the self-assembly of A&#x003b2;, this nanodrug has also been observed to dissociate A&#x003b2; plaques. In particular, compared with pure Cur, BP-PEG-Tar@Cur possessed superior cellular absorbance and A&#x003b2;-targeting capability. Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur effectively scavenged A&#x003b2;-induced ROS. The nanodrug exhibited effective penetration of the BBB under the NIR irradiation, and the behavioral test proved that spatial memory and learning deficits in AD mice were improved following treatment. The present research surveys the biological application of a novel nanodrug and provides new insights for developing multifunctional photothermal agents as a potential therapy for AD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledged the support of the key Laboratory of the Prevention and Treatment Technology of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease of Guangzhou.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
