Introduction</title><p>Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide and requires continuous improvement in treatment strategies [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A hallmark of cancer is aberrant oncogenic signaling triggered by both genetic and non-genetic alterations [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Novel targeted therapies that selectively inhibit activated oncogenic signaling pathways have led to more effective treatments and better outcomes [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, these targeted therapies in advanced cancers often do not result in a long-lasting response due to the emergence of resistance. Secondary mutations that lead to reactivation of the oncogenic pathway in the presence of the drug result in resistance to targeted therapies [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This underscores the need for alternative approaches to effectively combat cancer that are fundamentally different from inhibiting oncogenic signaling.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrate that hyperactivation of oncogenic signaling pathways can be as lethal to cancer cells as inhibition of these pathways [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, oncogenic signaling in cancer cells is associated with increased activation of stress response pathways that enable cells to cope with the stress caused by oncogenic activity [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a result, further activation of mitogenic signaling could destabilize the fragile homeostasis of cancer cells and overload the stress response pathways [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays an important role in the progression of mitosis and the cellular response to DNA damage [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Due to its ability to control various oncogenic signaling pathways, PP2A has been recognized as a tumor suppressor, leading to the development of drugs designed to reactivate its activity [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, inhibition of PP2A has gained interest as a strategy to target tumors that are resistant to conventional treatments [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Namely, the proper function of PP2A during the G2 phase of the cell cycle is essential for cell senescence [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cancer cell senescence is a major contributor to resistance to therapy, especially to conventional DNA-damaging agents that preferentially affect actively dividing cells [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of PP2A can help drive senescent cancer cells into mitosis, leading to cell death by mitotic catastrophe [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>LB-100, a small molecule inhibitor of PP2A, induces mitotic catastrophe in several tumor models, especially in combination with DNA-damaging agents [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recent study has shown that LB-100 enhances oncogenic signaling and activates stress response pathways [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Lu et al. discovered that LB100 caused an inappropriate entry into mitosis and increased cell death when combined with doxorubicin in glioblastoma cells [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In vivo, the combination therapy showed a better response, exhibiting either growth inhibition or regression, than each agent used alone. In addition, the combination of LB-100 with doxorubicin effectively prevented tumor recurrence [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has also been shown that simultaneous inhibition of PP2A by LB-100 and WEE1 kinase by adavosertib is highly lethal in several cancer models, leading to DNA replication breakdown and triggering premature mitosis with subsequent cell death [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Importantly, in a phase I clinical trial, LB-100 demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile at doses associated with clinical response [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These properties of LB-100 make it an attractive candidate to test the concept of activating oncogenic signaling for cancer treatment.</p><p>LB-100 is an emerging pharmaceutical agent with significant potential for overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer treatment. Its unique mechanism enables the sensitization of cancer cells to conventional therapies, including radio and chemotherapy [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Research has demonstrated that LB-100 can effectively reverse resistance to cisplatin in models of ovarian carcinoma and medulloblastoma [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, its efficacy in combination with immunotherapy underscores its potential in diverse treatment strategies [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The combination approaches with LB-100 target both primary tumors and address emerging resistance mechanisms. Due to its efficacy and safety profile in combination therapies [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], LB-100 is a promising option for combating MDR in cancer.</p><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and accounts for about 80% of all tumors of the central nervous system [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. GBM represents a major challenge in the field of oncology due to its aggressive nature and resistance to conventional therapies [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, the low biodistribution of most cancer therapeutics in the brain due to the high expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB) is one of the limitations in GBM treatment. P-gp or the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (ABCB1) prevents cellular uptake of a variety of anticancer drugs, leading to cancer drug resistance [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Standard treatment options for GBM include maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide administration [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the standard treatment for GBM is associated with poor response rates, it has remained essentially unchanged over the past decades due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As no therapy shows a promising response, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches for GBM.</p><p>Using glioblastoma cells, patient-derived cells and pairs of sensitive and MDR cancer cell lines, we investigated the anticancer effect of LB-100 in combination with adavosertib, an inhibitor of WEE1 kinase, and doxorubicin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. These drugs were selected for their ability to target stress response pathways, particularly DNA damage stress, by either inducing DNA damage stress (doxorubicin) or inhibiting the response to DNA damage (adavosertib). The combined treatment of LB-100 with adavosertib or doxorubicin was additionally investigated in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. For the first time, we report that LB-100 synergizes with doxorubicin in simultaneous and subsequent treatment by inhibiting P-gp expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00189"><title>2.

The histological grade was determined by correlating neuroradiological examination and histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen. The expression of GFAP, OLIG2, MAP2, vimentin and p53 were confirmed by histopathological analysis. TR159, an NSCLC sample, was obtained from the Clinic for Thoracic Surgery at the Clinical Center of Serbia after obtaining informed consent from the patients and approval from the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Center of Serbia (ref. number 623/4). The sample was collected during surgery, and histopathologic analysis determined NSCLC diagnosis, histologic grade, stage, necrosis and lymph node invasion status. The histological stage of the collected NSCLC sample is IIA. The surgical specimens DT7 and TR159 were placed in a sterile tube containing antibiotic-antimycotic solution and immediately transported to the research laboratory for further processing.</p><p>To establish primary cultures, the tissue was manually minced using a surgical blade in a sterile Petri dish immediately upon arrival at the laboratory. The samples were then sectioned into pieces measuring 3&#x02013;5 mm and dissociated with the Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

Real-Time Primary Culture Cells Growth Monitoring</title><p>Growth of DT7 and TR159 primary culture cells was monitored in real time using the xCELLigence system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with a 96-well E-plate. To establish a baseline, 100 &#x000b5;L of medium was added to each well, and the background was measured before seeding the cells. The cells were then seeded, and the total volume in each well was adjusted to 200 &#x000b5;L with media. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were treated with 250 and 500 nM DOX and adavosertib, either individually or in combination with 2.5 &#x000b5;M and 5.0 &#x000b5;M LB-100. Drug treatments were refreshed every 2 to 3 days for a total of 10 days. After the treatment period, the TR159 cells were allowed to recover for another 5 days. The xCELLigence system automatically recorded impedance values for each well every 30 min and displayed the results as a cell index (CI). Antiproliferative effects are characterized by a reduced growth rate while maintaining a similar growth trajectory to untreated cells. Cytostatic effects are identified by a growth profile that remains consistent with the initial seeding baseline, whereas cytotoxic effects refer to a decline in the growth profile below the baseline established during seeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-pharmaceutics-17-00189"><title>2.6.

In the glioblastoma primary cell culture, GFAP-positive cells were considered as glioblastoma cells. In the NSCLC primary cell culture, CK8/18-positive cells were considered as cancer cells. The immunofluorescence assay was additionally optimized to quantify P-gp expression using ABCB1 antibody. Patient-derived cells were seeded in black, clear-bottom 384-well cell culture microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in 50 &#x000b5;L of cell growth medium at a density of 4000 cells per well for glioblastoma primary cells and 1000 cells per well for NSCLC primary cells. The glioblastoma primary cells were treated 24 h after seeding with 250, 500, 1000 and 2500 nM adavosertib and DOX alone or in combination with 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 &#x000b5;M LB-100 for 5 days. NSCLC primary cells were treated with the same concentrations of adavosertib and DOX alone or in combinations with 250, 500 and 1000 nM LB-100 for 7 days. After the treatments, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT and washed using the Wellwash&#x02122; Versa microplate washer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cells were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at RT. After blocking, the glioblastoma and NSCLC primary cells were incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C with a primary rabbit GFAP antibody and primary rabbit CK8/18 antibody cocktail, respectively. Both primary culture cells were co-immunostained with mouse antibody against ABCB1 to detect the presence of P-gp in both the cancer and stromal cells. The cells were washed three times with PBS using the microplate washer before incubation with the secondary Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse antibody and the secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody at RT for 2 h in the dark. The cell nuclei were counterstained with 1 &#x000b5;g/mL Hoechst 33342 at RT for 2 h. The cells were kept at 4 &#x000b0;C in the dark until imaging. Fluorescently labeled cells were visualized using the ImageXpress Pico Automated Cell Imaging System (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) with a 4&#x000d7; objective lens, after determining optimal exposure times for each illumination filter (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>).

Drug Interaction Assessment</title><p>SynergyFinder+ is an advanced online tool used to analyze interactions between drugs, specifically LB-100 combined with adavosertib and LB-100 combined with DOX, to identify potential synergies. We collected dose&#x02013;response data from immunofluorescence assays performed on DT7 and TR159 patient-derived cells for various drug combinations. These data were organized into a matrix, and SynergyFinder+ utilized several models to evaluate the synergies between the drugs. The Zero Interaction Potency (ZIP) model enhances the analysis by comparing the drugs&#x02019; dose&#x02013;response curves. It assumes that there is no interaction between the drugs and calculates the expected effect accordingly. Any deviations from this expected effect are interpreted as a measure of synergy [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Next, the Bliss Independence model assesses the scenario where the drugs act independently. It estimates the expected effect based on the probability of unrelated events occurring simultaneously. If the observed effects of the combination exceed this expected value, it indicates a synergistic interaction [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, the Loewe Additivity model is based on the principle that drugs in combination behave like a single drug administered at varying doses. This model helps to determine whether the combined doses result in an additive effect or provide evidence of synergy [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Finally, the Highest Single Agent (HSA) model compares the effects of the drug combination to the maximum effects of the individual drugs. If the combination&#x02019;s effect surpasses that of the most effective single agent, it suggests a synergistic interaction [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

MTT Assay</title><p>The combined effects of LB-100 with DOX were studied in MDR U87-TxR glioblastoma and NCI-H460/R NSCLC cell lines by the MTT assay.

The cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at the density of 2000 cells per well for NCI-H460/R and 4000 cells per well for U87-TxR in 100 &#x003bc;L of the appropriate medium. In simultaneous treatments that lasted 72 h, two concentrations of LB-100 (2.5 and 5 &#x000b5;M) were combined with DOX (100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2500 nM) in MDR glioblastoma cells, as well as with DOX (50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 nM) in MDR NSCLCs. In subsequent treatment, both MDR cancer cell lines were pre-treated with 2.5 &#x000b5;M and 5 &#x000b5;M LB-100. After 24 h, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of DOX in the same concentrations range like in simultaneous treatments. The experiment was carried out for further 48 h. At the end of the treatment period, MTT was introduced to each well at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, and the plates were stored for 3 h at 37 &#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> environment. The formazan crystals formed in the cells with functioning mitochondria were dissolved in 100 &#x000b5;L of DMSO, and absorbance readings were taken at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm using the Multiskan Sky microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Zero Interaction Potency (ZIP) is a model that assumes drugs function independently without interacting with one another. When applying this model to the combination of LB-100 and adavosertib, slightly negative scores in DT7 (&#x02212;0.35) and a significantly negative score in TR159 (&#x02212;10.58) are obtained, which suggest potential antagonism. In contrast, when LB-100 is combined with DOX, there is a positive score in DT7 (1.62), indicating slight synergy; however, a negative score in TR159 (&#x02212;5.12) points towards antagonistic interactions. The Bliss Independence model operates on a similar framework, asserting independent drug action. Here, the combination of LB-100 and adavosertib reveals negative scores in both DT7 (&#x02212;0.79) and TR159 (&#x02212;9.49), again highlighting a lack of synergy and the possibility of antagonism. Meanwhile, the LB-100 and DOX combination shows a positive score in DT7 (1.61), suggesting slight synergy, but the negative score in TR159 (&#x02212;4.93) indicates a contrasting antagonistic effect. The Loewe Additivity model provides another perspective, which assumes an additive effect similar to that of a single agent. In this assessment, LB-100 combined with adavosertib results in a negative score in DT7 (&#x02212;0.73) while yielding a positive score in TR159 (3.06), suggesting potential additivity or synergy in that context. For LB-100 and DOX, a strong positive score in DT7 (5.14) implies robust synergy or additivity, whereas the score in TR159 (0.03) remains very low, indicating weaker interaction. The Highest Single Agent (HSA) model becomes relevant when at least one of the drugs is ineffective, allowing for comparison between the combined effect and the most potent single agent. In the case of LB-100 with adavosertib, positive scores in both DT7 (3.67) and TR159 (5.92) reveal significant synergy. A similar favorable outcome is noted for the LB-100 and DOX combination, which shows positive scores in both DT7 (6.08) and TR159 (1.17), indicating notable synergistic potential.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-pharmaceutics-17-00189"><title>3.4.

In this study, we explored the effects of LB-100 in combination with adavosertib and doxorubicin (DOX) in patient-derived cell cultures of glioblastoma and NSCLCs.

As a result, dysregulation of PP2A activity may lead to elevated P-gp expression through various mechanisms.

However, the combined treatment of LB-100 and DOX presented different outcomes. In glioblastoma primary cells, LB-100 further increased P-gp expression at lower concentrations of DOX.

Since LB-100 has shown potential in suppressing P-gp expression, we hypothesized that combining LB-100 with DOX could be beneficial in sensitizing MDR cancer cells. Therefore, we assessed the cytotoxicity of simultaneous and subsequent combined treatments. In U87-TxR cells, only the subsequent administration of LB-100 enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX. In NCI-H460/R cells, LB-100 improved the efficacy of DOX with both treatment schedules, although the subsequent treatment demonstrated a more pronounced effect. Our findings highlight the importance of the sequence, in which LB-100 is administered alongside other drugs. Additionally, a DOX accumulation assay conducted after 72 h with LB-100 revealed a concentration-dependent increase in DOX accumulation in both MDR cancer cell models. This result aligns with the observed impact of LB-100 on DOX efficacy in simultaneous and subsequent treatments and could also be due to LB-100 ability to enhance drug penetration [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00189" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The Rho123 accumulation assay demonstrated that LB-100 does not affect P-gp activity, while the SwissADME analysis indicated that LB-100 is not a P-gp substrate.

Additionally, this tool suggests that LB-100 is not a substrate for P-gp. To confirm this, we used the Rho123 accumulation assay in MDR cancer cells expressing P-gp, which supported the prediction.</p><p>Mechanistically, LB-100 reduces P-gp expression in MDR cancer cells. However, the transcriptional pattern of the <italic toggle="yes">ABCB1</italic> gene varies between MDR glioblastoma and NSCLCs, suggesting that regulation may occur at the post-transcriptional level. <italic toggle="yes">HIF-1&#x003b1;</italic>, a transcriptional regulator of <italic toggle="yes">ABCB1</italic>, also exhibited a different pattern in MDR glioblastoma and NSCLCs that mirrors <italic toggle="yes">ABCB1</italic> expression.</p><p>Furthermore, SwissADME shows that LB-100 does not interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, making it a promising candidate for combination therapy. The impact of LB-100 on P-gp expression is most significant after 72 h, which correlates with increased DOX accumulation and enhanced sensitivity of MDR cancer cells to DOX treatment. Notably, LB-100 does not appear to affect DNA damage or disrupt the cell cycle, indicating that MDR cancer cells possess robust DNA repair mechanisms that may counteract the typical effects of LB-100 on DNA damage induction and alterations in cell cycle dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmaceutics-17-00189"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, combining LB-100 with adavosertib and DOX is effective for glioblastoma and NSCLCs, but multiple applications are required to achieve synergistic effects. LB-100 demonstrates potential in addressing drug resistance in MDR cancers by reducing P-gp levels while affecting key regulatory pathways and altering transcriptional dynamics of genes associated with treatment response. The observed effects on <italic toggle="yes">HIF-1&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> gene expression suggest that LB-100 may enhance the efficacy of approved therapies like temozolomide, commonly used for glioblastoma therapy. LB-100 effectively enhances the accumulation of DOX and its cytotoxicity in MDR cancer cells, particularly when administered in a subsequent treatment. Our findings indicate that LB-100 alters P-gp expression, thereby improving the efficacy of DOX. Combining LB-100 with anticancer drugs is a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Sincere gratitude to Maja Ercegovac, Dragana Mari&#x00107; and Sofija Glumac for their invaluable assistance in the collection of an NSCLC tissue sample.
