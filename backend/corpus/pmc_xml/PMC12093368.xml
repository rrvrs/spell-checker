detection
of biological markers. However, most small molecule analytes are not
electroactive. Therefore, enzymes are widely used for selective breakdown
of the markers into electro-active species. However, it has proven
difficult to design a sensor interface where any enzyme can be controllably
immobilized in high amounts with preserved activity. In addition,
most interfaces cease to function in biofluids due to &#x0201c;fouling&#x0201d;
of the sensor surface. Here we present a generic strategy employting
polymer brushes for enzymatic electrochemical sensing which resolves
these issues. Generic conjugation chemistry is used to covalently
bind large amounts of enzymes (&#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>). Remarkably,
despite this enzyme load, the (&#x0223c;200 nm thick) brushes remain
highly hydrated and practically invisible by electrochemical methods:
Small molecules freely access the underlying electrode and the charge
transfer resistance increment is exceptionally low (&#x0003c;10 &#x003a9;).
The enzymatic polymer brush interfaces enable specific detection of
the biomarkers glucose and glutamate by simple chronoamperometry.
Furthermore, by sequential immobilization of several enzymes, cascade
reactions can be performed, as illustrated by detection of acetylcholine.
Finally, the sensor interface still functions in cerebrospinal fluid
(10&#x000d7; diluted, unfiltered). In conclusion, polymer brushes provide
extended possibilities for enzymatic catalysis and electrochemical
sensing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neurotransmitters</kwd><kwd>electrochemistry</kwd><kwd>biosensors</kwd><kwd>antifouling</kwd><kwd>polymer brushes</kwd><kwd>enzymes</kwd><kwd>cascade reactions</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Materials Science Area of Advance, Chalmers Tekniska H&#x000c3;&#x000b6;gskola</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">NA</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>mt5c00146</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>mt5c00146</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electrochemical biosensors are widely
researched for monitoring
health conditions and for diagnostic applications in detecting biomarkers
at early stages of disease development due to their high sensitivity
and selectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> This is because of their
ability to rapidly and continuously monitor electron transfer events,
enabling quantification of electroactive species present at the electrode
surface. Hence, the sensors provide direct monitoring of the release
of electroactive biomarkers at biologically relevant time and length
scales. These are important features for the development of diagnostic
sensors for brain-related disorders, where neurotransmitters can serve
as biomarkers for conditions such as depression and Alzheimer&#x02032;s
disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Most importantly, amperometric measurements
offer detection of neurotransmitter biomarkers for neurological pathologies,
with submillisecond temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> and spatial
resolution down to the single micrometer scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> For instance, the placement of enzyme-based microelectrode
biosensors in the brain allows the long-term recordings of neurochemical
activity in response to behavior in both healthy and diseased animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Additionally, pioneering work by Hochstetler et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> showed that positioning this type of microsensors in rodent
brain tissue slices can provide submillisecond temporal resolution
of single exocytotic neurotransmitter release on the level of individual
neurons. This high temporal resolution has made it possible to study
the kinetics of single synaptic vesicle fusion pores regulating the
amount of neurotransmitters released into synapses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> which provides important information on how neurons control signaling
strength during neuronal communication.</p><p>Whereas some neurotransmitters
that are relevant biomarkers, such
as dopamine, are naturally electroactive, several of the major neurotransmitters
in the brain are not. This includes key neurotransmitters associated
with neurodegenerative diseases, such as glutamate and acetylcholine
in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> which
makes electrochemical detection impossible unless the marker can be
converted from a nonelectroactive state to one capable of undergoing
redox reactions at the electrode surface. This can be solved by immobilization
of chemically selective enzymes capable of breaking down these neurotransmitters
into species that are electrochemically detectable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> As an added benefit, enzymes also provide chemical selectivity
for a single substrate, making enzyme-modified electrodes attractive
for sensing in complex chemical environment and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p><p>However, electrodes with enzymes used
for electrochemical biosensing
are highly susceptible to fouling from the complex biological environment.
Biofouling, i.e. nonspecific adsorption of biological molecules, will
severely reduce electrode lifetime and sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Also, direct adsorption of enzymes onto solid surfaces
tends to reduce their activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> This
calls for the use of tethers of soft matter constructs on the surface
for a more gentle enzyme immobilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and a proper quantification of immobilized amount as well as specific
activity, to be compared with the free enzyme in solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Unfortunately it has proven difficult to achieve such constructs
while also maintaining a high redox-activity, i.e. it is difficult
to keep the electrode accessible for efficient charge transfer events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> In addition, if the coatings are thicker than
&#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;m there are strongly detrimental effects on the response
time and the ability to detect transient signals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> In this context, polymer brushes, i.e. end-grafted chains
at high surface coverage, are an interesting surface functionalization
strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Still, work to date has been
done on brushes with the model enzyme glucose oxidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> (GOx) and detection in biofluids has not been demonstrated.</p><p>Here we present a generic strategy for enzymatic electrochemical
detection in biofluids based on poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes.
The PAA brushes, which are here around 200 nm in their hydrated state,
can be used to conjugate enzymes in a generic manner, at high capacity
(3D instead of 2D) and with largely preserved activity. Remarkably,
we show that by using appropriate chemistry for grafting, polymerization
and bioconjugation, the highly hydrated enzymatic brushes become almost
impossible to detect electrochemically: their presence is not noticeable
in cyclic voltammetry (CV) and barely detected in electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS), even though the enzyme amount on the
surface is extremely high. As a proof-of-principle for enzyme-mediated
detection we use amperometry to detect various analytes important
to the brain, such as glucose and glutamate, with the corresponding
oxidative enzymes immobilized in the polymer brush matrix. In addition,
we show that a cascade reaction dependent on multiple enzymes, the
catalytic breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, can be
achieved inside the brush by subsequent immobilization of the different
sequential enzymes. Finally, neurotransmitters can also be detected
in cerebrospinal fluid, showing that the polymer brushes prevent severe
fouling of the surface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to combine polymer brushes with enzyme-mediated electrochemical
detection of neurotransmitters. Additionally, our work provides the
first example of a functional polymer brush interface with electrochemical
redox activity comparable to that of an unmodified electrode. The
results hold significant potential for the development of electrochemical
sensors and other applications involving polymer brushes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Enzyme Immobilization and Quantification</title><p>PAA brushes
were prepared on gold electrodes using diazonium salt grafting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>) and atom transfer
radical polymerization (ATRP) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> In previous work, we have also shown that PAA
as well as poly(methacrylic acid) brushes in their protonated state
exhibit generic attractive interactions with water-soluble proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> We and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> have
attributed this effect to hydrogen bonds, similar to the well-known
phenomenon of polymeric carboxylic acids in solution forming complexes
with other hydrophilic polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> As the
brush is much thicker than the characteristic size of proteins, they
can bind in multilayers inside the brush. For secure enzyme immobilization,
covalent bonds need to be formed, which can be achieved by the established
EDC/NHS conjugation protocol. The initial modification with EDC/NHS
creates a &#x0201c;clickable&#x0201d; NHS ester group on the polymer
brush which forms an amide bond with amines on proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> However, if the native brush does not have favorable
interactions with proteins, the enzymes will not penetrate the brush
interior and the immobilized amount will then be very low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Hence, we opted for conditions where the enzymes
can move through the brush by hydrogen bonds (with the &#x02212;COOH
groups) while also being able to form covalent bonds (with the &#x02212;NHS
groups). To achieve this, the ionic strength was lowered compared
to physiological levels, and the pH was reduced to 5.0 (10 mM MES
with no added salt). Under these conditions the PAA brush is almost
entirely neutral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> and spontaneous NHS
hydrolysis should not occur too quickly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> GOx was used as a model enzyme for the initial characterization
and proof-of-principle measurements in this work as it is since long
ago used in enzymatic biosensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Illustration
of the interface design. Poly(acrylic acid) brushes

plasmon resonance
(SPR) in real-time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). Introducing NHS groups to the polymer brush gave a response
of 0.25&#x000b0; which increased to 0.40&#x000b0; after GOx binding (at
980 nm). The SPR trace also showed that the hydrolysis was not too
rapid as most NHS groups remained when the enzymes were introduced
10 min later. After washing with PBS and water, the enzyme amount
was quantified by spectra in the dry state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B). Note
that at physiological ionic strength any enzymes that are not covalently
bound will be released again upon returning to physiological pH due
to electrostatic repulsion unless they are highly positively charged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> (GOx has pI 4.2). Our protocol resulted in remarkably
high covalent enzyme immobilization capacity, i.e., 1&#x02013;2.5 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup> for PAA brushes with dry thickness of 20&#x02013;30 nm. Considering
that the dimensions of GOx (160 kg/mol) are 60 &#x000d7; 52 &#x000d7; 77
&#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> the average surface
area occupied by a single GOx is 39.1 nm<sup>2</sup> and the maximum
density of a monolayer should then correspond to 680 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>. As this is merely a quarter of the measured GOx surface coverage
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>), the enzymes are clearly able
to bind in multilayers within the hydrated polymer brush, confirming
that they can reach deep into the brush (ternary adsorption) during
the conjugation process. The uniformity of the enzymatic brush coating
was also good, with 5&#x02013;10% variation over &#x0223c;1 cm<sup>2</sup> surfaces. The PAA brushes alone showed similar variation, suggesting
that the enzyme to polymer ratio was constant over the surface. The
immobilized amount could be increased even further by tuning the protocol.
However, we speculated that mass coverages on the order of 1 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup> should be more than sufficient to create an efficient catalytic
interface considering that previous work has shown that monolayers
of directly adsorbed enzymes can provide fast biosensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> Immobilization of smaller enzyme amounts is straightforward by simply
interrupting the protein binding process.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Enzyme immobilization

to measure the
height of the enzyme-functionalized polymer brushes in physiological
PBS buffer (pH 7.5). In brief, injections of poly(ethylene glycol)
were used to obtain a so-called exclusion height based on the SPR
bulk response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> An average degree of hydration
of the films could then be obtained by comparing this height with
the dry thickness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C). These measurements showed that unmodified PAA brushes
had a water content of over 90%, i.e. the chains were very strongly
stretched, which is largely due to self-repulsion from the high degree
of ionization at physiological conditions in terms of pH and salt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> After enzyme immobilization the exclusion height
decreased, which we attribute to multivalent interactions between
proteins and multiple polymer chains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the enzyme-functionalized films remained highly hydrated
(&#x0223c;70%) even though the enzyme amount is comparable to the polymer
amount in terms of mass coverage. Together with the fact that the
grafting layer with aryl bonds is very thin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> this suggests that the electrode underneath the brush might be highly
accessible for redox reactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Electrochemical Characterization of the Interface</title><p>Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
were used for electrochemical characterization of the electrode after
the polymer brush grafting and enzyme immobilization. We observed
the presence of clear oxidation (right) and reduction (left) peaks
in CV sweeps, both after grafting of the polymer brush and after immobilization
of GOx (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A).
All CV data was measured with 1 mM ferrocenemethanol as a redox active
probe in ordinary (1&#x000d7;) PBS buffer. The peak-to-peak separation
of the oxidation and reduction events did not change significantly:
77.0 mV for the bare gold, 75.4 mV for the surface modified with the
polymer brush, and 79.1 mV after enzyme immobilization, using a scan
rate of 25 mV/s (see additional CV data in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). This shows that the surface modification does not influence
the redox probe accessibility and the values are close to the theoretical
ideal peak separation of one-electron transfer reactions (59.2 mV).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> The reason why the enzymatic brush is not clearly
detected is simply that even after the brushes are loaded with enzymes
they remain highly solvated, as shown by the SPR results above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C). Furthermore,
the thin grafting layer prepared from a diazonium salt (characterization

the charge transfer, while thiolated initiators significantly block

increase in current
and a broadening of the oxidation region from &#x02212;100 to +300
mV, as well as a broadening of the reduction region from +150 to &#x02212;200

the brush, as the neutral ferrocene turns into the positive ferrocenium
ion upon oxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> which can act as
counterion to the carboxylate groups of the polymers and thus remains
at the surface. Furthermore, the oxidation peak current was linear
with the square root of the scan rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B), indicating that the process is diffusion

to neutral after conjugation with GOx.</p><p>EIS was used to further
investigate the electrochemical availability

element (<italic>Z</italic><sub>w</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> (For the bare gold, the components that correspond to the brush
were not included.) After surface functionalization, there was no
significant difference in <italic>Z</italic><sub>W</sub>, which shows
that the diffusivity in solution remains unaltered, as expected. An
extremely small increase in <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> (approximately
from 1 to 2 &#x003a9;) was obtained after forming the polymer brush,
and following the immobilization of GOx (&#x0223c;1 &#x003a9; more).
Also, the resistance of the brush itself is &#x0003c;1 &#x003a9;. These values
confirm the surface functionalization qualitatively, but clearly the
enzymatic brushes do not significantly reduce the electrode accessibility
for redox reactions. This is partly because of the high degree of
hydration of the layer, but also because the grafting layer with aryl
bonds does not limit charge transfer significantly. As a comparison,
when using other initiators based on conventional self-assembled alkanethiols, <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> increments in the range 10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>5</sup> &#x003a9; have been reported by Anthi et al. for zwitterionic
brushes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> even without any enzymes present.
Similarly, Panzarasa et al. reported resistance increases in the kiloohm
range for poly(methacrylic acid) brushes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> These values are many orders of magnitude higher than ours. In fact,
the characteristic semicircle in the Nyqvist plot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> is not even visible in our system. Based on these results
we refer to the enzymatic brushes as close to &#x0201c;electrochemically

to its charges and polarizable groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> In addition to the detailed characterization by EIS, we also tested

from the integrated Cottrell equation for purely diffusion-controlled
Faradaic reactions on a planar electrode:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup><disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="mt5c00146_m003" position="anchor"/><label>2</label></disp-formula>Here <italic>n</italic> =

gold to 1.73 CM<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> for the

in diffusivity and electrode accessibility due to the enzymatic brush
coating, in qualitative agreement with the EIS results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>D). However, we mainly attribute
this to the well-known inhibitory interactions between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and GOx.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> If the molecule
binds to the enzymes it cannot easily react with the gold surface
underneath. This explains why the reduction of redox activity appears
much stronger than for ferrocenemethanol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Indeed, the kinetics of the current trace
did not fit the Cottrell expression in this case, while performing
the same experiment on brushes with other enzymes showed kinetics
that followed the Cottrell expression perfectly, just as for an unmodified
electrode (analysis in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>).</p><p>The electrodes with GOx brushes were further exposed to glucose
solutions of varying concentrations and repeated chronoamperometry
measurements were performed over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>D). The response, measured as the integrated
current, increased over time, showing that the local H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration increases when the enzymes are given
more time to operate. Notably, the sensor signal can thus be enhanced
simply by delaying the readout. It is also noteworthy that the signal
increases even though all H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> close to the
surface is consumed for each data point in time in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>D. As expected, increasing
the glucose concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 mM also resulted in a higher
signal, although not by a factor of 10. This is again attributed to
the relatively strong inhibition of GOx by the generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> expected in this concentration range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup></p><p>For certain applications (e.g., on living cells),
the sensor will
need to respond fast to detect transient increments in analyte concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> To get an estimate of the response time of the
enzymatic brush electrodes, chronoamperometry was performed with a
20 ms time resolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>E). Upon injection of glucose onto the electrode, the response
appeared instantly (&#x0003c;1 s), reaching its maximum value after 2.4
s. This demonstrates that time-resolved measurements are feasible
with the electrode interface, although further studies using higher
bandwidth potentiostats are needed to precisely determine the response
kinetics. Additionally, the enzyme loading and the polymer brush thickness
are likely important parameters to alter when optimizing sensor speed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> but this is beyond the scope of the present
study.</p><p>We independently verified the enzymatic reaction using

is proportional to the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the sampled solution (details in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>). Since the amount of GOx on the surface was determined from SPR
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>), we could
compare its activity with the same amount of GOx in solution phase.
The results indicated that the specific activity of GOx conjugated
to PAA brushes was 43% lower than in solution. While enzymes generally
suffer activity loss upon immobilization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> GOx stands out as being particularly robust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> and can maintain full activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> We
also tested the specific activity of GOx directly adsorbed on gold

lower activity observed for the brushes is that they are so heavily
loaded with GOx that substrate depletion may become significant (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link> and related discussion).

an efficient catalytic interface due to the high mass coverage.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Neurotransmitter Detection</title><p>To demonstrate the versatility
of the enzymatic polymer brush interface we tested detection of two
neurotransmitters, glutamate and acetylcholine, which are important
biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases as well as other conditions
(e.g., obesity for glutamate and hypertension for acetylcholine).
In both cases, the enzymes involved generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by catalyzing oxidative reactions. For glutamate detection, glutamate
oxidase (GluOx) converts <sc>l</sc>-glutamate to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate
and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> For acetylcholine,

Quantification of immobilized enzymes, electrochemical surface characterization
and amperometric responses were measured in the same manner as for
glucose detection with GOx. As expected, immobilization was successful
for all enzymes (Figure 5B) with an average immobilized mass of approximately
1.4&#x02013;1.5 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>).

to values obtained in PBS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>C). As with glucose, the sensor response (and thus

the enzymes conjugated
to the PAA brush using the colorimetric assay for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For GluOx, we quantified the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by enzymes with known activity in solution (5 U)
and compared with a sensor surface containing 3 &#x003bc;g GluOx (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>D). The surface converted
&#x0223c;15% of the available glutamate in a 2 mL vial in 10 min. Based
on this result, the specific activity of the immobilized GluOx was
calculated to 2.5 U/mg (4.1 mU/cm<sup>2</sup>), which closely matches
literature values for GluOx in solution phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> The value is also higher than what we obtained for immobilized
GOx (1.6 U/mg based on data in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>F). For acetylcholine, a direct comparison with enzymes
in solution is not straightforward since proximity effects influence
the total conversion rate under non-steady-state conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> so the assay was only used to verify the reaction
qualitatively (not shown). Nevertheless, these results demonstrate
that the soft polymer brush is an excellent immobilization scaffold
not only because it allows multilayers of enzymes to be assembled,
but also because they retain high activity. This is likely is due
to good substrate access and high conformational freedom inside the
hydrophilic brushes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> For comparison, the direct adsorption
of AChE onto an electrode has been reported to reduce specific activity
by nearly a factor of 10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup></p><p>Detection
of acetylcholine requires two enzymes (AChE and GluOx)
providing an opportunity to evaluate the performance of the enzymatic
polymer brushes for cascade reactions. To the best of our knowledge,
cascade reactions have never previously been performed using polymer
brushes as scaffolds, while several other constructs have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> In cascade reactions, the relative amounts of
the enzymes are expected to strongly influence the total reaction
rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> With our conjugation method, it
is not obvious whether the enzymes should be introduced simultaneously
or in sequence to the brush. For this initial study, we chose to introduce
them sequentially since this allowed us to quantify the amount of
each enzyme by SPR. Furthermore, as AChE has a considerably higher
molecular weight (280 kg/mol) than ChOx (95 kg/mol), we expected a
greater immobilization capacity of AChE due to more hydrogen bonds
during the immobilization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> prior to the
formation of covalent amide bonds that lock the protein in place.
Hence, we first immobilized ChOx for 10 min, followed by AChE. Indeed,
as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B, this approach led to large amounts of immobilized AChE (1.0 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>) even though the brush was already highly loaded with ChOx
(1.5 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>). This corresponds to &#x0223c; 5 times
more ChOx than AChE in terms of molar ratio. It should be noted, however,
that this ratio may not be optimal for maximizing the total reaction
rate and the speed of the sensor. Previously, a ratio of 1:10 for
AChE:ChOx was used for enzymes adsorbed directly on the solid electrode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> For future optimization, the ratio can be easily
adjusted by altering the immobilization time for the first enzyme.</p><p>The cascade reaction for acetylcholine detection produced an even
higher amperometry signal in comparison with glutamate at the same
analyte concentration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>C). This is partly because two H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecules
are generated for each analyte instead of one, but the increase is
more than a factor of 2, indicating that the cascade reaction runs
very efficiently. We also tested the sensor response upon injection
of acetylcholine over the electrode surface, which resulted in an
immediate response in chronoamperometry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>E). The sharp increase in current magnitude
revealed by the kinetics confirms a fast enzyme conversion also for
the two-step cascade.</p><p>We also evaluated the enzymatic polymer
brushes for sensing in
complex media. Both the glutamate and acetylcholine sensors successfully
detected their respective analytes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Note,
however, that the CSF had to be diluted 10 times simply to enable
proper flow into the liquid cell. Also, the signals were reduced in
comparison with detection in pure PBS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>C), suggesting some interference from the
biofluid. For instance, reactions with antioxidants, such as ascorbic
acid (vitamin C) which is naturally present in CSF,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> would remove a fraction of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated by the enzyme and thus lower the overall signals. This
explains why the relative signal reduction is almost the same for
both neurotransmitters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>C). To confirm that the electrode was still equally redox-active,
CV was performed in 10&#x000d7; diluted CSF at pH 7.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>F). The voltammograms were
almost identical before and after exposure to CSF, showing that the
electrode reactivity was not significantly altered. EIS was measured
as well and revealed only minor changes in the electrode characteristics
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). Hence, the electrode functions
well in CSF, which can be attributed to the polymer brushes preventing
large molecules from reaching the metal surface. However, PAA and
the enzymes conjugated to it is not the most repelling brush and SPR
data showed that some species from CSF did bind (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Figure S11</ext-link>). Since there was no negative impact on redox reactions,
these interactions must occur in the upper regions of the brush, i.e.
the brush is still fully antifouling in the sense that the solid surface
is not affected and measurements in complex biofluids are clearly
possible. While other constructs have been reported for this purpose,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> they do not have conjugated enzymes. Thus, our enzymatic polymer
brushes represent a new and generic modification strategy where enzymes
can be immobilized in very high quantities and securely grafted through
covalent bonds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work, surface sensitive and electrochemical
characterization
techniques were employed to investigate the viability of a novel electrode
interface combining the antifouling characteristics of polymer brushes
with enzyme-enhanced biomarker detection. Using generic conjugation
chemistry, we covalently bound large amounts of enzymes to the polymer
brush. In contrast to previous work on neurotransmitter sensors, we
focused on a thorough quantitative characterization of the interface
and its enzymes. We demonstrated the functionalization and conjugation
of GOx, GluOx, ChOx, and AChE to the interface, for detection of glucose,
glutamate and acetylcholine. Importantly, the electrode accessibility
was not significantly altered by the presence of the polymer brush
or its enzymes. We also demonstrated that the specific activity of
the enzymes is not strongly reduced after incorporation into the polymer
brush. Most importantly, detection works even in a biofluid, albeit
with reduced signals. Further work will focus on various optimization
aspects, for instance with respect to the amount of immobilized enzymes
and the total thickness of the brush.</p><p>We emphasize that this
study presents a versatile method for using
polymer brushes as a matrix for immobilization of enzymes on electrodes,
opening up for a wide range of applications in electrochemical sensing.
While this work focused on neurotransmitter oxidative enzymes, the
adaptable design allows for the detection of numerous nonelectroactive
species, assuming an appropriate enzyme is available for enzymatic
breakdown of the analyte into an electroactive product. This research
advances the development of robust and sensitive biomarker detection
techniques. As a next step, potentiostats/amplifiers designed for
low-noise measurements should be implemented and the surface modification
protocol should be adapted to microelectrodes for high-speed monitoring
of neurotransmitter activity at synapses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> As an alternative application direction, there is also potential

(ATRP) with activators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) was
used to synthesize PAA brushes on the 4-(phenethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate)
initiation layer. CuCl<sub>2</sub> (0.0053 g, 0.04 mmol), and PMDETA

g/L GOx in MES buffer for 1 h. Cascade samples were prepared by first
immersing the surfaces in 0.2 g/L ChOx in MES for 10 min, rinsing
with MES buffer, and immersing in 0.2 g/L AChE for 1 h. After exposure
to enzymes all surfaces were rinsed with MES buffer and immersed in
PBS buffer (150 mM, pH 7.5) for 20 min. Surfaces were stored at 8
&#x000b0;C in PBS buffer until use, but never for longer than a day after
immobilization. To quantify the AChE and ChOx amounts separately,
SPR measurements were performed on surfaces that had both enzymes
and on surfaces where only the ChOx step had been done.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.7"><title>Surface Plasmon Resonance</title><p>Measurements were performed

used was 10 &#x003bc;L/min, unless otherwise stated, and all measurements
were done at 25 &#x000b0;C. The methodology of analyzing SPR spectra
by Fresnel modeling and the quantification in dry state has been described

and after protein immobilization, with 20 mg/mL 35 kDa PEG as probe.
The refractive index used for PAA was 1.527 and the refractive index
of all enzymes was assumed to be equal to this value. Calculation
of the surface coverage was done with the density of the bulk polymer
material (1.41 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and an average value for proteins
(1.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). While SPR was used to obtain values of dry
thickness for all layers, we also verified that ellipsometry gave
consistent results (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.5c00146/suppl_file/mt5c00146_si_001.pdf">Figure S14</ext-link>) using a

A conventional three-electrode setup was used, with the gold substrate
as the working electrode, a platinum wire mesh as counter electrode,
and a Ag/AgCl electrode as reference. Measurements were performed
with 1 mM ferrocenemethanol in a 150 mM PBS solution (pH 7.5). CV
was used to determine the standard redox potential (<italic>E</italic><sup>0</sup>) of the redox probe as the average of potential values
at which the cathodic and anodic currents were maximal. All CV sweeps
were initiated with an anodic sweep from &#x02212;0.2 V to +0.5 V,
followed by a cathodic sweep from +0.5 V to &#x02212;0.2 V, at 10,
25, 40, 60, 90, 160, 250 and 360 mV/s. Five cycles were run and the
average of the last three were used to determine the cathodic and
anodic current maxima as well as for the diffusional analysis. EIS
was measured with a DC potential set at the <italic>E</italic><sup>0</sup> of ferrocenemethanol over frequencies ranging from 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> Hz, with an AC amplitude of 5 mV.

the same conditions but with CSF 10&#x000d7; diluted in PBS. Charge transfer
densities were determined by measuring amperometry and integrating
