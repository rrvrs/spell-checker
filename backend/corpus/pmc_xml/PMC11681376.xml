Typically, MS manifests between the ages of 20 and 30 years. However, up to 10% of all patients with MS are younger than 18 years at first manifestation, and less than 1% are younger than 10 years.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A growing body of research suggests that signs or symptoms nonspecific for MS manifest years before disease onset, suggestive of a prodromal phase.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> For example, a Canadian study showed that patients with MS had higher utilization of both inpatient and outpatient medical care in the 5 years before a first demyelinating event compared with matched general population controls.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The main reasons for health care utilization were diseases of the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, sensory organs, diseases of the blood, and mental health problems.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> A higher frequency of medication use, such as antivertigo medications, antiepileptics, glucocorticoids, urinary antispasmodics, and muscle relaxants, in the 5 years before a first demyelinating event in patients with MS compared with controls was observed in another Canadian study.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In addition, visual disturbances, musculoskeletal disorders, and disturbances of skin sensation were more frequently diagnosed before a first demyelinating event related to MS.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Less is known about the prodromal features in pediatric MS.

The SHI includes nearly 88% of the total German population. These data are reported by SHI-authorized physicians on a quarterly basis for billing purposes.

Due to the nationwide coverage of the data and the relatively long period, this dataset was appropriate to study early risk factors and comorbidities as well as prodromal features for various chronic conditions.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Case ascertainment was conducted annually in a cohort of pediatric patients younger than 18 years (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10&#x02009;715&#x02009;794 in 2020) with outpatient visits in the year of ascertainment and without an MS diagnosis in the preceding 3 years. Incident cases were defined as a first confirmed diagnosis of MS (<italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> code G35) in 1 quarter between 2013 and 2020 and at least 1 additional diagnosis in 1 of the following quarters (eFigure 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI241465-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). One of the MS diagnoses had to have been coded by a neurologist. Length of individual follow-up before a first diagnosis of MS varied between 3 and 5 years and depended on the time of first MS diagnosis, calendar years available in the dataset (2010-2020), and the first year with an outpatient visit (eFigure 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI241465-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). The latter was 2010 for most cases. eFigure 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI241465-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> describes the ascertainment of children and adolescents with MS. The index quarter was the earliest recorded MS-related or CNS demyelinating disease&#x02013;related code (CNS inflammatory or demyelinating diseases [G04, G05, G09, G35, G36, or G37], optic nerve or visual pathway disorders [H46, H47, or H48], or abnormal findings on diagnostic CNS imaging [R90]).<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Children and adolescents with a first CNS demyelinating disease&#x02013;related code only (ie, without a confirmed MS diagnosis) were not defined as having MS. Controls without an MS- or CNS-related demyelinating disease diagnosis were randomly matched to each case (10:1) by sex, age at first MS diagnosis (in years), region of residence (represented by the 17 regional Associations of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians), and observation period. In addition, we selected a second control group of children and adolescents newly diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), another chronic immune-mediated disorder of different pathophysiology.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Including an additional control group of patients with another autoimmune disorder was done to provide further information as to whether any observed associations were specific to MS or also common in other autoimmune diseases. Ascertainment of incident JIA cases was conducted using a similar approach as for incident MS cases; children or adolescents had to have received the first confirmed diagnosis of JIA (<italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> code M08.8) in 1 quarter between 2013 and 2020 and another confirmed diagnosis in a subsequent quarter. For the comparison of children and adolescents with MS and JIA, matching variables were identical to matching with controls without MS, but the target case-to-control ratio was 1:1.</p></sec><sec id="H2-3-ZOI241465"><title>Exposure</title><p>We performed exploratory analysis by examining the frequency of confirmed diagnoses in the 5 years before a first MS diagnosis. Diagnoses made in the penultimate quarter (preindex) were not considered in the analysis as they may reflect the diagnostic workup of MS. Diagnoses from all 22 <italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> chapters were included in the analysis using 3-digit codes. Among the 1222 possible 3-digit codes, to adhere to the data protection and access agreements, codes with fewer than 30 children or adolescents with MS and/or controls were not included, leaving 163 <italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> codes for analyses (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI241465-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="H2-4-ZOI241465"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Initially, we examined the association of 163 <italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> codes with a later MS diagnosis by calculating univariable odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs for the 5-year period. <italic>P</italic> values were corrected for multiple testing by using the &#x00160;id&#x000e1;k correction.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, we performed multivariable analysis by including all <italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> codes that remained statistically significant after the &#x00160;id&#x000e1;k correction in a logistic regression model also adjusted for sex and age. In addition to the pooled analysis for the whole 5-year period, we calculated ORs for each individual year to determine when potential differences in diseases or symptoms between children and adolescents with MS and controls occurred. Furthermore, we applied the same multivariable logistic model for the comparison of children and adolescents with MS and JIA. Finally, we conducted a complementary analysis by removing children and adolescents with neurological or cerebrovascular diagnoses since these disorders may be considered early indicators of MS<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI241465-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). The ORs for each disease, sign, and symptom in this analysis were adjusted for sex and age, as balancing between cases and controls was removed due to exclusion of children and adolescents with neurological or cerebrovascular diagnoses. This analysis was done using separate logistic regression models.

This is of particular importance since better characterization of early symptoms and/or risk factors, comorbid disorders, and possible prodromal features of MS may have considerable implications for early recognition of MS and subsequent progression of the disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> To our knowledge, such a systematic investigation has never been done in pediatric populations. Due to the nationwide coverage of the data included, we were able to include a large sample of children and adolescents with MS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1091), which in turn allowed us to detect associations with small and medium effect sizes. This is of particular importance as pediatric MS is a rare disorder. Furthermore, we used 2 control groups, children and adolescents without MS and those with another autoimmune disorder, JIA. The inclusion of the latter group may have allowed exclusion of associations that could have been attributed to inflammatory processes and thus may not have been due to MS-specific pathophysiological mechanisms.</p><p>In the main analysis, after sex and age adjustments, we found 9 disorders, signs, and symptoms significantly more frequently diagnosed 5 years before a first MS diagnosis than in children and adolescents without MS. These included obesity (<italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> code E66), 1 gastrointestinal disorder (K29), 1 musculoskeletal disorder (M22), 2 disorders of the eye (H52 and H53), and 4 unspecific diagnoses (R00, R14, R20, and R42). Two disorders, obesity and disorders of refraction and accommodation, remained significantly positively associated with MS in the complementary analysis (when children and adolescents with other neurological and cerebrovascular disorders were excluded) and compared with children and adolescents with JIA. The disorder with the highest AOR was disturbances of skin sensation, followed by abnormalities of heartbeat and obesity. The remaining disorders had small effect sizes, with AORs ranging between 1.26 (95% CI, 1.09-1.47) (disorders of refraction and accommodation) and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.22-1.89) (dizziness and giddiness).<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Obesity and, to a lesser extent, overweight in childhood<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and early adulthood<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> are known risk factors for the development of MS. Sex-specific differences in the risk of MS have been observed; extreme obesity before MS was significantly associated with the risk of MS and/or clinically isolated syndrome in girls but not boys.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> There was no association of overweight and moderate obesity with risk of MS in that study, possibly due to the low sample size in that study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;75). More recently, Milles et al<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> observed a positive association between a higher body mass index (BMI) and MS in both females and males. A causal role of obesity in the development of MS was observed in a large-scale mendelian randomization study; the risk of MS increased by 41% for each 1-unit increase in the SD of genetically determined BMI.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Our finding regarding the presumed exposure to obesity before first MS diagnosis is in line with these studies. Of note, children and adolescents with a diagnosis of obesity already present 5 years before first MS diagnosis had a 2-fold higher risk of later being diagnosed with MS than children and adolescents without obesity. There are several pathophysiological explanations for this association.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> First, obesity represents a condition characterized by low-grade inflammation, which may contribute to the development of neuroinflammation.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, several adipokines with both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions have been linked to autoimmune disorders, including MS.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In addition, obesity is associated with a lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, which in turn has been shown to be a risk factor for MS.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>In the main analysis, we found 4 unspecific diagnoses from chapter XVIII [R] of the <italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> classification &#x0201c;symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified&#x0201d;; similar findings have been observed by others.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Diagnoses made from this chapter are usually less defined, can be of unknown etiology, and require additional diagnostic procedures to make a more specific diagnosis. The unspecific nature of these symptoms, signs, and diagnoses may be indicative of possible prodromal features of MS. In fact, the diagnosis disturbances of skin sensation (R20) had the largest effect size in this study (AOR, 12.93; 95% CI, 8.98-18.62). This AOR was double when using children and adolescents with JIA as a control group (AOR, 27.70; 95% CI, 6.52-117.64). These findings are in agreement with findings from other studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> For example, Wijnands et al<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> observed that patients with relapsing-onset MS were more likely to visit dermatologists in the 5 years preceding MS onset than were patients without MS. Other unspecific diagnoses for which findings were significant in the main analysis were abnormalities of heartbeat (R00), dizziness and giddiness (R42), and flatulence and related conditions (R14). Given their low background prevalence (ie, prevalence among controls) and a relatively high AOR for MS, these diagnoses may help to facilitate an early diagnosis of MS. Thus, it would be worthwhile to raise awareness among general practitioners who see pediatric patients years before an initial diagnosis of MS.</p><p>Both cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in patients with MS.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Cardiovascular dysfunction, including orthostatic intolerance, dysfunctions of heart rate and rhythm, and left ventricular dysfunction, may be part of the clinical picture of MS.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In addition, evidence of early gastrointestinal symptoms before initial MS diagnosis exists.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In a retrospective cohort study over 14 years, Almeida et al<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> observed that every third adult patient with MS had gastrointestinal symptoms before their first demyelination event. The most frequent gastrointestinal symptoms or disorders reported were constipation (50%), diarrhea (30%), and irritable bowel syndrome (17%). In that study, the first manifestation of gastrointestinal symptoms was observed at an average 3.7 years before a first demyelination event. Yusuf et al<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> found higher rates of physician visits due to gastritis and duodenitis and diseases of the esophagus in the 5 years before a first demyelinating event or MS onset. We found several diagnoses related to the gastrointestinal system, including gastroenteritis and colitis of infectious and unspecified origin (A09), gastritis and duodenitis (K29), and 2 unspecific diagnoses (abdominal and pelvic pain [R10] and nausea and vomiting [R11]), of which gastritis and duodenitis remained positively associated with MS after controlling for other variables.</p><p>Visual impairment is one of the frequent complaints in patients of all ages with MS.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Every third child with MS has optic neuritis as the initial presenting symptom.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In the main univariable analysis, we found 3 diagnoses positively associated with a later MS diagnosis, of which 2&#x02014;disorders of refraction and accommodation (H52) and visual disturbances (H53)&#x02014;remained significantly associated with later MS diagnosis in the multivariable analysis. The diagnosis code H53 comprises a range of subjective disorders, including amblyopia and subjective visual disturbances, and may indicate the presence of visual impairment. In line with our findings, another German study found higher rates of visual disturbances 5 years before an MS diagnosis (in a cohort of patients without a clinically isolated syndrome).<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To our knowledge, the association of a more specific diagnosis (H52) with a later MS diagnosis has never been observed. However, a study showed that the accommodative ability is diminished in patients with MS compared with healthy individuals.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>Musculoskeletal symptoms belong to the clinical picture of MS, including muscle pain and bone and joint disorders. In addition, a study reported a high prevalence of musculoskeletal comorbidities in patients with MS.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Every seventh patient with a new MS diagnosis had a musculoskeletal disorder in 1 study.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In the univariable analyses, we found 8 diagnoses from the <italic>ICD-10-GM</italic> chapter on musculoskeletal diseases that were significantly associated with MS. Only 1 of them, disorders of patella (M22), was associated with a later MS diagnosis after adjusting the model for all other disorders. Similar findings were observed in other studies; for example, physician and hospital visits due to musculoskeletal disorders were more frequent among patients with MS in the 5 years before MS diagnosis or a first demyelinating event compared with controls.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Of note, children and adolescents with 1 of 3 musculoskeletal diagnoses&#x02014;other joint disorders, other soft-tissue disorders, and biomechanical lesions&#x02014;were less likely to be diagnosed with MS compared with children and adolescents with JIA. These diagnoses may be considered early symptoms and/or prodromal features of JIA.</p><sec id="H2-7-ZOI241465"><title>Limitations</title><p>The following limitations of the study should be considered when interpreting the results. First, we used administrative claims data that were primarily collected for billing purposes. Thus, both disease and exposure misclassification cannot be ruled out. In particular, there may have been an increased probability of the detection of some diseases and symptoms in cases compared with controls due to higher health care utilization among cases before their first MS diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="zoi241465r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241465r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> To minimize the possibility of including children and adolescents with a false-positive MS diagnosis, we applied a conservative case definition (ie, at least 2 confirmed diagnoses in 2 different quarters with at least 1 diagnosis coded by a neurologist). The same approach was applied to define exposures (albeit without confirmation by a neurologist). Second, due to the large study size and the number of the examined variables, some of the observed associations may be false positive. To reduce this possibility, we selected a conservative approach by adjusting for multiple tests. Third, the dataset does not include inpatient data and data for persons insured privately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI241465"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this case-control study, children and adolescents with MS had diverse metabolic, ocular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular symptoms, signs, and diagnoses within 5 years before MS diagnosis. These diagnoses (eg, sensory and ocular disorders) may be considered early symptoms and overlap with known risk factors (eg, obesity). In addition, unspecific diagnoses of unknown nature may be indicative of prodromal features (eg, disturbances of skin sensation, abnormalities of heartbeat, and flatulence). To our knowledge, this is the first study that systematically examined diagnoses made years before an initial MS diagnosis in a pediatric setting. The study used an exploratory approach to identify possible associations, which need to be validated in future studies. The observed associations may be used to generate hypotheses for future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI241465"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi241465r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name><surname>Yan</surname>
