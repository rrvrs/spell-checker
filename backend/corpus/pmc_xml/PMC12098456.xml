During the postharvest processing and storage of walnut, the endocarp often undergoes browning. Browning has become a major obstacle to walnut storage, not only affecting the taste and flavor of walnuts but also reducing their nutritional quality and commercial value. In the present study, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of walnut endocarp browning, analyses of the ultrastructure, physiological characteristics, and transcriptomic and metabolomic data of walnut endocarps at different storage periods were performed. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis showed that many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites (DAMs) were involved in the pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Among them, the expression levels of DEGs related to flavonoid metabolism and antioxidant activity had significant differences during their storage periods. In addition, the expression of stress-related transcription factors AP2/ERF, WRKY, bHLH, HSF, and MYB involved in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway was significantly upregulated during the browning process. This study comprehensively analyzed the causes of walnut endocarp browning, providing insights for studying the molecular mechanism of endocarp browning during storage and processing of walnuts and other fruits.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>walnut</kwd><kwd>endocarps</kwd><kwd>browning</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The nucleolus contains a lot of proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins, especially rich in essential unsaturated fatty acids &#x003c9;-3, &#x003c9;-6, etc., so it is beneficial for human growth and development and disease prevention (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Djuricic and Calder, 2021</xref>). However, the nucleolus is prone to oxidation and rancidity due to its difficulty to store owing to its high unsaturated fatty acid content. As a thin film wrapped outside the nucleolus, the endocarp is rich in polyphenols such as tannins, which can scavenge free radicals and block the extension of oxidation reaction, thus protecting the nutritional components of the nucleolus. Meanwhile, endocarps rich in polyphenols can be used as an important source of natural antioxidants in the food processing industry (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). In addition, endocarp color is the most intuitive quality index for evaluating walnut products. The bright color and complete structure of the endocarp indicates that the nucleolus is fresh and nutrient loss is less (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). However, the inner seed coat of a walnut kernel is prone to browning during postharvest drying or storage and loses its protective effect on the kernel, accelerating oil rancidity and protein oxidative damage. Therefore, browning not only affects the taste and flavor of walnuts but also reduces their nutritional quality and commodity value, which has become a major obstacle to walnut storage.</p><p>Postharvest browning is a physiological disorder of fruit, which is caused by many reasons, such as aging, mechanical damage, environmental stress, and energy shortage (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). It is well known that browning of fruit is divided into enzymatic browning and non-enzymatic browning; the former is considered to be the main cause (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). Phenols are mainly oxidized to brown ketones through the shikimic acid pathway and the phenylalanine pathway, followed by a series of dehydration, polymerization, and finally the formation of dark quinones (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez and Whitaker, 1995</xref>). The theory of regional distribution of substrate phenols and oxidases is one of the most recognized mechanisms of enzymatic browning. When the cell compartmentalization is lost, the substrate phenols will bind to the enzyme to form black substances, which will cause browning (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Queiroz et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Walnut&#x02019;s endocarp is prone to different degrees of browning due to its rich polyphenols. The color after browning depends on the content of polyphenols and the color of metabolites. For example, chlorogenic acid is dark orange, catechin is bright yellow, and juglone is darker (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Luo et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). At present, most of the studies on the browning mechanism of agricultural products and the inhibition of browning focus on the preservation of fresh fruits and vegetables. There are few reports on the mechanism of browning of the inner seed coat during the storage of walnut nuts. Based on this, the walnut variety &#x02018;Qingxiang&#x02019; was used as the experimental material in this study. The ultrastructure observation, physiological index determination, and comprehensive analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics were carried out during storage to reveal the physiological mechanism of browning during storage. It has important theoretical significance for the study of walnut browning regulation and the development of post-harvest treatment and high-quality storage technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Plant material and tissue collection</title><p>Walnuts <italic>Juglans regia</italic> L. cv. Qingxiang with green husk were harvested from a demonstration garden (Chengxian, GPRS: Lo-105.76812; La-33.74787) in Longnan, Gansu Province, China. After harvest, the walnuts were divided into seven groups (each group had three biological replicates with 30 fruits per replicate) after being peeled off. The first group of walnuts was taken out on the day of sampling as the material for 0 days, and the remaining walnuts underwent accelerated storage in an artificial climate box (temperature 25&#x000b0;C, light cycle 16&#x000a0;h during the day, 8&#x000a0;h at night). The samples were taken every 15 days until the 90th day. After each sampling, the shell was peeled off and the nucleolus was taken out. Except for the samples used for appearance and cell ultrastructure analysis, the remaining nucleolus was soaked in distilled water for 40&#x000a0;min to separate the endocarps.

CHS genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were differentially expressed (three upregulated, two downregulated), and the expression levels of CHI, flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), leucocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), and FRH decreased after 15 and 30 days of storage (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">

According to the distance to the origin of the O2PLS model, the relationship between these DEGs and DAMs was studied. The results showed that cytochrome synthesis gene (LOC108993766), WRKY transcription factor (LOC108984580), threonine-protein kinase (LOC108991876), xyloglucan and glycosyltransferase (novel.2317, LOC109013464) in the transcription level were significantly correlated with the expression of metabolites (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

Therefore, the browning has become a major factor affecting the storage of walnut nuts and limiting the shelf life of kernel products (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Villarreal-Lozoya et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). In this study, combined with the results of endocarp color and browning-related indicators, it was not difficult to find that the browning of walnuts was the most serious in the first 15 days of accelerated storage. After 60 days, the browning rate changed slowly, and the browning degree gradually increased throughout the storage period, which was consistent with the research results of Asaad et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Habibie et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). This may be the high water content of nucleolus and the high activity of oxidation-related enzymes in the early stage of storage.</p><p>The content of related substances in phenolic metabolism and the activity of related enzymes significantly affect the occurrence of post-harvest browning of fruits (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cosmulescu et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Walnut endocarps are rich in phenolic substances. On the one hand, phenolic substances have strong antioxidant activity, which can protect the nucleolus from the oxidation of fatty acids and protect the quality of nucleolus. On the other hand, phenolic substances will be used as substrates for enzymatic browning, which will be oxidized under the catalysis of PPO and cause browning (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Burdon et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). In this study, with the increase of browning degree, the total phenolic content showed a downward trend, which was consistent with the fact that the expression of phenolic acids was significantly downregulated at 15 and 30 days of storage compared with CK in metabolomics analysis. In addition, the PPO activity increased significantly in the early stage of storage, indicating that the enzymatic browning of polyphenol oxidation catalyzed by PPO in the first 30 days of storage was the main reason for the browning of walnut inner seed coat and then decreased rapidly after 45 days, which may be the inhibition of PPO activity with the accumulation of enzymatic browning products (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ho et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>SOD, CAT, and POD were very important enzymes in the plant tissue membrane protection system, which are closely related to tissue browning (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ighodaro and Akinloye, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2025</xref>). Among them, SOD as the first barrier of the antioxidant system will first scavenge free radicals and produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and then scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by enzymes such as CAT and APX, thereby reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). In this study, SOD activity increased rapidly in the early stage of storage (15 days), but CAT activity increased slowly, indicating that SOD was the main enzyme to remove reactive oxygen species in the early stage of storage. With the extension of storage time, the activity of SOD increased slowly, and even decreased, while the activity of CAT increased significantly, which may be the serious aging and damage of cells with the extension of storage time, which affected the synthesis of SOD-related proteins (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yan et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). At the same time, a large amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was produced, which enhanced the activity of CAT. POD was widely present in plant tissues and had strong activity. It was a heme-containing oxidoreductase that can scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by cell peroxidation and has an important impact on plant growth and development and stress resistance defense. In this study, POD activity showed a downward trend within 0~45 days of storage and increased after 45 days (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;2</bold>
</xref>, <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">
<bold>4</bold>
</xref>). It may be the fact that POD was mainly used as an oxidase in the early stage of storage and participated in the oxidation function of catalyzing phenols together with PPO. Since POD can catalyze the oxidation of phenolic substances in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, POD-related genes cause tissue browning (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aquino-Bola&#x000f1;os and Mercado-Silva, 2004</xref>). With the extension of storage time, the total phenol content of the oxidation substrate decreased, resulting in a decrease in POD activity. Later, with the deepening of membrane lipid peroxidation, more free radicals and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were produced, and POD was involved in the removal of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, resulting in an increase in its activity. Some other studies showed that the relationship between POD activity and browning is related to plant varieties (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Franck et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the relationship between POD and walnut browning remains to be further studied.</p><p>The cellular membrane system has the great function of maintaining cell homeostasis and ensuring normal metabolism. The cell biofilm structure in the fruit is generally in a dynamic equilibrium state. Once the balance is broken, the cell structure will be destroyed, which will lead to browning (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Scotti-Campos et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Some studies showed that the membrane metabolism disorders cause damage to the membrane structure, which promotes the contact reaction between the substrate and the enzyme to accelerate the browning phenotype (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mayer and Harel, 1979</xref>). It was found that the membrane lipid metabolism of longan fruit was affected after infection with mold, and the activities of some enzymes related to membrane lipid degradation, such as PLD and LOX, were abnormally increased, and the fruit showed a browning phenotype (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). In this study, LOX activity, MDA content, and relative conductivity showed an upward trend with the prolongation of storage time, and LOX activity and MDA content were significantly positively correlated with browning degree (P&#x0003c; 0.05), and relative conductivity was significantly positively correlated with browning degree (P&#x0003c; 0.01). At the same time, the results of transcriptomics analysis showed that DEGs in different storage periods were enriched in reactive oxygen species metabolism, photosynthetic membrane, chloroplast thylakoid membrane, plastid thylakoid membrane, thylakoid membrane, and other functions. The results of metabolomics analysis also showed that compared with CK, the cumulative expression of a large number of free fatty acids was upregulated at 15 and 30 days of storage. In addition, the cell ultrastructure also showed that from 15 days of storage, the cell structure began to change, the vacuole had inclusion exudation, the mitochondria began to disintegrate far away from the cell wall, and the electron density of the cell wall began to decrease. After 30 days, the cell wall began to thicken and the inclusions were severely degraded. After 60 days of storage, the cell wall began to crack. These results indicated that lipid oxidation and differential expression of related genes are one of the important reasons for browning of walnut inner skin during storage.</p><p>Energy is the basis of fruit postharvest metabolism, which is of great significance to maintain normal life metabolism after fruit harvest (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Energy supply plays an important role in controlling fruit senescence and postharvest physiological disorders. As the key enzyme in energy metabolism and regulation of ATP synthesis, ATPase plays an important role in the regulation of fruit browning. The decrease of its activity will cause cell energy loss and browning (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Some scholars believe that energy metabolism plays an important role in maintaining the structure and function of cell membranes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). For example, energy loss can lead to cell membrane repair dysfunction (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Rawyler et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). In recent years, more and more studies showed that intracellular energy is essential for the synthesis of phospholipids and the repair of cell membranes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). ClO2 treatment of longan fruits could enhance the activity of enzymes related to energy metabolism, such as NADH SDH, CCO, SCS, and ATPase, to promote and maintain energy production, thereby improving the overall energy level and reducing browning (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Vichaiya et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). In addition, free radicals have a certain damage effect on Na<sup>+</sup> K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase; when the cell membrane peroxidation is enhanced, the Na<sup>+</sup> K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity will be significantly reduced. The results of this study showed that with the prolongation of storage time, the activity of Na<sup>+</sup> K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase increased first and then decreased. It may be the damage of cell structure caused by membrane lipid peroxidation in the early stage. The body starts the repair mechanism and needs ATP to supply energy. Therefore, the activity of ATPase increases accordingly. With the prolongation of storage time, the accumulation of free radicals produced by enhanced oxidation causes damage to ATPase and leads to a decrease in its activity.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis showed that compared with CK, the expression of transcription factors involved in environmental stress was significantly upregulated at 15 and 30 days of storage, such as AP2/ERF-ERF, WRKY, C2H2, GARP-G2, bHLH, and HSF, indicating that high-temperature stress, senescence, and cell dehydration during storage of walnuts are important factors causing browning (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). Previous study has reported that WRKYs can promote the transcriptional reprogramming during banana peel browning (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). At the same time, the expression of cell wall structural protein gene was also significantly upregulated, which was consistent with the results of cell wall thickening at 30 days of storage in cell ultrastructure observation. In addition, the regulatory factors (MYB) involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism and antioxidant system glutathione transferase genes (GSTF, GSTU) were also significantly expressed, which indicated that the browning of walnut endocarps during storage was related to the metabolism of this propane (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). MYB&#x02013;bHLH&#x02013;WDR protein complexes have been reported to have transcriptional control of flavonoid biosynthesis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). In our study, the differential expression of MYB and bHLH genes (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">

</xref>) suggested that they are involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, the downregulation of PAL and CHI genes correlates with reduced total phenolic content, which associated with epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">

Phenylpropanoids were a class of compounds including tannins, anthocyanins, melanin, and lignin, and many of these compounds are colored and play a role in coloring and antioxidant protection for plants (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Grace and Logan, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Korkina, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Flavonoids can inhibit the production of ROS and play an important role in the response of plants to abiotic stress (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yan et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). The results of metabolomics analysis in this study showed that a total of 241 flavonoids were detected in the walnut endocarps during storage, accounting for a large proportion of the metabolites, and the analysis of differential metabolites showed that compared with CK, the contents of phenols, amino acids and their derivatives, sugars, and other substances decreased, and the contents of free fatty acids, flavonoids, quinones, and other substances increased at 15 and 30 days of storage. At the same time, the results of transcriptome and metabolome combined analysis also showed that differential genes and metabolites were mainly enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
