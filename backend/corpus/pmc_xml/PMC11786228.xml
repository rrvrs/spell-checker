While 125 companies (74%) tracked trends in health benefits costs and 109 (64%) tracked spending on the highest cost cases, only 14 (8%) tracked time employees spent having questions answered, and 12 (7%) tracked how often employees delayed receiving care because of an insurance company&#x02019;s actions.

We argue that in a market-driven or quasi&#x02013;market-driven system, what purchasers measure and prioritize in their decisions about benefits will influence what their vendors emphasize. Simply put, as the quality movement and other management literature have long found, measurement matters for how organizations operate and what people within the organizations prioritize and do.<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>We note that few studies have examined the measures and criteria used in decision-making by the employers that purchase and provide health benefits. We use new survey data to assess the extent to which US employers emphasize financial over nonfinancial criteria in decision-making about health care using these indicators: (1) proportion of measures that internal benefits administrators and external benefits consultants use that are financially oriented; and (2) relative importance of financial vs other considerations in companies&#x02019; choice of third-party administrators.</p><p>We expected to find greater emphasis on financial compared to nonfinancial measures and criteria among employers in their oversight and decision-making about health plans. We further expected that this emphasis would be widely practiced among employers and independent of organizational characteristics and other potential explanatory factors.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-AOI240089"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-AOI240089"><title>Survey Development</title><p>For this survey study, we developed the Employee Healthcare Benefits Survey drawing on previous research<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240089r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and expert input. We followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research (<ext-link xlink:href="https://aapor.org/standards-and-ethics/standard-definitions/" ext-link-type="uri">AAPOR</ext-link>) reporting guideline. The Stanford University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved study procedures on an expedited basis and waived the requirement for written informed consent as participants indicated consent by completing the survey. The final survey included 41 multipart questions capturing information about the respondent and company, assessing companies&#x02019; interactions with health benefits consulting firms and health benefits administrators, and the companies&#x02019; approach to managing employee health benefits. Relevant items included consulting tasks, asked of companies that used a health benefits consultant, criteria for selecting an administrator, asked of companies that use a health benefits administrator, information included in benefits administrators&#x02019; reports, asked of companies that receive an annual report on performance of their health plan, companies&#x02019; tracking of benefits information, excluding companies that were unsure, and what companies did with any health benefits savings, excluding companies that had no savings.

It excluded government-affiliated organizations and was stratified by number of employees (50-99, 100-499, or &#x02265;500). SSRS, a professional research and survey firm,<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> administered the survey in 2 waves: from May 2022 to July 2022 and from November 2022 to April 2023, reaching out to each organization 3 times using multiple modalities and conducting online and phone verification to identify qualified respondents. The responses for some variables reflect a subset of respondents due to the survey&#x02019;s skip logic. Item missingness, unrelated to skip patterns was low, less than 5% for all items.</p></sec><sec id="H2-3-AOI240089"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We report unweighted data to describe sample characteristics.

To investigate companies&#x02019; emphasis on financial concerns over other factors, we examined the difference in financial and nonfinancial composite measures derived from a multipart survey question or questions (see the eAppendix in <xref rid="note-AOI240089-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> for the composition of composites). To identify factors associated with employer priorities about employee health benefits, we considered a set of company characteristics that we thought, before conducting the survey, might be potentially relevant, including company size, risk for health care costs, use of benefits consultant, use of benefits administrator, frequency of requesting employee feedback regarding health benefits, inclusion of employee health and well-being in company&#x02019;s mission statement, having a formal plan for health and well-being, and count of company actions creating a culture of health.</p><p>We computed percentage of respondents who selected each item listed in consulting tasks (question 6), spending/user experience information in the benefits administrator report (questions 11 and 12), health information tracked by the company (question 19), and recipient of savings, if any (question 23), as well as the mean percentage across financial and nonfinancial items within each question, applying weights so that results reflect companies within the US. Similarly, we computed the mean importance score for criteria in selecting a benefits administrator (question 9), for each item individually and for the financial and nonfinancial composites, based on the weighted data. We used paired <italic>t</italic> tests to assess differences in financial vs nonfinancial emphasis in each series probed; we conducted tests on paired differences in proportions for question 6; questions 11 and 12; question 19; and question 23, and on the paired difference in mean importance scores for question 9. We performed weighted and unweighted multivariable linear regression modeling of the differences in proportions or means to identify factors associated with employer emphasis on financial vs nonfinancial aspects of employee health benefits, considering <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05 as statistically significant with 2-sided testing.

When choosing a health benefits administrator to manage its employees&#x02019; health benefits and the day-to-day operations of the health plan on behalf of the organization, companies favored cost criteria (question 9). Based on the weighted sample, the mean (SD) importance for cost factors, including price of administration and pricing of comparable services, was 4.5 (0.6) on a scale of 0 to 5, indicating these cost criteria were extremely important in companies&#x02019; choice of health benefits administrator. The mean (SD) importance for member experience factors, including telephone availability, ease of use of the administrator&#x02019;s website, member satisfaction, quality ratings, ease of locating in-network health care practitioners, and employee health outcomes was 4.0 (0.6), with the difference from financial factors being statistically significant (paired <italic>t</italic> test <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) (eTable 2, question 9, in <xref rid="note-AOI240089-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="H2-5-AOI240089"><title>What Companies and Their Advisors Measure and Track</title><p>Overall, 147 companies (67%) used benefits consulting firms, which are often influential in companies&#x02019; decisions about the design of health plans and which benefits administrators to use (question 5).

Of 37 comparisons, 6 proportions (16%) differed significantly, with differences in proportions no greater than 0.22. The use of a benefits consulting firm was significantly associated with an increased emphasis on financial aspects of employee health benefits, both for the information included in the benefits administrator&#x02019;s report and for benefits information tracked by the company. Specifically, the proportion of financial items was on average 0.22 greater than the proportion of nonfinancial items included in the report (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001), and the proportion of financial items tracked was on average 0.19 greater than the proportion of nonfinancial items tracked (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). In contrast, greater frequency in soliciting employee feedback about their health benefits related to significantly less emphasis on financial matters for both the benefits administrator&#x02019;s report and overall tracking of health information.

</label><p>Based on weighted data. Survey item text follows: question 9, &#x0201c;On a scale of 0 to 5, when 0 means completely unimportant and 5 means extremely important, how important are the criteria in your company&#x02019;s choice of health benefits administrator?&#x0201d;; question 6, &#x0201c;Which of the following, if any, does the health benefits consulting firm do for you?&#x0201d;; questions 11/12 (for companies receiving an annual report on the performance of their health plan from their health benefits administrator), &#x0201c;Which, if any, of the following spending/user experience information is included in the report?&#x0201d;; question 19, &#x0201c;Does your company, or your health benefits administrator on behalf of your company, track (in a deidentified way) any of the following?&#x0201d;; and question 23, &#x0201c;What does your company do with savings, if any, on health benefits?&#x0201d; For the full description of survey responses and composition of composites, see Figures 1-3 and refer to eAppendix in Supplement 1 section.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The analysis provided no evidence of any associations with self-insurance; reference to employee health and well-being in the company&#x02019;s mission statement or business objectives; having a formal, written, strategic plan for health and well-being that covers at least 2 of the 4 domains of health (employee, environment, consumer, community); or actions to promote a culture of health (ie, having a wellness program, offering monetary rewards for healthy lifestyles, and undertaking initiatives, such as housing, financial, or tuition assistance to increase employee access to services promoting health and well-being). The analysis also did not reveal any factors significantly associated with financial vs nonfinancial criteria in choosing a benefits administrator (question 9), tasks performed by a consulting firm (question 6), or recipient of any savings (question 23).</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-4-AOI240089"><title>Discussion</title><p>In a nationally representative survey of employers providing health benefits, we showed that financial and monetary indicators received the overwhelming focus of measurement, benefits consulting firms also overwhelmingly focus on financial measures, and financial indicators are emphasized most strongly in decision-making about which health benefits administrators to use. This emphasis on the financial aspects of health plans is heightened among companies that use a benefits consulting firm but otherwise is not affected by factors that might plausibly influence the extent of financial emphasis, such as size (number of employees) or whether employers regard promoting health and well-being as part of their mission. Companies that more frequently seek employee feedback about their health benefits experience paid less attention to financial factors. The frequency of seeking employee feedback probably assesses an employer&#x02019;s emphasis on the employee experience which, naturally, would cause employers to pay attention to the dimensions of that experience.</p><p>Financial measures and criteria dominate the oversight and decisions about health plans, while there is relative neglect of other indicators of health plan performance, such as the member experience, time spent negotiating with health benefits administrators, and overall employee behavioral and physical health. That this emphasis is largely independent of many explanatory factors indicates that employers&#x02019; emphasis on financial over nonfinancial aspects of health care has become truly institutionalized, that is, structures and rules have become widely accepted, reasonably stable over time, and largely independent of efficiency or other technical considerations.<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Emphasis on financial indicators of performance has become taken for granted and widely adopted without much consideration of anything other than &#x0201c;that is what employers do.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>We note that such emphasis on the financial dimensions of health plans is not inevitable; decisions about which administrators to use and what to measure could include not only financial criteria but also important nonfinancial criteria such as member experience and access to care. Research has demonstrated that employee problems in interacting with benefits administrators about claims and authorizations are pervasive,<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> absorb an economically significant amount of time, and that administrative burden adversely affects employee engagement and job satisfaction.<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Difficulties in accessing care because of cost, even for insured employees, has been a focus of both Gallup<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and KFF<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> reports because of the empirical research relating access to care to health outcomes and because a significant fraction of the US population delays obtaining some form of care (physician visits and prescriptions).</p><sec id="H2-7-AOI240089"><title>Limitations</title><p>The results of this study were gleaned from a cross-sectional survey, so we cannot claim causality. We also obtained a relatively low response rate leaving room for selection bias; we used recommended techniques for increasing response, and our response rate of more than 20% is not unusual for surveys of this type.<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Respondents did not differ from nonrespondents on known characteristics. We necessarily asked questions about a finite number of measures; we do not know if employers are measuring other things not queried in our survey. We also asked more questions about nonfinancial than financial measures; research suggests this would result in bias toward nonfinancial measures if counted.<sup><xref rid="aoi240089r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We sought to provide comparability by contrasting proportions of financial measures to proportions of nonfinancial measures; however, this approach results in higher proportions for constructs with fewer available options and thus may bias results toward financial measures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI240089"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data we present in this survey study likely reflect the taken-for-granted emphasis by employers on financial measures of health plan performance, to the neglect of other ways of assessing health plans. What we found may indicate the institutionalization of the prioritization of financial criteria in benefits administration. Because measures matter, employers&#x02019; emphasis on financial aspects may contribute to the problems observed in health benefits administration and health plan performance.</p><p>Health benefits plans exhibit numerous problems, ranging from employee dissatisfaction to problematic access to health care. As measurement is important in focusing attention and efforts, employers could and should act to incorporate a much broader and more comprehensive set of measures assessing how health plans operate. By expanding what they manage and measure beyond costs, employers might help expand attention to other dimensions of health plan performance implicating employee health and well-being.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-AOI240089"><title>References</title><ref id="aoi240089r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name><surname>O&#x02019;Reilly</surname>
