Its subtypes&#x02014;predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined&#x02014;vary in symptom presentation and impact on daily functioning. Understanding these subtypes is crucial for tailored interventions and support.</p></sec><sec id="sec1405"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our aim is to clinically characterize the psychopathological aspects of the subtypes of ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="sec1406"><title>Methods</title><p>Our study is conducted on patients (&#x0003e;18 years) referred to the adult ADHD outpatient service of the Psychiatric Clinic of Ancona (Universit&#x000e0; Politecnica delle Marche, Italy). The Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA 5.0) was used for diagnosing ADHD. The following rating scale were administered: Temperament Evaluation in Memphis, Pisa and San Diego (TEMPS-M), and Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R).</p></sec><sec id="sec1407"><title>Results</title><p>76% (n=170) of all screened patients were diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood. 57.6% (n=98) were diagnosed with ADHD combined subtype, 35.3% (n=60) with ADHD inattentive subtype, and 7.1% (n=12) with ADHD hyperactive subtype. Only 12.9% (n=22) were diagnosed with ADHD in childhood. Based on the results obtained at TEMPS-M, 43.8% (n=32) of patients were found to have cyclothymic temperament. Subjects with ADHD combined subtype scored significantly higher mean on the irritable temperament subscale of the TEMPS-M than those with ADHD inattentive subtype (p=0.016), while patients with ADHD inattentive subtype had a significantly higher mean score on the disorderliness subscale of the TCI-R than those with ADHD hyperactive and combined subtype (p=0.010). Given the logistic regression analyses using the TCI-R, developing an inattentive type of ADHD is negatively predicted by the disorderliness subscale of the TCI-R (exp(B)=0.788, IC95%=0.669-0.929, p=0.005) and positively predicted by the extravagance subscale of the TCI-R (exp(B)=1.104, IC95%=1.009-1.208, p=0.031), the hyperactive subtype of ADHD is negatively predicted by the fatigability subscale of the TCI-R (exp(B)=0.775, IC95%=0.597-1.005, p=0.055) and the combined subtype that is positively predicted by the disorderliness subscale of the TCI-R (exp(B)=1.140, IC95%=1.011-1.287, p=0.033). Regarding temperament, through a logistic regression analysis, the inattentive subtype of ADHD is negatively predicted by the irritable temperament subscale of the TEMPS-M (exp(B)=0.904, IC95%=8.39-0.974, p=0.008), while for the combined subtype of ADHD it is positively predicted by the irritable temperament subscale of the TEMPS-M (exp(B)=1.088, IC95%=1.014-1.167, p=0.019).</p></sec><sec id="sec1408"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results show that irritable temperament is a predictor for the inattentive and combined subtype, but with different polarities. In addition, how different patterns of personality are specific to the various subtypes of ADHD are highlighted.</p></sec><sec id="sec1409"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
