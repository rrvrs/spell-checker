Recently, the incorporation of genomic and transcriptomic approaches into this framework has led to the identification of hundreds of genes associated with different aging patterns. However, our understanding of the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these aging patterns remains limited. Here, we incorporated extensive metabolomic profiling into this framework to generate mechanistic insights into aging patterns in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Specifically, we characterized metabolomic change over adult lifespan in populations of <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> where selection for early reproduction has led to an accelerated aging phenotype relative to their controls. Using these data, we (i) evaluated evolutionary repeatability across the metabolome; (ii) assessed the value of the metabolome as a predictor of &#x0201c;biological age&#x0201d; in this system; and (iii) identified specific metabolites associated with accelerated aging. Generally, our findings suggest that selection for early reproduction resulted in highly repeatable alterations to the metabolome and the metabolome itself is a reliable predictor of &#x0201c;biological age&#x0201d;. Specifically, we find clusters of metabolites that are associated with the different rates of senescence observed between our accelerated aging population and their controls, adding new insights into the metabolites that may be driving the accelerated aging phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>metabolomic</kwd><kwd>clock</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source>

As predicted by the evolutionary theory of aging, selection for early reproduction reliably produces populations enriched for individuals that develop quickly and die young, whereas selection for postponed reproduction has the opposite effect (<xref rid="evaf082-B39" ref-type="bibr">Luckinbill et al. 1984</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B51" ref-type="bibr">Rose 1984</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chippindale et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B50" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al. 2010</xref>). Studying these populations has in turn generated many novel insights into the physiological tradeoffs associated with different rates of senescence. For instance, while populations selected for early reproduction develop quickly and have high early life fecundity, they also exhibit reductions in egg viability (<xref rid="evaf082-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chippindale et al. 1997</xref>), stress resistance (<xref rid="evaf082-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kezos et al. 2023</xref>), lifetime fecundity, and lifespan (<xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>). The goal of the current project is to build on this work to better understand the molecular underpinnings of this &#x0201c;accelerated aging&#x0201d; phenotype.</p><p>Over the past decade, the combination of experimental evolution and next-generation sequencing technologies has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the genetics of complex traits. Major findings from studies that analyze quantitative traits, such as longevity, stress resistance, and body size, have consistently shown that the underlying genetic architecture is complex, often involving hundreds of genes (e.g. <xref rid="evaf082-B9" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B56" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B55" ref-type="bibr">Tobler et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B17" ref-type="bibr">Fabian et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barter et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B30" ref-type="bibr">Kezos et al. 2019</xref>). Studies have also found that many of these traits may involve genes with significant pleiotropic interactions (<xref rid="evaf082-B20" ref-type="bibr">Greenspan et al. 2024</xref>), and suggest that genetic redundancy is a common feature of complex trait genetic architecture (<xref rid="evaf082-B21" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barghi et al. 2019</xref>). Because of this inherent complexity, direct insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying trait variation have been modest. With respect to aging and longevity, functional conclusions are largely limited to enrichment for gene ontology terms broadly related to neurological development, immune function, and metabolism (<xref rid="evaf082-B10" ref-type="bibr">Carnes et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B17" ref-type="bibr">Fabian et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barter et al. 2019</xref>). In an effort to move beyond the finding that complex traits are highly polygenic, some have turned to metabolomics as a path forward (e.g. <xref rid="evaf082-B44" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B11" ref-type="bibr">Cavigliasso et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p>Metabolomics involves the profiling of metabolites, molecules &#x0003c;2,000&#x02005;Da, collectively referred to as the metabolome. Because metabolites constitute the functional and energetic building blocks of all life, metabolomics provides a potential link between genotype and phenotype (<xref rid="evaf082-B23" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al. 2020</xref>). Among the -omic layers of systems biology (e.g. transcriptome, proteome, etc.), the metabolome is thought to closely reflect organismal phenotypes (<xref rid="evaf082-B15" ref-type="bibr">Dettmer et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2014</xref>). While genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic signals can be complicated by epigenetic and posttranslational modifications, it is thought that the downstream positionality of the metabolome provides a marker more representative of the observed phenotype (<xref rid="evaf082-B43" ref-type="bibr">Patti et al. 2012</xref>). The metabolome of flies is highly dynamic with age and is sensitive to effects on longevity from environmental conditions, genetic variation, and pharmacological interventions (<xref rid="evaf082-B2" ref-type="bibr">Avanesov et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B37" ref-type="bibr">Laye et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B27" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B44" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2022</xref>). In light of this, recent efforts have been made to include metabolomic phenotyping in the evolutionary biology framework (<xref rid="evaf082-B22" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B44" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B16" ref-type="bibr">Erkosar et al. 2024</xref>).</p><p>With respect to characterizing age-sensitive effects, <xref rid="evaf082-B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2022)</xref> recently used metabolomic data to build a multivariate age prediction model colloquially referred to as a &#x0201c;metabolomic clock&#x0201d;. As with other -omic clocks such as epigenetic clocks, the age prediction is not fully accurate (<xref rid="evaf082-B42" ref-type="bibr">Parrott and Bertucci 2019</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rutledge et al. 2022</xref>). Indeed, the deviation of the age prediction from the fly metabolome clock from the chronological age of the sampled flies, the flies so-called age acceleration, correlated with the mortality rate and the remaining life expectancy of isogenic flies (<xref rid="evaf082-B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2022</xref>). That is, fly strains whose predicted age was younger than their chronological age tended to live longer than flies whose predicted age was greater than their chronological age. Thus, the metabolome clock connects patterns of age in the metabolome to the rise in mortality risk that defines biological aging. Using clock models could provide insight into the molecules associated with the relative pace of chronological and biological age, where the former is simply a measure of the passing of time, and the latter is a relative measure of senescence (<xref rid="evaf082-B28" ref-type="bibr">Jylh&#x000e4;v&#x000e4; et al. 2017</xref>). In an experimental evolution context, such clock models could allow us to test hypotheses about the aging patterns that result from selection on life history (<xref rid="evaf082-B42" ref-type="bibr">Parrott and Bertucci 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we applied metabolomic analysis to a set of ten replicate fruit fly populations where hundreds of generations of selection for early reproduction (<xref rid="evaf082-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) has led to enrichment for an accelerated aging phenotype where flies develop quickly and die young relative to controls. This accelerated aging phenotype presents a disconnect between chronological and biological age when compared with the ancestral population. Previous work in this system has consistently demonstrated the evolutionary repeatability of this accelerated aging signal with high levels of genomic (<xref rid="evaf082-B19" ref-type="bibr">Graves et al. 2017</xref>), transcriptomic, (<xref rid="evaf082-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barter et al. 2019</xref>), and phenotypic convergence (<xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kezos et al. 2023</xref>) between newly derived and long-standing populations subjected to the same selection regime. This rapid convergence has been attributed to the hypothesis that adaptation in these populations is primarily fueled by shifts in common genetic variants present in the ancestral population from which this system was derived.</p><fig position="float" id="evaf082-F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Recent phylogeny and selection regimes for <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> populations of interest. a) Abbreviated diagram of the evolutionary relationship between the populations of interest.

(2022)</xref>, we compared metabolomic differentiation patterns between samples of 21-d-old flies (age from egg) from the accelerated aging (A-type) populations and their controls (C-type) and found evidence of altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, carbohydrate metabolism, and neurological function in the A-type populations. Because age-specific mortality rates are known to greatly diverge between the fly populations by day 21, we concluded that the observed differences in metabolic activity were a potential driver of the aging and longevity differences observed between the selection regimes. One possibility is that these differences were due to metabolic remodeling, similar to the differences between reproductive and nonreproductive flies (<xref rid="evaf082-B32" ref-type="bibr">Koliada et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B48" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues et al. 2023</xref>). Such remodeling in the A-type populations could meet energetic and nutritional demands associated with fast development and early reproduction and come at the expense of somatic maintenance. However, our ability to make a definitive statement was limited as <xref rid="evaf082-B44" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. (2022)</xref> included only a single age class and did not establish if this metabolomic difference reflected a difference in biological aging. In the present study, we seek to remedy this shortcoming and derive even deeper mechanistic insights by testing for accelerated biological age and characterizing how metabolomic profiles change over time in the A- and C-type regimes by sampling at multiple age classes (<xref rid="evaf082-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="evaf082-F2" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Age-specific mortality and metabolomic sampling design.

If true, we predicted that (i) metabolomic profiles should rapidly converge for populations subjected to the same selective pressures, (ii) a metabolomic clock should not only capture signals of chronological age but also reflect differences in biological age associated with the response to different selective pressures, and (iii) characterization of metabolite abundance over time should reveal specific metabolites associated with the accelerated aging phenotype in flies under the A-type selection regime, potentially providing mechanistic insights.</p><p>To test these predictions and further explore the data, we had three primary objectives:</p><p>Objective 1: To test our first predictions, we compared the metabolomes of long-standing and recently derived populations subjected to the same selection regime to evaluate levels of metabolomic convergence between them. If the known life-history tradeoffs that characterize the response to this selection in this system have a clear signal in the metabolome, newly derived and long-standing populations should show a high degree of metabolomic convergence within each respective regime.</p><p>Objective 2: To test our second prediction, we created separate metabolomic clocks using data from A- or C-type regimes. As with previous studies, we expect that these models will capture signals associated with age. In other studies, the deviation of the clock's prediction from the chronological age of the sampled flies reflected mortality risk within the studied population. In this setting however, we use such age acceleration to test our hypothesis about the relative biological ages of flies from these two regimes. We expect that, relative to the metabolome of the C-type populations, the A-type population metabolome will appear &#x0201c;older&#x0201d;. Similarly, we predict that a clock model based on the metabolome of the A-type populations will predict younger biological age for the metabolome of the C-type populations.</p><p>Objective 3: To test our third prediction, we assessed the similarity of the metabolome of all samples by hierarchical clustering. We expect that an accelerated aging phenotype will be represented in the metabolome via the presence of clusters of metabolites whose abundance shows greater similarity between the old C-type and the younger A-type populations. We then use these clustered metabolites to generate insights into the metabolic mechanisms underlying the accelerated aging phenotype observed in flies from the A-type regime.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="evaf082-s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="evaf082-s2.1"><title>Metabolomic Profiling</title><p>Targeted metabolomic profiling included a panel of 361 target metabolites, 210 of which were detected during LC-MS profiling, with 202 including values for all samples (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material</xref> online for full details).

The 9-d-old samples from A-type populations clustered separately from all other samples along both PC axes, showing a greater degree of differentiation for these samples than the rest. This striking difference in the metabolomic profile of the 9-d-old samples is likely due to the residual effects of recent eclosion (&#x0003c;24&#x02005;h), which can have large, short-term impacts on energy reserves (<xref rid="evaf082-B16" ref-type="bibr">Erkosar et al. 2024</xref>).

id="evaf082-s3.1"><title>Objective 1: Metabolomic Convergence Within Selection Regime</title><p>Adaptation in response to selection on reproductive timing in this system is associated with a number of physiological and developmental tradeoffs with complex genetic underpinnings. Because the metabolome constitutes the functional building blocks, and energetic currency of cells, we hypothesize that the physiological tradeoffs associated with the accelerated aging phenotype of A-type flies would be reflected in the abundances of metabolites. Alternatively, the metabolome could be associated with a wide variety of traits, only some of which are involved in the accelerated development or reduced longevity that evolve under these regimes. If our hypothesis is true, then we expect that populations under the same selection regime will show evidence of convergence within the metabolome, even in more recently selected populations. To test this prediction, we compared the metabolomes of populations from recently derived and long-standing histories under the same selection regime. We found that the metabolomes of recently derived and long-standing populations did not differ within either the A- and C-type selection regimes. This was evident by both a lack of metabolomic divergence between long-standing and more recent selection within each regime, and by the high accuracy of multivariate model predictions, regardless of the number of generations under selection. These results are consistent with metabolomic convergence within selection regimes and indicate that the metabolome is a reproducible biomarker of the underlying physiological responses to selection.</p></sec><sec id="evaf082-s3.2"><title>Objective 2: Metabolomic Clocks and the Effect of Selection Regime</title><p>The dynamics of the metabolome over the lifespan of the fly have been used to connect advancing chronological age to the rise in mortality risk that defines biological aging (<xref rid="evaf082-B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2022</xref>). Multivariate age prediction models (clocks), particularly epigenetic clocks, have been used to predict age across species (<xref rid="evaf082-B38" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al. 2023</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B41" ref-type="bibr">Meyer and Schumacher 2024</xref>). The use of clock models to understand the evolutionary process however is just beginning (<xref rid="evaf082-B42" ref-type="bibr">Parrott and Bertucci 2019</xref>). Here, we apply clock models of the metabolome to test our hypothesis that the rapid response to selection for early life reproduction is associated with the same underlying aging processes that are reflected in the metabolome. If true, the response to selection seen in the metabolome likely reflects shifts in physiological processes that are a part of normal aging in the ancestral population. If the rapid and repeatable shifts in allele frequency (<xref rid="evaf082-B19" ref-type="bibr">Graves et al. 2017</xref>), and both transcriptomic (<xref rid="evaf082-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barter et al. 2019</xref>) and phenotypic (<xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kezos et al. 2023</xref>) convergence are an indication of selection acting on common physiological mechanisms, then the components of the metabolome most closely tied to aging physiology should respond similarly. A critical prediction of our hypothesis is that the relative biological age of flies under the A-type selection regime should appear &#x0201c;older&#x0201d; than flies under the C-type selection regime.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first trained age prediction models <italic toggle="yes">within</italic> each regime, resulting in an A-type clock and a C-type clock. Both clocks captured the monotonic increase in chronological age within each respective population, with accuracy <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> exceeding &#x0003e;0.77 (<xref rid="evaf082-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In between-regime predictions, the C-type clock detected a chronological age increase for the A-type flies over time, however these age predictions were overestimated across all ages. Additionally, the C-type clock predicted an increase in the rate of aging of A-type flies relative to the predicted aging rate of flies from the C-type regime (<xref rid="evaf082-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). From a metabolomic perspective, the C-type flies &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; the A-type flies as both older and aging more quickly, presenting a metabolomic signal of accelerated biological aging in flies under the A-type selection regime.</p><p>Between-regime predictions using the A-type clock detected a chronological age increase for the C-type flies over time, however this prediction was underestimated across all ages. Additionally, the A-type clock predicted a decrease in the rate of aging of C-type flies relative to the predicted aging rate of flies from the A-type regime (<xref rid="evaf082-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). From a metabolomic perspective, the A-type flies &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; the C-type flies as both younger and aging more slowly, presenting a metabolomic signal of slower biological aging in flies under the C-type selection regime.</p><p>Taken together, the differences in age predictions made by the within-regime clocks show that the metabolome is capturing a biological signal that is indicative of chronological age, while the between-regime clocks show that the metabolome is also able to capture a signal indicative of the differences in biological age and aging observed at other phenotypic levels (e.g. <xref rid="evaf082-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chippindale et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kezos et al. 2023</xref>). The A-type clock suggests an age-deceleration effect when applied to the metabolome of the longer-lived C-type populations and the C-type clock suggests an age acceleration effect when applied to the shorter-lived A-type populations. Indeed, even the effects on the slopes are remarkably similar between the two between-regime models, both featuring a difference in a 50% difference in slopes. This further suggests both consistency and reliability in the metabolome for the process of aging even across populations with different lifespans.</p><p>The A-type clock achieved an accuracy of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.77 when predicting age in the A-type, while utilizing only 30.7% of 202 metabolites, and the C-type clock utilized only 11.4% to achieve even higher accuracy <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.87. Independently fit to two different data, the C-type and A-type clocks utilized predominantly nonintersecting metabolites, however they both included four intersecting metabolites (<xref rid="evaf082-F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material</xref> online). While this number of intersecting metabolites is not more than expected by chance, the coefficients fit to these metabolites in both clocks were highly correlated, indicating a common axis of variation with age in the metabolome.</p><p>It is important to note that, while the metabolites identified by the clock models shed light on the underlying metabolome variation related to age and to aging, elastic net and other regularized regression methods are designed in part to reduce the influence of co-linear predictors (<xref rid="evaf082-B59" ref-type="bibr">Zou and Hastie 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bujak et al. 2016</xref>). Because of this, the set of metabolites most influential in clock models may not include metabolites that share very similar age-related variation in abundance and so do not give a complete picture of age-associated metabolome variation in which collinearity is common (<xref rid="evaf082-B2" ref-type="bibr">Avanesov et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B36" ref-type="bibr">Lassen et al. 2023</xref>). In this light, we turn to a descriptive analysis of the metabolome variation and its convergence within regime to describe the patterns of variation under these selection regimes.</p></sec><sec id="evaf082-s3.3"><title>Objective 3: Characterizing Metabolite Abundance Patterns</title><p>Before we delve deeper into pathway analysis, we must first address the overall patterns of relative metabolite abundances across age and between populations under our two selection regimes. When evaluating the results of the linear mixed-effects models, it is important to take special note of the influence from the age &#x000d7; regime interaction term, as it helps to establish a perspective for subsequent analysis. Based on the results from the PCA (<xref rid="evaf082-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and the clock model predictions (<xref rid="evaf082-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), we see evidence of a large effect from the selection regime on the metabolome, as predicted age, and rate of aging differ by regime. As such, this led us to expect to see this reflected in the LMM results as a high number of metabolites that are significant for the age &#x000d7; regime interaction term, where many metabolites are contributing the accelerated aging phenotype of the A-type populations. However, we were surprised to find the opposite to be true, where relatively few metabolites were significant for the age &#x000d7; regime interaction term (14% of total metabolites) compared with the selection and age terms (55% each), suggesting that only a handful of metabolites may be driving the accelerated aging phenotype. With this in mind, we move forward with hierarchical clustering of metabolite abundance and pathway analysis to derive further insight into how small clusters of metabolites might drive these broader aging phenotypes.</p><p>To discuss the implications of the differences in metabolite abundance between selection regimes and across age, we must make assumptions about how metabolite abundances relate to the activity of specific metabolic pathways. For example, we could assume that an increased abundance of a metabolite indicates increased activity of the pathway that produces it. However, as metabolites are often involved in multiple pathways&#x02014;both as substrate and product&#x02014;reality is likely more complex. Other factors like differences in age-specific feeding rates can also impact abundances in ways that confound the interpretation of abundances. We attempt to overcome this, in part, through the use of higher-level analyses such as hierarchical clustering and enrichment analysis instead of making direct interpretations of individual metabolite abundances. As such, we primarily see the following work as hypothesis generating for future studies (e.g. flux assays to test hypotheses about metabolite utilization and pathway activity).</p><p>The metabolite abundance patterns driving the clusters depicted in <xref rid="evaf082-F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> are consistent with the prediction that the older C-type (70-d-old) and younger A-type (21, 28, and 35-d-old) flies would share similar patterns of abundance, revealing a metabolomic phenotype indicative of advanced or accelerated biological age (what we will refer to as the &#x0201c;aged phenotype&#x0201d;). This similarity in the metabolomes of old C-type and younger A-type flies is consistent with a broad array of age-related phenotypes shared by these two groups of flies, including high mortality rates (<xref rid="evaf082-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), as well as reduced egg viability (<xref rid="evaf082-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chippindale et al. 1997</xref>), stress resistance (<xref rid="evaf082-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kezos et al. 2023</xref>), and lifetime fecundity (<xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>). These clusters represent two distinct patterns that may help shed light on the mechanisms underlying the accelerated aging phenotype of flies under the A-type selection regime.</p><p>The first pattern, exhibited in clusters 9, 2, and 22 (<xref rid="evaf082-F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a, c, and d</xref>, respectively), includes metabolites with a lower abundance in flies with the aged phenotype, suggesting that pathways associated with these metabolites may be utilized less in these biologically older flies. Clusters 2 and 22 both show enrichment for several pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism, most notably the decrease in metabolites enriching the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway in cluster 22 (<xref rid="evaf082-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This decreased abundance of metabolites involved in carbohydrate metabolism suggests a potential switch in metabolic substrates away from carbohydrates that are associated with the aged phenotype (<xref rid="evaf082-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2022</xref>). Along with the decrease in carbohydrate metabolism, we also see a decreased abundance of metabolites associated with protein synthesis enriched in cluster 9, such as enrichment for aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and the valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway. The pattern of metabolite abundance in clusters 10 and 6 (<xref rid="evaf082-F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b and e</xref>, respectively) includes metabolites with increased abundance in flies with the aged phenotype suggesting that pathways associated with these clusters may be utilized more in these biologically older flies. The top pathways enriched for these clusters include both phenylalanine and nitrogen metabolism (clusters 10 and 6, respectively; <xref rid="evaf082-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), both of which are employed in circumstances with low carbohydrate utilization (<xref rid="evaf082-B24" ref-type="bibr">Heinrichsen et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B33" ref-type="bibr">Kosakamoto et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p>In considering the decrease in metabolite abundances associated with glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and protein synthesis pathways, alongside the increase in metabolite abundances associated with nitrogen metabolism pathways, we propose that this is evidence of a shift away from carbohydrate metabolism toward amino acid metabolism in flies with the aged phenotype. This pattern of age-related energy substrate use has been previously reported in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic>, where <xref rid="evaf082-B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2022)</xref> reported a decrease in carbohydrate use and an emphasis on serine and purine metabolism in aged flies. Additionally, <xref rid="evaf082-B44" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. (2022)</xref> reported a reduction in both amino acid and carbohydrate abundances in 21-d-old A-type flies relative to C-type flies. Thus, the apparent shift we see reflected over the time course measured here could explain the initial observations of <xref rid="evaf082-B44" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. (2022)</xref>. While more work is needed to directly test for such a substrate switch, it seems likely that the earlier age of onset of this metabolomic change in A-types is driven by selection for early reproduction. The accelerated development and heightened acute fecundity in flies from the A-type selection regime (<xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>) may be driving an antagonistic pleiotropic effect, where selection for carbohydrate utilization strategies that support rapid development and oviposition comes at the cost of an earlier shift away from this metabolic pathway, typically only seen in much older individuals, potentially contributing to the accelerated aging phenotype (<xref rid="evaf082-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="evaf082-s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="evaf082-s4.1"><title>Experimental Populations</title><p>All 20 <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> populations used in this study share a common origin, traced back to the large and outbred <xref rid="evaf082-B26" ref-type="bibr">Ives (1970)</xref> population. Numerous populations have been derived from this wild-bred lineage, first by Michael Rose and Brian Charlesworth (<xref rid="evaf082-B12" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 1980</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B49" ref-type="bibr">Rose and Charlesworth 1980</xref>, <xref rid="evaf082-B52" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B51" ref-type="bibr">Rose 1984</xref>) and then by generations of the Rose Lab (e.g. <xref rid="evaf082-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chippindale et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>), to study the evolutionary theory of aging. All populations in this system are maintained at census sizes of &#x0223c;2,000 individuals in an attempt to keep them outbred. Based on past genomic studies, we know that there is abundant genetic variation in all populations even after many hundreds of generations of evolution (e.g. <xref rid="evaf082-B45" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B19" ref-type="bibr">Graves et al. 2017</xref>). Here, we focused on the A-type populations and their controls, the C-type populations (<xref rid="evaf082-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). A-type populations were maintained on a 10-d generation cycle, whereas the C-type populations were maintained on a 28-d cycle. As a result of this difference, the A-type populations exhibit accelerated development, reduced longevity, higher early life fecundity, and lower stress tolerances than the C-type populations (<xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kezos et al. 2023</xref>). There are two selection histories within the A- and C-type populations, ACO/AO and CO/nCO, respectively (see <xref rid="evaf082-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Each history is distinguished by the number of generations they have been under selection, with AO and nCO having been derived more recently than ACO and CO to test questions about evolutionary repeatability (see <xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="evaf082-B19" ref-type="bibr">Graves et al. 2017</xref>). We know that populations from these selection histories that share the same selection regime have converged at several phenotypic levels and recent studies have treated them as replicates within each regime (A or C), based on phenotypic (<xref rid="evaf082-B8" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al. 2016</xref>), genomic (<xref rid="evaf082-B19" ref-type="bibr">Graves et al. 2017</xref>), and transcriptomic (<xref rid="evaf082-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barter et al. 2019</xref>) studies. At the time of sampling for this project, the ACO and AO populations had &#x0223c;1,000 and &#x0223c;490 generations under selection, respectively, whereas the CO and nCO populations had &#x0223c;415 and &#x0223c;160 generations, respectively.

Prior to measurement, all of the experimental populations were maintained on a 14-day culture cycle for two generations, staggered a day apart, to align the different treatments to a shared calendar and reduce the impact of gene-by-environment interaction.

A cage-cohort of &#x0223c;1,500 flies was generated from each of the five replicate populations for ACO, AO, CO, and nCO and maintained on a 14-day culture cycle for two generations, staggered a day apart to mitigate the impact of gene-by-environment interactions. Cohorts were maintained in a Plexiglas cage and were fed fresh banana-molasses based media each day with yeast solution to induce oviposition. Concurrent to the mortality experiment, the five replicate cage-cohorts for each selection history were sampled for metabolomic extraction at multiple timepoints (9&#x02005;d for A-type populations, 21, 28, and 35&#x02005;d for all populations, and 70&#x02005;d for C-type populations).

In order to facilitate the large sample sizes and sampling timepoints needed, as well as to reduce the potential noise caused by using both sexes within pooled samples, we focused on females in our sampling effort. Each sample consisted of a pool of &#x0223c;50 female flies that were randomly drawn from each population per timepoint. An equivalent number of males were removed from populations for each sample to maintain population sex ratios. While metabolomic characterization can be done with far fewer than 50 flies, the populations featured in this study are outbred and still harbor a great deal of genetic variation (see <xref rid="evaf082-B19" ref-type="bibr">Graves et al. 2017</xref>). Using pool sizes of &#x0223c;50 flies was an attempt to capture and represent this variation. The pooled samples were immediately dry frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C prior to metabolite extraction.
