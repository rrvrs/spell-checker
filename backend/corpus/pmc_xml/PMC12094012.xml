The authors of the study aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLPSGLT serum in improving facial skin quality in patients undergoing GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 therapy. In this split-face, double-blind pilot study, 7 female patients (median age 55) on stable GLP-1 RA/SGLT-2 therapy applied GLPSGLT serum to one side of the face and placebo to the other, twice daily for 6 weeks. Assessments at baseline, Day 21, and Day 42 included the Global Ranking Scale (GRS), standardized photography reviewed by a blinded physician, and a 26-item patient-satisfaction questionnaire. Treated sides showed statistically significant improvements across all 13 GRS domains vs placebo (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001), particularly in hydration, surface roughness, pigmentation, vasculature, visible pores, and static wrinkles. The blinded reviewer correctly identified the treated side in all cases. Patients reported greater satisfaction with skin texture, firmness, radiance, and hydration. No adverse events were reported. GLPSGLT serum significantly improved skin quality in GLP-1 RA/SGLT-2-treated patients and was well-tolerated, warranting further investigation in larger, histologically assessed cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s1"><title>Level of Evidence: 4 (Therapeutic)</title><p>

Although the safety profile of GLP-1 RAs is favorable, the drugs do have side effects recognized in the medical literature, including gastrointestinal distress, pancreatic concerns, cardiovascular effects, and injection-site reactions.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Some investigators are beginning to look at the effects of GLP-1 RA on adipose and skeletal muscle, whereas we theorize a major source of pathology for what we refer to as &#x0201c;GLP Face&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;GLP Skin&#x0201d; is the result of dermal impairment.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Based on anecdotal findings in facelift surgery, we hypothesize that there is a direct link between GLP-1 treatment and dermal/epidermal impairment. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated GLP-1 RAs suppressing keratinocyte proliferation, suppressing cytokine production, reducing skin structural integrity and barrier function, and reducing epidermal thickness.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B4" ref-type="bibr">4-6</xref></sup></p><p>Glucocorticoids and systemic steroids serve as an effective treatment for hyperproliferative skin conditions, such as hypertrophic scarring, by helping to suppress inflammation and reduce keratosis.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> By suppressing keratinocyte proliferation and migration, these treatments can effectively manage certain inflammatory skin conditions that cause excess keratosis, like psoriasis.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Glucocorticoid administration for variable term is shown to inhibit keratinocyte and fibroblast activity at the cellular and cytokine level.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ojaf030-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> These changes have led to increased skin susceptibility to ultraviolet damage, decreased elasticity, decreased barrier function, increased transepidermal water loss, and increased fragility.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ojaf030-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Use of GLP-1 RAs may result in similar skin changes to those observed in patients on systemic steroids and glucocorticoids, because of similar antiproliferative effects on keratinocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Just as glucocorticoids and systemic steroids reduce keratinocyte proliferation, so too do GLP-1 RAs.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ojaf030-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Keratinocytes have been found to exhibit GLP-1 receptors, and their proliferation is modulated by GLP-1 RAs&#x02014;liraglutide specifically.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In studies examining liraglutide's effects on keratinocytes, it was found both in vitro and in vivo that liraglutide suppressed keratinocyte proliferation.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ojaf030-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Similar to glucocorticoids, liraglutide has been proposed as a potential treatment for psoriasis, given its antiproliferative effects.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Taken together with the observed accelerated aging, and textural differences observed during facelift surgery on GLP-1 RA&#x02013;treated patients, it is hypothesized that long-term use of GLP-1 RAs may lead to skin atrophy through a similar mechanism to glucocorticoids and systemic steroids. In the burn literature, it is known that patients with large surface area burns on systemic steroid therapy have taken large doses of systemic Vitamin A, which partially reverses steroid-induced transforming growth factor beta 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 suppression, thus protecting the dermis and epidermis from classic steroid changes.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, our theory represents the first time an analogy has been made between glucocorticosteroid effects on the skin and GLP-1 RA/Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) effects on the skin, thus identifying an important consequence of GLP-1 RA/SGLT-2 treatment on the skin and a potential method to combat it.</p><p>In the current prospective study, a novel topical GLPSGLT l serum (Afore LLC, Chicago, IL) was tested for safety and efficacy on facial skin in a cohort of GLP-1 RA&#x02013;treated patients. The formulation was designed to provide a bioavailable local form of retinoic acid to the dermis, theoretically helping to partially reverse cellular and cytokine disruption.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This study represents the first placebo-controlled study to evaluate a topical serum used to enhance the elasticity, barrier function, and textural changes seen in the GLP-1 RA patient.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ojaf030-s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="ojaf030-s1.1"><title>Study Design</title><p>This single-center, split-face, placebo-controlled, blinded pilot study assessed the clinical effects of a novel topical serum (GLPSGLT topical serum) when applied twice daily to facial skin. The GLPSGLT serum contains a proprietary blend of water, retinoic acid, peptides, sodium hyaluronate, and botanically derived ingredients. The placebo-controlled topical in this study was designed to look, feel, and smell identical to the GLPSGLT serum, and its ingredients were as follows: water, aloe vera gel, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, and potassium sorbate.

The inclusion criteria were healthy females or males of ages between 18 and 75 years receiving GLP-1 analog or SGLT-2 therapy for a minimum of 30 days before the start of the study. The inclusion criteria for skin quality were presenting with at least one of the following: volume loss, loss of elasticity, presence of fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, photodamage, surface roughness, and uneven pigmentation. Patients who had received botulinum toxin A, filler, or energy-based treatments within 3 months of study enrollment or who had undergone rejuvenation procedures to the face or neck (eg, facelift surgery, microneedling, microdermabrasion, and chemical peels) within 30 days of the start of the study were excluded. Those who were current smokers, had a history of heavy smoking, had uncontrolled systemic inflammatory conditions, or had active dermatologic conditions in the areas to be treated were also excluded. For the duration of the study, patients did not receive any aesthetic treatments on their face or neck and limited their use of topical products to the product under study, the placebo topical, a gentle facial cleanser, a daily facial moisturizer, and routine 25% zinc-oxide-based SPF 30 sunscreen application daily as recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology. The gentle facial cleanser, daily facial moisturizer, and routine 25% zinc-oxide-based SPF 30 sunscreen were provided to patients at no cost.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="ojaf030-T1"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Patient Characteristics (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median age, years (range)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55 (34-64)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GRS skin type, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;I: pale white or freckled</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (71.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;II: white</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;III: white to light brown</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;IV: moderate brown</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (14.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;V: dark brown</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (14.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;VI: very dark brown to black</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GLP-1 or SGLT drug, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Tirzepatide</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (42.8)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Semaglutide</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (42.8)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Dulaglutide</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (14.3)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; GRS, Global Ranking Scale.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In this pilot study, the patients served as their own placebo-control group using a split-face study design.

Patients were instructed to apply a thin layer of the serum labeled LEFT to the left side of their face following use of the provided mild facial cleanser on the entire face in both the morning and evening. After applying the topical labeled LEFT, patients were instructed to wash their hands and then apply a thin layer of topical labeled RIGHT to the right side of their face. In the mornings, patients were instructed to apply a thin layer of the daily facial moisturizer to both sides of the face, followed by a thin layer of the 25% zinc-oxide-based sunscreen, after applying both LEFT and RIGHT topicals.

To our knowledge, this represents the first study of its kind to evaluate such a combination of ingredients for both cosmetic enhancement and the reversal of drug-induced skin changes related to GLP-1 RA medications, specifically tested on GLP-1 RA&#x02013;treated patients. This study provides evidence, in a small number of patients, that this combination may be effective for improving skin elasticity, surface roughness, skin texture and smoothness, dehydration, appearance of pores, fine lines and wrinkles, and pigmentation. These improvements are consistently captured across 3 different measures: the GRS scale, patient-satisfaction surveys, and independent physician review. Increased skin elasticity and firmness at Day 42 on the treated side&#x02014;observed in all of the patients&#x02014;presents an opportunity for future, more in-depth investigation related to histopathological changes to the skin. It is theorized that the GLPSGLT topical increased epidermal thickness, in direct contrast to observed epidermal thinning in GLP-1 RA&#x02013;treated patients; however, skin biopsies and histopathological analysis will be required to definitively conclude GLPSGLT topical's effects on skin structure.</p><p>A full review of the body of the literature evidence behind each ingredient in GLPSGLT is beyond the scope of this paper. The rationale behind the main active ingredients is described below.</p><p>Carotenoid byproducts are a well-known and well-established ingredient in topical formulations, typically prescribed to address signs of aging. In a previous clinical study in the senior author's clinical practice using the GRS as a primary endpoint on 10 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10) patients, a topical using a proprietary complex form of Vitamin A as a primary active ingredient led to clinically significant improvements in 13 of 13 domains. Notably, 95% of patients showed improvement to static wrinkles, and 95% demonstrated improvement to surface roughness.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Additionally, although very few of the patients in the referenced study presented with severe elasticity loss at baseline, 100% experienced improvement in their skin elasticity at the conclusion of the study.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These findings demonstrated that Vitamin A as a primary active showed significant promise for addressing GLP-1 RA&#x02013;induced accelerated signs of aging and loss of elasticity. This premise led to the formulation of a proprietary, first-of-its-kind bioactive soluble Vitamin A derivative in a novel peptide matrix for enhanced dermal availability and decreased negative inflammation.</p><p>Retinoids also improve several aspects of skin health and function thought to be negatively influenced by GLP-1 RA use. Vitamin A acts on retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors in keratinocytes, which promotes cell renewal and keratinocyte proliferation through nuclear receptor&#x02013;mediated gene transcription.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Specifically, Vitamin A increases proliferation of keratinocytes in the epidermis, leading to epidermal thickening, whereas GLP-1 RAs suppress keratinocyte proliferation and lead to epidermal thinning.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ojaf030-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ojaf030-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Retinoids influence keratinocyte differentiation, stimulating keratinocytes to develop properly into cells needed for proper skin barrier function. HaCaT (human epidermal keratinocyte) evaluation with GLP-1 use impairs keratinocyte inflammatory signal by activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and restraining macrophage migration, thus impairing apoptosis and the natural pathway of keratinocyte repair.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In addition, transforming growth factor beta 1 behavior is modified in ways that appear to overlap what is seen in glucocorticoid therapy.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> With continual use, retinoids are known to strengthen the protective function of the epidermis, restrain transepidermal water loss, and protect collagen against degradation.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Because GLP-1 RAs are thought to decrease skin tensile strength and barrier function by thinning the epidermis&#x02014;and reduce skin elasticity because of decreased barrier function leading to collagen and elastin degradation&#x02014;bioavailable peptide and Vitamin A derivatives lead to the promotion of a healthy skin barrier and protective effects against collagen and elastin degradation, allowing it to act as a primary active in the GLPSGLT formula.</p><p>Additional actives in the GLPSGLT formula include palmitoyl oligopeptide and palmitoyl tetrapeptide. Peptides are short chains of amino acids and are the building blocks of collagen and elastin. Both palmitoyl oligopeptide and palmitoyl tetrapeptide have been demonstrated to improve skin elasticity, as well as the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, when used in combination topical formulations.<sup><xref rid="ojaf030-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Palmitoyl oligopeptide and palmitoyl tetrapeptide provide demonstrable evidence of elasticity and aesthetic improvements counter to GLP-1 RA's elasticity-reducing and accelerative effects on aging.</p><p>Strengths of this study include excellent retention as well as the inclusion of a wide range of patient skin types in a relatively small sample size (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7) which makes for more informative study results. The use of a split-face design allowed for direct comparison between study topical and placebo-treated skin, allowing for more conclusive analysis of GLPSGLT topical's effects. Also positive was GLPSGLT topical's limited side-effect profile, indicating broad tolerance in a cohort of patients with compromised skin barrier strength. The results of this study indicate that the novel GLPSGLT topical formulation may help reverse skin changes associated with GLP-1 and SGLT-2 use, including reduced elasticity, surface roughness, and impaired hydration. Patients in this study were on GLP-1 RA therapy for as little as 6 months. In the senior author's clinical practice, patients outside of this study population have noted changes to their skin with the use of GLP-1 RAs in as little as 3 months with 10 pound weight loss. Without timely intervention, these structural and functional skin changes may become long-standing or potentially permanent, reinforcing the need for early treatment and preventative care in patients using these medications.</p><p>Limitations include a small cohort of patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7). Although the inclusion of blinded third-party photographic review and a patient-satisfaction survey with questions overlapping with the domains of the GRS assessment increases the rigor of the study beyond what would be achievable with the GRS alone, the authors recognize that these assessments are subjective, and like all subjective measures, may be prone to individual interpretation and bias. Evidence from this study suggests, with statistical significance, that there was an improvement to imbalance and asymmetry in all patients. Although &#x0201c;imbalance&#x0201d; is considered a morphologic domain and refers to the profile (&#x0201c;asymmetry&#x0201d; refers to the frontal view of the face), this term may be somewhat unclear to patients, and the degree of change observed in this domain, as well as the larger confidence interval, may be reflective of some patients&#x02019; assessing balanced skin tone rather than balance of facial anatomic structures, or may be reflective of patients&#x02019; assessing the magnitude of aesthetic skin changes experienced between the treatment and placebo sides of the face because of the split-face study design. Inclusion of an objective scale or outcome measure would strengthen study findings. The cohort of patients in this study included only 3 Fitzpatrick skin types, so future studies should be inclusive of all skin types.</p><p>Although there is published proof of histological change to the epidermis, we acknowledge the limitation of not including histology. Furthermore, this study would have benefited from histopathological skin analysis to assess structural skin changes in GLP-1 analog&#x02013;treated and SGLT analog&#x02013;treated patients before and after treatment with GLPSGLT topical. Because of the split-face study design, an ethical concern was raised around biopsy of the placebo-treated skin by the IRB. In future studies, histological analysis will be employed to make conclusive statements about the degree of structural skin changes, including the presence of collagen bundles in the skin before and after treatment with GLPSGLT. This study would have also benefited from expanding the inclusion criteria to corticosteroid users experiencing skin atrophy. Given the potential keratinocyte-suppressing mechanisms described for GLP-1 RAs and the keratinocyte-stimulating effects of GLPSGLT topical, this study would have benefited from additionally examining patients with corticosteroid skin thinning, a more well-established cause of keratinocyte-suppression-related skin atrophy. Last, the safety and tolerability described here are short-term (42 days) and do not necessarily reflect long-term safety and efficacy.</p><p>Although the current study focuses on the adverse dermatologic effects of GLP-1 RAs, it is important to note their emerging role in modulating inflammation. GLP-1s have demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions in both in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as psoriasis, keloid scarring, and other chronic inflammatory skin diseases. To fully understand the dual nature of GLP-1s&#x02014;both their beneficial and adverse effects&#x02014;future studies should incorporate dermatopathological assessments and long-term clinical follow-ups across a range of inflammatory and structural skin disorders.</p><p>GLPSGLT was formulated specifically to address the growing concern for skin changes observed in GLP-1 analog&#x02013;treated and SGLT analog&#x02013;treated patients. This study supports a role for this formulation as a supplementary at-home treatment for both GLP analog and SGLT users to address related losses of elasticity and firmness, in addition to a wide range of other age-related aesthetic concerns across multiple skin types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="ojaf030-s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In this study, GLPSGLT topical serum demonstrated statistically significant improvement across all 13 domains of the GRS in GLP-1&#x02013; and SGLT-2&#x02013;treated patients when applied twice daily for 42 days. Improvements were observed as early as Day 21 and continued through Day 42, with the treated side outperforming the placebo in all measured categories. Independent photographic review confirmed visible enhancement in key domains, such as surface roughness, pigmentation, and static wrinkles. Patients also reported high satisfaction and no significant adverse effects, supporting the serum's safety and efficacy over the 6-week study period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>ojaf030_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="ojaf030_supplementary_data.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="ojaf030-s5"><title>Supplemental Material</title><p>This article contains <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplemental material</xref> located online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/asjof/ojaf030" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1093/asjof/ojaf030</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="ojaf030-s6"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Dr Few is a consultant and investigator for Merz (Frankfurt, Germany) and Allergan (Dublin, Ireland); is a consultant for Revance (Nashville, TN); and holds stock in Venus Concepts (Toronto, Canada) and Revance.
