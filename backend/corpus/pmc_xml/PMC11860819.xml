The egg-laying period of the Zhedong white goose usually starts from September and ends in April of the following year. During the summer months from May to August, with long daylight hours and high temperatures, the white geese rest and do not lay eggs. This study explored the effects of off-season breeding on egg production performance, serum biochemical indicators, and hormone secretion in Zhedong white goose. The experiment was divided into normal breeding and off-seasonal breeding. The results suggested that the peak laying period lasted 3 months, and egg production was 15.62% higher than that in the control group in the off-season breeding group. The off-season breeding group had a 4.13% higher egg fertilization rate in November (laying period) than the control group, and the hatching rate of hatched eggs and fertilized eggs in the peak laying period was 2.77% and 2.3% higher, respectively, than the control group. The experimental group showed significantly higher serum P, ALB (albumin), TG (triglyceride), and TC (total cholesterol) levels; serum AST (glutamic oxalacetic transaminase) activity; and CREA (creatinine) and BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels than the control group at different time points. The serum LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), P4 (progesterone), and E2 (estradiol) levels were significantly higher in the off-season breeding group than in the control group. The serum T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (Tetraiodothyronine) levels were significantly higher in the off-season breeding group than in the control group at different points in the breeding cycle. The control group showed a significantly higher gene expression of GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) in the hypothalamus; GnRH, FSH, and LH in the pituitary; and GnRH in the ovary and significantly lower gene expression of VIP (vasoactine intestinal peptide) and PRL (prolactin) in the pituitary than the off-season breeding group. Thus, the off-season breeding of Zhedong white geese may prolong the peak laying period and improve egg production performance, thus enhancing the economic benefits of goose breeding.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Zhedong white goose</kwd><kwd>off-season reproduction</kwd><kwd>seasonal reproduction</kwd><kwd>egg-laying performance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>32072933</award-id><award-id>32072923</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 32072933, 32072923].</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vetsci-12-00179"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>China has the highest number of geese worldwide. In 2021, the number of commercially bred geese in China was approximately 570 million, accounting for more than 90% of the global production [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Xiangshan has become the largest breeding base of Zhedong white geese in China. The county has a total of 1.26 million geese in stock and produces and sells 10 million goslings annually. The total output value of the entire industrial chain has reached CNY 560 million. Zhedong white goose, also known as Xiangshan white goose and Zhejiang white goose, is a medium-sized goose bred for their meat and liver. Zhedong white geese are typically seasonal breeders; the breeding cycle begins at the end of autumn as the days gradually shorten (from the end of September to the beginning of October) and ends at the end of spring (from April to June) as the days gradually lengthen, and then enters the rest period in summer [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The average reproductive cycle of the Zhedong goose is 150&#x02013;180 days, which includes three to four laying periods; 8&#x02013;11 eggs are laid in each laying period, the duration of each laying period is 15&#x02013;40 min, and the average laying interval is 24&#x02013;40 h. Thus, typically, 30&#x02013;45 eggs are produced by a female goose annually; the average egg weight is 160&#x02013;170 g, and the fertilization rate is 85% [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, how to effectively prolong the breeding cycle of Zhedong white geese is very important.</p><p>Off-season breeding aims to use human intervention to make geese produce eggs in the non-breeding season contrary to their physiological characteristics [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previous studies have successfully used light regulation and forced molting to induce geese to produce eggs in the summer of the second year and achieved high-temperature egg production in the summer of the third year [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the average number of eggs produced in the off-season breeding cycle was lower than that in the normal breeding cycle, the price of goslings produced in the summer was much higher than the price of goslings raised in the normal breeding cycle, and the production cost was divided between the two seasons. The implementation of feeding technology in Landes geese was reported to increase the average profit by 20% compared with that generated using the normal breeding cycle, which affirms the potential of developing off-season breeding of geese in China. With the economic development and the consequent increase in food consumption, the market demand for goose products is gradually growing. The application of off-season breeding can effectively induce Zhedong white geese to produce eggs in the non-breeding season, which has economic benefits and ensures a stable supply to the market.</p><p>It is not difficult to find that counter-seasonal breeding can effectively increase economic benefits. It is widely acknowledged that animals, particularly birds, mainly regulate the seasonality of reproduction and other physiological activities by depending on the annual variations of the daily light cycle [<xref rid="B6-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Egg production requires the synthesis of large amounts of lipids, proteins, and minerals. When laying starts, plasma triglycerides increase substantially and lipoproteins are needed to transport them from liver to ovary [<xref rid="B7-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In a previous study, the elevation of TG and ALB indicated that the lipid and protein synthesis capacity of liver is greatly improved during egg laying [<xref rid="B8-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The study also found that egg production requires large amounts of trace elements, especially Ca and P, to form eggshell, and the transport of Ca requires participation of Na and Cl [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is well known that hormonal changes are closely related to the reproductive performance of animals. B&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;carrats et al. found that the photoperiod signals by the pineal gland, acting on photoreceptors located in the retina and the deep brain, directly regulate GnRH, and indirectly affect GnIH secretions through melatonin secretions [<xref rid="B10-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. GnRH and GnIH, respectively, stimulate and inhibit secretions of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through the pituitary gland so as to activate or inhibit reproductive activities. In addition, photo-signals trigger the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by stimulating the photoreceptor cells. TSH stimulates the local conversion of thyroid hormone total thyroxin (T4) into triiodothyronine (T3), which may in turn stimulate the release of GnRH-I in the median eminence, which subsequently induces reproductive activation [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, hormone regulation plays an essential role in the application of off-season breeding. A growing body of evidence suggests that serum biomarkers have been developed as indicators for clinical and breeding purposes in humans and animals [<xref rid="B12-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In animal breeding, serum parameters serve as indirect indicators for both animal health and economic traits [<xref rid="B14-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such as high levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are associated with pale, soft, exudative meat. Qi et al. found that total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), globulins (GLB), total cholesterol (CHOL), total triglyceride (TG) content, and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) are related to egg production [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>There is no doubt that the application of off-season breeding can effectively induce Zhedong white geese to produce eggs in the non-breeding season, which has economic benefits and ensures a stable supply to the market. However, because off-season breeding is a production strategy that goes against physiological laws, it remains unknown whether it affects the egg laying performance, physiological functions, and reproductive endocrine regulation of Zhedong white goose. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of off-season breeding on the egg-laying performance, physiological functions, and reproductive hormones of Zhedong white geese.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-12-00179"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-vetsci-12-00179"><title>2.1. Experimental Design</title><p>This study was conducted at an eastern Zhejiang white goose breeding farm located in Xiangshan County, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China. Experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the university (Yangzhou, China; approval no. SYXK (Su) 2022-0044). A total of 2000, 120 days, female Zhedong white geese of the same batch were selected; the number of male geese was 4000, 120 days. An amount of 1000 each were allocated to the normal seasonal breeding (control) group and off-season breeding group, respectively. Male geese were housed with female geese in a ratio of 2:1 to facilitate mating in each group. In the control group, geese were housed in a facility equipped with automatic feeders and egg laying houses furnished with appropriate bedding materials, and they were provided with ample space for activity along with an artificial pool outdoors. In contrast, geese in the off-season breeding group were accommodated in a light-protected breeding shed with controlled lighting conditions. The method was as follows: 1. Lighting Control. Implement artificial lighting: from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., provide artificial supplementary lighting to the goose house for 10 to 12 h each day, which can increase the duration of light in the goose house to over 16 h; Adjust the intensity of light: farmers can control the number and intensity of external light sources to adjust the intensity of light. Generally, an intensity of 1500 to 2000 lux is appropriate. 2. Environmental Regulation. 1. Adjust the temperature in the goose house: a room temperature of 15 to 20 degrees Celsius is suitable for the egg-laying and reproduction of geese. During off-season reproduction in winter, heaters or radiators can be used to maintain the temperature in the goose house, allowing geese to live in a suitable temperature to increase the reproduction rate. 2. Maintain the humidity in the goose house: appropriate humidity can help geese maintain their body&#x02019;s water balance and normal metabolism. During off-season reproduction in winter, the humidity in the goose house should be maintained at 60% to 70%. Spraying water or adding humidity equipment can achieve this goal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vetsci-12-00179"><title>2.2. Sample Selection</title><p>A total of 100 Zhejiang white geese were randomly selected from the off-seasonal breeding group and the control group for blood collection in 7, 8, 9 months. Fasting was ensured for 12 h before blood collection. In total, 5 mL of whole blood was collected from the wing vein using vacuum blood collection vessels, and the whole blood samples were kept at 4 &#x000b0;C for 30&#x02013;60 min. The whole blood was centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge for 10 min, after which, the supernatant was drawn in a 5 mL centrifuge tube and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vetsci-12-00179"><title>2.3.

Implementation of Off-Season Breeding Strategy</title><p>Throughout the entire experimental period, the control group was afforded opportunities for physical activity and provided with ample water and feed in accordance with the standard seasonal breeding protocol to uphold a regular laying cycle and rest period. In August 2018, the control group entered the laying phase. From 1 August to 1 June 2019, eggs were collected every morning and evening, and the total egg number and number of fertilized eggs, hatched goslings, and lost young geese (dead-in-shell) were determined.</p><p>The feed intake in the off-season breeding group was restricted from 1 to 20 February 2018; the total intake of fine and coarse feed was maintained at 150 g per animal, and green feed (spartina anglica) was provided ad libitum. From 1 February, the geese were driven into the shed every day after sunset and continued to be given artificial light, and the long light treatment was maintained for 18 h a day. During this period, the nutritional status of the breeding geese in the off-season breeding group was poor, so they gradually stopped egg production. From 21 February to 1 March, the feed intake for geese in the off-season breeding group was gradually increased to 200&#x02013;250 g per animal, and the light exposure period was maintained at 18 h per day. During this period, the geese in this group began to molt. From 1 March to 31 March, normal feeding was resumed, with 200&#x02013;250 g feed concentrate per animal, and green feed was provided ad libitum. From March 1, the geese in the off-season breeding group shed their feathers. From 1 to 30 April, 200&#x02013;250 g feed concentrate was administered per animal, and light exposure was increased by 1 h every week from 15 April to 1 June. After 1 month of molt recovery, feathers grew back and egg production started. From June 1, a shorter light exposure period of 12 h a day was used to promote egg production; the temperature of the goose house was maintained below 25 &#x000b0;C. Other management methods and feeding materials were the same as those in the control group, and each house was swept once to ensure clean conditions. From 1 April 2018 to 1 February 2019, eggs were collected once every morning and evening and screened to identify fertilized eggs. The total egg number and numbers of fertilized eggs, goslings born, and young geese lost in the 11-month production cycle were determined. <xref rid="vetsci-12-00179-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the composition of the feed provided to Zhedong white geese during the laying period.</p><p>The nesting behavior of geese in the control and off-season breeding groups was checked once every 3&#x02013;4 d.

Discussion</title><p>The technology of goose off-season reproduction is designed to carry out egg production in the non-reproductive season through artificial intervention against physiological characteristics. Natural light variation is the main factor for the emergence of seasonal reproductive trait characteristics in many animals. The implementation of goose out-of-season breeding production technology is a systematic engineering, the key of which is light and forced moult. Many studies have found that changing the light can affect the reproductive performance of poultry [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, we successfully established an off-season breeding production technology for Zhedong white geese by limiting feed-forced molting combined with light and temperature regulation. We found that the egg laying peak of the off-season breeding group increased by 15.62% compared with the control group.</p><p>Serum biochemical indexes serve as vital parameters for evaluating the nutritional status, physiological function, and production performance of animals in commercial production [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The higher the serum content of TP and ALB, the better the absorption and deposition of the protein provided by the feed, the higher the feed utilization rate, and the higher the protein metabolism [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The present study found that there was no significant difference in serum TP concentration between the off-season breeding group and the control group at the peak of the laying period, but the serum ALB content was significantly higher than that of the control group, indicating that the off-season breeding of eastern Zhejiang white geese did not affect protein absorption and metabolism and facilitated protein deposition at the peak of the laying period, which is conducive to maintaining their egg production performance.</p><p>Serum biochemistry considered to be a good indicator of health status. Ca and P, the most abundant mineral elements in the body, are crucial for bone growth, muscle development, and the maintenance of egg production performance and physiological function homeostasis during the breeding period [<xref rid="B19-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Micaela Sinalair-Black et al. found that serum Ca and P ion levels were correlated with egg laying performance, and blood calcium concentration was related to eggshell formation [<xref rid="B20-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Evandro Ferreira Cardoso et al. found that when laying hens suffered from heat stress, their serum Ca and P levels decreased significantly [<xref rid="B21-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Alagawany et al. found that different P levels in feed materials had no significant impact on the TP, AST, ALT, and BUN levels [<xref rid="B22-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the present study, it was found that the serum P and Ca levels at the peak of egg production were significantly higher in the off-season breeding group than in the control group, but there was no significant difference, indicating that the off-season breeding of eastern Zhejiang white geese did not affect the absorption and metabolism of mineral Ca and P, and the off-season breeding group increased the utilization efficiency of Ca and P in the feed during egg production, which was conducive to maintaining a high-yield performance. In short, Ca and P content is crucial for maintaining egg production performance.</p><p>Hen egg yolk is a natural supramolecular assembly of lipids and proteins with different organization levels [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The determination of serum lipid metabolism indexes is crucial for evaluating lipid metabolism. The liver synthesizes majority of the body&#x02019;s cholesterol, while exogenous cholesterol obtained from dietary intake is absorbed through the intestinal tract. Kuzmenko et al. found that serum TG levels fluctuate with season, typically being higher in summer than in winter [<xref rid="B24-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This is one of the reasons why poultry produce fewer eggs in winter. Lipids such as TG and cholesterol in the body enter the oocytes through specific receptors under the regulation of reproductive hormones, which promotes the formation of egg yolk. Maintaining normal levels of serum TG and TC provides nutritional guarantee and improves the hatching rate of fertilized eggs [<xref rid="B25-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mourot et al. [<xref rid="B26-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that the likelihood of fatty liver was twice as high in Landes geese than in Polish geese, and the serum TG levels in Landes raised for foie gras (foie gras of animals, especially geese, usually eaten as foie gras) were higher and they exhibit higher fat metabolism and deposition in the liver. Tanabe et al. reported that changes in serum TG levels were significantly positively correlated with laying performance in laying hens [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. When the serum TG levels decreased, the laying performance decreased, and when the serum TG levels recovered and increased, the laying performance gradually increased. In the present study, it was found that the serum TG levels in the off-season breeding group were significantly higher than those of the control group at the peak of the laying period, and the serum TC content also showed an increasing trend, indicating that the off-season breeding of Zhedong white geese did not affect the absorption and metabolism of lipids in the feed, and the higher serum TG and TC levels would help to maintain the energy demand and the nutritional composition of egg yolk at the peak of the laying period.</p><p>The concentrations of serum AST and ALT are related to the metabolism and function of the liver in farm animals. After liver cell damage, the concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in the blood are usually higher [<xref rid="B28-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The liver plays an important role in lipid metabolism, promoting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and synthesis and the decomposition of proteins, regulating blood glucose, and participating in hormonal regulation. Jiang Tao [<xref rid="B29-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported that seasons significantly affect the liver indexes in different goose breeds; for example, the serum AST activity is higher in summer than in winter, which is more conducive to protein absorption. In the present study, the serum AST activity of the off-season breeding group was slightly higher than that of the control group at the peak of egg production, and significantly higher than that of the control group in August, which was consistent with the study results of Jiang Tao. In conclusion, feeding Zhedong white geese in off-season not only increased egg production but also promoted the increase in serum AST activity during the laying peak, thus improving protein deposition and maintaining high egg-production performance. Kang Bo et al. conducted blood biochemical analysis in white geese and seed geese in northeast China and found significant differences in ALT, AST, and GGT activity and other indicators but no significant differences in TBil and Dbil between the goose breeds [<xref rid="B30-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Previous studies indicate that increasing the proportion of protein in the feed of lion head geese increased the egg production and hatching rate, serum ALT activity, and expression of pituitary FSHP and ovarian FSH receptor, which improved the production performance of lion head geese [<xref rid="B31-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the present study, there was no significant difference in serum Tbil levels and ALT and GGT activity between the experimental and control groups, indicating that off-season breeding did not affect the liver function of eastern Zhejiang white geese.</p><p>It is well known that poultry hormone regulation plays an important role in reproduction, which is conducive to maintaining the physiological pressure of poultry and improving economic benefits. Birds are mostly seasonal and their reproductive process is initiated by environmental queues [<xref rid="B33-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In poultry, changes in the environment can regulate the secretion of hormones [<xref rid="B34-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, off-season breeding is a typical method of achieving economic growth by adjusting the rearing environment and feed management. GnRH is one of the key hormones involved in the regulation of seasonal reproduction in geese. Its secretion and synthesis are regulated by photoreceptors in the hypothalamus, its own reproductive function, and the endocrine system [<xref rid="B35-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. GnRH produced by the hypothalamus regulates LH and FSH production by the pituitary gland, and the continuous secretion of GnRH is regulated by other nerve centers, especially photoreceptors. In birds exposed to long days, the secretion of GnRH increases, causing an increase in plasma gonadotropin concentration and maintaining the ovarian production of somatotropin and follicle development. According to a study, the rhythmic secretion of GnRH activates the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase system by binding to specific receptors on gonadotropin-secreting cells in the pituitary gland and induces the secretion of LH and FSH [<xref rid="B36-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Changes in FSH and LH levels stimulate the secretion of E2 and P4 in follicular cells to regulate mating and other reproductive behaviors during the breeding period. Yang Haiming et al. [<xref rid="B37-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] studied the expression of GnRH in Yangzhou geese under different light and temperature conditions and found that GnRH gene expression during the laying period was significantly higher than that during the rest period. The present study showed that GnRH and VIP were expressed in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary of eastern Zhejiang white geese. GnRH gene expression in the three tissues in the off-season breeding group during the rest period was significantly lower than that in the control group during the peak laying period; specifically, GnRH expression in the hypothalamus showed a 10-fold difference, which is consistent with the previous findings, indicating that GnRH regulates the laying performance in eastern Zhejiang white geese. Moreover, the expression of FSH and LH genes in the pituitary tissue in the off-season breeding group during the rest period was significantly lower than that in the control group during the peak laying period, consistent with the higher serum FSH and LH levels during the peak period of egg production. The serum FSH and LH levels in the off-season breeding group were higher than those in the control group at various time points, indicating that off-season breeding in eastern Zhejiang white geese was also strictly regulated by the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;gonadal axis to maintain the peak laying period.</p><p>Estradiol (E2) is predominantly synthesized by follicular cells, ovarian tissue, and the placenta. Avian progesterone (P4) is primarily produced by ovarian granulosa cells and is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Gumulka et al. observed significantly elevated serum levels of E2 and P4 in Anding geese during the laying period compared with the rest period [<xref rid="B38-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Zhao et al. [<xref rid="B39-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] found that the serum E2 and P4 levels of female Wanxi white geese were low before the breeding season, gradually increased as the laying period began, reached a peak in the middle and late laying periods, and reached the lowest level at the end of the laying period. In the present study, the change trend of serum E2 and P4 levels in the off-season breeding group and the control group was similar, and the highest hormone levels were consistent with the peak of the laying period. The change trend was that the serum E2 and P4 levels peaked at the peak of the laying period, gradually decreased after the peak laying period, and gradually increased during the early laying period after recovery during the rest period. However, the serum E2 and P4 levels in the off-season breeding group were significantly higher than those in the control group at some time points; these differences were consistent with the finding that the off-season breeding group maintained a longer peak laying period.</p><p>T3 and T4 are important endocrine hormones that participate in nutrient absorption and metabolism, bone growth and development, and gonadal development. Pond et al. reported that thyroid gland removal in turkeys led to a failure of egg production in antenatal turkeys and the cessation of egg production in turkeys during the laying period [<xref rid="B40-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Liu et al. used the estrogen-like effect of daidzein to promote an increase in thyroxine levels in Hy-Line Brown laying hens, which improved their laying performance [<xref rid="B41-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that T3, T4, and GH are important regulators of animal reproduction [<xref rid="B42-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. T3 and T4 are essential for the initiation and maintenance of egg production and for molting and regulate reproduction via the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;gonadal axis in poultry [<xref rid="B44-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. They regulate reproductive function directly and indirectly by regulating PRL secretion. The study showed that the change trend of serum T3 and T4 levels in eastern Zhejiang white geese was similar between the off-season breeding group and the control group; the serum T3 level was generally higher in the peak laying period, whereas the serum T4 level was lower in the rest period and higher in the peak laying period. The results suggest that the changes in serum T3 and T4 levels are closely associated with the energy expenditure and maintenance of laying performance during the laying period.</p><p>Off-season breeding prolonged the duration of the peak laying period of eastern Zhejiang white geese, and the egg production in the off-season breeding group was 15.62% higher than that in the control group. The average economic benefit per goose in the off-season breeding group was 7.2% higher than that in the control group. Off-season breeding increased the serum ALB, TG, and P levels and AST activity and promoted the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and minerals, which is conducive to maintaining the laying performance during the peak laying period. The change trends of serum FSH, LH, E2, P4, PRL, T3, and T4 levels in the off-season breeding group were similar to those in the control group. The serum E2, FSH, LH, P4, and T3 levels were higher in the off-season breeding group than in the control group at some time points during the peak laying period, and the highest levels of serum PRL were consistent with the rest period. Reproduction in avian species is controlled by the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;gonadal axis (HPGA), and the HPGA is a comprehensive feedback system formed under central nervous regulation [<xref rid="B45-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. HPGA is regulated by multiple hormones, including GnRH from the hypothalamus, prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, as well as E2 and P4 from the gonads [<xref rid="B46-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], with PRL regulating nesting behavior through the HPGA. During oviposition, the E2 from the ovary acts on the hypothalamus, enhancing the activity of dopamine and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which in turn promotes the synthesis and release of VIP. Through a feedback effect, this stimulates the secretion of PRL, thereby driving the nesting behavior [<xref rid="B47-vetsci-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this study, the gene expression levels of GnRH in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary and FSH and LH in the pituitary were significantly lower in the off-season breeding group than in the control group during the laying period, but the gene expression levels of VIP and PRL were significantly higher than those in the control group. It is not difficult to observe that the reduction in hormone content is conducive to the secretion of VIP and PRL, which increases the nesting behavior of poultry and promotes egg-laying.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
