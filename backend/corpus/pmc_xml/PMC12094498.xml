Although clinical patterns suggest that older individuals are more susceptible to poor outcomes, the biological mechanisms contributing to this increased vulnerability are poorly understood. Sirtuins, a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-dependent enzymes involved in cellular stress regulation, metabolism, and aging, may play a key role in modulating the hepatic response to burn injury. This study explores the potential mechanistic involvement of sirtuins in age-related liver damage following thermal injury.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Female C57BL/6 mice (young: four months; aged: 20-22 months) underwent sham or 15% total body surface area scald burn. Liver tissue was collected at 24- and 48-hours post-injury for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of all seven sirtuin family members.</p><p>Results</p><p>Burn injury significantly altered hepatic sirtuin&#x000a0;expression in an age- and time-dependent manner. Inflammatory regulators, <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt2</italic>, showed immediate downregulation in young mice with partial recovery at 48 hours, while aged mice exhibited delayed, more profound, and persistent suppression. In contrast, mitochondrial sirtuins (<italic>Sirt3-5</italic>) were downregulated in both age groups, and only young burned mice showed recovery of <italic>Sirt3</italic> and <italic>Sirt4</italic> expression at 48 hours. The most pronounced age-dependent difference occurred with <italic>Sirt4</italic>. At this time point, the expression of <italic>Sirt4</italic> was 71% higher in young burned mice compared to aged injured counterparts (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Genome stability regulating <italic>Sirt6</italic> and <italic>Sirt7</italic> exhibited age-specific responses, with <italic>Sirt6</italic> remaining stable in young injured mice, while&#x000a0;<italic>Sirt7</italic>&#x000a0;was lower in aged mice at 48 hours (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>This study reveals for the first time that burn injury triggers age-dependent alterations in the pattern of hepatic sirtuin expression, with delayed and/or more severe and persistent suppression across all sirtuin&#x000a0;family members. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the dysregulation of critical cellular homeostatic mechanisms in aged livers following burn injury and identify sirtuins as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating age-associated hepatic damage in elderly burn patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>burn injury</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>hepatic damage</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>liver injury</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>sirtuins</kwd><kwd>trauma</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by K08GM134185 (JPI), R01GM153949 (JPI), R01AG018859 (EJK), and R35GM131831 (EJK).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Severe burn injuries represent a significant clinical challenge, particularly in the elderly population, who experience markedly higher rates of complications, prolonged hospitalization, and two- to three-fold increased mortality compared to younger patients [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This age-associated vulnerability has been documented across multiple burn centers, with elderly patients (&#x0003e;65 years) exhibiting mortality rates of 45-50% compared to 10-15% in younger adults with comparable burn injuries [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As stated by Jeschke, the liver, as a central metabolic hub regulating acute-phase proteins, cytokine production, and immune modulation, plays a crucial role in systemic response to any type of trauma, including burns&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, age-related impairments in hepatic resilience can exacerbate systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction, predisposing elderly burn patients to adverse outcomes [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the liver exhibits significant morphological and functional changes following cutaneous burns, with these alterations markedly exacerbated in aged animals [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].&#x000a0;Specifically, we observed elevated liver injury markers (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), increased hepatic lipid deposits, heightened oxidative stress (measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels), and accentuated histological evidence of hepatic damage in aged mice compared to young counterparts after burn injury [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings highlight the increased vulnerability of the aged liver to acute stressors, but the molecular mechanisms driving this age-dependent susceptibility remain incompletely understood.</p><p>The molecular basis for heightened hepatic vulnerability in the aged appears to involve multiple interconnected pathways. Research from 2018 to 2022 demonstrates that burn-induced hepatic damage is driven not only by cytokine dysregulation but also by alterations in cellular stress response mechanisms, including sirtuin-mediated pathways [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Sirtuins are a family of 7 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-dependent deacetylases, named from <italic>Sirt1</italic> to <italic>Sirt7</italic>, that function as master regulators of cellular homeostasis. Based on their subcellular localization and function, sirtuins can be categorized into three groups: inflammatory regulators (<italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt2</italic>), mitochondrial function and oxidative stress regulators (<italic>Sirt3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>5</italic>), and genome stability and DNA repair modulators (<italic>Sirt6</italic> and <italic>7</italic>) [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These evolutionarily conserved proteins serve as critical sensors of cellular stress and metabolic state, orchestrating adaptive responses to maintain homeostasis under challenging conditions.</p><p>In our recent report on the transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of liver tissue following burn injury, we identified significant alterations in pathways associated with sirtuin&#x000a0;activity, including mitochondrial function, oxidative stress responses, and lipid metabolism [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The dysregulation of sirtuin&#x000a0;expression has been implicated in aging-related hepatic vulnerability, including diminished capacity to respond to oxidative stress, impaired metabolic flexibility, and compromised cellular repair mechanisms [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the specific role of sirtuins in burn-induced liver injury, particularly in the context of aging, remains unexplored.</p><p>Comprehensive genetic analyses are essential to understanding how the liver responds to burn injuries differ between young and aged individuals. The present study aims to characterize hepatic sirtuin&#x000a0;expression patterns following burn injury using a clinically validated murine burn model that closely replicates human burn physiology [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given the crucial role of sirtuins in modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic adaptation, identifying age-related changes in their expression may provide insight into the mechanisms driving burn-induced hepatic dysfunction. Ultimately, these findings could lead to targeted therapeutic strategies such as sirtuin modulators or epigenetic therapies, which are currently under investigation in cancer and autoimmune diseases, but may be repurposed and adapted to mitigate liver dysfunction after burns to improve care and clinical outcomes in elderly patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Mice</p><p>Young (four months old, equivalent to 20-25 human years) and aged (20-22 months old, comparable to 65-70 human years) female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Colony at Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). This age equivalence is based on established lifespan correlations between mice and humans as described by Flurkey et al. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Prior to the study, all mice were housed at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Vivarium for a minimum of two weeks to allow for acclimatization. Burn procedures were conducted between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM to mitigate circadian variations in inflammatory responses and stress hormone levels, which can significantly impact experimental outcomes [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Measures were taken to minimize discomfort and distress, with continuous monitoring post-burn to assess signs of pain. Euthanasia was carried out following Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines (protocol no. 00001163), using a gradual CO<sub>2</sub> exposure method followed by cervical dislocation as previously described [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All procedures were conducted in compliance with the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines for reporting animal research.</p><p>Clinical murine burn injury model</p><p>Animals were randomly distributed into four experimental groups: young sham, young burn, aged sham, and aged burn, with eight mice initially allocated to each group at each time point. The final analysis included six to eight&#x000a0;mice per group due to technical issues with RNA extraction in a small number of samples. Sample size was determined based on previous studies with similar endpoints that demonstrated statistical significance with n=6-8 per group [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mice were anesthetized using ketamine (55.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.6 mg/kg) before undergoing a full-thickness, 15% total body surface area (TBSA) scald burn injury. The dorsum was shaved, and mice were immersed in 95&#x000b0;C water for 10 seconds, a technique that ensures consistent burn depth and severity as previously validated and described [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Control (sham) mice underwent identical handling and were exposed to room-temperature water (25&#x000b0;C). To mimic clinical post-burn care, all mice received analgesia (buprenorphine extended-release, 0.13 mg/kg) and fluid resuscitation (1 mL subcutaneous normal saline) and were kept normothermic in their cages using warm pads. Mice were monitored for distress, and euthanasia was performed at either 24 or 48 hours post-burn, timepoints selected based on previous studies demonstrating significant hepatic changes within this critical period (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the experimental design and workflow for assessing hepatic sirtuin expression following burn injury in young and aged mice</title><p>(1) Experimental groups: female C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: young sham, young burn, aged sham, and aged burn.

</p><p>Mitochondrial integrity is critical for energy metabolism and oxidative stress regulation, particularly following burn-induced cellular injury. <italic>Sirt3</italic>, <italic>Sirt4</italic>, and <italic>Sirt5</italic> play essential roles in mitochondrial adaptation by regulating specific aspects of mitochondrial function: <italic>Sirt3</italic> deacetylates and activates manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification; <italic>Sirt4</italic> regulates glutamine metabolism and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production; and <italic>Sirt5</italic> desuccinylates and activates multiple metabolic enzymes involved in the urea cycle and oxidative defense [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

</p><p>Genomic stability is essential for cellular survival and tissue recovery following burn injury, as extensive DNA damage and protein misfolding contribute to hepatic dysfunction and impaired regeneration. In burn patients, particularly the elderly, increased oxidative stress and epigenetic dysregulation have been linked to prolonged hepatic insufficiency and heightened susceptibility to organ failure (Figure <xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>) [<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p><italic>Sirt6 </italic>and <italic>Sirt7</italic> play pivotal roles in maintaining genome integrity, chromatin remodeling, and protein quality control [<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. <italic>Sirt6</italic> deacetylates histone H3K9 to facilitate DNA double-strand break repair and regulate telomere maintenance, while <italic>Sirt7</italic> controls ribosomal DNA transcription and protein synthesis under stress conditions [<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, their expression was markedly suppressed in aged burned, and not young burned, mice at 48 hours post-injury. <italic>Sirt6</italic> depletion has been associated with reduced DNA repair efficiency, increased genomic instability, and accelerated aging of the liver through hyperactivation of NF-&#x003ba;B and impaired glycolytic regulation [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The data in this paper suggest that sustained <italic>Sirt6</italic> suppression in aged burned mice contributes to prolonged cellular stress and delays in hepatic regeneration.

The limited expression of genome stability sirtuins provides a potential mechanism for the compromised cellular resilience and regenerative capacity observed in elderly burn patients.</p><p>Age-related impairment in sirtuin&#x000a0;recovery and clinical implications</p><p>One of the key findings of this study is the marked difference in hepatic recovery between young and aged burned mice. Young mice exhibited transient sirtuin&#x000a0;suppression followed by partial or complete recovery at 48 hours, whereas aged mice demonstrated delayed and prolonged downregulation, leading to liver damage. This pattern mirrors clinical observations in burn patients, where younger individuals exhibit a more robust metabolic response, better mitochondrial resilience, and faster resolution of inflammation, ultimately leading to improved hepatic recovery and overall survival [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>These findings are consistent with previous research showing that younger humans have a greater capacity for metabolic adaptation, mitochondrial repair, and inflammatory resolution following burn injury [<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In contrast, aged mice remain in a state of prolonged inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired DNA repair, leading to worsened hepatic outcomes. Similarly, clinical studies have reported that elderly burn patients experience prolonged hypermetabolism, increased oxidative stress, and greater susceptibility to liver dysfunction, contributing to higher rates of sepsis, organ failure, and mortality compared to comparably injured younger cohorts [<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additionally, older burn patients exhibit impaired hepatic protein synthesis, reduced antioxidant capacity, and persistent catabolic stress, all of which further exacerbate metabolic inefficiency and delay recovery [<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The delayed recovery of sirtuins in aged burn-injured mice suggests that advanced age weakens the ability of the body to mount an effective stress response, increasing the risk of chronic liver dysfunction and multi-organ failure in elderly burn patients. Clinically, this is reflected in prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays, increased complications, and higher mortality rates among elderly burn victims, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted therapeutic strategies to enhance hepatic resilience in this vulnerable population [<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic implications and future directions</p><p>Expanding on the clinical significance of these findings, sirtuin&#x000a0;modulation may present a promising therapeutic avenue for burn patients, particularly the elderly [<xref rid="REF44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="REF46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Pharmacological activation of sirtuins has shown potential in preclinical models for mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress. Resveratrol, a well-studied <italic>Sirt1</italic> activator, has demonstrated protective effects against burn-induced inflammation and organ damage in experimental models [<xref rid="REF47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Similarly, NAD<sup>+</sup>&#x000a0;precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide, can enhance sirtuin&#x000a0;activity by increasing cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, potentially improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress in aged tissues [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Based on our findings, targeting specific sirtuin pathways could help preserve mitochondrial function, enhance metabolic adaptation, and reduce prolonged inflammatory states post-burn. For example, <italic>Sirt3</italic> activators might be particularly beneficial in preserving mitochondrial integrity and reducing oxidative stress in elderly burn patients. Similarly, <italic>Sirt1</italic> and <italic>Sirt2</italic> agonists could help attenuate excessive inflammation and promote resolution in the aged liver. Although preclinical studies have shown encouraging results, no clinical trials are currently underway investigating sirtuin modulators in human burn patients. Thus, further research is warranted to explore the safety, efficacy, and translational potential of these compounds, with the ultimate goal of integrating sirtuin-based therapies into clinical protocols to improve hepatic resilience and outcomes in this vulnerable population.</p><p>Additionally, identifying clinical biomarkers for the activity of sirtuins in patients with severe burns could facilitate early intervention and individualized treatment strategies. Measuring circulating levels of sirtuin-regulated metabolites or plasma markers of mitochondrial dysfunction might help identify patients at highest risk for age-associated complications&#x000a0;such as persistent hepatic inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, multi-organ failure, and delayed wound healing. By detecting these risks early, clinicians could implement targeted therapies to mitigate organ dysfunction, improve recovery trajectories, and ultimately reduce morbidity in elderly burn patients.</p><p>Limitations and future research</p><p>Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged to guide future research. First, our study was conducted exclusively in female mice due to the established sex-based differences in burn responses and inflammatory regulation [<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While this approach enhances internal consistency, it limits generalizability to male subjects. Future studies should compare sirtuin&#x000a0;responses in both sexes to develop sex-specific therapeutic approaches.</p><p>Second, while the 15% TBSA murine burn model used is well-established and clinically relevant [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], it does not fully replicate the multisystem trauma and physiological heterogeneity observed in human burn patients. Expanding research to include combined injury models, such as burn with infection or ischemia-reperfusion injury, could enhance the clinical relevance of these findings.</p><p>Third, our analysis focused on sirtuin&#x000a0;gene expression, which provides valuable insights into transcriptional regulation and does not necessarily reflect protein abundance or enzymatic activity. Future studies should incorporate proteomic analysis and enzymatic activity assays to confirm that transcriptional changes translate to functional alterations in sirtuin&#x000a0;activity.</p><p>Fourth, the 24- and 48-hour timepoints provide critical information about the acute phase response. However, they limit our ability to assess long-term hepatic adaptations, including the development of fibrosis, sustained metabolic dysfunction, and regenerative capacity in aged mice. Extended time points would be valuable for evaluating whether persistent sirtuin&#x000a0;dysregulation contributes to chronic hepatic impairment post-burn.</p><p>Finally, while we have identified important correlations between sirtuin expression patterns and age-dependent hepatic vulnerability, the present study does not establish a causative relationship due to its observational design and reliance on gene expression data without functional validation. Establishing causality requires mechanistic studies that go beyond association. Future investigations involving genetic knockout models or pharmacological modulation of specific sirtuins in aged mice will be critical to determine whether restoring or enhancing sirtuin activity can directly mitigate burn-induced liver damage and improve clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study demonstrates that burn injury induces significant alterations in hepatic sirtuin&#x000a0;expression, with distinct age and time-dependent patterns.
