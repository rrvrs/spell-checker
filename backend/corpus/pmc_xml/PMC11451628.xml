The presence of Lewy pathology may be pathogenic, as evidence points to transcriptional and functional deficits of afflicted neurons<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Lewy pathology may also precede degeneration of the cells it affects, as evidenced by time-course experiments tracking the appearance of pathology and subsequent degeneration of neurons in the same brain regions in mice<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, multiple reports of familial variants of PD which occur in the absence of Lewy pathology<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and individuals with abundant Lewy pathology but without neurocognitive deficits<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> leave open the question as to whether Lewy pathology is a pathogenic driver of disease or part of a response to other disease mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Across neurodegenerative diseases, neurons display selective vulnerability to disease-associated pathologies, degeneration, or both; this vulnerability is apparent at the brain region and neuronal subtype level<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In PD, Lewy pathology first emerges in deep subcortical regions, progressing to the midbrain and finally higher-order neocortical regions<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The presence of midbrain Lewy pathology is accompanied by the loss of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), which drives the disease&#x02019;s classical motor symptoms<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In DLB, the progression of pathology differs, with faster progression in limbic and cortical regions<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. In both diseases, neurons show patterns of selective vulnerability to Lewy pathology; in PD, SNc DANs develop abundant pathology while adjacent DANs of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are relatively resistant<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and in DLB, neuritic Lewy pathology develops in the CA2 hippocampal subfield, while the dentate gyrus is spared<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In the neocortex, excitatory neurons (ExNs) develop LBs, while inhibitory neurons (InNs) do not<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, and intratelencephalic neurons of layer 5 (L5 IT), a subtype of pyramidal ExNs, may be more vulnerable to Lewy pathology relative to other ExN subtypes<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Despite an understanding of which regions and cell types are vulnerable to pathology and degeneration, the underlying molecular mechanisms of vulnerability remain to be fully described. Some evidence implicates endogenous &#x003b1;-synuclein expression as a driver of vulnerability to Lewy pathology<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. For example, ExNs, which develop Lewy pathology, express high levels of endogenous &#x003b1;-synuclein, and InNs and non-neuronal cells, which are resistant, express much lower levels<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. However, several observations indicate that endogenous &#x003b1;-synuclein expression does not fully determine cellular vulnerability to pathology and degeneration in synucleinopathies. For example, SNc and VTA DANs both express very high endogenous &#x003b1;-synuclein, but have very different vulnerability, to both pathology and degeneration<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, in multiple system atrophy (MSA), &#x003b1;-synuclein accumulates in oligodendrocytes, despite these cells exhibiting little to no basal &#x003b1;-synuclein expression<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Other work has suggested that factors such as functional connectivity, myelination state, degree of axonal branching, and calcium buffering influence neurons&#x02019; vulnerability, but these links have not been established as causal<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Recent work using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) in the context of tauopathy suggests that there are innate transcriptional differences between vulnerable and resilient neurons which may help explain their vulnerability to tau pathology<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. For example, InNs, which largely do not develop tau pathology, express higher levels of genes in pathways involved in autophagic processing of tau, which could contribute to their resilience<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Similar transcriptional differences may exist in synucleinopathies, which could help explain selective vulnerability to &#x003b1;-synuclein pathologies where &#x003b1;-synuclein expression alone fails to do so, which we sought to address for the first time in the present study.</p><p id="P6">Recent advances in spatial transcriptomic technologies have enabled imaging-based detection of hundreds of genes simultaneously at subcellular resolution. Since these technologies are non-destructive, they can be coupled with downstream analyses, including immunofluorescence (IF) for protein co-detection in the same sections<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. In the current study, we used Xenium, a subcellular-resolution imaging spatial transcriptomic (IST) platform, with a well-characterized transgenic synucleinopathy mouse model which overexpresses wild-type human &#x003b1;-synuclein (<italic toggle="yes">hSNCA</italic>) under the murine neuronal Thy1 promoter (Line 61, &#x003b1;-syn-tg). By performing post-Xenium IF with an antibody against &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylated at Serine 129 (pSyn), we identified cortical and hippocampal cell types that were vulnerable and resilient towards developing this pathology. Next, by creating a custom panel of probes against genes known to be involved in &#x003b1;-synuclein processing, aggregation, and toxicity, we interrogated the transcriptional underpinnings of the selective neuronal vulnerability to &#x003b1;-synuclein pathology in this model. Finally, by independently comparing transcriptomes of healthy non-transgenic (non-tg) neurons to pSyn<sup>+</sup> and pSyn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b1;-syn-tg neurons, we could distinguish conserved transcriptional changes associated generally with <italic toggle="yes">hSNCA</italic> overexpression, such as molecular chaperones and autophagy-related genes, versus those which were pSyn pathology-dependent, including genes related to mitochondria and the endolysosomal system. This study uses novel IST technology to yield new biological insights into the neuronal vulnerability to and downstream effects of &#x003b1;-synuclein pathology in this &#x003b1;-syn-tg mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mouse line.</title><p id="P7">Line 61 (&#x003b1;-syn-tg) mice were originally generated by inserting cDNA for the coding region of human <italic toggle="yes">SNCA</italic> under the control of the mouse <italic toggle="yes">Thy1</italic> promoter<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and is available from JAX (strain #038796).

Cell barcodes from the cortex or hippocampus of each sample were determined by manually drawing regions of interest within Xenium Explorer (v2.0+, 10x Genomics), and the Seurat object was subset accordingly to only contain either cortical or hippocampal cells. After subsetting, data was re-scaled for both cortex and hippocampus independently, followed by the standard Seurat single-cell workflow (RunPCA(), RunUMAP(), FindNeighbors(), and FindClusters()). Due to the relative differences in cell type diversity between the two regions, clustering resolution was set to 0.8 for the cortex and 0.3 for the hippocampus to avoid over-clustering.

Affine transformation matrices of geometric translations and transformations used to align IF images to Xenium data in Xenium Explorer were extracted. IF images were loaded back into QuPath, and the same affine transformations were applied, yielding a transformed image on the same coordinates as those of the Xenium data.

We then subset the ABC atlas object to only include genes which were present in our base or custom Xenium panels. To facilitate direct comparison of expression data between Xenium and the ABC atlas data, gene expression was averaged (using AverageExpression() in Seurat) and scaled across the selected cell types. For correlating expression of individual genes in the base or custom panels, a linear regression was run for each gene, correlating the scaled expression of that gene in the defined cell types in the ABC atlas against its expression in the Xenium data in those same cell types. For comparing cell type gene expression to validate cell type assignments, we first generated &#x0201c;expression profiles&#x0201d; for each cell type in the ABC atlas and Xenium datasets by scaling the average expression of each gene in the base Xenium panel across the same cell types in both datasets independently. We then computed a Pearson coefficient between the expression profiles of ABC atlas and Xenium cell types, obtaining the similarity score between all the cell types from both datasets. Note that for both these analyses (i.e., comparing expression of individual genes and expression profiles of whole cell types), only non-tg cells were used from the Xenium experiments, as to avoid confounds of gene expression changes in &#x003b1;-syn-tg cells.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Pseudo-bulk differential expression analysis.</title><p id="P14">DESeq2<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> was used for pseudo-bulk differential expression analysis.

We also found further selective vulnerability among the ExN subtypes, determining that L5 ET neurons developed the most frequent pathology, while other subtypes even in the same cortical layer (L5 IT and L5 NP) developed pathology less frequently.

Interestingly, we note that the most severe pathology, which extended to the cytoplasm and axons, was also most prevalent in L5 ET neurons, while other neuronal subtypes mainly had pathology restricted to the nucleus. In the hippocampus, we found that InNs were broadly resistant to pSyn pathology, and among the major ExN subtypes, CA1 neurons developed pathology approximately twice as frequently as CA2/3 neurons, while DG neurons exhibited almost no pathology.</p><p id="P54">Recent work performed in human tissue and the &#x003b1;-synuclein PFF model sheds further light on selective neuronal vulnerability to pSyn pathology. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that in the cortex and amygdala of mice injected with &#x003b1;-synuclein PFFs, ExNs are broadly vulnerable to pSyn pathology, while InNs are resistant<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, consistent with our observations in the &#x003b1;-syn-tg mouse model. However, when specifically comparing among ExN subtypes in the cortex of PFF mice and PD cases, L5 IT neurons were vulnerable to pSyn pathology, while L5 ET neurons were resilient<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. It is possible that different model systems (i.e., transgenic vs. fibril seeding) may engage different mechanisms of vulnerability in different cell types.</p><p id="P55">In the hippocampus, work in &#x003b1;-synuclein PFF-injected mice and human DLB tissue has identified the CA2/3 subfield as the most vulnerable to pSyn pathology and subsequent degeneration<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. This contrasts with our current findings in the &#x003b1;-syn-tg model, in which we found CA1 to have the most pSyn pathology. Interestingly, however, prior work in the same &#x003b1;-syn-tg model showed that CA3 neurons, but not CA1 neurons, were vulnerable to degeneration, which was attributed to higher expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the vulnerable cells<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. These results imply that there are distinct mechanisms of vulnerability to pSyn pathology compared to degeneration, and that pSyn pathology may not necessarily precede degeneration of affected neurons.

Further work is needed in mouse models and human tissue of synucleinopathy and other proteinopathies to determine if pathology is invariably upstream of cell death or if separate mechanisms govern vulnerability to these distinct events, and if this process occurs in a cell type-dependent manner.</p><p id="P56">We next investigated which genes included in our Xenium panel may be responsible for differences in pSyn vulnerability across and within cell types. In the context of synucleinopathies, prior work has implicated endogenous &#x003b1;-synuclein expression in the selective vulnerability of certain neuronal populations, at the regional and subtype level<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>.

However, &#x003b1;-synuclein expression does not seem to account for the whole picture of vulnerability to pathology; for example, DA neurons of the VTA express similarly high &#x003b1;-synuclein levels as those in the neighboring SNc, and yet do not develop pathology or degenerate in PD<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Work in the context of tauopathy found that certain protein clearance pathways, centered around the cochaperone BAG3, are expressed more highly in resilient InNs compared to vulnerable ExNs under baseline conditions, potentially implicating deficient clearance leading to protein aggregation and pathology in vulnerable cell types<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.

Similarly, in the cortex, <italic toggle="yes">hSNCA</italic> expression does not correlate with pathology rates across cell types when only analyzing the ExN subtypes, particularly evident when comparing L5 IT and L5 ET neurons, which have nearly identical <italic toggle="yes">hSNCA</italic> expression but greatly different pathology rates.</p><p id="P58">In addition to <italic toggle="yes">hSNCA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Plk2</italic> expression correlates well with pathology rates across all cell types.

However, the exact role of phosphorylated &#x003b1;-synuclein in both the physiological and disease states has remained elusive, and whether preventing &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation by inhibiting Plk2 would be beneficial to slow disease progression is unclear.

However, there were also many genes whose expression was specifically altered in pSyn<sup>+</sup> neurons and where expression did not correlate with <italic toggle="yes">hSNCA</italic> (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Pink1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Prkn</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Vps35</italic>), indicating a more specific cellular response to phosphorylated &#x003b1;-synuclein. Interestingly, this has been demonstrated previously, where a truncated form of &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129, termed pSyn*, was identified in human PD brains and in &#x003b1;-synuclein PFF-treated neurons and mice and was highly mitotoxic, inducing mitochondrial damage and mitophagy in the neurons<sup><xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup>. Finally, many of the transcriptional changes which we observed, pSyn pathology-dependent or not, have been reported in other models of synucleinopathy or in human tissue (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Dnajb6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Hspa4l</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Hsph1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Gabarapl1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Map1lc3b</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ctsb</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ctsd</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Pink1</italic>, among others)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup>, indicating that broader &#x003b1;-synuclein-related cellular dysfunction is reflected in &#x003b1;-syn-tg mice.</p><p id="P63">Importantly, our data suggests that while &#x003b1;-syn-tg neurons with pSyn pathology show unique signatures of transcriptional dysfunction compared to neighboring pSyn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b1;-syn-tg cells, those pSyn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells still experience significant alterations compared to healthy control cells. While this may be expected in a transgenic model where most cells are being impacted by transgene expression, this statement likely holds true in other models (i.e., &#x003b1;-synuclein PFF) and in human disease, as it does for AT8 tau-negative cells from AD brains compared to healthy controls<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Given the abundance of synaptic &#x003b1;-synuclein pathology in the PD/DLB cortex<sup><xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup>, for example, it is entirely likely that neurons which may not harbor LBs are still dysfunctional, transcriptionally and functionally. Thus, simply comparing transcriptomes of pSyn<sup>+</sup> neurons to those of surrounding pSyn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> neurons within the same samples may not capture the full range of dysfunction in both populations of cells when compared to the healthy state. This necessitates independent comparisons of pSyn<sup>+</sup> and pSyn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> diseased cells to cells from healthy controls in addition to within-sample comparisons of pSyn<sup>+</sup> and pSyn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells.</p><p id="P64">There are several limitations to the current study. First, imaging spatial transcriptomics is a newer technology, and bioinformatic analysis techniques are still under development. Specifically, it is likely that instrument hardware and software (i.e., imaging quality, optical crowding, processing speeds), platform chemistries (i.e., probe set sizes, multiplexed protein targets for segmentation), and analysis techniques (i.e., segmentation algorithms, gene count normalization, differential expression) will evolve quickly over the coming years as benchmarking studies are conducted and new pipelines are established specifically for analyzing IST data. As such, we hope that this study and its associated raw data will serve as a resource for the community in developing these tools.</p><p id="P65">In addition, the mouse model we chose to use here, Line 61, has several unique features that may limit generalizability to other models. We chose this model mainly due to the large amounts of pSyn pathology it develops, which adequately powered our differential expression between pSyn<sup>+</sup> and pSyn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells. However, transgene expression is driven under the <italic toggle="yes">Thy1</italic> promoter inserted on the X-chromosome, leading to sex effects which we confirm here. It is also possible that transgene expression, and by extension, pathology formation, is driven by promoter copy number or endogenous expression of <italic toggle="yes">Thy1</italic> transcription factors. &#x003b1;-Synuclein overexpression as a model also has limitations, in that the many-fold increase in protein levels<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> may induce non-PD-relevant neuronal stress, and it is unclear whether phenotypes observed in transgenic and AAV-based &#x003b1;-synuclein overexpression models are due to overexpression or the formation of disease-relevant pathological &#x003b1;-synuclein assemblies<sup><xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup>. However, our observation of transcriptional changes in &#x003b1;-syn-tg neurons which were reflective of alterations seen in other animal models of PD and in LB-bearing neurons of the human brain indicate that we are observing disease-relevant changes, to the extent that is possible in an overexpression model. Finally, this mouse line does not exhibit <italic toggle="yes">bona fide</italic> Lewy pathology; rather, neurons develop nuclear and cell body &#x003b1;-syn inclusions, some of which are proteinase-K resistant, as demonstrated here. Furthermore, however, no synucleinopathy mouse model develops true Lewy pathology, the closest currently being the &#x003b1;-syn preformed fibril model. Now that technology exists to extensively the profile molecular identities of cells with co-detection of pathology in the same sections, we believe it is important to re-evaluate animal models which have been in use for decades, to determine how faithfully each recapitulates aspects of human Lewy body disease (i.e., which cell types develop pathology and the downstream impacts of that pathology), which is what we sought to do in this study with the Line 61 model.</p><p id="P66">Overall, imaging spatial transcriptomics represents a promising avenue for neuropathological research. The ability to combine RNA, protein, and other -omic data in the same tissue sections while maintaining spatial fidelity is invaluable, allowing for the multimodal integration of high-dimensional data with higher confidence than when using any set of individual methods in parallel (i.e., analyzing serial sections or sets of isolated cells). Here, we utilized this novel technology in a mouse model of &#x003b1;-synucleinopathy, identifying neuronal subtypes which were vulnerable to pathology in the model, determining why they were vulnerable, and profiling downstream effects of pathology. Our study provides not only new biological insights into the molecular context of &#x003b1;-synuclein pathology, but also provides a framework for future neuropathological studies to expand upon, utilizing a similar technical toolkit to answer similar questions in other disease models and contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="media-1.pdf" id="d67e2026" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 2</label><media xlink:href="media-2.xlsx" id="d67e2029" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements:</title><p id="P68">We appreciate Dr. Zu-Xi Yu at the Pathology Core in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for allowing us to use the paraffin processor and embedding center.
