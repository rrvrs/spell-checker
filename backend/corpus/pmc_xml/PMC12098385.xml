However, whether immortalized mouse MG cell lines exhibit neurogenic capacities similar to those of primary mouse MG remains unclear. In this study, we examined the morphology, proliferation rate, and marker profile of primary MG cells isolated from postnatal mouse pups with two immortalized mouse MG cell lines, QMMuC-1 and ImM10, in a standard growth medium. After chemical induction, we compared the morphology, markers, direct neuronal reprogramming efficiency, and axon length of these cell types in two culture media: Neurobasal and DMEM/F12. Our results showed that in standard growth medium, QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells displayed similar morphology and marker profiles as primary MG cells, with the only differences observed in nestin expression. However, QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells exhibited much higher proliferation rates than the primary MG cells. Following chemical treatment in both Neurobasal and DMEM/F12 media, a subset of primary MG, QMMuC-1, and ImM10 cells was induced to differentiate into immature neuron-like cells by day 7. While primary MG cells showed similar neuronal reprogramming efficiency and axon length extension in both media, QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells displayed variations between the two culture media. Moreover, some of the induced neuronal cells derived from primary MG cells expressed HuC/D and Calbindin markers, whereas none of the cells derived from QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells expressed these markers. Subsequent observations revealed that induced immature neuron-like cells derived from primary MG cells in both types of media and those derived from ImM10 cells cultured in DMEM/F12 survived until day 14. Taken together, our findings suggest that the two immortalized cell lines, QMMuC-1 and ImM10, exhibited neurogenic capacities similar to those of primary MG cells to some extent but did not fully recapitulate all their characteristics. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to culture conditions and the validation of key results when using immortalized cells as a substitute for primary MG cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>M&#x000fc;ller glia</kwd><kwd>QMMuC-1 cell line</kwd><kwd>ImM10 cell line</kwd><kwd>neurogenic responses</kwd><kwd>chemical induction</kwd><kwd>neuronal reprogramming</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Cell replacement is a promising strategy for replacing lost neurons and restoring vision (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Coco-Martin et al., 2021</xref>). However, cell replacement through transplantation poses several challenges in clinical applications, including the complicated process of creating a reliable cell source, poor survival and integration rates of cells, and other potential side effects (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Coco-Martin et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, cell replacement via <italic>in vivo</italic> direct reprogramming from an endogenous cell source to neurons can overcome these challenges (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Coco-Martin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Direct reprogramming of resident cells to replace damaged neurons is faster and avoids the risk of immune rejection (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, this strategy requires further investigation to address significant limitations such as the low proliferative ability of the endogenous cell source, low conversion efficiency, and immaturity of the converted neurons (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). More importantly, several studies that successfully achieved <italic>in vivo</italic> direct reprogramming lack definitive validation of the origin of the converted neurons, leading to controversy or issues with reproducibility (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). To address this limitation, genetic lineage tracing of the starting cells involved in direct reprogramming should be used to ensure the accurate identification and validation of the reprogrammed neurons (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hoang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Xie and Chen, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have successfully converted M&#x000fc;ller glia (MG), the radial glia in the retina, into retinal neurons by overexpressing neuronal transcription factor genes in adult mice (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Todd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Todd et al., 2022</xref>). However, for clinical use, inducing neuronal conversion using small molecules is desirable because this approach is cost-effective, safe, and easy to control in terms of concentration and timing (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Two studies showed that chemical compounds can convert primary MG cells isolated from rat and mouse pups into bipolar-like cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, one study found that the intravitreal injection of four small molecules induced some MG to migrate into the outer nuclear layer and express rhodopsin, a specific gene of rod photoreceptors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>). Despite these encouraging findings, the efficiency of chemically induced direct reprogramming remains low, and it is not yet understood how small-molecule combinations can be adjusted to achieve the desired retinal neurons.</p><p>In 2015, through two successive rounds of chemical screening with 5,000 and 1,500 small molecules, a set of five small molecules was found to effectively induce mouse fibroblasts into functional neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>). This compound combination was optimized to convert astrocytes into neurons in the mouse brain (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> implementation offers many advantages for screening drug candidates owing to its cost-effectiveness and rapid procedures. Nonetheless, to obtain a pure primary MG population for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, retinas are usually dissociated using several enzymes, cultured, and passaged at least twice (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Pereiro et al., 2020b</xref>). Using this method, only a small number of primary MG cells can be obtained; however, they proliferate slowly and early undergo senescence after four to eight passages (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Pereiro et al., 2020b</xref>). Thus, it requires the use of many postnatal mouse pups to obtain enough cells for experiments, which raises ethical concerns regarding animal welfare. Several MG cell lines have been established and used to study the characteristics and functions of MG, owing to their high proliferative capacity (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Sarthy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Limb et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Tomi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Otteson and Joseph Phillips, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kittipassorn et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the similar characteristics of these cell lines to those of primary MG cells, the immortalization process may change their physiology and behavior compared to primary cells. However, it remains unknown whether these cell lines can serve as useful tools for studying neurogenic characteristics instead of primary MG cells. Here, we show similar and distinct characteristics between primary MG, ImM10, and QMMuC-1 cells grown in growth and chemical induction media. These findings provide useful information on the use of primary MG or immortalized cells to study the neurogenic capacity of MG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Experimental animals</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6J female and male mice were purchased from CLEA Japan Inc (Tokyo, Japan).

However, from day 3, ImM10 cells proliferated remarkably, and on day 7, the mean absorbance at 450 nm of ImM10 cells was approximately 19 times and 2.65 times greater than that of primary MG and QMMuC-1 cells, respectively. The proliferation rate of QMMuC-1 cells increased gradually, with the mean absorbance at day 7 being 7.3 times higher than that of primary MG cells.

We treated primary MG, QMMuC-1, and ImM10 cells with six compounds, including db-cAMP (D, 100 &#x003bc;M), Forskolin (F, 10 &#x003bc;M), Y-27632 (Y, 5 &#x003bc;M), ISX9 (I, 40 &#x003bc;M), CHIR99021 (C, 20 &#x003bc;M), and I-BET151 (B, 2 &#x003bc;M), that have been reported to induce the differentiation of primary mouse MG cells into neuron-like cells (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed massive cell death during a preliminary experiment (data not shown), particularly in QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells. Cell death is a major limiting factor in direct reprogramming (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gasc&#x000f3;n et al., 2016</xref>). A high concentration of small molecules induces rapid neuronal conversion but also causes significant cell death (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we aimed to improve the survival rate by reducing the concentrations of three compounds on day 2 after chemical induction (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, we tested the neurogenic capacity of these cell cultures in two different media: Neurobasal and DMEM/F12. With this new concentration modification, we observed rapid cellular morphological changes in a subset of primary MG, QMMuC-1, and ImM10 cells after chemical treatment in both media (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B, C</xref>). A few QMMuC-1 cells acquired smaller cell bodies with thin extensions by day 3. By day 7, in both types of culture media, numerous primary MG, QMMuC-1, and ImM10 cells adopted neuron-like shapes with small cell bodies and long extensions. In contrast, in the control group with DMSO or with only IBET-151 or ISX9, all three cell types maintained typical MG-like morphology. Interestingly, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with DMSO, most of the ImM10 cells underwent cell death, while these cells still survived and proliferated in Neurobasal medium supplemented with DMSO. This result indicates that DMEM/F12 medium lacks certain factors or nutrients necessary for the survival and proliferation of ImM10 cells, unlike Neurobasal medium.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Morphological changes of primary MG, QMMuC-1, and ImM10 cells after chemical treatment. <bold>(A)</bold> The scheme of the chemical induction procedure.

The results showed that, in both Neurobasal and DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 6 small molecules, most TuJ1-positive cells derived from QMMuC-1 and primary MG cells acquired neuron-like shapes. In contrast, in the Neurobasal medium supplemented with 6 compounds, approximately half of the TuJ1-positive cells derived from ImM10 cells exhibited an MG-like shape (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In DMEM/F12, this rate was lower but still accounted for approximately one-third of the total number of TuJ1-positive cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, in Neurobasal medium supplemented with only ISX9 compound, QMMuC-1 cells showed a comparable rate of TuJ1-positive cells with MG-like morphology to those in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 6 chemicals. This result suggests that ISX9, in combination with Neurobasal medium, has a modest effect on neuronal induction in QMMuC-1 cells. When comparing the neuronal conversion efficiencies of the three cell types induced by 6 small molecules (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E, F</xref>), QMMuC-1 cells showed a higher tendency to become TuJ1-positive and acquire a neuron-like shape. However, a significant difference in this rate was observed only between QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells cultured in the Neurobasal medium. Analysis of the total axon length per cell showed that neuron-like/TuJ1-positive cells from primary MG and ImM10 cells extended to similar lengths in both media (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). However, the axons of neuron-like TuJ1-positive cells derived from QMMuC-1 cells were shorter in the Neurobasal medium. In general, the total axonal length per cell was similar across all cell types. Thus, these results indicate that while the culture medium did not significantly affect neuronal conversion efficiency and axon growth in primary MG cells, chemical induction in DMEM/F12 medium induced more neuron-like cells in ImM10 cells and promoted better axon growth in QMMuC-1 cells than in Neurobasal medium.</p><p>To confirm the neuronal identity of neuron-like cells derived from primary MG, QMMuC-1, and ImM10 cells, we stained these cells with neuronal cell markers (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>) and retinal neuron markers (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B,C</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6B-C</xref>, and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7B-C</xref>). None of the TuJ1+ cells in all three cell types were positive for NeuroD1, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family that highly expressed in developing neurons (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cho and Tsai, 2004</xref>). In addition, TuJ1+ cells in all three cell types were negative for Map2, a marker of mature neurons, confirming that these cells remained at an immature stage. Interestingly, a few TuJ1+ cells derived from primary MG cells were positive for Calbindin in both types of media (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, we detected cells expressing the HuC/D marker in the primary MG cells treated with 6 compounds (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Due to limitations with the host antibody, we could not confirm whether these HuC/D+ cells were also TuJ1+; however, because none of the primary MG cells cultured in growth medium were positive for HuC/D, it is likely that these HuC/D+ cells were induced by the 6 chemicals. Calbindin is a calcium-binding protein primarily expressed in horizontal cells, as well as in some subtypes of amacrine and retinal ganglion cells in the mouse retina (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Poch&#x000e9; et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, HuC/D is expressed in amacrine and retinal ganglion cells, with transient expression in horizontal cells during development (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Ekstr&#x000f6;m and Johansson, 2003</xref>). However, primary MG-derived TuJ1+ cells were negative for Brn3a and Rbpms, two markers of retinal ganglion cells. Therefore, these results suggest that a subset of neuron-like cells derived from primary MG cells were likely directed toward amacrine cells or horizontal cells rather than retinal ganglion cells. There was no difference in the percentage of primary MG cells positive for Calbindin/TuJ1 or HuC/D markers on day 7 between Neurobasal and DMEM/F12 media. Surprisingly, unlike primary MG cells, none of the neuron-like cells derived from ImM10 or QMMuC-1 cells expressed Calbindin or HuC/D. All cell types were negative for Otx2, a marker of bipolar cells and immature photoreceptors, as well as Rhodopsin, a marker of mature photoreceptors. Taken together, these results on day 7 indicate that QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells can be induced into immature TuJ1+/neuron-like cells, similar to primary MG cells. However, unlike primary MG cells, they did not differentiate into amacrine or horizontal cell fates by day 7.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Immunostaining results of neuron-like cells derived from primary MG cells with various neuronal markers and retinal neuron markers. <bold>(A)</bold> Cells were stained with TuJ1 marker and neuronal markers: NeuroD1 and Map2.

In contrast, primary MG cells stop proliferation and undergo senescence after only 4 to 8 passages (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Pereiro et al., 2020b</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells have a higher proliferation capacity than primary MG cells in the growth medium. Simian virus 40 large tumor antigen activation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed a shorter doubling rate and greater viability than in cells cultured under spontaneously immortalized conditions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amand et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, conditional overexpression of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen may induce the ImM10 cell line to acquire a higher capacity to overcome contact inhibition and a faster proliferation rate than the QMMuC-1 cell line.</p><p>Immunostaining of cell cultures in the growth medium revealed that primary MG, QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells expressed GFAP marker. In normal retinas, MG typically show no gene expression or very low gene expression of GFAP (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2006a</xref>). After the retinal injury, MG upregulate GFAP expression, indicating their activation and stress (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2006a</xref>). A previous study reported that freshly dissociated rabbit M&#x000fc;ller glial cells did not express the GFAP gene, but after 2 days of culturing, the cells displayed high levels of GFAP marker expression (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mcgillem et al., 1998</xref>). Other studies have also shown that primary MG cells express GFAP markers even when the primary cells are isolated from normal, healthy pups (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kittipassorn et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, several research groups have reported that primary MG cells do not express GFAP (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hicks and Courtois, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Limb et al., 2002</xref>). The cell isolation protocols used in these studies have many differences, including the type of enzyme used for dissociation and the duration of enzyme incubation. One study suggested that extended soaking during cell isolation in their protocol may reduce the cellular adhesion and the severity of tissue dissociation, resulting in low GFAP gene expression (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hicks and Courtois, 1990</xref>). Thus, the differences in GFAP expression in primary cells in previous reports may be due to the differences in the effects of the dissociation step on MG. The W21M MG cell line, an immortalized whale MG, strongly expresses GFAP at passages lower than 10 but starts to reduce GFAP expression after passage 10 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Pereiro et al., 2022</xref>). Although in this study, the fluorescence signal intensity of GFAP marker in primary MG was comparable to two immortalized cell lines, primary MG displayed a higher variability. Hence, the lower expression of GFAP in QMMuC-1 and more stable expression of GFAP in ImM10 cells compared to that in primary MG cells may be due to the high passage number of the two immortalized cell lines used in the present study.</p><p>The primary MG cells isolated from postnatal mouse pups in the present study expressed nestin and Pax6, consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Pereiro et al., 2020a</xref>). MG express nestin and Pax6 during postnatal development but diminish the expression of these markers in the adult stage (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, a study has demonstrated that a subset of MG cells continues to express Pax6 during the adult stage (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Joly et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies have shown that MG upregulate nestin and Pax6 expression following retinal injury (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Suga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2022</xref>). Both QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cell lines were established from primary MG cells isolated at the postnatal stage; however, QMMuC-1 cells were negative for nestin marker. Interestingly, one study observed that only primary human MG that coexpress nestin and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein, a MG marker, can become spontaneously immortalized in culture (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is possible that at early passages of QMMuC-1 cells, these cells express nestin. However, after several passages, these cells may lose nestin expression for unknown reasons.</p><p>The concentration of small molecules greatly affects neuronal conversion and the survival rate of induced neurons. A previous study halved the concentration of I-BET151 and ISX9 on day 2 after chemical induction and later added neurotrophins, antioxidants, and a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor on day 6 to increase the survival of reprogrammed cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Another study established a strategy to balance the neuronal conversion efficiency and survival rate by adding small molecules in a stepwise manner, with one group of small molecules inducing neuronal reprogramming, while the other group promoting cell survival and improving reprogramming efficiency (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). To reduce cell death, we adjusted the concentrations of I-BET151, ISX9, and CHIR99021 on day 2 after chemical induction. In addition to the small molecule concentration, we found that the volume of the induction medium greatly affected the survival rate of converted neurons. Typically, the volume of the medium has not been reported in direct reprogramming studies. In our preliminary experiments, we observed that a higher volume of induction medium accelerated the direct reprogramming process and caused more cell death, even with the same concentration as in a smaller volume. This observation may explain the differences between our results and those of previous study (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). When we first tested the same concentration of small-molecule combinations to convert primary mouse MG cells into neuron-like cells, we observed low cell survival. The previous study utilized 6-well plates, whereas we used 96-well plates, which are more suitable for drug screening and reduce the number of primary MG cells required for experiments (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). However, although we improved the cell survival with our treatment, the induced neuron-like cells remained in an immature stage at day 14 after chemical induction. Reduced concentrations of these compounds could potentially lead to a slower neuronal reprogramming process or incomplete downregulation of MG gene expression. Thus, our results highlight the importance of small molecule concentrations in cell survival and reprogramming efficiency.</p><p>Although immortalized glial cell lines undergo changes during the immortalization process, many retain a neurogenic capacity that is, to some extent, similar to that of primary glial cells. One study treated primary mouse MG cells with four chemicals and found that this combination upregulated the rhodopsin gene, a specific photoreceptor marker (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>). This finding was validated using a rat immortalized MG cell line, which showed a similar upregulation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>). Another study screened 93 small molecules in a spontaneously transformed mouse astrocyte cell line and identified a combination that converted these cells into glutamatergic neurons (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we investigated the neurogenic characteristics of two mouse immortalized MG cell lines, QMMuC-1 and ImM10, in two types of culture media, Neurobasal and DMEM/F12. Previous studies on direct neuronal reprogramming commonly used these media individually or in a 1:1 ratio (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings demonstrated that QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells were chemically converted into neuron-like TuJ1-positive cells similar to primary cells by day 7 in both media. Interestingly, QMMuC-1 cells showed a higher tendency to convert induced neuron-like cells than primary MG and ImM10 cells. Notably, only ISX9 supplementation in Neurobasal medium was able to induce a subset of QMMuC-1 cells to upregulate TuJ1 expression. Nestin is a marker protein for central nervous system stem cells and progenitor cells, and its expression decreases when these cells differentiate into neurons and glial cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Dahlstrand et al., 1995</xref>). The absence of nestin expression in QMMuC-1 cells may facilitate neuronal differentiation following chemical treatments. Similar to primary MG cells, QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells did not upregulate NeuroD1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor crucial for neuronal generation and cell fate (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cho and Tsai, 2004</xref>), nor Map2, a marker of mature neurons after chemical treatment at day 7.</p><p>Although QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells can be induced into immature neuron-like cells similar to primary MG cells, the induced neuronal cells from these two immortalized lines may not differentiate in the same way as primary MG cells. After stimulation with six compounds, a subset of primary MG-derived neuron-like cells appears to differentiate into amacrine or horizontal cell fates, as indicated by HuC/D and calbindin markers. In contrast, neuron-like cells derived from QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells had not reached the differentiation stage. Another possibility is that TuJ1+ cells derived from QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells could differentiate in the same direction as primary MG cells, but at a slower rate. Therefore, future work is needed to evaluate cell identity at a more mature stage. However, based on these results, we could at least conclude that QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells did not respond to the six compounds in the same way as primary MG cells. The high variability of the GFAP marker in primary MG cells suggests that these cells were quite heterogeneous, which may explain the differences in response between the cell types. Firstly, the primary MG cells isolated from postnatal day 2 pups may contain a small subset that is susceptible to neurogenic stimulation, allowing these cells to differentiated into retinal neurons more easily. In contrast, the QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cell lines underwent many passages, thus may have lost these characteristics.</p><p>We observed that the induced neuron-like cells derived from QMMuC-1 cells could not be maintained beyond day 7 in either Neurobasal or DMEM/F12 media. In contrast, the induced neuron-like cells derived from ImM10 cells in DMEM/F12 survived until day 14 post-treatment, albeit with a gradual reduction in cell numbers after day 7. Primary MG-derived neuron-like cells, on the other hand, survived until day 14 in both types of media. In the retina, MG support retinal neurons by releasing various factors, including neurotrophins (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Tworig and Feller, 2022</xref>). Given that only a subset of primary MG cells is converted into induced neuron-like cells, non-converted MG cells may release neurotrophic factors, thereby supporting the survival of converted neuron-like cells. In contrast, immortalized cell lines lose this characteristic during the immortalization process, as exemplified by QMMuC-1&#x02019;s significantly lower expression of neurotrophic genes than in primary MG cells (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>). The study mentioned above, which used a spontaneously transformed mouse astrocyte cell line, also included neurotrophins in the induction medium from day 0, whereas previous studies typically added neurotrophic factors after transitioning to a mature medium (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes et al., 2022</xref>). It remains unclear why neuron-like cells derived from QMMuC-1 and ImM10 exhibit distinct survival abilities, despite both being immortalized cell lines. Differences in the methods used for immortalization may influence their characteristics.</p><p>Our results suggest that the two immortalized MG cell lines, QMMuC-1 and ImM10, to some extent, can be used to study the neurogenic characteristics of MG and address the limitations associated with the use of primary MG cells. Using the ImM10 cell line can be particularly beneficial for screening purposes because it carries a GFP reporter gene under the rhodopsin promoter, enabling the robust detection of GFP signals when ImM10 cells are converted into photoreceptor cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Otteson and Joseph Phillips, 2010</xref>). Immortalized cell lines are also particularly valuable for studying the neurogenic capacity of MG in human due to the limited availability of primary human MG cells. However, since the induced neuronal cells from these two immortalized lines did not respond to the six small molecules in the same differentiation direction as primary MG cells, validating key findings from immortalized cells using primary MG cells is essential. In addition, the inclusion of neurotrophic factors or other supportive factors in the induction media is crucial for maintaining the survival of induced neuron-like cells derived from immortalized cells.</p><p>While this study provides valuable insights into the neurogenic capacity of immortalized MG cell lines, certain limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, due to the lack of access to early-passage QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cell lines, we were unable to assess and compare their neurogenetic capacity at early and late passages. This limitation prevents a comprehensive understanding of how genetic or epigenetic drift during immortalization may influence neurogenesis. Future studies focusing on early-passage immortalized MG cell lines will be essential for clarifying the impact of passage number on small-molecule-induced neurogenesis and improving the generalizability of these findings. Secondly, the induced neuronal cells in this study are predominantly at an immature stage. Therefore, further work will be necessary to promote their maturation and evaluate their functional characteristics, such as synaptic connectivity and electrophysiological responses. Finally, while our study highlighted differences in cell survival between the induced neuronal cells derived from primary M&#x000fc;ller glia, QMMuC-1 cells, and ImM10 cells in two different media, and suggested potential factors contributing to these differences, we did not perform experiments aimed at improving cell survival. Optimizing conditions to enhance cell survival is a complex task that would require careful adjustments of various factors, and thus, represents an important area for future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we examined and compared the characteristics of primary MG cells and two immortalized mouse MG cell lines, QMMuC-1 and ImM10, in standard growth and neurogenic induction media. In standard growth medium, QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells showed similar morphology and marker profiles, with differences only in the nestin markers. However, the QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells exhibited significantly higher proliferation rates. In the chemical induction medium, QMMuC-1 cells and ImM10 cells were converted into immature neuron-like cells, such as primary MG cells with variations in reprogramming efficiency. However, induced neuronal cells derived from QMMuC-1 and ImM10 cells exhibited differences in their differentiation capacity into retinal neurons compared to primary MG cells. Our experiments also showed differences in the cell survival of induced neuron-like cells derived from the three cell types and the effect of the culture medium on direct neuronal reprogramming.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal study was approved by The Animal Experimental Ethical Review Committee of the University of Tsukuba.
