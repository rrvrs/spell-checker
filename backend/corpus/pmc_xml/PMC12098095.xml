Cervical extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) in early pregnancy provide a non-invasive source for fetal genome acquisition, potentially enabling fetal HLA typing for obstetric risk assessment.

FACS and TRIC were applied to isolate EVT from maternal cells, followed by RSSO-PCR for HLA typing. EVT presence pre- and post-isolation was determined through HLA-G, &#x003b2;-hCG, and Cytokeratin-7 (CK-7) expression.

The degree of HLA (mis)matching has been suggested to affect pregnancy outcome. High levels of HLA sharing within couples are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In contrast, a low degree of maternal-fetal HLA sharing, as seen in oocyte donation pregnancies (OD), is associated with increased risk of complications such as preeclampsia (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Interestingly, successful OD pregnancies show a higher level of maternal-fetal HLA matching than expected by chance (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recently, we showed that, although there is no need for preferential selection of maternal-fetal HLA compatibility in uncomplicated autologous pregnancies, preeclamptic pregnancies show higher HLA-C, HLA class I, and total HLA matching (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Overall, these studies suggest that maternal-fetal HLA compatibility at conception may confer a selective advantage, influencing pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, determining the HLA profile of the fetus early in gestation can contribute to improved risk management of such complications. Unfortunately, in-depth analysis of fetal DNA, and thereby HLA, during gestation is limited by current non-invasive techniques.</p><p>Current prenatal diagnostic techniques for genetic testing, including the Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT), chorionic villus sampling, and amniocentesis, all have their limitations. Among these, the latter two are invasive and carry the risk of fetal loss (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The NIPT analyzes cell-free fetal DNA obtained from maternal plasma, distinguishing small fragments of fetal DNA from the large fraction of maternal DNA (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The technique is clinically approved for chromosome number determination, but still has its limitations as it requires deep sequencing that is associated with high costs and low sensitivity. Moreover, the technique remains limited in its ability to support more detailed analyses, such as chromosomal mosaicism (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Likewise, NIPT is not considered reliable for fetal HLA typing, as the technique requires sufficient genomic coverage for accurate typing (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, the unique HLA expression profile of the circulating fetal trophoblasts &#x02013; characterized by classical polymorphic HLA-C and non-classical oligomorphic HLA-E, -F, and -G, while lacking the other HLA molecules - limits RNA-based approaches, whereas whole genome sequencing remains costly (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Extravillous trophoblasts (EVT), present in the cervical canal from early gestation, are a potential resource to obtain the full fetal genome in a non-invasive manner (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). EVT are unique in their expression of HLA-G, which is not expressed by tissues of the cervix or uterine cavity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This creates an exceptional opportunity to detect and isolate such cervical EVT. The technique of Trophoblast Retrieval and Isolation from the Cervix (TRIC), based on magnetic HLA-G-targeted EVT isolation, has been applied to determine fetal sex, chromosome number variants, and hemoglobin genotypes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Imudia and colleagues were the first to establish a protocol for retrieving EVT based on the simple cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smear using a cytobrush (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These findings along with subsequent studies, indicate that cervical samples may be applied for fetal sex determination, single nucleotide variances detection, and the isolation of intact DNA or RNA for analyzing variance and pathological protein expression profiles (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The EVT yield between 5 and 20 weeks of gestation seemed unaffected by gestational age, maternal BMI, parity, and maternal age (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Cervical EVT are suggested to resemble placental EVT, presenting opportunities to characterize molecules or pathways within placental EVT throughout gestation, including those involved in both pathophysiology and normal physiological processes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Yet, the biological function of the migration of EVT to the cervix remains unexplained.</p><p>Although the TRIC method appears promising and robust, the reproducibility remains uncertain as only one other research center has attempted to replicate the protocol, achieving a significantly lower success rate (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Furthermore, established cell isolation methods, such as FACS for targeting EVT in cervical samples, have not been documented yet, nor compared to TRIC. It has been previously shown that HLA-targeted FACS can reliably separate cells present at frequencies as low as 0.01% (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>We aimed to achieve fetal HLA typing in early pregnancy by isolating EVT from the cervix, to eventually improve risk assessment during pregnancy. This study demonstrates a critical analysis and comparison of TRIC and FACS as new potential methods for non-invasive fetal genomic analysis and its future feasibility for clinical application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All pregnant women (n=32) were recruited from the obstetrics department of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) between May 2022 and November 2023.

This study is the first to demonstrate the potential of cervical samples from pregnant women for non-invasive fetal HLA typing.</p><p>Cervical samples from pregnant women encompassed 0.01-0.04% HLA-G<sup>+</sup> cells throughout all trimesters. These EVT frequencies in the cervical canal were found throughout 5&#x02013;20 weeks of gestational age (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and our results suggest this number is maintained until the third trimester. To accomplish fetal HLA typing, FACS was applied and resulted in a recognizable fetal HLA genotype. In contrast, only the maternal HLA genotype was detected in HLA-G<sup>+</sup> cells isolated using TRIC. The reliable detection limit for HLA typing and Y-chromosome analysis was determined to be 1,000-4,000 cells per locus and 1,000 cells in total, respectively, with fixation negatively influencing the results. The TRIC technique failed to isolate HLA-G<sup>+</sup>&#x003b2;-hCG<sup>+</sup>CK-7<sup>+</sup> cells without significant contamination from remaining maternal cells. Despite optimization of antibody-magnetic nanoparticle binding, increased washing cycles, and the inclusion of additional negative and positive controls, the previously published TRIC results could not be replicated. Furthermore, CK-7<sup>+</sup> cells without &#x003b2;-hCG or HLA-G expression were detected in multiple samples, suggesting that CK-7 is not a suitable marker for EVT detection in the presence of epithelial cells. These findings suggest that EVT cell counts before isolation and the sub-optimal isolation techniques, due to maternal cell contamination, limit the effectiveness of the current RSSO-PCR HLA typing technique in achieving specific fetal HLA genotyping from cervical samples. Despite these challenges, the successful identification of a fetal HLA genotype through FACS underscores its potential as a superior alternative for isolating and analyzing EVT and fetal DNA, offering valuable prospects for obstetric risk management.</p><p>Maternal-fetal HLA compatibility has been repeatedly associated with pregnancy outcome, including recurrent pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, and birth weight (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Therefore, determining the fetal HLA profile early in gestation may contribute to improved risk assessment and management of such complications. Current techniques for fetal genetic analysis, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, are invasive due to their associated risks, while the non-invasive NIPT is limited by low sensitivity and lacks the ability of in-depth DNA analysis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, HLA typing, along with detailed analyses of different chromosomal structures (e.g. translocations, inversions, micro-duplications, micro-deletions), single nucleotide variants, and epigenetic variations, require adequate genomic coverage, which is extremely difficult given the small fetal DNA fragments present in maternal plasma (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>This study pioneers the use of cervical samples from pregnant women for non-invasive fetal HLA typing. FACS resulted in a recognizable fetal HLA genotype. This approach demonstrates potential for clinical application as a relatively fast, non-invasive, and informative technique for fetal HLA typing. The estimated turnaround time from sample collection to test results is less than one week. This includes 2&#x02013;3 days for processing, staining, and FACS-based isolation, followed by an additional day for DNA extraction and HLA typing, provided the logistics allow it.</p><p>One of the challenges yet to be surmounted is the contamination of maternal DNA in the isolated cell population. Despite HLA-G serving as a specific marker for EVT, strict selection of HLA-G<sup>+</sup> cells did not provide sufficient specificity to rule out maternal DNA contamination. False-positive cell contamination stemming from factors such as autofluorescence or cell-free maternal DNA cannot be excluded as potential explanations. We could improve accuracy and gating for HLA-G<sup>dim</sup> cells by including another EVT marker. For instance, we showed that all HLA-G<sup>+</sup> cells also express ITGA1 (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;5</bold>
</xref>), which was absent in maternal cells. Next to increasing purity, optimizing the technique is crucial to reaching the 1,000-4,000 cells per locus threshold for reliable second-field HLA typing by RSSO-PCR. With a maximum of 1,000 HLA-G<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from our samples, increasing the EVT count is essential. This could be addressed by serial cervical smear collections across gestation, with pooled samples increasing the total EVT yield. This approach also allows for a comparative analysis of EVT isolation efficiency across trimesters, assessing the impact of gestational timing on HLA typing feasibility. Tandem MACS using sequential enrichment steps may further improve EVT purity and recovery. Alternatively, leveraging targeted single-cell DNA sequencing may enable reliable HLA typing despite low cell numbers. This would still require specific EVT markers, but techniques such as reverse cross-linking and nuclei isolation could help overcome challenges posed by fixation or cell clumping (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>As a temporary alternative, focusing solely on HLA-C typing and incorporating maternal killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) typing could provide a more targeted analysis. Hiby et&#x000a0;al. and subsequent studies by the Moffett lab found that maternal KIR AA genotypes and fetal HLA-C2 allotypes are over-represented in preeclamptic pregnancies (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Indeed, we further confirmed differently distributed KIR/HLA-C genotype combinations and overall more HLA-C matches in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). While the evidence for the role of paternal HLA-C2 in preeclampsia risk is becoming increasingly substantial, clinical applications remain distant (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Determining the fetal HLA-C2 allotype in early gestation, following further development of cervical EVT isolation, can contribute to obstetric risk management, particularly when integrated with clinical data and serological markers in mathematical prediction models. Another improvement that could enhance the accuracy and reliability of fetal HLA typing is incorporating paternal HLA as a control. This could help reliably determine fetal HLA among maternal HLA, especially for maternal-fetal HLA matching and homozygous HLA genotypes.</p><p>To isolate EVT, FACS was performed as an alternative to TRIC. While FACS had not been used before for EVT isolation from cervical samples, TRIC has been applied for fetal DNA analysis in studies by D.R. Armant&#x02019;s group (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In our study, TRIC failed to yield any discernible fetal HLA alleles, whereas FACS generated a fetal HLA genotype thus approaching a viable result. The absence of fetal HLA in TRIC-isolated cells raises questions about the technique&#x02019;s effectiveness and reproducibility for fetal genomic analysis. Maternal contamination likely played a larger role in TRIC than FACS, with TRIC samples exceeding 90% maternal cells; far above the 10% threshold for reliable RSSO-PCR detection. Post-isolation whole genome amplification (WGA) could help to address the challenge of low EVT counts, but it may amplify maternal DNA more efficiently, potentially overshadowing fetal DNA. With enhanced fetal cell purity post-isolation, WGA could still be beneficial to elevate fetal DNA levels above the detection threshold for HLA typing.</p><p>To date, multiple attempts have been made to replicate TRIC in other research centers unaffiliated with its original development. Single-cell genotyping via laser-capture microdissection succeeded in 21 cases (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, the labor-intensive and low-throughput nature of laser-capture microdissection limits its applicability in routine diagnostic workflows. Van Dijk et&#x000a0;al. (2022) replicated TRIC, but with only a 23% success rate for reliable fetal DNA testing (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Despite a 96% success rate in EVT isolation, maternal DNA contamination also remained an insurmountable challenge. Jain et&#x000a0;al. (2016) suggested the presence of large amounts of cell-free or exogenous maternal DNA in isolated EVT, highlighting the potential need for fetal nuclear isolation with DNase treatment (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Remarkably, Van Dijk et&#x000a0;al. tested various DNA isolation adaptations, including DNase treatments and Nuclear Core Complex antibodies, but these failed to yield fetal DNA (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Additionally, they emphasized the impact of sampling depth, as previous successful TRIC studies involved women undergoing pregnancy termination, allowing more thorough sampling compared to the prospected clinical application, where miscarriage risk must be minimized to the fullest extent possible (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Lee et&#x000a0;al. found that mucus removal before fixation improved EVT purity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Our findings also indicate that fixation negatively impacts results, doubling the required cell number for HLA typing and Y-chromosome analysis. This drawback poses challenges for clinical application, where standardized fixation is preferred over processing of fresh samples due to its flexibility and ability to preserve cell integrity. Nonetheless, considering the significance of fetal HLA typing, particularly in risk assessment for certain patient groups such as oocyte donation pregnancies, it may still be feasible to prioritize fresh sampling (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Further research is needed to optimize cervical sampling protocols, balancing reliability with clinical feasibility.</p><p>The use of EVT markers in previous TRIC studies has complicated accurate identification of these cells. While CK-7 is an effective marker in EVT cultures, its use in cervical samples potentially leads to misinterpretation as epithelial cells share lineage precursors (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We demonstrated the presence of CK-7<sup>+</sup> cells without &#x003b2;-hCG or HLA-G expression in cervical samples of pregnant and non-pregnant women, verifying that CK-7 is unsuitable for EVT confirmation. Likewise, morphological analysis requires caution, as we observed clearly diminished but false-positive &#x003b2;-hCG<sup>+</sup> staining with morphological characteristics resembling epithelial cells. This phenomenon might be the cause for a discrepancy that we observed in the publication of Jain, et&#x000a0;al. (2016), in which immunofluorescent-labelled cells after TRIC clearly resemble the morphology of epithelial cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Mucus and cell clumps may cause non-specific binding, but we found that fixation does not seem to contribute to this. Valuable insights into identifying suitable unique EVT markers may stem from exploring an alternative source for non-invasive fetal DNA: peripheral maternal blood. Hatt et&#x000a0;al. (2014) introduced CD105 and CD141 as potential markers, but noted HLA-G epitope instability in circulating cells, possibly explaining previous failures (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Significant advancements in EVT isolation from maternal circulation may eventually lead to cervical sampling falling out favor. Nevertheless, each approach presents its challenges, such as the rarity of EVT in peripheral blood (1 EVT per 1.5x10<sup>8</sup> maternal white blood cells) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>Future studies could leverage FACS-based cervical EVT isolation to explore its clinical utility. A case-control study of preeclamptic pregnancies could confirm increased maternal-fetal HLA (-C) compatibility as a consistent finding and the feasibility to incorporate fetal HLA typing into risk assessment protocols (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Additionally, investigating to what extent cervical EVT resemble their decidual counterparts may provide insights into their functional relevance. This approach could pave the way for biomarker discovery or application for pregnancy complications such as recurrent pregnancy loss, chronic histiocytic intervillositis and villitis of unknown aetiology, all of which urgently require predictive tools due to the lack of effective early diagnostics (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Since EVT-immune cell interactions play a pivotal role in these disorders, studying cervical EVT could shed light on underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Given the diagnostic value of clustered circulating trophoblasts in placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), cervical EVT isolation could provide a non-invasive screening tool for early risk assessment of PAS (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our investigation into the feasibility of using cervical samples for fetal HLA typing using FACS has demonstrated its potential. A recognizable fetal HLA pattern was found after RSSO-PCR on isolated HLA-G<sup>+</sup> cells, though maternal DNA contamination remains a challenge that requires further refinement. Establishing a detection threshold emphasized the importance of achieving high fetal cell purity for successful HLA typing. Meanwhile, we showed that despite efforts to optimize the technique, the replication of previous TRIC protocols remains elusive. This finding underscores the importance of replicating results, critically evaluating new techniques, and sharing these sometimes unexpected insights with the scientific community to ensure effective and reliable clinical applications. Future improvements could include refraining from using fixation, prioritizing HLA-C allotype detection, exploring additional EVT markers and utilizing single-cell techniques. Future studies could harness FACS-based cervical EVT isolation to explore its broader clinical utility, including non-invasive biomarker screening for various pregnancy complications and research on resemblance of decidual EVT, given the pivotal role of EVT-immune cell interactions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Joke Moes in helping to collect samples, Marie van Dijk (Amsterdam UMC) for guidance on protocol adjustments, and Prof. Dr. Jannie Borst for progress guidance and textual feedback on the abstract.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by Ethics committee of the LUMC (study protocol nr. 22-3091).
