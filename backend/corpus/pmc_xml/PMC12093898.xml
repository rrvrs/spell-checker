FPIES affects infants and toddlers but can persist into adulthood. As there are no extant methods to identify safe foods for FPIES patients, food ingestion trials are performed at home and often lead to reactions and development of food aversions, which may lead to failure-to-thrive and gastric feeding tube requirements. We hypothesized that foods that fail to elicit responses in immune cells of FPIES patients would be safe to ingest, which could support development of a diagnostic method to headstart safe food identification in patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We developed an ex vivo model of FPIES using food-stimulated white blood cells (WBCs) from pediatric FPIES patients and controls by defining a 9-gene panel representative of FPIES ex vivo responses and conducted a single-arm pilot clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Myeloid cells of FPIES patients displayed variable individual-specific myeloid cell reactivity patterns (iMCRPs) to different foods.

Non-IgE food allergies include food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Their mechanisms remain incompletely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, no definitive diagnostic tests or biomarkers for non-IgE food allergies exist. Typical IgE-type allergy testing, which relies on detecting IgE antibodies via food skin or blood-based testing methods, cannot distinguish foods that are safe to eat versus those that trigger reactions in these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">FPIES is a relatively prevalent type of non-IgE food allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] characterized by severe repetitive vomiting reactions to specific foods 1&#x02013;4 h after ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. FPIES affects over 900,000 people in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], primarily infants and toddlers under age three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Foods that cause reactions are called &#x0201c;trigger&#x0201d; foods, while foods that do not are called &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although population studies suggest that some foods pose a higher risk to trigger an FPIES reaction, any food can be a trigger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and work from our own group suggests that the risk profile of FPIES triggers in the population might change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Foods never previously ingested must be &#x0201c;trialed&#x0201d; because there is no existing method to predict if a new food will be safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Food ingestion trials are performed at home without any testing using &#x0201c;low-risk&#x0201d; foods based on FPIES population data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, numerous reactions occur during these essentially random food trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This traumatizes children and families and often leads to profound anxiety, food aversions, gastric feeding tube requirements, developmental delays, severe growth and nutritional deficiencies, and/or reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, the manner in which foods are introduced following standard-of-care (SOC) recommendations is restrictive because patients are advised to trial only low-risk foods initially and to delay high-risk food introductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This approach may reduce patients&#x02019; food repertoires at a critical phase in human development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Initial stages of FPIES after diagnosis, when few or no safe foods had been identified, particularly pose a challenge to patients when the diet is still highly restricted. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel methodology to identify a number of individual-specific safe foods during the early stages of the disease, to provide a sufficient repertoire of foods and circumvent food aversions leading to failure-to-thrive from ensuing.</p><p id="Par24">Development of novel diagnostics is limited by a need for a better understanding of FPIES pathophysiology. While serotonin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and IL-17-related signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] are implicated in the disease pathophysiology based on real-life FPIES reaction sampling, no model systems exist in which to study the disease. In the present study, we developed an ex vivo model of FPIES reactions using peripheral WBCs to define an RNA-based panel of FPIES response genes. We identified that the major source of direct FPIES immune cell responses to food stimulation occurs within myeloid cells. We utilized this ex vivo model as a diagnostic approach to identify a number of safe foods in FPIES and conducted a pilot clinical trial to provide preliminary validation of this model&#x02019;s performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study approval</title><p id="Par25">The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Michigan under IRB protocol # HUM00156027.

Recruitment of FPIES participants was conducted under a single-arm clinical trial of 10 FPIES participants, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04644783).

For non-FPIES controls, the blood was obtained from lead testing samples from de-identified participants. The blood was treated with ACK buffer to lyse the red blood cells, and the total WBCs were plated in a 12-well plate and cultured in RPMI +&#x02009;10% FBS at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO2, and then treated/saturated for 3&#x000a0;h with ~&#x02009;1 mg/ml freshly prepared food homogenate, 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml LPS, or left untreated.

These values were plotted for foods that had been retrospectively identified as triggers, which were labeled as &#x0201c;retrospective triggers&#x0201d;, and foods that had been retrospectively identified as safe foods, which were labeled &#x0201c;retrospective safe&#x02019;s&#x0201d;. These expression values identified a cut-off value of 29.24, at which the NPV was 98.5, which corresponded to a 98.5% chance for a food, of unknown status, to be safe when its expression value of the 9-gene panel normalized to LPS was below 29.24. Foods of unknown safe or trigger status with an expression value below 29.24 were therefore prospectively predicted to be safe, and the list of such foods was communicated to the FPIES participant parent/guardian.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Microarrays and microarray analyses</title><p id="Par33">Microarrays were performed by the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core, and the analyses were performed by the Bioinformatics Core at the University of Michigan.

The random effect in the logit model took into consideration the correlated data measured within the same participant. A cluster Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the precision of the assay. Specifically, the area under the cluster ROC curve (AUC), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI), was calculated.

We simplified the gene list to a 9-gene panel that was robustly detectable by RT-qPCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), and which strongly correlated with the expression of the 208 gene panel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C; each datapoint represents one treatment), indicating that this abridged panel was representative of the global transcriptomic changes per food treatment. Clustering of the responses to different food treatments by a k-means clustering algorithm for the highest 30-induced genes distinctly separated food classifications into 2 clusters: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] a response-lacking food cluster (Cluster 1; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, D), versus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] a response-triggering food cluster (Cluster 2; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), indicating that, irrespective of the nature of the food treatment, the cellular transcriptional responses were similar when induced.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Case study identifies 9-gene panel associated with FPIES triggers. <bold>A</bold> Microarray heatmap of 208 genes that are induced by treating FPIES patient&#x02019;s WBCs ex vivo with 2 known triggers versus 2 known safe foods.

We selected 3 response-triggering foods from the 2 participants, which were known trigger foods for those individuals, and 2 response-lacking foods that were known safe foods. We observed by scRNA-Seq that the induction of the genes from the 9-gene panel was specific to myeloid cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, C). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots showed that the clustering by gene expression for the myeloid cell sub-cluster segregated the untreated and safe food groups from the LPS and trigger food groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D), whereas the T cell sub-cluster or total cell cluster failed to segregate the foods as such (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E, F). Finally, scRNA-Seq from the pooled data in these 2 participants corroborated the induction of each gene of the 9-gene panel within the myeloid cell sub-cluster (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G). These data indicated that the responding cells to short-term food stimulation were myeloid cells, and not T cells. We termed the individual-specific myeloid cell response patterns to different foods &#x0201c;individual-specific myeloid cell reactivity patterns&#x0201d; (iMCRPs). We conclude, based on the microarray and scRNA-Seq data, that iMCRPs of FPIES participants correlate with trigger food induction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Predictive capacity of 9-gene panel for safe foods in FPIES participants.</title><p id="Par44">To assess the predictive capacity of the assay, we first established the baseline responsiveness in FPIES participants versus controls. Control samples were obtained from participants of a similar age group to FPIES participants, ranging from 13 to 25 months (obtained from de-identified samples collected for blood lead testing) (Supplememtary Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x02009;A). We observed that FPIES participants exhibited heightened responses to LPS and to safe food treatments, relative to non-FPIES controls, by inducing significantly higher expression of the 9-gene iMCRP panels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). This indicated the possible existence of an inherent myeloid cell &#x0201c;hyper-responsiveness defect&#x0201d; in FPIES participants. While baseline iMCRP responses in FPIES participants were elevated, the responses to FPIES triggers were, in turn, significantly higher than the responses to safe foods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, C).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Prediction of safe foods for FPIES participants. <bold>A</bold> Expression values of the 9-gene panel of FPIES participants&#x02019; WBC responses to LPS or safe food treatments relative to non-FPIES control participants&#x02019; WBCs.

As it could potentially cause harm to introduce response-triggering foods in the context of a pilot clinical trial, all the trigger foods were documented retrospectively from FPIES reactions that had occurred prior to enrollment in this study. Three trigger foods exhibited low signals, under the threshold of 29.24 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, C), which could have been due to an inaccuracy in initial clinical classification (for example, upon review, these 3 foods had been confounded with other trigger food introductions at the same time as the reaction), or due to inaccuracy of the assay due to the existence of other unidentified pathways mediating food-mediated reactions. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, false positives were also prevalent, and hence the assay could not identify trigger foods, as it yielded low positive predictive values (PPV) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E). As such, response values over 29.24 were assigned as &#x0201c;inderminate&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;predicted triggers&#x0201d;. The goal of the analyses was therefore to solely assess the association of the lack of response ex vivo to safe food ingestion in vivo, which would serve useful for safe food prediction. The area under the curve (AUC) for the ROC curve was 73.16 (p &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F), which was negatively influenced by the low PPV. Hence, low signals in this assay were strongly associated with safe food identification, but high values were indeterminate. However, the identification of a number of safe foods with high specificity via the use of NPV was highly advantageous for the FPIES participants, as shown in the following section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Improved outcomes in participants following assay predictions relative to standard of care</title><p id="Par46">We compared the outcomes of the 10-participant cohort that followed assay predictions, relative to a 113-participant FPIES cohort that followed standard-of-care recommendations at the University of Michigan Allergy Clinic (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the latter of whom were selected to match the trial group (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The demographics of the two groups were comparable in median ages for FPIES onset and first food introductions after diagnosis, numbers of triggers per patient,&#x000a0;gender, and ethnicity (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, 4). 19.5% (22/113) of the FPIES participant cohort experienced a subsequent reaction after physician and dietitian education on trigger avoidance and safe home introduction of new foods per consensus guidelines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). This contrasted with a 0% reaction rate in this pilot 10-participant study following assay predictions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). A more in-depth review of individual food introductions from a representative 20-participant sub-cohort of the 113 SOC cohort, revealed that the percentage of reactions to newly introduced foods was significantly lower in patients following assay predictions than SOC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). The numbers of introduced foods per patient, to calculate the latter rates, were comparable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Importantly, we found that assay predictions altered the manner of food introductions to include a higher percentage of high-risk foods usually avoided under SOC recommendations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D), potentially leading to a more diversified diet.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Improved outcomes in participants following assay predictions relative to standard of care. <bold>A</bold> Percentage of participants with subsequent reactions after first encounter with an allergist who followed the standard of care recommendations versus assay predictions. <bold>B</bold> Percentage of newly introduced foods causing FPIES reactions in a representative 20-participant sub-cohort (of the 113-patient cohort) who followed the standard of care recommendations relative to 10 participant cohort who followed assay predictions. * p &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. <bold>C</bold> The number of foods introduced per patient in the 20-participant sub-cohort (following SOC) relative to 10-participant cohort (following assay predictions). <bold>D</bold> Percentages of successfully introduced foods by food category (low, medium, or high risk) in the representative 20 sub-cohort participants who followed the standard of care recommendations versus the 10 participant cohort who followed assay predictions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13223_2025_968_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Best fit model comprising cow milk, green beans, pear and rice</title><p id="Par47">We identified a best fit model comprising cow milk, green beans, pear and rice, which resulted in an ROC AUC of 93.49 (Supplementary Fig. 5&#x02009;A), and an NPV and PPV of 100% at the cutoff expression value of 1743 (Supplementary Fig. 5B, C). Unlike the model that utilized our total panel of 28 foods, this model did not generate false positives, and as such requires further future validation. FPIES subjects in whom one of these 4 foods were triggers exhibited dramatically higher expression values than those in whom these foods were safe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Identification of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) to partially mediate food-stimulatory responses in myeloid cells, in a distinct manner from LPS</title><p id="Par48">To identify potential pathways that mediate food-stimulatory responses that we observe in myeloid cells, and to determine whether LPS contaminants within food treatments had contributed to these repsonses, we analyzed the scRNA-Seq data from the two subjects described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B&#x02013;G, whose peripheral WBCs were treated with safe foods, trigger foods and LPS. We sub-clustered the myeloid cells pooled from all the treatment groups from the two subjects. The reason for pooling the myeloid cells from all the treatment groups in the sub-clustering procedure was to be able to identify the similarities and differences in the responses of the treated cells between the trigger food-treated versus the LPS-treated groups, relative to baseline untreated, within the same subclustering plot. This allows for identifying, in an unsupervised manner, which cell populations were induced by trigger foods relative to those induced by LPS.</p><p id="Par49">We identified 4 distinct sub-clusters (Supplementary Fig. 6&#x02009;A, B) from the pooled myeloid cells from all treatment groups. We found that trigger food treatments did not induce the 9-gene panel in the same myeloid cell subclusters as LPS did (Supplementary Fig. 6B), with the induction of subcluster 2 appearing to be LPS-specific, while the induction of subcluster 4 appearing to be trigger food-specific (Supplementary Fig. 6B). This led us to screen these two subclusters for the differences in induced receptor expression between them. This screen identified one receptor, the C-type lectin Mincle (CLEC4E), which was induced in subcluster 4 in response to trigger foods, but not in subcluster 2 in response to LPS (Supplementary Fig. 6&#x02009;C). Consistent with the distinctness of the induction of CLEC4E/Mincle receptor by trigger food stimulation (and not LPS) in subcluster 4, we observed that the inhibition of the C-type lectin receptor mediator, SYK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], partially inhibited the panel expression (Supplementary Fig. 6D), whereas TLR4, TLR2 or MyD88 inhibitors, which are known to inhibit LPS-mediated induction of IL-6, failed to inhibit trigger food-induced IL-6 or the remaining genes in our panel (Supplementary Fig. 6D). Hence, this data identified that C-type lectin receptor signaling partially mediates the ex vivo reactions to food treatments, which are independent of the TLR2/4 pathways that mediate LPS signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par50">FPIES is understudied and primarily afflicts a vulnerable population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The FPIES diagnosis carries long-term risks that are not always well-addressed by the current approach to food introductions among patients with multiple trigger foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Most extant FPIES studies are limited to surveys, observational data, or clinical FPIES challenge results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. While these studies are important in the understanding of FPIES, experimental ex vivo models of how food antigens interact with and stimulate immune cells are needed to advance the field. Our study provides the first evidence that iMCRPs could serve as an ex vivo FPIES model. The study provides insight into a novel strategy for potentially identifying safe foods for FPIES patients based on negative predictive value obtained from testing in the ex vivo model.</p><p id="Par51">The iMCRP signals we identified are relevant to previously reported in vivo FPIES reactions. We observed considerable overlap in the genes that we identified as induced in the myeloid cell sub-cluster ex vivo and those that are reported to be induced in the peripheral blood of patients during FPIES reactions, such as IL-6, CCL20, TNF, IL-8, and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Indeed, a fundamental question posed by FPIES is how the innate immune response, which is thought to be one of the major responses underlying FPIES, could vary in food-specificity between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Members of the FPIES field have suspected that the general inability to reliably detect antigen-specific T cell responses in FPIES might be due to tissue residence of antigen-specific T cells in FPIES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The present results, however, suggest that perhaps a crucial part of the FPIES pathogenic response may be related to myeloid cell responses to specific foods. This is an intriguing possibility and warrants further study.</p><p id="Par52">The present study has limitations. First, the occurrence of false positives may lead to the unfavorable outcome of unnecessarily leading patients to avoid certain safe foods. Hence, it is important to explicitly assign the foods that elicit high signals as &#x0201c;indeterminate&#x0201d;, and not as &#x0201c;predicted triggers&#x0201d;. The utility of the present assay approach, if further validated, would solely rely on negative predictive value in predicting safe foods to jumpstart reaction-free food introductions during initial food trialing. This could be very helpful since safe food identification is challenging in the initial stages of the disease when food repertoires are extremely limited. Early life is a key time when food aversions may develop, which could increase the likelihood of failure-to-thrive. Second, given the variety of foods we sought to test, we employed whole food homogenates for ex vivo testing. This could raise the possibility of food contamination, such as with endotoxin. However, the reproducibility of the responses (to the same food treatments) between different blood draws taken at different time points from the same individual, and the lack of TLR inhibitors&#x02019; ability to inhibit the iMCRPs to direct food antigen stimulation, both indicate that these responses may be less likely to be due to endotoxin contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Future work may require comparisons between purified food proteins and the present approach. Third, other food components, aside from endotoxin, might be responsible for the high degree of false-positives in the ex vivo model. It is important to note that the food homogenates used were not digested as they would be in the stomach in in vivo before reaching the duodenum. Therefore, future studies using pre-digested foods with gastric enzymes may address the false positive rates obtained in this assay. Moreover, future studies investigating the specific identity of the moieties that trigger FPIES may also contribute to improving trigger food prediction and PPV for this assay. Fourth, this work included a pilot clinical trial that did not deploy randomization. Given the pilot nature of the trial, this was appropriate, but further work will need to address this. Fifth, we were also unable to prospectively test trigger food predictions with oral food challenges due to the perceived risk of such an action. Future work may require such challenges, depending on the risk level and benefit expected. Sixth, this preliminary study remains under-powered to be able to analyze the association of the induction of each gene &#x02013; within the 9-gene panel &#x02013; to the occurrence of the FPIES reactions as well as the severity of those reactions. These analyses can be the subject of future larger follow-up studies. Seventh, this study focusses on early childhood FPIES, does not address later childhood FPIES or adult FPIES, and only focusses on acute and not chronic FPIES. These limitations can be the subject of future investigations. Eighth, aside from the data on mincle and the SYK inhibitor, the other cluster of iMCRPs was without an identified receptor, so further work may require additional investigations in this regard. Lastly, the RNA-based method requires extensive labor and reagent inputs, making any future scaling of this specific method difficult. However, there are methods, using various protein-based assays, to address this in the future.</p><p id="Par53">Like other understudied disorders, FPIES warrants intense investigation not just for the sake of those afflicted, but also to reveal crucial insights into normal physiology, common mechanisms, and key pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

This work can lay the foundation for a new approach to understanding FPIES pathophysiology, developing FPIES diagnostics, and perhaps ultimately improving care for patients with this disorder. By developing our ex vivo model of FPIES-like food responses, we can help begin to define the genetic and immune underpinnings of individual-specific food responses. Indeed, this initial evaluation of how ex vivo immune cells respond to different food antigens, and the mechanisms involved, can lay a foundation for future development of more definitive approaches to understanding FPIES pathogenesis, diagnosis, and perhaps treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">iMCRPs represent a novel and potentially useful tool that associates with safe food ingestion in FPIES patients for foods that fail to elicit immune cell reactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
