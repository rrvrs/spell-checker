The observed 1.6-fold increase in soluble ST2 levels in heart failure patients with depression emphasizes the importance of mental health assessment and intervention in individuals with chronic medical conditions, particularly heart failure, to enhance overall care and outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec5321"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
