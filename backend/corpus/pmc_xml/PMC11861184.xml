Methotrexate, a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD) that interferes with B vitamin folate metabolism, is the cornerstone of RA management and widely accepted as the first-line treatment for RA patients (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). To optimize RA management, the treat-to-target strategy, which involves regular monitoring and adjusting treatments to achieve and maintain specific clinical targets, has been widely adopted in clinical settings (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The optimal treatment target is to attain long-term remission (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), however in a significant proportion of patients, ranging from 50 to 60%, this is not achieved using methotrexate monotherapy (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Early identification of patients unlikely to achieve remission could allow for tailored treatment strategies with clinical benefits.</p><p>Machine learning-based approaches have facilitated the integration of complex, heterogeneous and multi-dimensional datasets in prediction models. Algorithms such as elastic net (EN), random forest classifier (RFC) and support vector machine (SVM) have been demonstrated as effective in forecasting drug responsiveness (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), including the prediction of methotrexate effectiveness in RA patients (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These algorithms, when integrated through ensemble learning methods such as the super learner algorithm, provide robust and generalizable performance, and have been accordingly employed in our predictive modeling (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Recently, machine learning models have identified various baseline characteristics in predicting methotrexate response. These include biological markers such as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), clinical characteristics such as disease activity score (DAS) (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as well as treatment-related factors like corticosteroid co-treatment (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Despite these insights, the predictive value of these baseline characteristics for non-remission following methotrexate treatment in RA remain underexplored. In an approach to facilitate personalized therapy for DMARD-naive RA patients, we utilized baseline characteristics from 222 DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve patients with RA from the ARCTIC trial to develop machine learning models capable of predicting 6-month non-remission as per ACR/EULAR Boolean, SDAI, and CDAI criteria (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The study aims to assess the predictive performance of these models across various non-remission criteria and identify key predictors at treatment onset for non-remission at 6&#x0202f;months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>Among the 230 patients enrolled in the ARCTIC trial, 224 individuals with available blood samples were approved for data access by the Norwegian regional ethics committee. Two patients were excluded due to insufficient sample quality, resulting in a final study population of 222 patients. This secondary analysis of an existing dataset fixed the sample size by the original trial design and data availability (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). All patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology/The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (ACR/EULAR) 2010 classification criteria for RA, with symptom duration less than two years. Patients were DMARD na&#x000ef;ve with indication to start methotrexate therapy and were randomized 1:1 to a treat-to-target strategy with or without the guidance of ultrasound examinations. Results from the primary analyses of the ARCTIC trial found no significant differences in clinical and radiographic outcomes between the two groups, and for this report the two groups were pooled. Methotrexate monotherapy was initiated combined with bridging therapy with tapering doses of prednisolone from 15&#x0202f;mg/day to 0 over 7&#x0202f;weeks (see details in the previous study) (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The present study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the regional ethics committee (reference number: 2010/744/REK s&#x000f8;r-&#x000f8;st C). All patients provided written informed consent.

Demographic features included age, body mass index (BMI), sex, history of smoking. Main clinical and laboratory measures included time since patient-reported first swollen joint (symptom duration), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), swollen joint count based on 44 joints (SJC44), tender joint count using Ritchie Articular Index (RAI), Disease Activity Score (DAS), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease total score (RAID score) (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), patient global assessment of disease activity (PGA), Physician global assessment of disease activity (PhGA), fatigue, joint pain, the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system physical function, T-score (PROMIS-PF), and finally, dose of methotrexate (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for details).</p><p>Outcomes were non-remission at 6&#x0202f;months assessed across three different criteria: ACR/EULAR Boolean, SDAI and CDAI. The ACR-EULAR Boolean criteria is based on Boolean statuses of four parameters (tender joint count, swollen joint count, CRP and PGA), serving as a stringent measure for assessing remission status. By contrast, SDAI and CDAI criteria employ a composite score comprising tender joint count, swollen joint count, PGA and PhGA, with the former also including CRP (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref> for details). Patients who transitioned from methotrexate monotherapy at the evaluated timepoint due to inadequate efficacy or intolerance, were classified as non-remission. Detailed statistics on the characteristics of patients categorized as remission or non-remission based on these criteria are presented in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Data cleaning and imputation</title><p>Among all baseline measures, six had one or two data points missing from subjects (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). To prevent data leakage, missing values in these features were imputed separately for the training and test sets using the KNN Imputer from the Scikit-learn library. The KNN Imputer, a single imputation method, was chosen for its ability to estimate missing values based on feature similarity. Given the low proportion of missing data (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), the potential bias introduced by imputation is considered minimal. Additionally, missing outcomes according to ACR/EULAR Boolean, SDAI and CDAI non-remission, which ranges from 12 to 13 instances, were imputed through a detailed analysis that consider DAS scores and data from follow-up visits at various time points (for details see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S1</xref>). All imputation procedures were conducted by a module named impute in Scikit-learn in Python 3.8.0 (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Establishment of machine learning models</title><p>To construct machine learning models that integrate all baseline features, all instances were included to predict non-remission. For the simplified model, instances with missing features were excluded for the analysis, resulting in 220 patients for the RAID score-exclusive model. The data were split into two parts: 80% for training model (model development folds) and 20% for testing the model (test fold), as part of the nested 5-fold cross-validation detailed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Categorical features were converted into dummy variables indicating the absence or presence of a category by 0 or 1, and continuous features were standardized separately for training and test data to prevent data leakage. A super learner model was employed, integrating EN, RFC and SVM as base model and logistic regression as meta model. The training process involved two steps: (1) tuning optimal hyperparameter for each base model using 5-fold cross validation with grid search strategy (detailed in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), (2) initializing base models with optimal hyperparameters and generating an ensemble prediction through a weighted combination of predictions from base prediction algorithms via meta-algorithm. The model outputs a probability of non-remission, and final decision threshold was determined to maximize sensitivity while maintaining specificity at 0.60. All procedures were executed by modules (ensemble, metrics, model_selection, linear_model, svm) in Scikit-learn in Python 3.8.0 (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Analytical framework for predictive model development.

Nested cross-validation was preferred to avoid overfitting during model development. In this case, nested 5-fold cross-validation included two layers of cross-validation. The outer layer yielded 5 independent test sets and model development sets, allowing 5 sequential evaluations on test sets unseen by the model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The mean (SD) of these 5 test sets was used for analysis. The evaluation was performed with a minimum of three repetitions to ensure robustness, and the repetition with median performance was selected for presentation. AUC-ROC, sensitivity, specificity and precision were used as evaluation metrics. AUC-ROC measures the model&#x02019;s ability to distinguish between classes, with a value of 1 indicating perfect separation. Sensitivity quantifies the proportion of true positives among actual positives, while specificity represents the proportion of true negatives among actual negatives. Precision, also known as Positive Predictive Value or PPV, refers to the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives (true positives plus false positives). The classification threshold was selected to maximize the sensitivity while maintaining specificity of at least 0.60. All procedures were executed by NumPy and Pandas libraries, and modules (ensemble, metrics, model_selection, linear_model, svm) in Scikit-learn in Python 3.8.0 (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Feature predictive power interpretation</title><p>The predictive power of each feature was evaluated by a composite measure that integrates value of coefficient estimated from EN, feature important from RFC and permutation importance from SVM. All values were normalized using min-max normalization to eliminate the influence of scale discrepancies and ensure a uniform basis for comparison and interpretation. These values were then combined with weights estimated for each base learner by the meta learner. The directionality of association between each feature and outcomes was denoted by the directionality of coefficients from EN.

To assess its clinical utility more thoroughly, we analyzed the dynamic patterns of sensitivity, specificity and precision across various thresholds. These thresholds were used to classify patients into remission and non-remission categories at 6&#x0202f;months. This analysis was conducted on five independent test sets not previously seen during model training. Interpolation methods were employed to compute mean performance curve across these evaluations, as depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. Two classification thresholds were defined for distinct clinical objectives within a simulated clinical context. The first threshold prioritized the identification of non-remission cases by maximizing true positives. For consistency, we retained a previously defined threshold that maximized sensitivity while maintaining acceptable specificity (&#x0003e;0.60). The thresholds determined for non-remission were 0.58, 0.55, and 0.59 for ACR/EULAR Boolean, SDAI, and CDAI criteria, respectively, yielding mean sensitivity values of 0.79, 0.77, and 0.74, with corresponding mean precision values of 0.78, 0.76, and 0.74. The second threshold aimed to minimize false positives, which is critical in scenarios requiring high precision for accurate non-remission predictions. To this end, the classification threshold was adjusted to achieve a mean precision of at least 0.90, corresponding to a false positive rate of less than 10%. We set classification thresholds of 0.86, 0.83, and 0.81 for non-remission based on the ACR/EULAR Boolean, SDAI, and CDAI criteria, respectively, in this case. These thresholds produced mean sensitivity values of 0.23, 0.25, and 0.32, as well as mean precision values of 0.94, 0.93, and 0.96, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Clinical significance of simplified RAID score models.

According to the thresholds identified in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, 32 patients were classified as non-remission under both ACR/EULAR Boolean and SDAI criteria, and 41 under CDAI criteria.

This underscores a pressing need to enable personalized treatment approaches and the early identification of patients who are unlikely to achieve disease remission using methotrexate monotherapy alone. Although various prediction models have been development, comprehensive exploration of accessible baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory predictors for outcomes across diverse remission criteria remains insufficiently studied. Here, we investigated the potential to predict non-remission across three criteria: ACR/EULAR Boolean, SDAI and CDAI in DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve RA patients undergoing methotrexate monotherapy and managed with a treat-to-target strategy. Employing machine learning and nested cross-validation evaluation, we found that models incorporating all baseline features achieved robust predictive performance with an AUC-ROC of 0.75 to 0.76 for non-remission at 6&#x0202f;months. The RAID score emerged as a reliable and robust predictor. The simplified model based solely on the baseline RAID score demonstrated performance comparable to more complex models, underscoring its potential in guiding methotrexate therapy decisions.</p><p>Our study demonstrated high predictive performance across the three non-remission criteria, highlighting the model&#x02019;s robustness across both Boolean and composite scores. This promising performance reveals predictive value of baseline patient characteristics, aligning with other studies that have successfully utilized patient characteristics to predict clinical outcomes like low-disease activity or DAS-based EULAR response criteria (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>A significant finding from our study is the RAID score&#x02019;s powerful predictive capability for non-remission. As a composite measure to assess patients&#x02019; condition, the RAID score was initially developed for use in clinical trials and later adopted in clinical practice (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that the RAID score correlates well with the widely used composite measure for RA severity disease activity score 28 (DAS28), and our previous study also showed high responsiveness of RAID score (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This underscores the RAID score&#x02019;s reliability as a quantitative tool for measuring health status changes. Our current analysis confirms its strong predictive power, making the RAID score-exclusive model&#x02019;s performance comparable to that of the model incorporating multiple baseline features. The superior performance of this streamlined model in terms of sensitivity, precision and specificity make it a valuable and user-friendly clinical tool. It effectively identifies patients unlikely to reach remission at 6&#x0202f;months, thus facilitating more effective tailoring of management strategies.</p><p>A critical consideration is the false positive rate, which poses a risk of overtreatment for patients who might otherwise achieve remission. In the simulation study for predicting non-remission, by setting a high classification threshold, we significantly enhanced the precision of true non-remission case identification, with a marked reduction in false positives. For instance, under the CDAI criteria, precise early identification with a threshold of 0.81 distinguished 42 patients as non-remission out of 133 true non-remission cases, with only 2 misclassifications (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This enables timely intervention with alternative treatments and more rigorous monitoring for these identified non-remission patients, potentially increasing the overall remission rate. However, the trade-off for such a high-threshold strategy-a reduced sensitivity-should be also fully considered. Low sensitivity results in failing to detect the majority of non-remission cases, leading to undertreatment and negatively affecting patient outcomes. To mitigate this, lower thresholds that prioritize higher sensitivity could complement the high-threshold approach by capturing a broader range of potential non-remission cases in advance. Defining multiple thresholds tailored to different clinical objectives, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, can help balance sensitivity and precision, mitigating the risk of both overtreatment and undertreatment in critical practice.</p><p>The strong predictive power of RAID score might be attributed to its comprehensive coverage of seven domains of patient-reported outcomes, which is revealed by the impressive performance of simplified model that includes features, such as fatigue as well as PROMIS-PF indicating physical function. Beyond RAID score, this study verifies the predictive value of other baseline characteristics. Notably, PROMIS-PF, which is a health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) was identified as the notable predictor for ACR/EULAR Boolean non-remission. A higher PROMIS-PF, reflecting better physical condition, is inversely associated with non-remission. This finding aligns with previous study demonstrating that the greater disability indicated by higher HAQ was significantly associated with lower likelihood of remission (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This conclusion is further supported by response outcome prediction models developed by Duong and Gosselt, respectively (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). By contrast, for SDAI and CDAI criteria, fatigue, which has not been fully explored in recent studies, emerged as a significant predictor, particularly for CDAI criteria, revealing its predictive potential. Moreover, the RAI, measuring tender joint count was highlighted as a significant predictor for ACR/EULAR Boolean and SDAI criteria, is in line with previous studies (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The DAS, identified as a significant predictor for DAS-based EULAR response in earlier research, also demonstrated predictive value in the current study, albeit with moderate predictive power, possibly due to its strong correlation with the RAID score (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Additionally, factors such as smoking status, sex and ACPA were not identified as top predictors in the present study aligning with negative conclusions of previous study (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>A strength of this study was that all included patients were DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve and initiated methotrexate as the first-line therapy, with data collection conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice including independent monitoring, ensuring high data quality (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Employing an ensemble super learner model, we enhanced performance and mitigated model selection bias. Additionally, the model evaluation on the independent hold-out test set through nested cross-validation ensure robustness, further strengthening the study. Despite this, external validation in other cohorts is needed to address potential overestimation of model performance, and hence remains a limitation. Further validation in cohorts with different ethnicities and clinical context is essential to validate model generalization before broader clinical integration. Moreover, despite promising AUC-ROC, unavoidable false positives necessitate enhanced precision, potentially achievable through a larger sample size. Other limitations may include a restricted patient number and potential limitations with respect to the examined baseline characteristics.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides convincing evidence of the utility of baseline RAID score in predicting non-remission according to ACR/EULAR Boolean, SDAI, CDAI criteria as outcome measures at 6&#x0202f;months. Accordingly, a high baseline RAID score in DMARD-na&#x000ef;ve early RA patients starting methotrexate monotherapy should serve as a critical indicator for clinicians. This &#x02018;red flag&#x02019; necessitates further evaluation by the proposed model, warranting stringent monitoring to optimize treatment outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the patients for participating in the ARCTIC study, as well as investigators and medical staff for their contributions to patient recruitment and data collection in the ARCTIC study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec18"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="sec25" ref-type="sec">Supplementary material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec19"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving human participants were approved by the regional ethics committee (reference number: 2010/744/REK s&#x000f8;r-&#x000f8;st C) and conducted in accordance with local legislation and institutional requirements.
