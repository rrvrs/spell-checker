The accurate assessment of animal health and welfare relies on the systematic gathering of data about animals, resources and management. In this respect, slaughterhouse surveys offer valuable insights, as distinct tail and skin lesions can act as &#x02018;iceberg&#x02019; parameters, suitable to estimate welfare during the entire animals&#x02019; lifecycle. However, the routine recording of lesions is often costly and time-consuming, making it unfeasible in high-throughput abattoirs. This study aims to train open-source convolutional neural networks for detecting ear biting lesions in slaughtered pigs, as a pre-requisite for a systematic and cost-effective welfare monitoring.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">A total of 3,140 pictures were employed to train and test open-source convolutional neural networks. Investigations were carried out by three veterinarians, who agreed to assess porcine ears using a simplified method, to minimize inter-observers&#x02019; variability and to facilitate the convolutional neural networks&#x02019; training: a) healthy auricles (label 0); deformed auricles displaying alterations in their contour due to real lesions (label 1); postmortem artefacts due to slaughtering (label 2). The entire dataset (training set and test set) was evaluated by one observer, while a supplementary set of 150 pictures was assessed by all veterinarians. Overall, the agreement among observers was very high (<italic>Cohen</italic>&#x02019;s kappa coefficient&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.88).

Lesions resulting from ear biting usually begin at the auricle base or tip and can extend to affect the entire pinna in more severe cases. The prevalence of ear biting usually ranges from 10 to 25% at slaughter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These lesions often start as small scratches or bite marks, later becoming covered with a crust of inflammatory debris, and may ultimately lead to near-complete loss of the pinna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The observation of ear biting lesions at the slaughterhouse can be a reliable indicator for assessing on-farm pig welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Animal welfare is perceived as a relevant challenge within the European Union, prompting stringent regulations and ongoing improvements in livestock production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Over time, the idea has emerged that both negative and positive experiences should be considered when evaluating whether an animal has &#x0201c;a life worth living&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Aligned with these developments, the definition of animal welfare provided by the World Organization for Animal Health is among the most widely accepted: &#x0201c;<italic>An animal experiences good welfare if the animal is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear and distress, and is able to express behaviours that are important for its physical and mental state</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Notably, animal welfare is understood as an intrinsic characteristic of the animal itself, subject to fluctuations and quantifiable through the combination of different measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this context, animal-based indicators are recognized as the most appropriate and are included within widely adopted welfare assessment protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several methods have been developed to score tail and skin lesions, which can act as &#x02018;iceberg&#x02019; indicators of broader welfare issues on farms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Skin lesions occurring at different stages of pig farming remain still detectable at slaughter, making their assessment useful for estimating welfare outcomes across the animals&#x02019; entire lifecycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The systematic record of lesions at postmortem inspection is costly and time-consuming, making it unfeasible in high-speed slaughter chains. In addition, intra- and inter-operators&#x02019; variability raises some concerns about the consistency of data, event when simplified methods are employed (e.g., presence/absence of distinct pathological findings) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technologies could address the above issues, particularly in high-throughput abattoirs, where huge numbers of animals are processed daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Artificial intelligence is a discipline aiming to develop intelligent agents and it is massively impacting upon human activities. When considering medical sciences, the recent success of AI in pathology and diagnostic imaging largely results from the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be effectively trained to solve image understanding challenges. Likewise, AI-based tools have been developed to detect lesions and carcass contamination in slaughtered animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">With this in mind, this study aims to train CNNs for detecting ear biting lesions in slaughtered pigs, using open-source and freely available tools. The performances of such CNNs are compared to those of veterinarians, regarded as the gold standard. The systematic detection of ear biting lesions could contribute to assess pig welfare on farm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and photo acquisition</title><p id="Par8">A total of 1,570 porcine carcasses were randomly selected for this investigation, which was carried out between January 2023 and August 2024.

In this context, a potential link between tail and ear biting has been also hypothesized, with ear biting behavior possibly occurring more frequently when tails are docked short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">In recent years, both the scientific community and the livestock industry have shown interest in the implementation of computer vision (mostly AI-based) at slaughtering. Such an approach could allow the systematic, standardized, and fatigue-proof detection of lesions, thus contributing to assess animal health and/or welfare on farm. As reviewed by Sandberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], a certain attention has been focused on the pig sectors, and this is not surprising as it is among the most intensive and technological ones.</p><p id="Par32">This study fits into the above research landscape. More in detail, it aimed to develop CNNs able to detect ear biting lesions, which are regarded as abattoir-based indicators of on-farm welfare. Notably, Bl&#x000f6;mke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] developed a camera-based system to assess ear and tail lesions. Their algorithm considered ear shape, surface and position, ruling out some additional findings (e.g., otohematomas, artefacts after dehairing). A consistent reliability was seen among observers, while it was lower when compared with the camera-based system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This study shows some similarities with that published by Bl&#x000f6;mke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For instance, the aim and the main features of images are almost identical. However, it is useful to highlight a few peculiarities, which could hopefully contribute to streamline the development of more effective and efficient systems. First, we strictly focused on the evaluation of ears&#x02019; contours, aiming to enhance consistency among observers and to speed up the CNN training. Indeed, subjective and non-standardizable assessments can cause severe biases, which are difficult to be mitigated and could impair the CNNs&#x02019; performances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our investigative approach suitably solved that task, as the agreement among the observers was almost perfect and further increasing over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, free open-source software and AI-powered tools were used herein with promising results. In our opinion, this is worthy of mention, as it suggests that AI-based tools could be widely adopted to address specific tasks.</p><p id="Par33">The CNN training needs thousands of images, taken under various field conditions. This is crucial to manage biases and to suitably develop CNNs, which could be successfully employed in different slaughterhouses. On the other hand, the setup of cameras in several abattoirs is logistically challenging and expensive at this stage. Therefore, as already tested, we built the dataset using smartphones cameras, which are always available, easy to use, and provide suitable pictures (their resolution is usually reduced to lighten the CNN workload) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of course, the CNN needs to integrate with other components to fully automate the entire process, from images&#x02019; collection to sharing results with the stakeholders. In this respect, valuable experiences are being gathered, which could serve as guidelines for routinely application of AI-powered tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">In this study, we used the same CNN twice, assigning a single task at a time, as this approach can lead to better performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is impossible to define universally accepted cut-off values to assess CNN capabilities, as they closely depend on the context, application, and data complexity. The CNNs developed herein achieved high values of accuracy (&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.88), specificity (&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.89), and sensitivity (&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.86). Such performance is consistent with those reported in similar studies, even when compared with investigators who did not contribute to the training process. For instance, existing CNN models report sensitivity values ranging from 0.77 to 0.96, and specificity values ranging from 0.86 to 0.99 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, there is always room for improvement. This is a distinct feature of AI-based tools, which can progressively enhance their experience and skills. As a rule, CNNs&#x02019; performance can be further improved by increasing the dataset size and enhancing the balance of the dataset among the different classes (i.e., healthy <italic>vs</italic> lesion <italic>vs</italic> artefact). It is also worth noting that the CNNs were trained on images of heavy white pigs. Although ear profile is unlikely affected by its size or skin pigmentation, augmenting the dataset with pictures of lightweight and/or pigmented pigs could be beneficial to support the broader application of these CNNs.</p><p id="Par35">Slaughtering procedures often induce prominent artefacts, which might complicate the detection of lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As far as skin lesions are regarded, conflicting data have been reported about the effect of routine slaughtering process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In our experience, artefacts represent a challenge to detect ear lesions in slaughtered pigs, both for veterinarians and for CNN. This challenge greatly varies among different abattoirs and could be solved by taking pictures before brushing, whenever needed and allowed by the slaughter plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">A broad consensus exists that postmortem inspection can yield valuable data regarding animal welfare and health. In this context, ear biting lesions are considered reliable indicators of animal welfare in pig farming. Artificial intelligence-based systems have been designed to detect and/or score lesions in slaughtered animals, convolutional neural networks representing a particularly important technique. We consider that this investigation contributes further insights in this field of research, suggesting that suitable performance can be achieved even with freely available tools, especially when the task is strictly defined and relatively simple. The setup of cameras at key points along the slaughter line, combined with the development of more effective tools, might enable stakeholders to assemble their own ideal puzzle, aiming to fulfil specific needs in a cost-effective manner.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Authors gratefully thank Dr. Matteo Chincarini (University of Teramo) for critical reading the introduction paragraph, and Prof. Francesca Vaccarelli (University of Teramo) for kindly reviewing the English format of the manuscript.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, G.M., A.R.
