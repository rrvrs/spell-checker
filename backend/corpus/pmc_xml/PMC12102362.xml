In eukaryotes, rRNA accounts for most of the total RNA content, often comprising over 80% or more of the transcriptome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Precisely, in common baker&#x02019;s yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, rRNA constitutes approximately 70&#x02013;80% of the total RNA content, whereas tRNA and mRNA comprise only 15% and 5%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In other eukaryotes, the rRNA content in total RNA is very similar, as demonstrated, for example, in HEK293 cells (~&#x02009;85%), rat liver (~&#x02009;80%), human kidney (~&#x02009;85%), human pancreas (~&#x02009;85%) or <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (~&#x02009;85%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The problem of rRNA contamination becomes apparent during downstream transcriptome analyses. The overwhelming presence of rRNA can bias sequencing results by dominating the read counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This bias reduces the sensitivity and accuracy of differential gene expression analysis, leading to misinterpretation of experimental results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, rRNA can hinder the detection and analysis of other RNA species, including low-abundance transcripts such as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are particularly interesting in many research areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Caused by rRNA contamination, low sequencing depth of non-rRNA species can also induce difficulties for their secondary structure mapping, using strategies coupled with NGS, such as SHAPE-seq, SHAPE-MaP, or DMS-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Diverse methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of rRNA contamination and improve the accuracy of downstream analyses. They aim to capture the population of polyadenylated RNAs or to selectively remove rRNA molecules while preserving the integrity and representation of other RNA species. Oligo (dT)-based methods rely on the hybridization of the poly(A) tails of RNA molecules to oligo (dT) probes attached to magnetic beads. It allows for selective capture and enrichment of eukaryotic polyadenylated RNA species, excluding most RNA molecules that lack poly(A) tails, such as most rRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These techniques are straightforward and relatively simple to implement but limited to polyadenylated transcripts and, therefore, are not suitable for capturing non-polyadenylated RNA species, such as most ncRNAs. On the other hand, if poly(A) RNAs are the aim of the study, these methods significantly enrich a pool of full-length transcripts. Targeted rRNA-depletion methods are typically based on the application of oligonucleotides complementary to rRNAs to separate or degrade them in total RNA samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The specifically hybridized probes can be physically extracted together with rRNA using streptavidin-covered magnetic beads or can be recognized and cleaved by duplex-specific nucleases. An essential limitation of targeted rRNA depletion is the necessity of application species-specific probes. Moreover, the effectiveness of targeted rRNA depletion may be reduced since probes used in commercially available kits may only partially cover rRNA sequences or do not target 5S rRNA at all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we comprehensively analyzed mRNA enrichment strategies for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> total RNA. We compared the efficiency of the targeted rRNA depletion (RiboMinus&#x02122; Transcriptome Isolation Kit from Invitrogen) and poly(A) RNA selection (Poly(A)Purist&#x02122; MAG Kit from Invitrogen, and Oligo (dT)<sub>25</sub> Magnetic Beads from New England Biolabs). Our data demonstrate that following a single round of mRNA enrichment under recommended conditions, rRNA still makes up roughly 50% of the total yeast RNA content, regardless of the method utilized. Therefore, we explored strategies to enhance mRNA enrichment efficiency. It involved testing different ratios of oligo (dT) magnetic beads to RNA and implementing a pre-treatment step, resulting in two rounds of mRNA enrichment. As a result, we present improved experimental conditions that reduce rRNA content in total yeast RNA to less than 10%. We also show that in vivo RNA modification with 2-methylnicotinic acid imidazolide (NAI), a widely used SHAPE reagent, does not interfere with the mRNA enrichment protocol developed in our study. Additionally, we demonstrate that the TapeStation electrophoresis can be successfully used for rRNA content assignment as an attractive and cheaper alternative to NG sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Optimizing mRNA enrichment: one round is insufficient</title><p id="Par5">To establish the most efficient way for mRNA enrichment in yeast total RNA samples, we evaluated two different commercially available reagent sets: The RiboMinus&#x02122; Transcriptome Isolation Kit from Invitrogen (in subsequent sections referred to as RiboMinus kit or RM) and the Poly(A)Purist&#x02122; MAG Kit from Invitrogen (referred to as MAG kit or MAG) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

As recommended, we used 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of total yeast RNA per single purification reaction with the RiboMinus kit (300:1 beads-to-RNA ratio). 75&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of total yeast RNA was applied for a single reaction with the MAG kit, and the beads-to-RNA ratio was 1:1. According to the manufacturer, the MAG kit allows such a low ratio without efficiency loss due to the improved buffer recipe. For the (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads, the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol was designed for direct mRNA isolation from mammalian cells that lack a cell wall, and it combines cell lysis and mRNA binding steps. Therefore, to enrich mRNA from an already isolated total yeast RNA sample, we followed the protocol of Green and Sambrook, including the recommended 13.3:1 beads-to-RNA ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To evaluate the efficacy of applied mRNA enrichment strategies, we quantified the 18S and 25S rRNA content in total yeast RNA using the TapeStation capillary electrophoresis system. This system provides a high-resolution separation of RNA fragments based on their size, allowing for the detection and quantitative analysis of distinct RNA populations. We quantified the electrophoretic bands corresponding to rRNA using the ImageQuantTL 10.2 software by measuring the areas under the peaks. The obtained data were presented as a percentage of the remaining rRNA, calculated relative to the total RNA content in the sample.</p><p id="Par7">Upon analyzing the input total RNA sample, two leading bands or peaks representing the 18S and 25S rRNAs were detected on electropherograms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,B). The total RNA population consisted mainly of rRNA (82.7%), with 18S rRNA accounting for over 36% and 25S rRNA around 46% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). For all tested approaches of mRNA enrichment, we detected a decrease in the intensity of 18S and 25S rRNA signals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,B, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Nevertheless, rRNA still accounted for approximately 50% of the RNA in the output samples, showing low efficacy of all tested procedures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). The MAG kit and (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads depleted comparable portions of both rRNAs, with the MAG kit demonstrating a slightly higher 25S rRNA removal. The RiboMinus kit primarily reduced the 18S rRNA content, with a weaker reduction observed for the 25S rRNA. The average RNA output ranged from 2% to 3.9% of the total RNA input, with the MAG kit exhibiting the lowest yield (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The Qubit assessment of RNA integrity showed that none of the applied methods caused RNA degradation and all output RNA samples exhibited a very good quality (RNA IQ score above 8.5).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Comparative analysis of yeast mRNA enrichment efficiency using diverse methods.

We found that lowering the ratio from the recommended earlier 13.3:1 to 6:1, or even 1:1, has a negligible impact on the efficiency of mRNA enrichment (54.4% vs. 59.1% and 51.6% of rRNA content, respectively) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). It showed that applied mRNA enrichment protocol allows using significantly smaller amounts of (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads without efficiency drop, lowering the cost of the procedure (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). When we increased the beads-to-RNA ratio to 25:1, the rRNA content measured after the mRNA enrichment dropped to 32.7%. The further ratio increase to 50:1 and 125:1 reduced rRNA content to about 20% in RNA output samples. It represents a significant improvement in mRNA enrichment over previously recommended conditions. However, it also necessitates the usage of a substantial quantity of (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads, which may not be cost-effective. To avoid using the extremely large amounts of magnetic beads, we reduced RNA input from 75 to 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for the highest beads-to-RNA ratios. The percentage of RNA output ranged between 3% to 7.4% for 75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and 2.5&#x02013;6.7% for lower RNA inputs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).

The first round of mRNA enrichment was performed with beads-to-RNA ratios of 13.3:1 and 1:1. All RNA from the first round was taken to the second round, where the beads-to-RNA ratio was adjusted to 13.3:1 or 90:1. Using the 1:1 ratio in the second round could significantly reduce the beads consumption. However, in this study, where the maximal tested RNA input was 75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and assuming a 3% RNA output (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C), the volume of beads in the second round would be too small to operate correctly (only 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l). Nevertheless, it can be used instead for much higher total RNA inputs. For all samples, we found a substantial decrease in the intensity of the 18S and 25S signals, reaching levels between 8 and 12%, with the most favorable results observed in the 1:1&#x02014;13.3:1 ratio combination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A&#x02013;C, Supp. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

It is worth noting that the efficiency of the two-round procedure was very satisfactory, independent of applied beads-to-RNA ratios in each round. In addition to enhanced mRNA enrichment, this approach allows the use of much smaller amounts of magnetic beads than the application of one-round mRNA enrichment with the three highest tested (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads-RNA ratios (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Although the relative RNA output of the second round was notably higher than that of the first round (Supp. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), the improved efficiency of the two-round procedure was accompanied by lower final RNA output, ranging from 0.45 to 1.14% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Results of a two-round mRNA enrichment using different (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads-to-RNA ratios.

We considered the relation between the amounts of total RNA processed and reagent consumption as a crucial factor when choosing the approaches for the two-round procedure. Thus, the combinations we used were: MAG kit&#x02014;RiboMinus kit, MAG kit&#x02014;(dT)<sub>25</sub> beads, (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads&#x02014;RiboMinus kit. We have decided against using the RiboMinus kit as the first step due to its low throughput and high cost (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The input cannot exceed 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA per reaction, and as a result, the average output did not exceed 400&#x000a0;ng (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). This would necessitate the application of a significantly higher quantity of reagents to obtain enough RNA for the second round of mRNA enrichment. On the other hand, the MAG kit was not employed as the second step in the two-round mRNA enrichment.

To that end, we modified the yeast transcriptome with NAI in vivo, applied two rounds of mRNA enrichment with (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads, and estimated the rRNA level using Tape Station (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Although the DNA digestion step is typically performed during or immediately after RNA isolation, we performed it after the first round of mRNA enrichment. It allowed us to use a lower amount of DNase due to the reduction of non-polyadenylated RNA in the total RNA pool. Results from the TapeStation analysis indicated that this procedure resulted in even lower rRNA content in the final RNA samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B, C). This improvement, however, was not a consequence of NAI modification, as the control sample treated with DMSO only (-) exhibited the same rRNA level as the sample treated with the standardly used NAI concentration (100&#x000a0;mM). We observed slightly lower rRNA content in the sample treated with 200&#x000a0;mM NAI. Thus, we claim that NAI treatment does not reduce mRNA enrichment efficiency. Moreover, the additional purification procedures after the DNA digestion step (e.g., RNA precipitation with ethanol or isopropanol) can contribute to efficiency improvement.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Results of the two-round mRNA enrichment after in vivo RNA modification with NAI.

We evaluated the efficiency of mRNA enrichment conducted with two ready-to-use kits and oligo (dT) magnetic beads combined with custom buffers. We showed that a single round of enrichment in recommended conditions proved insufficient, with still approximately 50% of rRNA content in total RNA output, regardless of the approach employed. Surprisingly, neither of the commercial kits outperformed the (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads regarding rRNA depletion. Therefore, we explored strategies to enhance mRNA enrichment efficiency. It involved testing different magnetic beads-to-RNA ratios and implementing a pre-treatment step, resulting in the two-round mRNA enrichment. Eventually, we found conditions that allowed for a much better reduction of rRNA content. Additionally, we present that the TapeStation capillary electrophoresis can be used for rRNA content assessment as an attractive alternative to NG sequencing.</p><p id="Par15">Using (dT)<sub>25</sub> magnetic beads, we showed that increasing the beads-to-RNA ratio significantly improved mRNA enrichment. Of note, decreasing the ratio from 13.3:1 to 1:1 has a negligible effect. Nevertheless, we achieved the highest efficiency in rRNA depletion by applying the two-round mRNA enrichment. Based on various combinations tested, we selected the two-round enrichment with (dT)<sub>25</sub> magnetic beads, especially the combination of 1:1 and 13.3:1 ratios, as the best and most time- and cost-effective option (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The ratio lowering in the second round could also be considered for larger RNA inputs than those applied in this study. The two-round approach can reduce rRNA content to less than 10% in the final RNA sample. Such an efficient rRNA drop was not achieved in any single-step procedure, even at the highest tested beads-to-RNA ratio. However, the improved efficiency of mRNA enrichment was accompanied by a lower relative RNA output compared to the single-round procedure. On the other hand, the two-round approach requires significantly fewer magnetic beads to process the same amount of total RNA compared to the single-step procedures with the best mRNA enrichment efficiency. The additional economic advantage of the (dT)<sub>25</sub> beads is the possibility of their regenerating and reusing in subsequent experiments.</p><p id="Par16">Nevertheless, the choice of the mRNA enrichment strategy should also be influenced by the study&#x02019;s goal and downstream analyses planned. Studies of RNA expression levels have demonstrated that the choice of rRNA depletion approach affects RNA-seq results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Zhao et al. showed that methods based on poly(A) selection offer superior exonic coverage and improved accuracy in gene quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. On the other hand, rRNA depletion-based methods also capture nascent transcripts that have not yet undergone the polyadenylation process, significantly increasing the proportion of intronic sequences from pre-mature mRNAs (up to 50% of mapped reads). Consequently, more reads must be generated to achieve the same level of exonic coverage as when using the poly(A) selection approach. Similarly, Jaksik et al. demonstrated that poly(A) selection leads to better outcomes in analyzing gene expression and structural aberrations, while methods based on rRNA removal are more suitable for detecting various classes of RNAs, mutations, or polymorphisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">The persistence of some rRNA contamination, even after two rounds of mRNA enrichment, may be attributed to the substantial predominance of rRNA, constituting more than 80% of total RNA in yeast. It may pose a risk of non-specific rRNA binding to the oligo (dT) beads and, thus, their appearance in the RNA pool after elution. Moreover, although poly(A) tails are conventionally regarded as a distinguishing feature of mRNAs, polyadenylation of yeast rRNAs was also reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. While the detected amount of polyadenylated rRNA is low, it becomes significant considering rRNA great abundance in the total RNA pool. A similar observation was also described for 18S and 28S rRNAs in human cells, where many post-transcriptionally added tails contained not only but primarily adenosines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This phenomenon may contribute to rRNA &#x02018;background&#x02019; when utilizing oligo (dT)-based approaches for mRNA selection. Our study omitted the presence of 5S rRNA in the total yeast RNA samples. According to the manufacturer, the RiboMinus kit does not target and deplete 5S rRNA. However, recent work demonstrates that applying the RiboMinus kit designed for bacteria allows the removal of approximately 40% of the 5S rRNA, as confirmed by the qPCR method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">In the case of SHAPE experiments, a very high sequencing depth for each RNA nucleotide is needed to provide high-quality information about RNA secondary structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The simplest way to entirely circumvent the challenge of rRNA contamination involves employing gene- or region-specific primers in the modification detection during the reverse transcription process. However, non-specific primers must be used to obtain SHAPE data for the transcriptomes. Thus, finding the most efficient rRNA depletion strategy is still critical. Importantly, we demonstrated that RNA modification with one of the leading SHAPE reagents, NAI, does not impede the mRNA enrichment with (dT)<sub>25</sub> magnetic beads.</p><p id="Par19">To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly investigate the impact of NAI-based SHAPE probing on mRNA enrichment efficiency for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.

Therefore, although NAI was used in that study, its impact was not evaluated in the context of the standard protocols involving rRNA removal or mRNA enrichment.

Finally, 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of reverse transcriptase enzyme (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) was added, and the solution was incubated at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min, at 42&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;h, at 75&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min, and cooled at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After that, EDTA was added (to the final concentration of 6&#x000a0;mM), followed by incubation for 5&#x000a0;min at room temperature and the addition of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (to the final concentration of 6&#x000a0;mM). Second-strand synthesis was conducted using NEBNext&#x000ae; Ultra&#x02122; II Non-Directional RNA Second-Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs) at 16&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;h. The obtained dsDNA was purified using GeneMATRIX PCR/DNA Clean-Up Purification Kit (Euryx) and eluted with 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l water. In the next step, samples were precipitated by ammonium acetate (5&#x000a0;M), glycogen, and ethanol at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min and recovered by centrifugation at 16,100&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 30&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. dsDNA pellet was washed once with 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of 70% ethanol and resuspended in 15&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of water. The final dsDNA amount was measured using Qubit high-sensitivity dsDNA assay (Invitrogen). The following steps of library preparation and sequencing were performed by Novogene (UK). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform (NovaSeq) using a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;bp read configuration, resulting in a total data of 60&#x02013;115&#x000a0;Gb obtained in three replicates, with about 89% of the base calls having a quality score above Q30. Sequencing reads alignment to 18S and 25S ribosomal RNAs was performed using Bowtie2, implemented in ShapeMapper 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec170" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
