While PRP affects both sexes equally, it exhibits a bimodal age distribution, with peaks in the first and fifth decades of life [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The characteristic features of PRP include palmoplantar keratoderma (thickening of the skin on palms and soles)and follicular hyperkeratotic papules, which gradually coalesce into orange-red scaly plaques. These plaques typically exhibit well-demarcated areas of uninvolved skin, often described as <italic>islands of sparing</italic>&#x000a0;or <italic>nappes claires</italic>&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to its chronic nature and&#x000a0;noticeable PRP lesions, PRP can significantly impact patients' psychological well-being, social interactions, and overall quality of life [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Griffiths introduced a classification system in 1980, categorizing&#x000a0;PRP&#x000a0;into five subtypes. Subsequently, Miralles et&#x000a0;al. expanded this classification in 1995 to encompass a sixth subtype, which is characterized by concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a poorer prognosis, as described in previous classification studies&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Management of PRP involves tailored approaches based on disease extension and severity. Topical therapy is recommended for localized forms, such as PRP type III, and is often used adjunctively with systemic therapy for severe cases to alleviate cutaneous symptoms. Medium to high potency corticosteroids, keratolytics, emollients, and Vitamin D derivatives are commonly employed for localized forms. Systemic treatment is reserved for moderate-to-severe disease, with retinoids being the mainstay therapy. While most cases respond favorably to retinoids, refractory cases pose a challenge, with limited standardized treatment protocols available due to the rarity of PRP. In recent years, biological agents have emerged as promising options for refractory cases, targeting cytokines implicated in PRP pathogenesis such as TNF-alpha and IL-17. Phototherapy, including ultraviolet B (UVB) and psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, may also be effective, although responses vary among patients. Methotrexate and other immunosuppressants are considered alternatives for second-line treatment, while newer therapies like apremilast and extracorporeal photochemotherapy show promise in select cases. The management of PRP requires a tailored approach considering disease severity, treatment response, and potential adverse effects, with ongoing research needed to establish standardized treatment guidelines [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we report a PRP case of a 71-year-old male with improved status due to ustekinumab treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>The patient was a 70-year-old male with a known medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN).

The surgical pathology report dated February 12, 2023, revealed findings from a 3 mm skin punch biopsy taken from the patient's abdomen, collected due to pruritic papules present all over the body for the past two years. Microscopic examination displayed features consistent with a PRP-like eruption, characterized by broad epidermal ridges with thick suprapapillary plates with few scattered lymphocytes and a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils in the dermis, alongside slightly dilated superficial vessels (Figures <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The report mentioned a PRP-like eruption and raised a query regarding a potential association with the initiation of insulin therapy or another drug. However, no recent changes in medication were identified. The patient remained on his existing regimen throughout the disease course, including during recovery. Although the initial pathology report described the findings as a <italic>PRP-like eruption</italic>,&#x000a0;this term is sometimes used in histopathology to indicate atypical features&#x000a0;that are suggestive but not fully diagnostic without definitive clinical correlation. However, as will be detailed later in this report, the clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and sustained response to targeted therapy supported a diagnosis of classic PRP rather than a drug-induced eruption.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Histopathological features of PRP.</title><p>Histopathological image showing flaky hyperkeratosis; mild epidermal acanthosis with broad rete ridges and thick suprapapillary plates (low magnification).</p><p>PRP, pityriasis rubra pilaris</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082660-i02" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Histopathological features of PRP.</title><p>Histopathological image showing dilated papillary dermal vessels with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and notable eosinophils (high magnification).</p><p>PRP, pityriasis rubra pilaris</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082660-i03" position="float"/></fig><p>The clinical and histological findings shed light on the patient's dermatological condition, guiding subsequent treatment decisions and follow-up evaluations. Subsequently, the patient commenced oral acitretin (25 mg) OD for a month and betamethasone cream (0.1%) applied topically twice daily for one month to manage inflammatory skin lesions.</p><p>Seven weeks after initiating the acitretin regimen, the patient reported an improvement in his condition. Laboratory tests conducted revealed normal lipid and hepatic profiles. The treatment plan included continuing acitretin 25 mg orally&#x000a0;OD&#x000a0;and antihistamines 10 mg OD at bedtime for one month.</p><p>The patient's follow-up visit after a month (four weeks) revealed a normal hepatic profile, normal total cholesterol, and a triglyceride level of 114 mg/dL. The patient remained clinically stable with no new flare-ups, and the treatment regimen was continued without modifications. During this visit, urea cream (10%) was added to the treatment regimen to be applied topically OD, along with soft white paraffin twice daily for three months, to mitigate xerosis. Oral acitretin (25 mg) OD was continued for one month. The patient was scheduled for follow-up in one month; however, he missed the appointment and returned&#x000a0;approximately&#x000a0;10 weeks later after his last visit.</p><p>At this delayed follow-up, about five months since the initial visit, the patient presented with a flare-up of symptoms, which was attributed to a five-week lapse in acitretin use following the end of his last prescribed course. Laboratory tests, including liver function tests (LFT) and total yellow globules (TYG), were within normal limits. The patient continued antihistamines for pruritus management and was&#x000a0;restarted&#x000a0;on oral acitretin (25 mg) OD to address keratinization abnormalities associated with PRP.</p><p>The patient was seen three weeks later&#x000a0;after resuming&#x000a0;acitretin treatment. Unfortunately, no clinical improvement was observed, and the patient's symptoms had worsened. Although the&#x000a0;flare was initially associated with a brief interruption in acitretin therapy, the lack of response despite resumption further supported the need for treatment escalation. Given the limited response over several months, ustekinumab was initiated during this visit as a second-line agent, based on its efficacy&#x000a0;in refractory PRP and its favorable safety profile in older adults.</p><p>Consequently, ustekinumab therapy 90 mg subcutaneous (SQ) once monthly was administered alongside clobetasol propionate cream (0.05%) applied topically OD for one month to address inflammatory skin lesions, in addition to continued antihistamines for pruritus control. He attended a follow-up appointment one month later since the start of ustekinumab therapy with topical clobetasol propionate. The patient demonstrated clinical improvement (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Throughout the biologic therapy course, the patient tolerated ustekinumab well, with no reported adverse effects. Finally, ustekinumab was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 90 mg once monthly, consistent with the treatment regimen since the initiation of therapy.</p><p>This case demonstrated a clear timeline of treatment response over one year, beginning with initial presentation in February 2023 and progressing from systemic retinoids to biologic therapy, ultimately resulting in complete resolution by March 2024.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PRP&#x000a0;is a rare inflammatory dermatosis characterized by erythematous plaques with follicular hyperkeratotic papules, often involving the entire body surface area.

The therapeutic approach varies depending on disease severity, patient characteristics, and response to previous treatments. Systemic retinoids, such as acitretin, have effectively managed PRP by modulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our patient showed partial improvement with acitretin therapy; however, due to persistent symptoms, ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 and -23, was initiated, resulting in significant clinical improvement [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In cases of refractory PRP, biologic agents targeting specific cytokines implicated in disease pathogenesis have shown promising results. Risankizumab, a selective inhibitor of interleukin-23, has been successfully used to treat PRP in children, highlighting its potential in managing severe cases [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-17A, rapidly cleared PRP lesions in an HIV-positive patient, underscoring the role of targeted immunotherapy in challenging cases [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Ustekinumab was selected over other biologics due to its established efficacy in refractory PRP and a favorable safety profile in older adults [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors such as ixekizumab and risankizumab have shown promise, particularly in resistant or pediatric cases [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], ustekinumab&#x02019;s broader immunologic target (IL-12/23) and its proven long-term tolerability made it a suitable second-line agent in this case. Despite initial partial response, the recurrence of symptoms and lack of improvement following the reintroduction of acitretin suggested emerging therapeutic resistance [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This clinical course supported the need for timely escalation to biologic therapy.</p><p>This case highlights several important clinical considerations in the management of PRP. First, the importance of histopathological examination in confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions cannot be overstated, particularly in cases with atypical clinical presentations or overlapping features with other dermatoses. Second, the sequential escalation of therapy from topical agents to systemic agents, including retinoids and biologics, underscores the need for a tailored approach based on disease severity and response to treatment. Finally, the successful outcome observed with ustekinumab therapy suggests its potential utility as a promising treatment option for refractory cases of PRP, although further studies are warranted to elucidate its long-term efficacy and safety profile in this context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this case highlights the complexity of managing PRP, with histopathological confirmation playing a key role in diagnosis and therapeutic planning. It demonstrates the effectiveness of ustekinumab in treating refractory PRP after an incomplete response to acitretin. The patient&#x02019;s gradual, sustained improvement supports the consideration of interleukin-targeting biologics as a viable option for managing severe or treatment-resistant PRP. With a clearly documented one-year treatment course, this case reinforces the value of stepwise escalation in PRP management. Continued research is needed to identify targeted therapeutic strategies to&#x000a0;improve treatment outcomes and enhance the quality of life for affected individuals.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
