Higher intramuscular fat (IMF) accumulation in Chinese indigenous breed pigs is associated with their special gut microbiota structure. However, the specific microbes and metabolic pathways responsible for lipid deposition are still poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In the present study, a comparative analysis of the gut microbiota and metabolome in obese Ningxiang (NX) pigs and lean Duroc&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Landrace&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Yorkshire (DLY) pigs was conducted. The results revealed a higher abundance of gut lactobacilli and a correlation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism pathway in NX pigs. We proceeded to verify the roles of various lactobacilli strains originating from NX pigs in BCAA metabolism and lipids deposition in SD rats. We demonstrated that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> is a fundamental species responsible for modulating lipid deposition in NX pigs and that increased circulating levels of BCAA are positively linked to greater lipid deposition. Additionally, it has been verified that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> originating from NX pigs has the ability to improve BCAA synthesis in the gut and enhance IMF content in lean DLY pigs. The expression of genes related to lipid synthesis was also significantly upregulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Taken together, our results imply that NX pig-derived <italic>L. reuteri</italic> regulates BCAA metabolism and plays a potential role in improving the meat quality of lean pig breeds through modulation of host intramuscular lipid deposition.

There are a range of factors that impact meat quality, of which intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a crucial indicator and is strongly linked to pork tenderness and flavor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, diet and breed have been identified as primary determinants in the formation of meat quality traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Chinese indigenous pig breeds are well-known for their exceptional meat quality, which is distinguished by elevated IMF values and desirable meat color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The gut microbiota undergoes mutual selection and adaptation with the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous study has shown that Chinese indigenous pig breeds, such as the obese Sanjiang pigs exhibit distinctive metabolic and microbial profiles compared to lean Yorkshire pigs, which could be linked to their diverse metabolic phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests a causal relationship between gut microbiota and host metabolic phenotypes, potentially mediated through metabolites derived from the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Certain gut microbiota-derived metabolites have exhibited either anti-obesity or pro-obesity effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For instance, short-chain fatty acids have been found to mitigate lipid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Conversely, trimethylamine-N-oxide has been demonstrated to expedite fat deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Gut microbiota is also a potential regulatory factor in amino acid homeostasis, and the correlations of BCAA profiles and gut microbiota have to be identified in some disease models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Branched-chain amino acids&#x000a0;(BCAAs) have well been demonstrated to regulate lipid metabolism and increase IMF content in pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. BCAA metabolism may serve as a potential mechanistic link of gut microbiota influencing muscle fat accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the present study was conducted to analyze the correlation between gut microbial composition and BCAA metabolism using obese Ningxiang (NX) pigs and commercially available lean Duroc&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Landrace&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Yorkshire (DLY) pigs. To further establish the causal connection between lactobacilli and branched-chain amino acid metabolism, <italic>L. reuteri</italic> was isolated from NX pigs crucial bacterial biomarker that elevated circulating and ileal contents&#x000a0;levels of BCAAs. Additionally, the substantial presence of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> from NX pigs facilitated the promotion of IMF deposition in DLY pigs by influencing BCAA metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="Par7">The experimental procedures received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Hunan Agricultural University.</p><p id="Par8">A total of sixty finishing pigs including thirty DLY pigs and thirty NX pigs were used in this study. DLY pigs with similar genetic backgrounds and body conditions were individually housed in the finishing barn of the farm of Hunan Longhua Agricultural and Livestock Development Co Ltd., Chaling County, Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province. NX pigs with similar genetic backgrounds were reared at the farm of Hunan Chuweixiang Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Co., Ltd.. NX and DLY pigs were fed according to their respective feeding standards, respectively. All pigs were free to drink water, and the feeding management was carried out uniformly according to the company&#x02019;s breeding norms. Ileal mucosa, colonic contents, and muscle were isolated and collected for analysis.</p><p id="Par9">Fecal samples were obtained from NX finishing pigs and used to isolate <italic>L. mucosae</italic>, <italic>L. reuteri</italic>, and <italic>L. salivarius</italic>. The samples were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and then serially diluted to 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>. Different diluted samples were plated on MRS agar and were subjected to a temperature of 37&#x000a0;&#x02103; for 2&#x000a0;days in an anaerobic workstation, with a gas mixture comprising 80% N<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 10% H<sub>2</sub>. A solitary colony was picked from the plates and refined via streaking of the bacterial colony on modified MRS agar. The single strain&#x02019;s 16S rRNA gene was amplified with two universal primers (27F: 5&#x02032;-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3&#x02032; and 1492R: 5&#x02032;-TACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3&#x02032;), followed by sequencing through the Sanger method. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were then aligned with the NCBI nucleotide sequence database to distinguish three strains. Isolated strains&#x02032; growth curves were determined. Isolated strains were utilized in the experiments conducted on rat and pig cultures, as shown in Fig. S1. Furthermore, the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> XY227 isolated from NX pig fecal samples was reserved at the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC M 20231546 XY227). <italic>L. reuteri</italic> XY227 was subsequently processed into powder form by CRVAB Bio-technology Co., Ltd.</p><p id="Par10">Male SD rats, 7&#x000a0;weeks old, were procured from Boresen Biotech Company (Hunan, China).

They had unrestricted access to food and water. After acclimatizing for one week, the rats were assigned randomly to four groups of ten replicates each and one rat per replicate. NC group comprised of rats administered oral sterile saline (1&#x000a0;mL), LM group comprised of rats administered oral <italic>L. mucosae</italic> (1&#x000a0;mL, 10<sup>9</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/mL); LR group comprised of rats administered oral <italic>L. reuteri</italic> (1&#x000a0;mL, 10<sup>9</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/mL); LS group comprised of rats administered oral <italic>L. salivarius</italic> (1&#x000a0;mL, 10<sup>9</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/mL). All groups were treated once daily for 8&#x000a0;weeks. The body weight (BW) of the rat was measured by weighing the rat on a scale for one week. Blood was sampled from the heart and serum was collected to measure BCAA levels. The inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), perirenal adipose tissue (PAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), gastrocnemius muscle, ileal contents, and feces were quickly frozen and stored at&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p><p id="Par11">Sixteen castrated DLY pigs with an average initial body weight of 63.36&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.28&#x000a0;kg were randomly divided into two groups, with each group consisting of eight replicates and one pig per replicate. One group was fed a normal diet (NC), while the other group was given LR, which contained 0.4% (w/w) <italic>L. reuteri</italic> (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>11</sup>&#x000a0;CFU/kg normal diet). The diets were formulated to meet the nutrient requirements recommended by the NRC (2012). Pellet feed was used in the experiment and bacteria powder and feed were mixed evenly before feeding. The pigs were kept in a typical environment with a natural light regime, 50% to 60% humidity, and a temperature of 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;&#x02103;. No antibiotics were given in advance to the pigs to comply with the antibiotic-free production standard. Throughout the entirety of the experiment, the pigs had free access to food and water. The treatments were consistently administered for a duration of 50&#x000a0;days. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3500&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and the supernatants were stored at&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis. Samples of longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM), jejunum, ileum, ileal contents, and colonic contents were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

The PCR amplification was conducted using the following optimal conditions: initial denaturation at 98&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;s, followed by 32&#x000a0;cycles of denaturation at 98&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;s, annealing at 54&#x000a0;&#x02103; for 30&#x000a0;s, and extension at 72&#x000a0;&#x02103; for 45&#x000a0;s. A final extension at 72&#x000a0;&#x02103; for 10&#x000a0;min was performed. The size of the PCR products was confirmed by performing 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.</p><p id="Par13">The amplicon pools underwent sequencing preparation, with the size and quantity of the amplicon library assessed utilizing an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) and the Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosciences, Woburn, MA, USA), respectively. The NovaSeq PE250 platform was employed to sequence the libraries, whilst the LC-Bio provided manufacturer recommendations for sequencing the samples on an Illumina NovaSeq platform. Paired-end reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and subsequently truncated by removing the barcode and primer sequence. The paired-end reads were then merged using FLASH software. Quality filtering on the raw reads was performed with specific filtering conditions to obtain high-quality clean tags according to fqtrim (version 0.94). Chimeric sequences were filtered out using Vsearch software (version 2.3.4). Finally, after dereplication using DADA2, a feature table and feature sequence were obtained. Alpha and beta diversity were calculated by random normalization of the same sequences. The feature abundance was normalized using the relative abundance of each sample, according to the SILVA (release 138) classifier. Alpha diversity, which analyses the species diversity complexity of a sample through the calculation of five different indices (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, Pielou-e), was determined using QIIME2. The beta diversity was also calculated by QIIME2, and the R package was used to produce graphs. Sequence alignment was performed using Blast, and annotations of feature sequences for each representative sequence were obtained from the SILVA database. Diagrams were produced using the R package (v3.5.2). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis was used to identify the differentially abundant genera between the two groups. Microbial functions were predicted using PICRUSt2 against KEGG databases using default parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Metabolomic analysis</title><p id="Par14">The muscle and colonic contents samples (30&#x02009;~&#x02009;100&#x000a0;mg) were homogenized with an equal volume of PBS and centrifuged at 12,000&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> for 5&#x000a0;min.

To determine whether the superior fat deposition performance of NX pigs is related to microbial function and metabolic function, we first investigated the differences in microbial and metabolic functions of colonic contents between obese NX pigs and lean DLY pigs and found that NX pigs harbor a distant gut microbiota compared with lean DLY pigs (Fig. S1A). Furthermore, the microbial function of the KEGG pathways was then predicted by LEfSe (Fig. S1B).
