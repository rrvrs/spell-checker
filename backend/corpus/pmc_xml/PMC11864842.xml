Advances in surgical techniques have significantly improved outcomes for children with CHD. Common surgical procedures include repair of septal defects, such as atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs), as well as correction of complex anomalies such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and transposition of the great arteries. Despite these advancements, it is crucial to assess the exercise capacity of children with CHD. This evaluation provides insights into their cardiovascular function and helps tailor appropriate exercise recommendations. Children with CHD often exhibit reduced exercise tolerance due to factors such as altered heart function, limited blood flow, or impaired oxygen delivery. Assessing their exercise capacity through standardized tests, such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT) or cardiopulmonary exercise test, helps clinicians gauge their functional abilities and determine any limitations. Understanding a child's exercise capacity guides medical management and also aids in designing personalized exercise programs to promote cardiovascular health and overall well-being. Regular assessments can track changes over time, ensuring optimal care and enhancing the quality of life (QOL) for children living with CHD. These two case reports examine the exercise capacity of two children with CHD who underwent surgery for VSD. Both children participated in the 6MWT, covering 223 and 183 meters, respectively. The physiological responses of these two CHD patients during the exercise test are discussed in this case series. This case series provides information regarding the cardiovascular adjustment during the 6MWT and various causes that affected them to complete the 6MWT.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>6-minute walk test</kwd><kwd>congenital heart disease (chd)</kwd><kwd>exercise capacity</kwd><kwd>pediatrics</kwd><kwd>valve surgery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital heart diseases (CHD) represent a spectrum of structural abnormalities in the heart that are present at birth, affecting approximately 1% of newborns worldwide. These defects can involve the heart walls, valves, or blood vessels, leading to disruptions in its normal function [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are various types of CHD, each with distinct characteristics and impact on cardiovascular health. The CHD is classified as left to right shunt or right to left shunt. Common types include ventricular septal defects (VSD), atrial septal defects (ASD), and aortic valve stenosis&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Treatment of choice for CHD is mainly corrective surgery or palliative surgery. Core surgeries for CHD focus on correcting these structural abnormalities to restore proper heart function and prevent long-term complications. Among these procedures, closure of VSD and ASD with repair of valve defects, stand as pivotal interventions. These surgeries are vital in alleviating symptoms such as cyanosis, heart failure, and impaired growth [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The inflammatory response and tissue trauma following surgery also contribute to temporary muscle weakness and fatigue.</p><p>Additionally, postoperative pain and medication side effects may limit mobility and hinder exercise tolerance. This decline in exercise capacity underscores the importance of structured rehabilitation programs aimed at improving cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall functional capacity. Post-surgery assessment is crucial, especially in pediatric patients [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Evaluation often involves sub-maximal tests such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT), which measures exercise capacity and functional status. Parameters such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, and perceived exertion on the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale offer valuable insights into recovery progress. The 6MWT is a non-invasive test frequently used to measure exercise capacity in post-cardiac surgery patients [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During the 6MWT, patients are tasked with walking as far as possible within a 20-meter straight path, turning at each end. The goal is to cover the maximum distance in the allotted time of 6 minutes. Patients are encouraged to move at their own pace without direct influence from the examiner, emphasizing a natural and self-selected speed throughout the test [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The assessment of the 6MWT in the pediatric population following cardiac surgeries lacks sufficient evidence. By understanding their postoperative functional status through the 6MWT, healthcare providers can design interventions to enhance cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength. This approach not only aids in immediate recovery but also lays the foundation for lifelong habits of physical activity, promoting an active and healthy lifestyle into adulthood. Further research and utilization of the 6MWT in this context can lead to improved outcomes and better long-term health prospects for pediatric cardiac surgery patients. Here, we present the case of two patients' exercise capacity assessment with the help of a 6MWT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>Case 1</p><p>A 3-year-old male child, weighing 9 kg, presented with recurrent cough and cold.

Advances in surgical techniques and postoperative care have contributed to shorter hospital stays, promoting faster recoveries while ensuring patient safety and well-being [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that physical capacity in children with CHD is lower compared to healthy controls with limited exercise capacity and a shorter lifespan related to health [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Limited exercise capacity favors a more sedentary lifestyle, a situation that can be maintained into adulthood [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Exercise capacity is one of the main factors when assessing health-related quality of life (QOL), prognosis, risk of morbidity, and early mortality from cardiovascular, metabolic, or respiratory disease [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It can be evaluated by a standardized laboratory test such as the cardiopulmonary exercise test&#x000a0;or standardized field tests such as 6MWT, shuttle walking test, time up and go, or similar tests [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Assessing the exercise capacity of children and adolescents with CHD&#x000a0;is crucial for enhancing their functional status and overall QOL. This evaluation plays a pivotal role in identifying potential poor prognostic factors associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Geiger et al. found that the average distance traveled by healthy individuals in the 3- to 5-year age group was 544 meters. In our assessment, our patients covered 183 and 223 meters, respectively. This comparison underscores the impact of CHD and postoperative recovery on exercise capacity in pediatric patients [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The assessment of 6MWT&#x000a0;in the pediatric population following cardiac surgeries lacks sufficient evidence. However, it is crucial to evaluate the exercise capacity of these patients to develop a personalized exercise regimen for their rehabilitation. Enhancing exercise capacity can support patients in maintaining an active lifestyle into adulthood.</p><p>In assessing 6MWT in children, we encountered challenges during the test, with one child being distracted and pausing mid-way while another started weeping midway. These interruptions highlight the need for adjustments in the 6MWT protocol when working with pediatric patients. These modifications aim to create a more engaging and supportive testing environment, addressing issues, such as attention span and emotional comfort. Overcoming these challenges requires tailored adjustments to enhance engagement and comfort during the test, fostering a more cooperative environment. Improving communication strategies, incorporating interactive elements, and considering child-friendly incentives can aid in achieving more reliable and insightful results from 6MWT in pediatric patients. These modifications are crucial for the effective evaluation of exercise tolerance and functional capacity in this young age group. Patient discharge assessment post-cardiac surgery is essential for ensuring optimal recovery and reducing readmission rates. Effective assessment helps healthcare providers tailor postoperative care plans, including medication management, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up appointments, promoting continuity of care and preventing complications [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The presented case reports highlight the response of 6MWT in pediatric CHD patients operated for VSD. The 6MWT emerges as a valuable tool for evaluating exercise capacity and functional outcomes post-surgery. The 6MWT&#x000a0;can be effectively utilized in cooperative patients, particularly with pediatric populations. However, limitations arise when children may not readily obey commands, so modifications are necessary for accurate assessments. Prior evaluations on cooperation levels and establishing a relationship with the child can significantly impact the test's reliability and outcomes.&#x000a0;Further studies are needed to incorporate additional components, enhancing cooperation in pediatric patients during 6MWT.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Ritik V.
