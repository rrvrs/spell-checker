Our previous studies demonstrated that AKR1B1 knockdown reduced the motility and proliferation of CRC cell lines, and its elevated expression was correlated with increased mesenchymal marker expression, inflammation, and poor prognosis in CRC patient cohorts.

Notably,&#x000a0;AKR1B1&#x02010;expressing macrophages were predominantly of the M2 phenotype, and AKR1B1 expression and M2 marker expression showed strong positive correlation in bulk transcriptomic data. Immunofluorescence confirmed the colocalization of CD163 and AKR1B1 in stromal macrophages.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may help in the development of more effective therapies. CRC is distinct from most tumors due to its interplay with the gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in shaping the TME. In addition to the microbiome, CRC cells also interact with various cellular components such as immune cells, cancer&#x02010;associated fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in either promoting or suppressing tumor development [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Aldo&#x02010;keto reductases (AKRs) are a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze an extensive range of oxidation&#x02013;reduction reactions. They are mainly cytosolic, monomeric (34&#x02013;37&#x02009;kDa), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)&#x02010;dependent oxidoreductases and are involved in many critical metabolic events in health and disease [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. AKRs can reduce aldehydes and ketones (carbonyl groups), including glucose, retinals, and a number of drugs to their corresponding primary and secondary alcohols [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we have shown that high AKR1B1 mRNA expression in bulk colorectal tumor specimens was associated with worse prognosis, which could be validated using publicly available transcriptome data from multiple datasets&#x000a0;[<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mechanistically, we showed that AKR1B1 expression was associated with high mitogenic signaling via the MAP Kinase pathway as well as rapid cell cycle progression, along with the activation of NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B and inflammation [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="cam470974-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other studies have shown that AKR1B1 may play a key role in the progression of colitis to CRC, further highlighting a role of AKR1B1 in inflammation [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. High expression of AKR1B1 was also associated with worse prognosis in gastric cancer [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and breast cancer [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and with favorable prognosis in endometrial cancer (when combined with the expression of AKR1B10) [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>However, relatively little is known about the expression of AKR1B1 in the CRC TME. One recent study has shown that high expression of AKR1B1 in gastric cancer cells was associated with immunosuppressive immune cell infiltration and worse prognosis, although it was not reported whether the stromal cells expressed any AKR1B1 [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another study has reported the expression of Aldose Reductase (AR) in murine splenic T cells; AR was regulated via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in order to transmit immunosuppressive signals to T cells from macrophages generated upon infection with the <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">

</styled-content> complex [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the current study, we aimed to understand whether AKR1B1 is expressed solely by cancer cells or also by other cell types in the TME, and whether its expression from the TME contributes to the prediction of prognosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="cam470974-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>An overview of the methods is presented here.

To clarify this, we utilized another microarray dataset, GSE16385, where transcriptome data from na&#x000ef;ve macrophages differentiated into M1 and M2 types was available. Here, AKR1B1 expression was increased upon IL&#x02010;4 induction (M2 differentiation) and decreased upon IFN&#x003b3; + TNF&#x003b1; induction (M1 differentiation) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E</xref>).

To further substantiate our data, we carried out immunofluorescence staining with CD163 and AKR1B1 antibodies in FFPE tissues obtained from colon cancer patients.

In colon adenocarcinoma, most of the CD163 positive cells were also positively stained with AKR1B1.

Overall, our data suggest that tumors with high CAF content had higher expression of AKR1B1, which is in good agreement with the FACS sorted transcriptomic data of CRC tumors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). When AKR1B1 expression was evaluated in previously published subgroups of CRC based on CAF marker expression [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], AKR1B1 expression was lowest in group 1 (lowest CAF) and gradually increased in groups 2, 3, and 4 (highest CAF) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6G</xref>).</p><p>We next analyzed an independent scRNA&#x02010;seq&#x000a0;dataset (GSE146771) in which data from FACS enriched cell types in colorectal tumors, including subsets of macrophages in the myeloid lineage are available [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Most sections had positive staining in both epithelial and stromal cells at varying intensities. We noted cases that lacked overall AKR1B1 staining, lacked staining in stroma, as well as weak staining in mucinous and signet ring carcinomas (data not shown). Stromal cells, primarily subepithelial macrophages, were seen to stain positively for AKR1B1 in non&#x02010;neoplastic colon mucosa (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>), whereas the stroma of colon adenocarcinoma had widespread positivity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). Based on the staining patterns, AKR1B1 scores generated from the tumor (tumor AKR1B1 score) and stroma (stromal AKR1B1 score) were evaluated in parallel with the level of stromal infiltration in the tumor core.

Although these data suggest common mechanisms for the expression of AKR1B1 in both epithelial and stromal compartments, we also observed that the tumor AKR1B1 score was significantly lower in stage 3 tumors (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9B</xref>), whereas the stromal AKR1B1 score did not show any significant difference between the different stages (data not shown). Thus, both epithelial and stromal compartments express the protein, but the regulatory pathways leading to the expression may be distinct. We also did not observe any significant relationship between the tumor AKR1B1 score and vascular or lymphatic invasion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9C,D</xref>). The tumor AKR1B1 score was significantly higher in proximal tumors compared to distal tumors (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>: 0.046, Turkish cohort, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9E</xref>) and in mucinous tumors as compared to nonmucinous tumors with borderline significance (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>: 0.056, Serbian cohort, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9F</xref>), which may be due to the presence of mucinous tumors more often in the proximal colon [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Analysis of the stromal AKR1B1 score within distal and proximal tumors showed that the stromal AKR1B1 score was associated with good OS in tumors located in the distal colon but not in the proximal colon (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). These data suggest heterogeneity in the expression of AKR1B1 in the tumor stroma and neoplastic cells, and that the expression from cancer cells was higher in the proximal and mucinous subgroups. In addition, a higher protein level expression of AKR1B1 in the tumor stroma was associated with better prognosis, whereas expression from neoplastic epithelial cells had no significant relationship with the clinical outcome.</p><p>We have previously shown that microarray&#x02010;based expression of AKR1B1 was associated with poor RFS [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When OS was used as the measure of clinical outcome, reanalysis of the GSE39582 dataset indicated that higher AKR1B1 expression was associated with better OS (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11A</xref>). In GSE17536, high AKR1B1 expression was associated with poor Disease&#x02010;Free Survival (DFS) confirming our findings with RFS in GSE39582 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11B</xref>); however, no significant relationship was identified with Disease Specific Survival (DSS) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11C</xref>). These data suggest high variations in the relationship between AKR1B1 expression and clinical outcomes among different cohorts and with different measures of clinical outcome when evaluated on the basis of bulk expression data from the tumor.</p><p>Since we showed that expression of AKR1B1 from tumor stroma was associated with favorable prognosis via IHC, while bulk transcriptomic data suggested the opposite pattern in certain cohorts, we hypothesized that tumor purity may affect clinical outcomes based on AKR1B1 expression. Therefore, we next evaluated prognostic relationships of AKR1B1 based on tumor purity scores generated by the ESTIMATE method. Interestingly, AKR1B1 was associated with poor RFS when the tumor purity was higher (i.e., more epithelial rather than stromal content) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>). On the other hand, AKR1B1 expression was strongly associated with good OS when the tumor purity was lower (i.e., more stromal content) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>). Strikingly, significance with OS was lost in tumors with high tumor purity, emphasizing the effect of TME content and the cell types expressing AKR1B1 in AKR1B1's prognostic relationships. Since we observed that AKR1B1 can be expressed by many different cell types in the TME, we next investigated prognostic relationships of AKR1B1 in CRC subgroups defined by the abundance of immune and stromal cells. Noticeably, AKR1B1 expression was associated with favorable prognosis in the CRC subgroups with high stroma and immune infiltration, whereas no significance was noted in subgroups with lower abundance of these cell types (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13</xref>). These data suggest that patients with high AKR1B1 expression in a TME with higher stroma and immune content had more favorable prognosis. In order to substantiate these findings at the protein level, we analyzed stromal content based on the H&#x00026;E stained slides in the Turkish cohort. Tumor samples were classified as &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; stroma based on the median stromal percentage of the cohort (20%). We observed that stromal B1 score was associated with longer OS in tumors with higher stromal percentage, whereas this significance was lost in tumors with low stromal percentage, supporting our in silico findings (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="cam470974-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our data show for the first time that CRC tumors have expression of AKR1B1 in both epithelial and stromal compartments; moreover, the relationship of AKR1B1 expression and clinical outcome depends highly on the TME content.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cam470974-sec-0018"><label>4</label><title>DISSCUSSION</title><p>Several different transcriptome&#x02010;based systems [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="cam470974-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="cam470974-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that have been used for the classification of CRC tumors into different molecular subtypes agree that CRC tumors with high expression of stem cell markers or mesenchymal gene expression show worse prognosis. Further studies have revealed that sole evaluation of epithelial gene expression is insufficient to accurately define CRC molecular subtypes [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In fact, a role of stromal activation of mesenchymal signaling was strongly implicated in the assignment of worse prognosis in CRC [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="cam470974-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Colorectal tumors are generally infiltrated by macrophages, followed by T and B cells; however, most tumors appear to show low infiltration of lymphocytes.

We and others have also reported the activation of inflammatory signaling in AKR1B1 overexpressing CRC cell lines and tumors [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] as well as in mouse models of colitis with a high expression of AKR1B1 [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We have reported the highest level of AKR1B1 expression in CMS4 tumors that are known to be highly mesenchymal, aggressive, rich in stroma, and have active TGF&#x003b2; signaling, angiogenesis, and inflammation [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, we noted high AKR1B1 expression in CMS1 tumors, which show MSI as well as increased immune signaling, along with strong activation of immunosuppressive pathways [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These two CMS types are known to be rich in either desmoplastic stroma or immune cells in the TME; thus, this led us to hypothesize that the stromal compartment of CRC tumors may contribute toward oncogenic signaling in AKR1B1 expressing tumors.</p><p>Extensive bioinformatics analyses using bulk RNA and scRNA&#x02010;seq data strongly indicated that AKR1B1 was expressed in both stromal as well as epithelial cells in CRC, which was validated with IHC. In particular, we observed a strong correlation between AKR1B1 expression and the involvement of M2 macrophages in the TME from bulk transcriptomic data. We also confirmed the expression of AKR1B1 in M2 macrophages in human adenocarcinoma samples and in M2 macrophages differentiated in&#x000a0;vitro from THP1 cells. M2 macrophages are generally associated with angiogenesis and tissue repair. Tumor&#x02010;associated macrophages (TAM) found in the TME are known to have characteristics similar to M2 macrophages. The presence of TAMs is generally associated with an immune&#x02010;suppressive environment, with the recruitment of regulatory T cells and interruption of immune cell interactions and worse prognosis due to the development of EMT and drug resistance [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on strong correlations between AKR1B1 expression and the fraction of M2 macrophages in the TME, we therefore expected to observe poor prognosis in patients with high stromal expression of AKR1B1. We observed that when tumor purity was high (i.e., tumors had low stromal infiltration), and most of the AKR1B1 expression was contributed by the neoplastic epithelial cells, high expression of AKR1B1 indeed was associated with worse prognosis. The lack of stroma in the in&#x000a0;vitro CRC models and previous data from our group indicating an increase in migration and proliferation in CRC cell lines overexpressing AKR1B1 [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] suggests a clear relationship between AKR1B1 expression and aggressive traits and poor prognosis in a low&#x02010;stroma TME.</p><p>In the current study, we have observed that the expression of AKR1B1 can be contributed by both stromal and epithelial cells in tumors with a high stromal component, and high protein level expression of AKR1B1 from the stroma was associated with favorable prognosis. When tumors were stratified based on their tumor purity, immune and stromal contents, microarray&#x02010;based AKR1B1 expression was associated with good OS in tumors with high stroma and immune fractions and low tumor purity. Ex&#x000a0;vivo data confirmed that the stromal expression of AKR1B1 was associated with good prognosis specifically in tumors with a higher stromal percentage but not in tumors with a low stromal percentage. These findings overall support that the AKR1B1 and prognosis relationship is highly dependent on the TME and the cell types that express AKR1B1.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the contribution of TME to the relationship between AKR1B1 expression and favorable prognosis. We can suggest several different reasons for our findings. First, there are numerous cell types in the TME; we were able to confirm the expression of AKR1B1 in CD163<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells. There is remarkable disparity in the literature regarding the role of macrophages in the TME of tumors; nonetheless, several studies suggest improved survival with the infiltration of macrophages in CRC [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, in most of these studies, the macrophages were identified by one or two markers, which may be insufficient to characterize the vast spectrum of macrophages between the M1 and M2 extremes and their role in the TME. CRC with CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration was shown to have high infiltration of immature dendritic cells (DC) and better prognosis, especially in limited disease (UICC I and II) rather than in advanced disease (UICC III and IV) [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The stage of the disease may therefore be important in evaluating the role of specific cells infiltrating the TME. Our bioinformatics analyses also suggest that conventional DCs (cDCs) can express AKR1B1. Although this was not experimentally verified in the current study, we speculate that AKR1B1 expression in cDCs may alter the way the TME supports tumor progression. The location of the macrophage can also be important; thus, the presence of macrophages at the invasive front was shown to decrease synchronous and metachronous hepatic metastases [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, a high macrophage to epithelial cell ratio was shown to improve prognosis in CRC; the same study showed that direct in&#x000a0;vitro cell&#x02013;cell contact between HCT&#x02010;116 CRC cells and macrophages led to epithelial cell death, whereas the lack of direct contact (translated to tumors with low macrophage infiltration) led to enhanced cancer cell migration and nuclear beta catenin levels [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>scRNA&#x02010;seq data of CRC tumors revealed the presence of AKR1B1 transcripts in other cell types in the TME as well, suggesting that the combinatorial effect of the expression of AKR1B1 from different cell types as well as the chemokines/cytokines they release may contribute toward prognosis [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, the role of AKR1B1 protein and the mechanisms that are associated with a higher AKR1B1 expression in each of these cell types may have an impact on its relationship with clinical outcomes. For example, Shimizu et&#x000a0;al. reported that upon tyrosine phosphorylation, AKR1B1 in T cells undergoes significant alterations due to cell&#x02010;to&#x02010;cell interaction with immunosuppressive macrophages, resulting in the downregulation of T cell functions by suppressor macrophages [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The extent of AKR1B1 expression in the numerous different cell types available in the TME and its role in modulating the functions of these cells is currently unknown. An elevated flow of glucose through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, compared to mitochondrial oxidation, is known to be essential for the inflammatory functions of inflammatory myeloid cells [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The reduction of glucose via AKR1B1 leads to the formation of sorbitol and then to fructose [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fructose, even when generated in small amounts, was shown to change the polarization of macrophages from M1 to M2 [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is possible that the source of fructose in the macrophages could have been through the enzymatic activity of AKR1B1. It is also feasible to suggest that AKR1B1 may modulate glucose metabolism and thereby play a role in the inflammatory functions in the TME. This is supported by our previous observation that AKR1B1 expressing tumors had higher expression of pro&#x02010;inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Future studies including modulation of AKR1B1 expression in various myeloid cell types and coculture of these cells with CRC cells and investigation of the metabolic and transcriptomic changes might provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind the current findings.</p><p>In our study, in addition to the expression of AKR1B1 in macrophages, we identified CAFs as another source of AKR1B1 expression. CAFs do not constitute a homogeneous cell population; instead, recent studies have defined specific CAF subpopulations which have different origins, marker proteins, and are known to either promote or suppress cancer progression [<xref rid="cam470974-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is currently unknown which CAF subtype/subtypes express AKR1B1 among previously defined myofibroblastic CAF (myCAFs), inflammatory CAF (iCAFs), and antigen&#x02010;presenting CAF (apCAFs) subtypes, thus both the expression and potential role of AKR1B1 in these cells need to be elucidated.</p><p>The current study has some limitations that need to be specified. The immunohistochemistry relied on tissue microarrays, which provide data on a very small region of the tumor. Considering tumor heterogeneity, future studies can include samples that are collected from different regions of the same tumor. Although AKR1B1 expression was strongly correlated with the expression of multiple macrophage markers in silico, validation of coexpression was performed using only one macrophage marker. However, macrophages have numerous markers and can belong to several different subtypes. A better classification of which macrophage expresses AKR1B1 most robustly needs to be identified. We did not experimentally verify the expression of AKR1B1 in CAFs in the current study. Thus, future experiments can be designed to determine whether FAP positive fibroblasts also express AKR1B1.</p><p>In summary, in the current study we evaluated the expression and prognostic significance of AKR1B1 in CRC, focusing on its presence within the TME. Based on analyses of multiple transcriptomic datasets, we showed that AKR1B1 is highly expressed in the tumor stroma, specifically in CAFs and myeloid cells, compared to relatively lower expression in epithelial cells. IF&#x02010;based double staining experiments using colon adenocarcinoma tissues confirmed that AKR1B1 was indeed expressed by CD163 positive M2 macrophages. In&#x000a0;vitro, M2 macrophages differentiated from THP1 cells showed AKR1B1 expression. Microarray&#x02010;based prognostic analyses revealed that high AKR1B1 expression was associated with favorable OS in tumors with low tumor purity and high stromal or immune infiltration. In line with these findings, stromal AKR1B1 score based on IHC stainings was significantly associated with favorable OS in the Turkish cohort. Thus, these data highlight that the prognostic associations of AKR1B1 i highly dependent on the context of the TME, and that the stromal expression of AKR1B1 may have a role in CRC progression. Overall, the study underscores the importance of characterizing the specific cell populations within the TME that express potential biomarkers, such as AKR1B1, to improve the interpretation of gene expression&#x02010;based biomarkers in CRC.</p></sec><sec id="cam470974-sec-0024"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>S.D.C. and A.N. obtained funding for the study with contributions from S.B.
