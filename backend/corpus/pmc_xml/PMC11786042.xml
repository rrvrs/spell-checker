Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) comprises two major subunits, LDHA and LDHB, which can assemble into five different isoenzymes (LDH1-5). However, the role of LDH isoenzyme and its subunits in different GBM subtypes is largely unknown. Our findings reveal that LDHA and LDHB subunits correlated with mesenchymal and proneural subtype classification, and have prognostic and clinical significance in GBM patients. Moreover, it is demonstrated that LDH5, characterized by high LDHA and low LDHB levels, is highly expressed in mesenchymal subtype GBM cells and promotes proliferation, migration, and PMT. Conversely, proneural subtype GBM cells exhibited LDH1 dominance, and low LDHA and high LDHB levels. Notably, LDH1 played a pivotal role in the proliferation, migration, and PMT of proneural glioma cells. For treatment of proneural subtype GBM, gossypol-acetic acid (GAA)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (GAA-BSA NPs) were developed to ameliorate PMT by targeting LDH1. These nanoparticles effectively suppress proneural subtype tumor growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, surpassing their efficacy against the mesenchymal subtype. The results offer several novel insights into the role of LDH isoenzyme in subtype classification between mesenchymal and proneural GBM and provide a promising therapeutic approach for proneural subtype GBM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glioblastoma multiform</kwd><kwd>lactate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>subtype classification</kwd><kwd>proneural-to-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), classified as a World Health Organization grade IV tumor, is extremely malignant and has a high prevalence rate, with a grim clinical prognosis among adults <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Despite the availability of comprehensive treatment strategies encompassing surgical intervention, ionizing radiation, and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide, the median survival of patients with GBM following diagnosis rarely exceeds 1-year <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Distinguished by their gene expression profiles, GBMs can be categorized into four distinct subtypes, namely, classical, proneural, neural, and mesenchymal <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. During the progression of GBM, the mesenchymal subtype originates from the proneural subtype through a process known as proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. This transition is associated with tumor microenvironment, metabolic molecular and treatment-related factors to tumor recurrent and therapy <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the core enzyme involved in catalyzing the formation of lactate through glycolysis; this process, known as the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of metabolic alteration in cancer cells <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The LDH isoenzyme is composed of two subunits (LDHA and LDHB), forming a tetramer structure that produces five key isoforms, namely, LDH1(4B), LDH2(3B1A), LDH3(2B2A), LDH4(3B1A), and LDH5(4A) <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. LDH isoenzyme shows variations in distribution among various tissues in the human body and between malignant tissue samples, indicating it can serve as a vital molecular marker for cancer diagnosis <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Although the effects of LDH isoenzyme on GBM growth and invasiveness have been studied <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, its role and potential as a therapeutic target in PMT warrants further investigation.</p><p>Although many effective LDHA/B inhibitors that target LDH isoenzyme have been developed by pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions, these inhibitors have not been applied in the clinic for various reasons such as poor pharmacokinetic properties and low <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Gossypol-acetic acid (GAA), a dehydrogenase inhibitor, has demonstrated the capacity to interfere with mitochondrial metabolism, induce autophagic cell death, and promote tumor cell apoptosis <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. However, clinical studies in patients with glioma have shown a low response rate to treatment with GAA <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, although the reasons responsible for this outcome remain unclear. Unique tumor microenvironment characterized by hypoxia and high ferric ions (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) levels features often encountered in gliomas, and iron chelators can change the metabolism of tumor cells by reducing the intake of Fe<sup>3+</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Studies have shown that GAA tends to bind with iron in hemoglobin to form gossypol-iron complexes, which in turn inhibit iron absorption<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Within this context, we hypothesized that tumor microenvironment's high Fe<sup>3+</sup> levels may influence the efficacy of GAA in tumor treatment. Owing to its exceptional biocompatibility and biodegradability, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is commonly utilized as a drug carrier <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Additionally, BSA nanoparticles (NPs) are soluble in water, stable, and capable of gradually releasing hydrophobic drugs <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. These attributes render them promising tools for the treatment of GBM <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the different roles of the LDH isoenzyme (LDH1 and LDH5) within the proneural and mesenchymal GBM subtypes, respectively, and examined their key roles in the PMT process. Furthermore, we developed a strategy targeting LDH1 through encapsulating GAA with BSA to generate NPs that could be used in the treatment of proneural subtype GBM. Our results offer novel insights into the role of LDH isoenzyme in subtype classification between mesenchymal and proneural GBM and provide a promising treatment approach for proneural subtype GBM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Data source</title><p>RNA-seq transcriptome data and clinical data (survival time and survival status) of patients with glioblastoma were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (<ext-link xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.cgga.org.cn/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.cgga.org.cn/</ext-link>).

Furthermore, the other U87MG- and U251MG-bearing mouse models were established by subcutaneously injecting 0.1 mL of U87MG cells (2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>) and U251MG cells (8&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>), respectively, into the BALB/c nude mice. When the tumor volume reached approximately 80 mm<sup>3</sup>, the tumor-bearing mice were randomized into four groups (n=6 per group). Mice in different groups were administered intraperitoneal injections once every 3 days, for six times in total, as follows: 1) PBS; 2) GAA, 15 mg/kg; 3) GAA-BSA NPs at 15 mg/kg GAA dose; and 4) LDHA inhibitor FX11 (2.5 mg/kg, HY16214; MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China). Tumor size was monitored throughout the treatment period.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

The results demonstrated that elevated levels of LDHA were predominantly observed in the mesenchymal subtype, whereas reduced LDHA expression was more frequently associated with the proneural subtype. (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and S1A). Conversely, the expression levels of LDHB exhibited an opposite pattern. (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and S1B). Further, a positive correlation was detected between the expression of mesenchymal markers (YKL-40 and VIM) and LDHA levels by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). These findings were further validated by heatmap analysis (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). In addition, we investigated the impact of LDHA and LDHB on GBM prognosis through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) mRNA database. The results indicated that patients exhibiting high LDHA expression experienced shorter survival periods, while elevated LDHB expression appears to be associated with prolonged survival periods (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and F). After a comprehensive evaluation of histology, grade, gender, and age, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed using the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database to identify prognostic factors and examine their clinical relevance. (<xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref> C-F). These studies identified LDHA and LDHB as potential independent overall survival factors, indicating their potential utility in constructing prognostic calibration curves for predicting GBM outcomes and underscoring their significant clinical relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>LDH isoenzymes composed of different subunits determine the classification of glioma cells</title><p>To validate our database-derived analyses, we conducted in vitro experiments across four glioma cell lines. Initially, LDHA and LDHB expression levels were tested. Results indicated a marked upregulation of LDHA at both mRNA and protein levels in LN229 and U87MG cells, whereas LDHB was significantly expressed in U251MG and SW1783 cells at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and B), highlighting differential LDH subunit expression across these glioma cell lines.</p><p>Considering the pivotal role of LDH in lactate production, we quantified lactate concentrations in the cell culture supernatants and assessed the dynamics of pyruvate consumption. Observations revealed that U87MG and LN229 glioma cells exhibited higher lactate production rates compared to SW1783 and U251MG cells. Notably, U87MG cells produced substantial amounts of lactate while consuming relatively low levels of pyruvate, suggesting an enhanced pyruvate utilization rate (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and D), which may due to variations in their metabolic pathways and enzyme activity<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. To further elucidate the association between LDH subunits and glioblastoma (GBM) phenotypes, we analyzed the expression of OLIG2 (a marker for the proneural phenotype) and VIM (a marker for the mesenchymal phenotype). Consistent with previously observed patterns in GBM specimens, OLIG2 expression was elevated in SW1783 and U251MG cells, while U87MG and LN229 cells exhibited characteristics associated with mesenchymal glioma cells (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B and E).</p><p>Additionally, native electrophoresis corroborated these findings, revealing that distinct LDH isoenzyme expression profiles were present across the cell lines due to variations in LDH subunit expression. Specifically, LDH5 (4A) was the predominant isoform in LN229 and U87MG cells, whereas LDH1 (4B) was the main isoform in U251MG and SW1783 cells (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F). To confirm that the observed isoenzyme patterns were attributable to differential LDH subunit expression, we selectively suppressed LDHA and LDHB using shRNA constructs (sh-LDHA and sh-LDHB, respectively). Knockdown of LDHA and LDHB led to significant reductions in their respective mRNA levels in U87MG, LN229, and U251MG cells relative to control cells (sh-EGFP) (<xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2</xref>A-C). Furthermore, native electrophoresis demonstrated that LDHA knockdown resulted in diminished LDH5 expression in U87MG and LN229 cells, while LDHB knockdown had minimal impact (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G and S3A). Conversely, LDHB inhibition led to decreased LDH1 expression in U251MG cells, whereas LDHA knockdown did not alter the LDH isoenzyme profile (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H and S3B). Collectively, these findings indicate that the differential expression of LDH subunits contributes to distinct LDH isoenzyme compositions, which may play a role in defining glioma cell phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>LDH isoenzymes promoted the proliferation and migration of glioma cells and in vivo tumor growth</title><p>Downregulating the expression of LDHA inhibited the relative proliferation rate of U87MG and LN229 cells in comparison with that in the control group (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and B). Although different outcomes in cell proliferation rates were observed in U87MG and LN229 cells when LDHB was downregulated, there was no statistically significant difference (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and D). The results were further confirmed by colony formation assays (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E and F). In contrast, an inverse trend was noted in U251MG cells: LDHB downregulation led to a significant decrease in relative proliferation rate and colony numbers, whereas LDHA downregulation had the opposite effect (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G-I).</p><p>We further investigated the influence of LDH isoenzymes on glioma cell migration. Notably, LDHA knockdown led to a reduction in the number of migrating U87MG and LN229 cells, as evidenced by the Transwell assay, whereas LDHB knockdown exerted the opposite effect (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and B). Conversely, in U251MG cells, sh-LDHB resulted in reduced migratory ability, whereas the number of migrated cells increased in the sh-LDHA group (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). These findings underscore the distinct and critical roles played by LDHA and LDHB in these two glioma subtypes. In summary, LDH5 promotes the proliferation and migration of mesenchymal glioma cells, whereas LDH1 maintains these processes in proneural glioma cells. Thus, LDH isoenzyme differentially regulates the proliferation and migration of mesenchymal and proneural glioma cells.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> studies were conducted by injecting U87MG and U251MG cells into the BALB/c nude mice. Intriguingly, in U87MG group, LDHA knockdown led to decreased tumor growth, whereas LDHB knockdown exerted the opposite effect (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). These results were also observed in terms of tumor volume and weight (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E and F). Conversely, in the U251MG group, LDHB knockdown significantly decreased the tumor size, volume, and weight, whereas LDHA knockdown exerted the opposite effect (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G-I). Collectively, we found that LDH5 and LDH1 play pivotal roles in the proliferation and migration of glioma cells as well as tumor growth in mesenchymal and proneural subtypes of GBM.</p></sec><sec><title>LDH isoenzymes promoted proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) of glioma cells</title><p>To further investigate the relationship between LDH isoenzymes and PMT in glioma, we analyzed protein expression levels of VIM (mesenchymal marker) and OLIG2 (proneural marker) through western blotting. The results confirmed that LDHA knockdown downregulated mesenchymal marker expression in U87MG cells, while proneural marker expression was upregulated (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A and B). However, LDHB knockdown triggered the downregulation of the proneural marker and upregulation of mesenchymal markers (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C and D). The corresponding findings in LN229 cells were consistent with these results (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E-H), suggesting that LDH5 promotes PMT in mesenchymal glioma cells. Conversely, in U251MG cells, LDHA shRNA had a limited impact on mesenchymal transition, while treatment with LDHB shRNA decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers and increased that of proneural markers (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>I-L). Thus, LDH1 emerges as a pivotal factor driving PMT in proneural glioma cells. Given that the proneural subtype exhibits a higher propensity for transition into the mesenchymal subtype, it is imperative to intervene at the root of the process by targeting LDH1 in proneural subtype GBM.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of GAA-BSA nanoparticles for LDH1 treatment in proneural subtype GBM</title><p>Initially, a computational simulation was conducted to screen 10 drugs, revealing that gossypol-acetic acid (GAA) emerged as the most promising candidate for binding to the LDH1 protein. However, GAA exhibits poor water solubility and is prone to degradation in the tumor microenvironment <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), known for its exceptional biocompatibility and biodegradability, is a commonly utilized drug carrier <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Notably, BSA nanoparticles are water-soluble, stable, and capable of slowly releasing hydrophobic drugs <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Therefore, to mitigate the impact of the tumor microenvironment, we devised a strategy to encapsulate GAA within BSA protein nanoparticles (NPs), resulting in a novel formulation termed GAA-BSA nanoparticles. The binding sites of GAA on the LDH1 protein were simulated, revealing GLN D73 and HIS C186 as key interaction points (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). These results underscored the potential ability of GAA to target LDH1 protein. Subsequently, GAA-BSA NPs were synthesized and as shown in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B and C, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging showed that GAA-BSA NPs were primarily homogenous in size and have a dense core. The average size of the NPs was 147.25&#x000b1;1.56 nm and the zeta potential was -28.87&#x000b1;0.52 mV (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D; Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which may prolonged the circulation time in the blood by increasing the blood-brain barrier permeability, targeting the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway or evading phagocytosis by immune cells <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. Moreover, the NPs displayed a drug-loading efficiency (DLE) of 70.55&#x000b1;1.08%, with a drug-loading capacity (DLC) of 3.10&#x000b1;0.05% (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which is equivalent to 31.0 &#x003bc;g of GAA per mg of NPs. Drug release from the nanoparticles exhibited a biphasic pattern at pH 7.4, with an initial burst release of 31.78&#x000b1;2.17% within the first 4 h, followed by a gradual release of 83.36&#x000b1;2.0% over the subsequent 90 h (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F depicts a schematic of the preparation of GAA-BSA NPs using the desolvation method.</p></sec><sec><title>GAA-BSA NPs inhibited proneural subtype GBM growth in vitro and in vivo</title><p>The selective efficacy of GAA-BSA NPs was substantiated by observing cellular uptake in mesenchymal and proneural subtype cells. FITC-conjugated NPs were incubated with U87MG and U251MG cells for 4h. And significantly higher fluorescence intensity was observed in proneural subtype cells than in mesenchymal-type cells. (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). To verify the potential efficacy of GAA-BSA NPs in tumor treatment, <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity evaluation by CCK-8 assay was performed. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of GAA against U87MG and U251MG cell lines were determined to be 14.73 and 9.91 &#x003bc;M, respectively. For GAA-BSA, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 290 &#x003bc;g/mL and 214.6 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively (the GAA concentration was 15.79 and 11.50 &#x003bc;M, respectively). These results suggest substantial selectivity of GAA-BSA NPs for targeting and eliminating proneural subtype cells (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B).</p><p>Importantly, this study assessed the potential of GAA-BSA NPs to neutralize the impact of Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the tumor microenvironment. The CCK-8 assay results showed that cell viability was significantly reduced in the Fe<sup>3+</sup>+GAA-BSA NPs group compared to the Fe<sup>3+</sup>+GAA group. This observation indicated the capacity of GAA-BSA NPs to enhance cell killing by mitigating the effects of Fe<sup>3+</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C). To further assess the therapeutic efficacy of GAA-BSA NPs, we analyzed the tumor size, volume, and weight as indicators of treatment effect<italic> in vivo</italic>. FX11, an LDHA inhibitor, is utilized to assess the therapeutic sensitivity of mesenchymal and proneural subtype GBM. In proneural type tumor model, tumor size, volume, and weight were markedly reduced after the treatment with GAA-BSA NPs, surpassing the impact of GAA and LDHA inhibitor FX11 (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D-F). However, this effect was not observed in the mesenchymal tumor model (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>G-I). In summary, GAA-BSA NPs may be a promising treatment for targeting proneural subtype GBM. The schematic model is shown in Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although extensive studies have begun to unravel the connection between GBM molecular subtypes and metabolic phenotypes <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, the complex metabolic mechanisms driving subtype classification in GBM remain unclear. This study primarily identified LDH isoenzymes as correlating with mesenchymal and proneural subtype classification and demonstrated prognostic and clinical significance in GBM patients.</p><p>LDH is used as a diagnostic biomarker for various tumors and has a long history of application in routine clinical diagnosis <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Recently, research attention has shifted to total serum LDH activity, as well as the expression of LDH isoenzymes <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Our findings corroborate the notion that LDH isoenzymes might serve as clinically significant molecular markers for distinguishing mesenchymal and proneural GBM subtypes, offering a foundation for more precise molecular typing of GBM. The mesenchymal subtype, which is characterized by heightened aggressiveness and poor prognosis relative to the proneural subtype, can transition from the proneural subtype following radiation therapy and chemotherapy <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. PMT in GBM is aligned with increased proliferation and migration of cells <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. This is consistent with previous evidence on the role of LDH isoenzymes in governing cellular growth and migration <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. In this study, we revealed the roles of LDH5 in promoting the proliferation, migration, and PMT of mesenchymal glioma cells, and showed that LDH1 sustains these functions in proneural glioma cells. The present evidence may serve as a cornerstone for developing gene expression-based diagnostic tools for recurrence monitoring and prognosis prediction. We hypothesized that targeting LDH isoenzymes could offer a potential strategy to inhibit this transition from the proneural subtype. This approach may lead to the development of effective therapeutic options against GBM.</p><p>Furthermore, targeted therapeutic strategies can be tailored based on LDH isoenzyme expression characteristics. The present investigation of GAA-BSA NPs offers a potentially selective approach to GBM therapy. BSA is a versatile protein system for drug delivery, that is non-toxic, non-immunogenic, biocompatible, and biodegradable <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>.
