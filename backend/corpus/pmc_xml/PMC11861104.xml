Two systems were developed based on eutectic solvents: A1 (&#x0201c;A&#x0201d; for acid) comprised dodecyl methyl sulfoxide and thymol in 1:2 ratio (w/w) as liquid membrane, while A2 used [6-methylcoumarin:thymol (1:2)]:2-nitrophenyl octyl ether in 2:1 ratio (w/w). The performance of A1 and A2 was characterized by extraction of 31 acidic model analytes (pharmaceutical drugs and nutrients) spiked into 100 &#x000b5;L human plasma diluted 1:1 (v/v) with phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The acceptor solution was 50&#x000a0;mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> buffer pH 10.0, and extraction was performed at an agitation rate of 750 RPM. Voltage and extraction time were 30&#x000a0;V for 30&#x000a0;min and 10&#x000a0;V for 20&#x000a0;min for A1 and A2, respectively. Under optimal conditions, A1 extracted analytes with 1.8&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6.0 with an average recovery (<italic>R</italic>) of 85.1%, while A2 extracted in a range of 0.5&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6.0 with an average recovery of 79.9%. Meanwhile, extraction current was low at 9 and 26 &#x000b5;A, respectively, which is indicative of good system robustness. Using UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of the acceptor solution, repeatability of the A1 and A2 methods was determined to be 2.8&#x02013;7.7% and 3.3&#x02013;9.4% for <italic>R</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40%, matrix effects were 82&#x02013;117% and 84&#x02013;112%, respectively, and linear calibration curves were obtained. The performance and compatibility with human plasma represent a major improvement over previous state-of-the-art liquid membranes for acidic analytes, namely 1-octanol.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2">

Resulting from this, various techniques have been invented and research is still very active. One such technique is electromembrane extraction (EME), first presented in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which mainly has been used for bioanalytical and environmental extraction applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. EME is performed using a supported liquid membrane that separates the sample from a clean acceptor solution. The liquid membrane comprises a porous polymeric membrane, often polypropylene, and a few microliters of organic solvent immobilized in the pores of the membrane by strong capillary forces. Extraction is initiated by applying an external electric field across the liquid membrane, which stimulates charged analyte ions to migrate from the sample, through the liquid membrane, and to the acceptor solution. The latter may subsequently be collected and analyzed by an appropriate analytical method, for example liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS). The organic solvents used in EME are typically non-volatile, non-toxic, and thus safe for the operator. Combined with the very small volume of solvent used, this makes EME a very environmentally friendly technique. EME further offers good selectivity and clean-up of matrix components. Selectivity is controlled by both the polarity and magnitude of the applied electric field, as well as the chemistry and hydrophobicity of the solvent. As such, EME is suitable for extraction of charged analytes across a wide range of properties and hydrophobicity.</p><p id="Par4">To date, approximately 450 articles on EME have been published, exploring fundamentals, methods, and applications, which are summarized in recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Example applications include extraction of metals and heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], pharmaceuticals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and endogenous metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This has been realized in different technical formats, such as hollow-fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], 96-well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and various microfluidic formats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], all of which have been laboratory-built, and transfer and reproducibility of methods between laboratories have thus been challenging. In 2022, the first commercial EME equipment was however launched, based on using conductive vials to house the sample and acceptor solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since then, this vial-based format has been applied for EME in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and analysis of drugs-of-abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Recently, we introduced the concept of <italic>generic</italic> EME conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], designed to streamline method development by providing starting conditions for efficient extraction of analytes within a defined range (termed <italic>extraction window</italic>) of charge (<italic>z</italic>) and hydrophobicity (log <italic>P</italic>). A key goal of generic conditions is to lower the barrier to EME&#x02019;s adoption and to provide both novice and seasoned users with standardized conditions compatible with commercially available equipment. Developing generic systems primarily concerns the selection of a suitable liquid membrane. For example, 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE), a much used solvent in EME, has an extraction window of 2.2&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6.4 for&#x02009;+&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>z</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x02009;+&#x02009;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The establishment of generic conditions is also tied to the operational stability, which mainly concerns the extraction current produced during transfer of charged species. As such, a low current (&#x0003c;&#x02009;50 &#x000b5;A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) minimizes the effects of water electrolysis at the electrodes, which otherwise induces gas formation and pH changes and results in poor extraction efficiency. High current may arise from excessive conductivity of the liquid membrane, a too water-soluble solvent that leaks during the extraction, or poor discrimination of matrix components.</p><p id="Par6">The current fundamental article is the continuation of a series on generic EME systems aimed at commercial conductive vial&#x02013;based equipment and focuses on acidic compounds displaying low-to-moderate hydrophilicity. Previous papers in this series have concerned generic systems for basic substances of high and low hydrophilicity, in human plasma samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Acidic substances are however more challenging to extract with EME, for several reasons. Firstly, far fewer suitable liquid membrane solvents have been published, with the vast majority being aliphatic alcohols such as 1-octanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Alcoholic liquid membranes work by acting as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) that interacts with the strong hydrogen bonding accepting (HBA) properties of ionized acids, thereby improving partitioning into the organic phase. Compared to solvents for basic analytes, the alcohols however lack secondary interactions such as the cation-&#x003c0; interactions found between cationic analytes and aromatic solvents. This means that solvents used for extracting acids should not be overly hydrophobic since this impedes the transfer of the analyte. Conversely, solvents that are more hydrophilic, like 1-octanol, can increase the permeability of the liquid membrane. This heightened permeability however also allows more competing matrix ions to pass through, which can lead to decreased recovery of the analyte and generate excessive extraction current. Therefore, when using 1-octanol with complex samples, it is often necessary to substantially dilute the samples before proceeding with the extraction process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this work, we however present two new liquid membranes for acidic analytes based on stronger and more diverse chemical interactions. Compared to 1-octanol, these provided major improvements in the extraction performance and compatibility with human plasma samples without excessive dilution. The liquid membranes were identified after exploring different solvent chemistries and other EME method parameters were subsequently optimized. Thirty-one acidic model analytes were used to characterize the merits of the methods, which had broad extraction windows and high efficiency within, and therefore can be recommended for acids with low to moderate hydrophilicity. It should be emphasized that while LC&#x02013;MS was utilized for the characterization of the proposed EME methods, their utility is not confined to integration with LC&#x02013;MS alone. Instead, the work sets the stage for development of new and robust EME applications for acidic analytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental section</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p id="Par7">Camphor, thymol, <sc>dl</sc>-menthol, dodecyl methyl sulfoxide (DDMS), 6-methylcoumarin, tri(butyl) phosphate, tri(pentyl) phosphate, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, 1-decanol, 1-undecanol, 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE), carvacrol, tri-n-butyl phosphine oxide, tri(isobutyl) phosphate, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, formic acid (LC&#x02013;MS grade), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4-nitroaniline, and all model analytes (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

For EME, a pair of vials&#x02014;one for the sample and another for the acceptor&#x02014;was fastened into a custom-designed union that housed the supporting membrane infused with the liquid membrane, together forming a single extraction cell. The 9-mm-diameter supporting membrane comprised polypropylene (PP2E, Extraction Technologies Norway). In this configuration, the conductive vials thus served as the anode and cathode. Up to 10 extraction cells were loaded into a 10-position holder mounted on a horizontal shaker (Extraction Technologies Norway) and covered by a lid with one printed electrode for each vial.

During initial experiments, the sample was adjusted to pH 7.4 using 50&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer. At this pH, all model analytes were negatively charged. During EME of acids, a boundary layer with depressed pH is formed at the liquid membrane-acceptor interface, which may impede the mass transfer into the acceptor solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To overcome this effect, the acceptor solution was adjusted to pH 11 by 50&#x000a0;mM ammonia. Ammonia was selected as a volatile base compatible with electrospray ionization.

This trend was similar to previous observations for basic substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The introduction of human plasma destabilized the system, leading to an increase in current, which was attributed to the low hydrophobicity of 1-octanol allowing a greater influx of matrix components, and recoveries were decreased significantly. Replacing 1-octanol with more hydrophobic aliphatic alcohols, namely 1-nonanol, 1-decanol, and 1-undecanol, improved the stability but also decreased recoveries further (data not shown). This was because the hydrophobic barrier of the liquid membrane was increased without any increase in HBA, HBD, or dipole interactions. Despite their frequent use throughout literature, 1-octanol and other aliphatic alcohols were therefore concluded to be unsuitable as generic liquid membranes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Screening for alternative liquid membranes</title><p id="Par34">Next, a screening for new alternative liquid membrane solvents was performed. Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> summarizes the solvents, their properties, and extraction performance.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the extraction efficiency of the best liquid membrane candidates.

However, this did not improve the stability. Alternatively, tri(butyl) phosphate was reported by Wu et al. as an efficient liquid membrane for EME of three barbiturates (acids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], despite not offering any HBD interactions that otherwise previously was assumed as required for EME of acidic analytes. The Kamlet-Taft values are <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88, and &#x003c0;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65, and the solvent is assumed to extract acids primarily by dipole interactions. Tri(butyl) phosphate was highly efficient in extractions from a neat standard sample, but performance deteriorated in plasma samples and current increased with time. Additionally, tri(butyl) phosphate is a suspected carcinogen and was therefore considered an unsuitable solvent. Instead, other phosphates were investigated. Tri(pentyl) phosphate (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80, &#x003c0;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63) yielded a stable and low current (30 &#x000b5;A) and moderate extraction recoveries of analytes of 2&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;4. The solvent has recently also been identified as suitable for EME of hydrophobic peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], as well as some basic small-molecule substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Next, a range of eutectic solvents were considered. (Deep) eutectic solvents are prepared by mixing two (or more) solid components, one HBD and one HBA, that form intermolecular bonds which yield a lower melting point than the individual components. Eutectic solvents are interesting due to the possibilities for fine-tuning solvent properties by mixing various components in different ratios. In EME, monoterpenes, such as menthol and thymol, have been explored as HBD components in eutectic solvents, and applied for peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and some basic and acidic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Menthol and thymol were paired with three HBA components with complementary properties, camphor (log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5), dodecyl methyl sulfoxide (DDMS, log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.6), and 6-methylcoumarin (log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.3) in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 ratios. Camphor and DDMS are non-aromatic and offer HBA and dipole interaction, while the highly aromatic 6-methylcoumarin offers additional &#x003c0;-type interaction (&#x003c0;-&#x003c0; stacking, anion-&#x003c0;). Menthol-based solvents were all found unsuitable due to either poor solvent stability (did not remain liquid at room temperature), poor extraction efficiency, or dissolution into the acceptor solution. Mixtures with DDMS/6-methylcoumarin and thymol in 2:1 ratio were also not liquid at room temperature. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the extraction performance of the best ratios for each combination. As seen, DDMS:thymol (1:2) and 6-methylcoumarin:thymol (1:2) were both slightly more efficient than camphor:thymol (1:1), and were therefore considered superior. With DDMS:thymol (1:2), recoveries were also fairly insensitive to a plasma matrix. The Kamlet-Taft values were <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.11, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.30, and &#x003c0;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97, which indicated strong HBD and dipole interactions, and weak-to-moderate HBA interactions. Changing the ratio to 1:1 caused the acceptor solution to become cloudy, which was attributed to the very low solubility of DDMS and consequent formation of microdroplets. For 6-methylcoumarin:thymol, the extraction efficiency was similar for both 1:1 and 1:2 ratios (2:1 was not liquid at room temperature), but the current was reduced from 60 to 30 &#x000b5;A for the 1:2 ratio. The Kamlet-Taft values for this ratio were determined to be <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.01, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.55 (exact value could not be determined due to high background absorbance), and &#x003c0;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.09. Based on these observations, DDMS:thymol (1:2) and 6-methylcoumarin:thymol (1:2) were selected as the best candidates. As an additional remark, Hong et al. recently suggested that aromatic liquid membranes may be more susceptible to fouling by matrix components when extracting bases, causing a decrease in extraction recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The current data may indicate that this phenomenon is less prominent for acidic analytes, as no major decrease from neat standard to plasma was observed with 6-methylcoumarin:thymol (1:2). We suggest this could be related to the lack of cation-&#x003c0; interactions for the reversed voltage polarity.</p><p id="Par37">A few additional solvents were tested and found unsuitable or inferior; these are summarized in Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Optimization</title><p id="Par38">The two candidate liquid membranes, DDMS:thymol (1:2) and 6-methylcoumarin:thymol (1:2), were denoted as systems A1 and A2 (&#x0201c;A&#x0201d; for acid), respectively. As the next step, the final EME conditions for systems A1 and A2 were optimized. First, the final liquid membrane compositions were considered; specifically the addition of NPOE as a stabilizing component for increased robustness was evaluated. For both systems, 1 part NPOE was added to 2 parts of the original solvent. In system A1, addition of NPOE did not give any significant improvement in recovery or current during extraction, while system A2, on the other hand, doubled the recovery for several of the most hydrophobic analytes (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) and yielded a minor reduction in extraction current. DDMS:thymol (1:2) and [6-methylcoumarin:thymol (1:2)]:NPOE (2:1) were therefore selected as the final liquid membranes for A1 and A2, respectively. The improved recoveries for A2 may have resulted from the relatively weaker interactions provided by NPOE, thereby diminishing the trapping of hydrophobic analytes within the liquid membrane. Kamlet-Taft values for the final A2 mixture could not be determined due to high UV absorbance of NPOE, but are expected to be similar to 6-methylcoumarin:thymol (1:2).</p><p id="Par39">Next, other extraction parameters were considered, namely liquid membrane volume, sample pH, acceptor pH, agitation rate, extraction voltage, and time. To improve the kinetics of the extraction, smaller sample and acceptor vials (200 &#x000b5;L/100 &#x000b5;L, total capacity/filling volume) were used during optimization. For both A1 and A2, 9&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;L of liquid membrane was optimal, while smaller volumes gave rise to greater variability between replicates (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>); 9 &#x000b5;L was therefore selected for both methods. The effect of sample pH was investigated for pH 7.4, 9.0, and 11.0. Increasing the sample pH may theoretically improve the extractability for weaker acids; however, all model analytes were already negatively charged at pH 7.4. As such, pH 7.4 was optimal in both systems (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The decreasing performance at higher pH is explained by electrostatic repulsion of anionic analytes by negatively charged thymol (pKa 10.6) molecules in the sample-liquid membrane interface. Sample pH 7.4 was adjusted by diluting the plasma sample 1:1 (v/v) with 50&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The acceptor pH was investigated in the range pH 7.0&#x02013;11.0 (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>) and found optimal at pH 10 in both systems. pH 10.0 was therefore selected for the acceptor, which was adjusted using LC&#x02013;MS compatible (volatile) 50&#x000a0;mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> buffer. The difference in optimal sample and acceptor pH is explained by the formation of boundary layers at the water-liquid membrane interfaces that locally have a higher and lower pH than the bulk aqueous solution, at the cathode and anode side of the liquid membrane, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For EME of acids, the acceptor-side boundary layer is thus more acidic and requires a higher acceptor pH to be overcome. Agitation rate was studied at 500&#x02013;1000 RPM (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>), with 750 RPM found as optimal in both systems. This is concurrent with previous findings in the commercial extraction format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Finally, the impact of extraction voltage and time was investigated. The results are summarized by Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> as continuous boxplots of recoveries of all analytes extracted with acceptable efficiency (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40%). Based on these, 30&#x000a0;V and 10&#x000a0;V were selected for systems A1 and A2, respectively, as only minor gains were made at greater voltages. Additionally, greater robustness is expected by operating the systems below the maximum tolerable voltage. Optimal extraction time was set to 30&#x000a0;min and 20&#x000a0;min for systems A1 and A2, respectively, as a compromise between extraction efficiency and throughput.

System stability was also evaluated by the dissolution of liquid membrane components into the acceptor phase during extraction, by measuring the individual components with LC-UV.

The contribution from individual components is shown in Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>. The absolute concentration of individual liquid membrane components was&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.96&#x000a0;mg/mL for A1 and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.44&#x000a0;mg/mL for A2. This was considered acceptable and clearly did not cause any disturbance in LC&#x02013;MS signals (no matrix effects) or current instability.

Within their respective extraction windows, the average extraction recovery was 85.1% for A1 and 79.9% for A2. It should be noted that the width of the windows and the performance within are based on a limited number of compounds, and the exact values are therefore uncertain. Considering the price, the&#x02009;~&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mg liquid membrane was estimated to cost 0.079 &#x020ac; and 0.024 &#x020ac; for A1 and A2, respectively, which may be considered negligible in the total analysis cost. The analytical merits were very similar in both systems, and the overall loss of liquid membrane to the acceptor phase was also similar. System A1 however operated at almost threefold less current than A2. Based on these considerations, for overlapping extraction windows system A1 is recommended. The recommendation of both systems is limited to substances with an acidity corresponding to pKa&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6.5. For 6.5&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;pKa&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;9.0, A1 and A2 may be recommended, but the sample and acceptor pH should be re-optimized and dissolution of the liquid membrane should be reevaluated (due to phenol pKa on thymol). No system can currently be recommended for weak acids with pKa&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;9.0, but the authors recommend testing tri(pentyl) phosphate as a liquid membrane that remains unionized at elevated pH. Although not recommended as the first choice for bases, A1 and A2 may also be applied within the extraction windows mentioned above.</p><p id="Par44">These recommendations principally apply to conductive vial&#x02013;based EME, but similar extraction selectivity is expected for other technical formats.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">A new set of liquid membranes and associated experimental conditions (termed A1 and A2) was developed for acidic substances with 0.5&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6.0. The systems were fully compatible with human plasma samples and extracted most analytes within their defined extraction windows exhaustively (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;85%) or near-exhaustively, which represents a major improvement over previous state-of-the-art EME systems for acids. In addition, they can be applied for EME of basic substances as well, although they are not recommended as the first choice. Adding A1 and A2 to previously published first-choice systems, methods for EME in commercial equipment for a wide variety of basic and acidic substances are now available. In forthcoming research, similar conditions will be investigated for acidic substances with log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5. Also, despite the excellent and robust performance of A1 and A2, one limitation to these systems is their formulation of multiple different components in the liquid membrane mixture. Future research may therefore explore simpler liquid membranes that can deliver the same performance.</p><p id="Par46">With the introduction of commercially available EME equipment, the technique has become more accessible to analytical chemists around the world. We hope this work may serve as starting conditions for future applications of robust EME for acidic substances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="216_2024_5503_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 2826 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Published in the topical collection featuring <italic>Sustainability in Sample Preparation</italic> with guest editors Soledad C&#x000e1;rdenas and Pablo Richter.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Chenchen Song: investigation; methodology; writing&#x02014;review and editing.
