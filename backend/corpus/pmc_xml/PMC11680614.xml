In addition, patiromer therapy was also associated with optimization of RAASi therapy (including increasing the proportion of tolerance of target dose MRA and reducing the ratio of RAASi discontinuation). Compared to placebo, the incidence of hypokalemia was significantly higher under patiromer therapy. Our study demonstrated that the incidence of other AEs under patiromer therapy was generally similar to using placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Comparison with Other Studies</title><p id="Par40">In recent years, several clinical trials have reported the effects of patiromer in lowering serum potassium, reducing the incidence of hyperkalemia, and optimizing RAASi therapy in patients with HF.</p><p id="Par41">A previous meta-analysis based on three studies concluded that patiromer as a novel potassium binder could optimize RAASi therapy in patients with HF (RR 1.25, 1.08 to 1.45) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, this study included only three studies, with a lack of heterogeneity, limited follow-up period (1&#x02013;3 months), and small numbers of events and patients, which we believe, hindered the drawing of valid conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, they performed subgroups of the types of potassium binders only, which we believe may, to some extent, omitted some outcomes with clinical value.</p><p id="Par42">Our study has several advantages over previous meta-analyses. First, we comprehensively and systematically studied the effect of patiromer on reducing the incidence of hyperkalemia and optimizing RAASi therapy in HF patients, obtaining pooled results of higher accuracy by excluding confounding factors such as different types of novel potassium binders and various outcomes. Second, we are confident that our results are reliable because the included studies were all RCTs, only one of which had a high risk of bias; despite the high heterogeneity of the pooled results, the sources of heterogeneity were all reasonably justified in sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses, and the pooled results remained stable without directional changes after excluding studies that primarily drove heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Underlying Mechanisms</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Pathophysiology Mechanisms</title><p id="Par43">The renin-angiotensin system plays a vital role in potassium metabolism in patients with HF. Commonly, according to pathophysiological mechanisms, patients with HF have lower cardiac output compared to normal persons, which results in renal hypoperfusion, which activates the renin-angiotensin system, thereby promoting potassium excretion by stimulating aldosterone synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the application of RAASi, including ACEi, ARB, and MRA, inhibits the synthesis or action of aldosterone, resulting in a reduction in potassium excretion. The inhibition would be especially more apparent under the circumstance of combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; high serum potassium can also directly inhibit RAAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], resulting in a tendency to further elevate serum potassium.</p><p id="Par44">Accumulating evidence supports the link between disturbances in potassium metabolism and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF. Several studies reported a U-shaped association between serum potassium and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], that is, the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF was relatively low in a narrow range.</p><p id="Par45">It is worth noting that in the observational study by Cooper et al., after covariate adjustment, hyperkalemia was found associated only with the rise of short-term but not long-term mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Elucidating this causal relationship is of particular clinical importance because it remains unclear whether treatment targeting hyperkalemia can increase the long-term survival rate of patients with HF.</p><p id="Par46">Although it is uncertain whether hyperkalemia is a risk factor or a sign of increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF, certain mechanisms that may increase such risk should be paid attention to.</p><p id="Par47">Hyperkalemia has a grand effect on cardiac electrophysiology, including a decrease in myocardial resting membrane potential, increased cardiac depolarization, myocardial excitability, cardiac instability, and conduction system abnormalities, which could ultimately lead to arrhythmias, and even progress to ventricular fibrillation and asystole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Even if it is indeterminate whether therapies targeting hyperkalemia themselves could directly improve clinical outcomes, such therapies may make it possible for patients with HF to tolerate higher doses of RAASi, thus providing indirect clinical benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Drug Mechanisms</title><p id="Par49">Patiromer is a type of non-absorbable, low expansion ratio, cross-linked polymer, composed of beads with a diameter of about 118 &#x000b5;m, with fine fluidity and appropriate viscosity, and is stable in physiological environments.</p><p id="Par50">Its main mechanism is to exchange Ca<sup>2+</sup> for K<sup>+</sup> in the digestive tract (mainly in the colon, where the concentration of K<sup>+</sup> is the highest) and promote the excretion of K<sup>+</sup> from the feces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Compared with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), patiromer carries physical properties such as limited water absorption and low expansion ratio; therefore, the digestive tract reactions it may cause are relatively low. Another advantage of patiromer is that its exchange ion is Ca<sup>2+</sup> instead of Na<sup>+</sup>; thus, it may be more applicable in patients with high volume load, such as HF, severe hypertension and edema. At physiological pH, each gram of patiromer can bind 8.5&#x02013;8.8 mEq K<sup>+</sup> in vitro, which is much higher than SPS and other resins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Vitro drug&#x02013;drug interaction studies showed the binding rate of patiromer with multiple types of drug cannot be ignored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Based on the vitro data, FDA recommended such types of drug should be taken at least 6 h before or after patiromer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">It is worth noting that patiromer and SZC have considerable distinctions in pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profile respects, rendering them dissimilar. Despite that their pharmacologic mechanisms work similarly such as exchanging cations for potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, binding potassium, and increasing its fecal excretion, the cations they exchange potassium for are totally different: patiromer for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, SZC for Na<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As a consequence, the incidence of edema would be much higher in patients under SZC therapy due to increased absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since HF patients are often volume overloaded, the net clinical benefit of lowering serum potassium with patiromer and SZC might not be equivalent. Min et al. Reported that the initiation of SZC might be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure and severe edema compared to patiromer in routine practice in a cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A previous meta-analysis expounded that comparing with standard of care, patiromer had lower rates of hyperkalemia, while no significant differences between the two groups in terms of overall adverse effects, any serious/specific adverse effects, or treatment discontinuation as a result of adverse effects was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, SZC exhibited varying efficacy and safety. Compared with standard care, SZC showed no significant difference in the occurrence of hyperkalemia during treatment, overall adverse effects, any serious/specific adverse effects, or treatment discontinuation as a result of adverse effects, but showed a higher rate of edema in the treatment group. In addition, the incidence of edema in patients treated with SZC was dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Initiation and Monitoring</title><p id="Par53">Recent studies indicated that the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF was relatively low in a narrow range of serum potassium. Although the optimal range of serum potassium reported by these studies is not completely identical, it is generally relatively safe between 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

For common HF patients with mild hyperkalemia, serum K<sup>+</sup> 5.1&#x02013;5.5 mEq/L is considered acceptable due to relatively low associated risk and should not limit RAASi titration. It is considered acceptable, under such circumstance, to conduct a low-potassium diet or regular therapies (such as initiating a diuretic or increasing its dose) to adjust serum potassium. However, under two circumstances, the algorithm advocated the use of patiromer to enable RAASi titration, which are, first, for heart failure, concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b&#x02013;4, and/or diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with mild hyperkalemia and second, serum K<sup>+</sup> levels &#x0003e; 5.5 mmol/L (moderate and severe hyperkalemia). In patients experiencing severe hyperkalemia (serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003e; 6.0 mEq/L), RAASi therapy should be discontinued or reduced, and patiromer initiated. Following normalization of serum K<sup>+</sup> levels, crucial RAASi therapy should be re-initiated and titrated to maximal doses with close monitoring of serum K<sup>+</sup> levels.</p><p id="Par54">Low serum potassium is a side effect that is reversible and readily managed in HF patients by reducing the patiromer dosage or up-titrated RAASi therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Clinicians have the discretion to adjust the dose of patiromer from 8.4 g to 25.2 g as needed to maintain potassium within a safe range of 4.0 to 5.0 mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Serum potassium and creatinine monitoring would help reduce both unwanted extremities of serum potassium. Although current guideline for the exact timing of monitoring serum potassium and renal function after initiating patiromer remains insufficient, the following suggestions could be offered referring to expert recommendations and guidelines for RAASi titration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]: if the potassium level is very elevated above 6.0 mmol/L or other clinically worrisome factors are present, a repeat potassium level check should be drawn within 12 h to monitor efficacy.
