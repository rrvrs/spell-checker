Introduction</title><p>China is a populous country with a high level of meat consumption. Pork is the primary meat food for both urban and rural residents, accounting for approximately 67% of all meat consumption. Consequently, the cultivation of pig breeds with a high growth rate and high leanness has consistently been a key objective in pig breeding. The identification of candidate genes, gut microbiota, and metabolites associated with fat deposition has emerged as a pivotal research area. In a previous study, we generated genetically modified pigs (hereinafter referred to as KI pigs) with adipose tissue-specific expressions of the <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The results demonstrated that the KI pigs exhibited a markedly enhanced thermoregulatory capacity in comparison to the wild-type (WT) pigs (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Additionally, they displayed a notable reduction in adiposity (4.89%), a considerable decrease in backfat thickness (2.4 mm), and a substantial increase in lean body mass (3.38%). Consequently, the KI pigs exhibited a low adiposity and a high lean body mass, a trait of significant commercial value [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While previous studies have elucidated that the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> gene in adipose tissue promotes lipolysis, further clarification is required regarding the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the low fat rate observed in KI pigs.</p><p>The intestinal flora represents a significant component of the normal ecosystem of the host, comprising thousands of distinct microorganisms within the gut, collectively referred to as the &#x02018;second genome&#x02019; [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over an extended period of evolutionary history, the host organism and its associated microbiota have co-evolved to form a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. This relationship is involved in a range of physiological and pathological processes, including digestion, absorption, immunity, and the development of disease in the host [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The composition of microorganisms is subject to a number of factors, including dietary intake, environmental conditions, and genetics [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Wu et al. investigated the effects of HIF-2&#x003b1; deficiency on the intestinal microbiota using a mouse model of intestinal epithelial cells. They observed that <italic toggle="yes">HIF-2&#x003b1;</italic> deficiency altered the intestinal microbiota, reduced lactate synthesis, increased the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcus</italic> torques in the intestine, and upregulated intestinal and plasma deoxycholic acid levels. This resulted in the activation of the white adipose tissue expression of <italic toggle="yes">TGR5</italic> to promote thermogenesis and the amelioration of high-fat diet-induced obesity [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our preceding study, we discovered that <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> KI pigs exhibited markedly enhanced thermoregulatory capabilities compared to wild-type (WT) pigs. Additionally, we observed a notable increase in lean body mass. Subsequent analysis revealed that plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were significantly elevated, while triglyceride content was significantly reduced in KI pigs. Subsequent lipidomic investigations of adipose tissue from KI pigs revealed that the adipose-specific expression of <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> markedly altered the lipid composition of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue from Parma pigs, with a notable reduction in triglycerides and an increase in phospholipids and sphingolipids [<xref rid="B6-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, the modified lipid constitution of adipose tissue can result in alterations in lipids within the organismal system, thereby regulating host gut microbiota homeostasis. Subsequent findings demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> expression not only reduced the expression of genes closely related to bile acid metabolism but also resulted in alterations to the composition of the intestinal flora. This was accompanied by increased levels of porcine deoxycholic acid in vivo and collectively facilitated the hydrolysis of adipose tissue [<xref rid="B7-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The colon represents a significant site of microbial fermentation. Nutrients in foods that are not fully digested are transported to the colon, where they are broken down by the gut microbiota. It has been demonstrated that in excess of one-third of the small molecules present in the blood of humans originate from the microbial flora of the gut [<xref rid="B8-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], The metabolites of gut microorganisms can be absorbed into the bloodstream via the hepatic&#x02013;intestinal circulation, thereby participating in the regulation of host physiological processes [<xref rid="B10-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids, are the primary metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria from the breakdown of dietary fibre. As microbial derivatives that are highly abundant in the intestinal lumen, SCFAs are not only metabolic by-products, but they also act as signal molecules that can activate gene expression in host cells. This action helps to alleviate and regulate key physiological processes, including intestinal inflammation, the nervous system, and the endocrine system. For example, butyrate and other SCFAs have been shown to promote B-cell differentiation and increase the number of B-cells. Additionally, butyrate has been demonstrated to inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines by neutrophils in patients with enteritis, thereby attenuating the intestinal inflammatory response [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The compound activates the intestinal AMPK signal pathway, which in turn increases the expression of genes related to Occludin, Claudins, and Cadherin in the intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins. This has the effect of regulating intestinal permeability and the integrity of the intestinal barrier, thereby promoting intestinal functions [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, SCFAs have been demonstrated to stimulate the release of cholecystokinin, thereby activating the vagus nerve and increasing feelings of satiety [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) within the colon bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), thereby stimulating the production of gut hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The results of animal studies indicate that SCFAs may play a role in energy acquisition, which in turn contributes to the development of obesity [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether there are alterations in the SCFAs present in the intestines of UCP1 pigs, and whether these altered SCFAs are involved in the deposition of fat in pigs.</p><p>In this study, targeted metabolomic techniques were employed to examine the abundance and fractions of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fecal samples from adult wild-type (WT) and UCP1 knock-in pigs. Furthermore, the gut microbial communities potentially involved in SCFA metabolism were analyzed in depth by 16s rRNA sequencing. Furthermore, in vitro adipocyte differentiation and lipogenic function studies were conducted on the screened differential SCFAs, which contributed to our in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the low adiposity observed in UCP1 pigs. This study not only enhances our comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms of porcine fat metabolism but also furnishes a scientific foundation for the commercialization of <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> gene-edited pigs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-12-00102"><title>2.

The content in WT pigs was 1.84 times higher than that in KI pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vetsci-12-00102"><title>3.2. Distinctive Variations in the Fecal Microbiology of KI and WT Pigs</title><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) represent the primary products of dietary fibre fermentation within the intestine. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed decrease in SCFA content and alteration in fecal fraction proportions in KI pigs, we employed the 16s rRNA technique to characterize the microbial composition in the feces of WT and KI pigs. The results demonstrated significant discrepancies in the microbial composition of the feces of KI and WT pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Additionally, &#x003b1;-diversity indices, including the Chao1 index and Simpson&#x02019;s index, exhibited a notable elevation in KI pigs compared to WT pigs (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), indicating a more diverse bacterial flora in the former (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Furthermore, a comparison of the flora composition of WT and UCP1 pigs at the phylum level (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C) and at the genus level (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D) revealed significant discrepancies between the two. For instance, at the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes was higher in KI pigs than in WT pigs, whereas the abundance of Spirochaetes was lower than in WT pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). At the genus level, the abundance of Prevotella was higher than in WT pigs, whereas the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> was lower than in WT pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Furthermore, six genera were identified as significantly different between WT and KI pigs (Fold Change &#x0003e;2, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), with <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Coprococcus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Dorea</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Oscillospira,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">rc4-4</italic> being significantly more abundant in KI pigs than in WT pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Conversely, <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. were significantly less abundant than in WT pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E,F). Furthermore, functional enrichment revealed that the abundance of metabolism-related pathways, including amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, was markedly elevated in KI pigs relative to WT pigs. Conversely, the abundance of disease-related pathways was significantly diminished in KI pigs compared to WT pigs, indicating that the KI pigs may possess a more robust gut flora structure (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G). Taken together, the results demonstrated that the gut microbiota of KI pigs exhibited notable differences from that of WT pigs in terms of diversity, composition, and functionality.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-vetsci-12-00102"><title>3.3. SCFA Content Is Significantly and Positively Correlated with Porcine Adiposity and Streptococcus spp. Abundance</title><p>Despite the identification of significant differences in SCFAs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and microbial composition (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) within the feces of KI pigs compared with those of WT pigs, the inter-relationship between SCFAs and the differential microorganisms, as well as their connection to porcine lipogenesis, remains ambiguous. Consequently, we conducted Pearson correlation analyses of body weight and adiposity in 6-month-old WT and KI pigs with the SCFA content in the feces and differential bacteria. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between six differential SCFAs (acetic acid, methylacetic acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid) and body weight and fat percentage in pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Conversely, the abundance of the differential microorganisms <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Coprococcus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Oscillospira</italic> exhibited a significant negative correlation with body weight and fat percentage (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), while the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. demonstrated a significant positive correlation with body weight and adiposity, and only <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. exhibited a significant positive correlation with the content of SCFAs. In contrast, the abundance of the differentiated bacteria showed a significant negative correlation with the content of SCFAs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). The fat rate of KI pigs was found to be significantly lower than that of WT pigs, and the content of SCFAs in the feces of KI pigs was also significantly lower than that of WT pigs. Correlation analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the two, suggesting that SCFAs may play a role in promoting adipogenesis. Conversely, the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. was significantly lower in KI pigs than in WT pigs, and it had a significant positive correlation with the fat rate and body weight. It was therefore inferred that the reduction in SCFAs in the intestinal tract of KI pigs might be related to the decrease in the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic>. However, the specific molecular mechanism requires further verification through additional experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-vetsci-12-00102"><title>3.4. Caproic Acid Enhanced the Efficiency of SVF Cell Differentiation to Mature Adipocytes</title><p>Six SCFAs were identified as being significantly and positively correlated with porcine adiposity. It was hypothesized that the lower adiposity of KI pigs may be caused by a reduction in the content of SCFAs in their intestines. However, the effect of SCFAs on porcine fat deposition remains unknown. It was therefore decided that caproic acid, which is the most different in the feces of WT and KI pigs (except for isovaleric acid), should be the subject of further investigation with a view to establishing its role in regulating lipid deposition in porcine SVF cells. SVF cells were isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Bama pigs and added to a medium containing varying concentrations of sodium caproate salt. This induced the differentiation of SVF cells into mature adipocytes, allowing for an assessment of the lipogenic efficiency of this differentiation process on the formation of white adipocytes (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Following an eight-day period of induced differentiation, the SVF was observed to successfully differentiate into mature adipocytes. The treatment of sodium caproate at a concentration of 0.1 mM was found to significantly enhance the efficiency of SVF differentiation into mature adipocytes (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B,C, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Conversely, sodium caproate at a concentration of 3 mM was observed to significantly reduce the efficiency of SVF differentiation into white adipocytes (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B,C, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) [<xref rid="B21-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the alterations in the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">FFAR2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> genes were identified following the administration of varying concentrations of sodium caproate. The findings demonstrated that sodium caproate treatment could stimulate the expression of <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). The aforementioned results indicated that sodium caproate could promote the differentiation of SVF cells to mature adipocytes by activating the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> gene, with the 0.1 mM concentration demonstrating the most pronounced effect.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vetsci-12-00102"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Leanness is an important indicator of pig growth and farrowing time. Consequently, breeding low-fat-rate pig breeds is now one of the goals of pig breeding. This is achieved by identifying candidate genes that regulate lipid metabolism in pigs. Furthermore, the excavation and identification of the intestinal probiotics and prebiotics associated with pig fat deposition represents another means of regulating pig growth from the perspective of energy intake [<xref rid="B22-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate genetically modified pigs with the adipose tissue-specific expression of the <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> gene. The KI pigs displayed a reduced fat percentage and an increased lean mass compared to the WT pigs [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genetic background of the KI pigs is consistent with that of the WT pigs, with the exception of differences in adipose tissue <italic toggle="yes">UCP1</italic> gene expression. This makes them an appropriate model for screening probiotics and prebiotics. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) constitute a group of saturated fatty acids with a chain length of one to six carbon atoms. They are primarily produced by gut microorganisms that ferment unconsumed fibre in the diet, providing energy to intestinal epithelial cells and supplying approximately 10% of the host&#x02019;s energy each day [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The proportion of acetate, butyrate, and propionate in the SCFAs produced in the host intestine was high, accounting for approximately 90% of the total SCFAs [<xref rid="B24-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The principal components of the seven SCFAs identified were acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid, collectively accounting for approximately 80% of the total SCFAs. The production of SCFAs by the gut can regulate the host&#x02019;s energy homeostasis and contribute to the development of the host&#x02019;s obese phenotype [<xref rid="B25-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A number of studies have indicated that individuals with a higher body mass index (BMI) have a greater concentration of SCFAs in their feces than those with a lower BMI [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Notably, this difference is not attributed to variations in dietary intake or the absorption of SCFAs [<xref rid="B26-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The findings of our study align with the observation that the fat percentage was markedly lower in KI pigs compared to WT pigs. Additionally, the total amount of SCFAs and the concentration of seven SCFAs in the feces of KI pigs were found to be significantly reduced in comparison to WT pigs (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00102-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). SCFAs are produced by gut microbes that ferment dietary fibres that are not easily digested by the host. The fecal microbial composition of the KI pigs in this study differed significantly from that of the WT pigs, which may be the primary factor contributing to the observed differences in SCFAs. It is commonly reported in the literature that butyric acid production is typically attributed to <italic toggle="yes">Firmicutes</italic> [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The butyric acid content of the feces of the KI pigs was found to be significantly lower than that of the wild-type pigs, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the relative abundance of the thick-walled phylum is lower in the former than in the latter at six months of age. The results of the correlation analysis indicated that the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. was significantly and positively correlated with the content of differential SCFAs and also positively correlated with adiposity. This suggests that <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. may be involved in the production of SCFAs in the intestinal tracts of pigs in the KI, which is consistent with the production of acetic acid SCFAs by <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. as reported in the literature [<xref rid="B28-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, the identity of the predominant species of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> awaits confirmation. It has been documented in the scientific literature that SCFAs not only provide energy to the host organism but are also pivotal signal molecules that function by binding to the G protein-coupled receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (<italic toggle="yes">FFAR2</italic>) and free fatty acid receptor 4 (<italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic>). These receptors are expressed in the intestinal mucosa, immune cells, liver, and adipose tissue [<xref rid="B29-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that the expression of <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> in adipose tissue is markedly elevated in individuals with obesity in comparison to those with a normal BMI. Furthermore, a detrimental variant of <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> (p.R270H) has been linked to elevated fasting glucose levels and an increased risk of obesity. This variant has also been observed to play a role in the development of obesity in both human and murine models [<xref rid="B30-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Concurrently, some studies have indicated that SCFAs can stimulate <italic toggle="yes">FFAR2</italic>, thereby enhancing energy uptake in white adipose tissue [<xref rid="B32-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, it has been documented in the scientific literature that acetate exerts anti-lipolytic effects through the inhibition of HSL phosphorylation in human pluripotent adipose tissue-derived stem cells, which is mediated by FFARs [<xref rid="B33-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The present study revealed that the concentration of SCFAs in the feces of KI pigs was markedly lower than that of WT pigs. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between the SCFA content and porcine adiposity. However, the impact of SCFAs on porcine fat deposition remains unclear. Accordingly, we examined the impact of caproic acid, which exhibited the most pronounced variation in KI and WT pigs, on the in vitro lipogenesis of SVF cells. The findings indicated the administration of sodium caproate at a concentration of 0.1 mM. The differentiation efficiency of SVF to mature adipocytes was significantly increased by 0.1 mM sodium caproate; the expression of genes related to lipogenesis was increased as well. However, the treatment of sodium caproate at a concentration of 3 mM was ineffective, which may be due to the fact that the sodium caproate at a concentration of 0.1 mM promotes SVF proliferation and lipid synthesis, but the 3 mM concentration of sodium caproate had a certain toxic effect on cells and promoted apoptosis. Nevertheless, the treatment of SVF cells with either 0.1 mM or 3 mM concentrations of caproic acid sodium salt was observed to significantly upregulate <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> gene expression, while having no effect on FFAR2. This suggests that caproic acid sodium salt may regulate the differentiation of SVF cells to white adipocytes and lipogenesis through <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> activation but not FFAR2. This is consistent with the findings that high concentrations of caproic acid are associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity [<xref rid="B34-vetsci-12-00102" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, this is consistent with the observation of low concentrations of SCFAs and low adiposity in the feces of KI pigs. Nevertheless, further validation and mechanistic elucidation at the individual level are required to confirm the mechanisms by which the high expression of the UCP1 gene in adipose tissue in KI pigs regulates the reduction in <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp. abundance and produces SCFAs. Additionally, the role of SCFAs in the regulation of adipose tissue lipogenesis remains to be elucidated. The present study sought to elucidate the compositional differences in SCFAs and intestinal flora between KI and WT pigs. It revealed a notable decline in the concentration of SCFAs in the feces of KI pigs, which may be linked to a reduction in the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> spp.</p><p>Furthermore, the study demonstrated the efficacy of SCFAs in promoting the differentiation of SVF cells into mature adipocytes through the activation of <italic toggle="yes">FFAR4</italic> gene expression.
