Several studies have reported an association between suicidal behaviors (i.e., suicide ideation, plans, and attempts) and food insecurity. This meta-analytic review for the first time, synthesized the available literature to determine the pooled prevalence of suicidal behaviors among individuals experiencing food insecurity, and examined the strength of their association.</p></sec><sec id="sec0979"><title>Objectives</title><p>To determine the pooled prevalence of suicidal behaviors among individuals experiencing food insecurity, and examine the strength of their association.</p></sec><sec id="sec0980"><title>Methods</title><p>Databases (<italic toggle="yes">Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL</italic>) were searched using the appropriate search term from inception to July 2022. Eligible studies reporting the number/prevalence of suicidal behaviors among individuals experiencing food insecurity or the association between food insecurity and suicidal behaviors were included. The pooled prevalence of suicidal behaviors was determined using the random-effects model. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022352858).</p></sec><sec id="sec0981"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 47 studies comprising 75,346 individuals having experienced food insecurity were included. The pooled prevalence was 22.3% for suicide ideation (95% CI: 14.7-29.9; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=99.6%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, k=18), 18.1% for suicide plans (95% CI: 7.0-29.1; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=99.6%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, k=4), 17.2% for suicide attempts (95% CI: 9.6-24.8; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=99.9%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, k=12), and 4.6% for unspecified suicidal behavior (95% CI: 2.8-6.4; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=85.5%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, k=5). There was a positive relationship between experiencing food insecurity and (i) suicide ideation (aOR=1.049 [95% CI: 1.046-1.052; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=99.6%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, k=31]), (ii) suicide plans (aOR=1.480 [95% CI: 1.465-1.496; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=99.1%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, k=5]), and (iii) unspecified suicide behaviors (aOR=1.133 [95% CI: 1.052-1.219; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=53.0%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.047, k=6]). However, a negative relationship was observed between experiencing food insecurity and suicide attempts (aOR=0.622 [95% CI: 0.617-0.627; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 98.8%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, k=15]). The continent and the countries income status where the study was conducted were the common cause of heterogeneity of the differences in the odds of the relationships between experiencing food insecurity and suicidal behaviors - with North America and high-income countries (HICs) having higher odds. For suicide attempts, all non HICs had a negative relationship with food insecurity.</p></sec><sec id="sec0982"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is a high prevalence of suicidal behaviors among individuals experiencing food insecurity.
