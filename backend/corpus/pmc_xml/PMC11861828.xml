We aimed to determine if primary care patients at risk for MASLD and advanced fibrosis were evaluated with subsequent testing. A secondary aim was to determine if at-risk patients with normal aminotransferases had advanced fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Primary care patients at increased risk for MASLD with advanced fibrosis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;91,914) were identified using previously established criteria. Patients with known alternative/concomitant etiology of liver disease or cirrhosis were excluded. The study cohort included patients with calculated FIB-4 score in 2020 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;52,006), and stratified into low, indeterminate, and high likelihood of advanced fibrosis. Among those at indeterminate/high risk, rates of subsequent testing were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Risk stratification with FIB-4 characterized 77% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40,026) as low risk, 17% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8847) as indeterminate, and 6% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3133) as high risk. Among indeterminate/high-risk patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11,980), 78.7% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9433) had aminotransferases within normal limits, 0.95% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;114) had elastography, and 8.2% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;984) were referred for subspecialty evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">In this cohort of primary care patients at risk for MASLD with fibrosis, the FIB-4 score identified a substantial proportion of indeterminate/high-risk patients, the majority of which had normal aminotransferase levels. Low rates of subsequent testing were observed. These data suggest that a majority of patients at increased risk for liver-related outcomes remain unrecognized and highlight opportunities to facilitate their identification.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11606-024-08955-9.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>MASLD</kwd><kwd>non-invasive testing</kwd><kwd>fibrosis-4 score</kwd><kwd>screening</kwd><kwd>advanced fibrosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008478</institution-id><institution>Wake Forest School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural</award-id><award-id>Clinical Scholar in Informatics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Ted G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Wake Forest University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by the Carolinas Consortium.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Society of General Internal Medicine 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec2"><title>BACKGROUND</title><p id="Par16">The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the general population of adults is estimated to be 25&#x02013;30% and it is generally asymptomatic, hindering early diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> This number is likely to increase further given the association between NAFLD, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> These associations indeed gave rise to the more descriptive terminology the field has recently shifted to, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) .<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> is essentially the subset of MASLD patients with associated steatohepatitis and/or development of fibrosis (formerly NASH).

Of those meeting the criteria for further testing, less than 1% underwent elastography, and less than 10% underwent subspecialty evaluation, suggesting a substantial proportion of patients and their providers were unaware of their risk for liver-related morbidity and mortality. These data suggest that patients with MASLD at increased risk for advanced fibrosis are underdiagnosed and are at risk for developing potentially preventable liver-related-complications.</p><p id="Par32">Though risk factors for MASLD are well established, previously published data suggest underdiagnosis of MASLD in the primary care setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> In a large Medicare claims database (&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 million patients assessed), the reported prevalence of MASLD was 5.7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> This is supported in the current study as only 5.3% of the cohort at risk for MASLD were carrying an ICD-10 diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH. This is discordant with the previously reported 25% of the general population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> indicating significant under-recognition of the disease. Although not all patients with metabolic risk factors develop MASLD, it is estimated that their risk is 1.3&#x02013;1.7 times higher than the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> In patients with T2DM, the prevalence of MASLD ranges from 30 to 75%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Despite this strong association, we did not observe significant differences in subsequent testing based on the presence of T2DM, further highlighting under-recognition.</p><p id="Par33">Utilization of a faulty diagnostic heuristic could be a potential reason for the under-recognition of MASLD. While using the FIB-4 scores to identify at-risk patients is well-established, previous studies suggest that providers may instead rely upon liver enzymes as a screening heuristic for MASLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Elevated aminotransferase levels should alarm providers to investigate hepatic injury, but normal aminotransferase levels do not necessarily reflect the absence of liver disease. In fact, aminotransferase levels can be normal in patients with MASLD/MASH and advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis on biopsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> In the present study, just under one-quarter (22%) of patients with normal aminotransferase levels had advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis based on elastography. Alarmingly, 64.2% of patients in our study with high FIB-4 scores had aminotransferase levels within the normal range (as defined by their local lab). Thus, it is unlikely those patients would have &#x0201c;raised suspicion&#x0201d; in their PCPs of underlying liver disease, highlighting a major shortcoming of relying on aminotransferase levels alone.</p><p id="Par34">Only recently have the identified risk factors and the sequential use of NIT in screening patients at risk been codified into recommendations by US professional societies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> However, specific risk factors for MASLD (i.e., T2DM, metabolic syndrome) have long been recognized to be associated with an increased risk of MASH and/or advanced fibrosis, and the diagnostic utility of the FIB-4 score for identifying at-risk patients was well-established prior to the publication of the 2021 ACG Clinical Pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>&#x000a0;The main objective in primary care clinics is to identify the large proportion of MASLD patients at low risk for advanced fibrosis, as only a minority (3&#x02013;5%) of patients with MASLD will progress to cirrhosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> In this setting, the excellent negative predictive value (~&#x02009;90%) of the widely available/cost-effective FIB-4 score can exclude advanced fibrosis and identify low-risk patients who do not require additional testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Though these patients are at decreased risk of liver-related morbidity/mortality compared to those with higher degrees of fibrosis, they remain at risk for death from cardiovascular disease and non-hepatic malignancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> In this population, management of metabolic syndrome components may both decrease the risk of fibrosis progression and improve non-liver-related morbidity/mortality.</p><p id="Par35">The FIB-4 score identifies a substantial proportion of patients in the indeterminate or high-risk category (i.e., increased risk) needing further evaluation. In the US, it is estimated that 20.3 million patients would be categorized as indeterminate or high-risk based on the FIB-4 score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Due to the low positive predictive value of FIB-4 score for advanced fibrosis, especially within the indeterminate population, subsequent assessment strategies such as elastography or serum tests are recommended to evaluate for liver fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> In those patients undergoing further assessment (i.e., elastography), it is suggested those patients who remain at indeterminate or high risk and/or have discordant findings undergo additional testing (i.e., subspecialty referral and/or liver biopsy). The objective in this population is to identify patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis so targeted and evidence-based interventions that improve morbidity and mortality can be appropriately initiated (i.e., variceal and hepatocellular carcinoma screening). Thus, identifying patients with advanced liver fibrosis has important clinical implications. Prior population-based data suggest approximately 4% of patients with indeterminate FIB-4 scores will have elastography suggesting advanced fibrosis, thus re-classifying these patients as high-risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> If our entire indeterminate risk population (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8847) were screened with elastography, there would be an additional 354 patients diagnosed with advanced fibrosis. However, in our study, 0.7% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;61) of the entire indeterminate risk population was screened and only 18 patients were diagnosed with advanced fibrosis, leaving a majority of patients with advanced fibrosis undiagnosed.</p><p id="Par36">With the rising prevalence of MASLD, we can expect further strain on limited healthcare resources and exacerbation of the already substantial economic burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Given the large number of patients with MASLD, a common clinical question raised by PCPs is which patients to refer for subspecialty evaluation. A 2018 prospective longitudinal cohort study from the UK implemented a two-step screening pathway in the primary care setting utilizing FIB-4 score as the initial screening test. Prior to introduction of the pathway, 66% of patients referred for subspecialty evaluation had a baseline FIB-4 score suggesting low risk of advanced fibrosis (i.e., referral could have been avoided).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Following implementation, they observed an 80% decrease in unnecessary referrals. Furthermore, the pathway increased the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis five-fold and three-fold, respectively. These real-world data demonstrate that implementing screening pathways will likely optimize use of the limited available resources. This group also demonstrated the cost efficiency of such screening programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup></p><p id="Par37">Limitations to our study must be acknowledged. The study period preceded the publication of the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) Clinical Care Pathway in 2021, which outlines a strategy for screening at-risk patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Available data did not allow determination of the frequency with which PCPs calculated FIB-4 scores in clinical practice during the study period (calculated post hoc). This raises two troublesome but equally important possibilities. First, our data may reflect the previously reported low utilization of FIB-4 scores in clinical practice among PCPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, the low number of patients with elevated liver chemistries likely resulted in the under-recognition of at-risk patients. Alternatively, if one were to assume FIB-4 scores were calculated with regularity during the study period, the data would suggest inadequate resources to appropriately link identified at-risk patients to subsequent testing. Additionally, the study cohort was followed in calendar year 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic which may have influenced practice patterns. Reassuringly, similar data collected from 2012 to 2021 (encompassing 8&#x000a0;years of data collection not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic) demonstrated that 10.3% of patients underwent confirmatory testing, similar to the observed rates in the present study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Another limitation of the study is that the specific indication for subspecialty referral was not known in all patients. Thus, it is likely that a proportion of referrals observed were in fact for diagnoses other than MASLD (i.e., unrelated to liver disease). This would suggest that MASLD and advanced fibrosis as a reason for referral was even lower than the&#x02009;~&#x02009;8% observed. We acknowledge that the generalizability of the results may be limited as this study was performed within a single healthcare system; however, our study included over 300 providers at 60 primary care practices. Additionally, the race/ethnic composition of our population may not be representative of other geographic locations and/or healthcare systems.</p><p id="Par38">Our study has several strengths. In attempts to overcome the inherent limitation of using ICD-10 codes, our study created a computational algorithm in the EHR (electronic phenotyping) for MASLD with risk for advanced fibrosis. We included utilizing source data from the EHR when possible (i.e., BMI measurements, measured hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, etc.). This likely improved accuracy in the identification of the at-risk population. Compared to similar work, our study included a larger study population because the analysis was not limited to patients previously diagnosed with MASLD, but rather included the entire primary care population at risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Thus, we were able to identify previously undiagnosed patients with MASLD at risk for advanced fibrosis in addition to those already diagnosed with MASLD.</p><p id="Par39">The present study suggests that patients with MASLD at risk for liver-related outcomes remain under-identified, potentially due to dependence on a historical heuristic (elevated aminotransferase levels). The electronic phenotyping of MASLD and advanced fibrosis within this study also highlights an opportunity for screening tools for patients at risk for MASLD. The computational algorithm for identification of patients with MASLD and MASH at risk for advanced fibrosis provides a foundation for further investigation of EHR-based implementation studies. Acknowledging the significant responsibilities and time constraints of PCPs, along with patient-level factors, we hypothesize developing EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) tools facilitating screening and appropriate subsequent testing for patients will be embraced by patients, providers, and health systems. Such processes may also allow for optimizing the efficient use of resources to ensure those with MASLD at the highest risk of advanced fibrosis are identified and appropriately managed to prevent liver-related morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="11606_2024_8955_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 22 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>NAFLD</term><def><p id="Par5">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NASH</term><def><p id="Par6">Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MASLD</term><def><p id="Par7">Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FIB-4</term><def><p id="Par8">Fibrosis-4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2DM</term><def><p id="Par9">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELF</term><def><p id="Par10">Enhanced liver fibrosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VCTE</term><def><p id="Par11">Vibration controlled transient elastography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPV</term><def><p id="Par12">Negative predictive value</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIT</term><def><p id="Par13">Non-invasive testing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EHR</term><def><p id="Par14">Electronic health record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDS</term><def><p id="Par15">Clinical decision support</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contribution:</title><p>Dr. Xiao and Dr. Rudnick contributed to the study concept and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, drafting of the manuscript, and critical revision of the manuscript.</p><p>Ms. Witek, Ms. Bundy, Mr. Moses, and Mr. Obermiller contributed to acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, statistical analysis, and critical revision of the manuscript.</p><p>Dr. Dharod advised on the study concept and design refinement, study supervision, acquisition of data, and critical revision of the manuscript.</p><p>Dr. Russo and Dr. Schreiner advised on study concept and design refinement and critical revision of the manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by the Carolinas Consortium.
