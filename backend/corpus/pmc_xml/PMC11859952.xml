Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), produced by K cells in the duodenum and jejunum, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), synthesized by L cells in the small intestine and colon, both play critical roles in the regulating glucose homeostasis [<xref rid="bvaf022-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. GIP and GLP-1 collaborate to enhance postprandial insulin secretion, thereby facilitating the efficient disposal of glucose following a meal through a phenomenon known as the incretin effect [<xref rid="bvaf022-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This effect refers to the enhanced insulin response to oral glucose, primarily mediated by the actions of the incretin hormones GIP and GLP-1 on incretin receptors located on pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. The presence of nutrients, particularly carbohydrates and fats, in the digestive system triggers the release of these hormones. Research has shown that in healthy individuals, the incretin effect accounts for approximately 70% of postprandial insulin secretion, with GIP contributing around 44% [<xref rid="bvaf022-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This makes GIP as the primary contributor to the incretin effect and a significant factor in postprandial glucose regulation [<xref rid="bvaf022-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Although GIP is the primary incretin hormone in healthy individuals and plays a crucial role in incretin effects, its insulin response is significantly reduced in individuals with T2DM who have uncontrolled hyperglycemia, a phenomenon referred to as GIP resistance [<xref rid="bvaf022-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This resistance is attributed to reduced GIP receptor expression and postreceptor defects associated with prolonged &#x003b2; cell stimulation [<xref rid="bvaf022-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a result, GIP has traditionally not been considered a viable therapeutic target for T2DM. Intriguingly, recent studies have demonstrated that the insulinotropic effectiveness of GIP can be partially restored through improved glycemic control [<xref rid="bvaf022-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf022-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These promising discoveries have paved the way for the development of therapies based on GIP receptor agonists or strategies aimed at enhancing the endogenous secretion of GIP for the treatment of T2DM [<xref rid="bvaf022-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In the regulation of incretin secretion, the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex plays a critical role [<xref rid="bvaf022-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Secretagogin (SCGN), an EF-hand calcium binding protein, is primarily found in islet cells, specific regions of the brain, and enteroendocrine cells (EECs). SCGN interacts with the core SNARE protein SNAP25 and &#x003b2;-actin, functioning as a key regulator of the vesicular secretion of hormones such as insulin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and oxytocin, among others [<xref rid="bvaf022-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf022-B12" ref-type="bibr">12-16</xref>]. Recent research has shown that SCGN is colocalized with GLP-1 in intestinal L-cells and plays a pivotal role in the circadian release of GLP-1 [<xref rid="bvaf022-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether SCGN also regulates the secretion of GIP. Given the significant similarity in secretion mechanisms between GIP and GLP-1, we hypothesized that SCGN may have the potential to regulate GIP secretion. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to examine the influence of SCGN on GIP secretion using both human plasma samples and <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> knockout mouse models.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="bvaf022-s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="bvaf022-s1.1"><title>Cohort of Study and Human Duodenal Tissue</title><p>The study encompassed 128 participants from The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University Health Science Center spanning the years 2023 to 2024. These comprised 64 individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes and 64 nondiabetic healthy control individuals from the Department of Metabolism and Endocrinology. Specifically, the inclusion criteria for patients with newly onset diabetes in this study required that participants be aged between 18 and 65 years, have a duration of diabetes of less than 1 year, and meet the 1999 World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Participants were excluded if they had a history of chronic illnesses or had been taking medications that affect glucose metabolism within the past 6 months. Additionally, pregnant or lactating individuals as well as those unable or unwilling to provide informed consent were also excluded. The healthy control cohort consisted of individuals aged 18 to 65 years, who had no history of chronic disease or regular medication consumption. Individuals with diabetes were excluded based on their levels of fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin. The clinical characteristics of the patients and control individuals are summarized in <xref rid="bvaf022-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

These hormones play critical roles in managing glucose homeostasis and regulating appetite through both endocrine and neural mechanisms [<xref rid="bvaf022-B23" ref-type="bibr">23-25</xref>]. In these 2 hormones, GIP contributes approximately two-thirds of the entire incretin effect in insulin section. In patients with T2DM, the overall incretin effect is reduced [<xref rid="bvaf022-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf022-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf022-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The cellular mechanisms and intestinal cues that regulate endogenous GIP secretion continue to be areas of active research yet remain poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the calcium-binding protein SCGN is abundantly expressed in GIP-producing K cells within the human and mouse intestinal epithelium. The presence of SCGN in K cells, along with its colocalization with GIP, prompted us to investigate its previously unrecognized physiological roles in regulating GIP secretion. We observed a positive correlation between SCGN and GIP levels in postprandial states among patients with T2DM, leptin receptor gene knockout&#x02013;induced diabetic mice (db/db mice), and their healthy controls. Consequently, we generated <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> KO mouse models to further evaluate the function of SCGN in regulating GIP secretion. Our findings indicate that <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> KO mice exhibit impaired tolerance to lard oil and glucose, characterized by decreased postprandial levels of GIP and insulin, alongside elevated triglyceride and glucose levels. Finally, we assessed K-cell numbers, GIP mRNA expression, and intestinal morphology in <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> KO mice. Our results revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> deficiency did not affect K-cell number, GIP mRNA expression, or intestinal morphology.</p><p>Previous studies have found that <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> is expressed in intestinal L cells and plays a role in GLP-1 secretion. <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> knockout mice and siRNA-treated cells exhibited significantly reduced GLP-1 secretion in response to nutrient stimulation [<xref rid="bvaf022-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. SCGN was found to interact with SNAP25 and &#x003b2;-actin, which are components of the SNARE secretory complex, thereby regulating secretory granule dynamics [<xref rid="bvaf022-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf022-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Meanwhile, the expression of SCGN is regulated by the clock gene <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>, leading to the circadian release of GLP-1 [<xref rid="bvaf022-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar to its role in GLP-1 secretion, our study revealed a positive correlation between SCGN and GIP in both patients with T2DM and healthy controls postprandially. We further verified the key role of SCGN in GIP secretion using knockout mice. Consequently, our study enhances the understanding of SCGN's function in regulating the secretion of incretin hormones in intestinal endocrine cells.</p><p>To clarify that the decrease in GIP secretion resulting from <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> KO is not due to a reduction in K-cell number or GIP protein synthesis, we observed that <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> KO has no significant effects on intestinal structure or the number of K cells, nor does it impact the synthesis of GIP mRNA. By analyzing the role of SCGN in regulating the secretion of GLP-1 and insulin, it is reasonable to postulate that SCGN regulates GIP secretion by influencing the process of vesicle secretion.</p><p>Given that SCGN can regulate the secretion of both GIP and GLP-1, key factors in facilitating weight loss [<xref rid="bvaf022-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], it is plausible to speculate that a decrease in SCGN levels may impact body weight. Although the current study found that <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> gene knockout had no significant effect on the body weight of mice under short-term, normal-diet feeding, further investigation under long-term, nutrient-rich conditions will be crucial to elucidate this issue. Additionally, examining SCGN levels and exploring their relationship with GIP and GLP-1 in obese cohorts would be beneficial for validating this correlation.</p><p>Although this study established a well-defined relationship between SCGN and GIP secretion, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, the precise mechanism by which SCGN regulates GIP secretion remains unclear, necessitating further investigation to determine whether the expression of SCGN and GIP secretion is also influenced by circadian proteins. Additionally, it is important to assess whether SCGN-regulated, stage-wise SNARE assembly plays a critical role in this process [<xref rid="bvaf022-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Secondly, the use of general <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> knockout mice in this study complicates the interpretation of our findings, making it challenging to ascertain whether the observed decrease in insulin levels was a result of diminished GIP secretion or a direct consequence of SCGN's effect on insulin secretion. To address this, the use of K cell conditional knockout mice is necessary. Thirdly, the sample size in our clinical study is relatively limited, necessitating validation in a larger cohort in the future. Finally, another potential limitation is the possibility that <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> deletion may also affect the release of other hormones with intestinotrophic effects, which could subsequently influence intestinal morphology and function. Future studies should investigate this aspect to enhance our understanding of the broader implications of SCGN deficiency.</p><p>Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SCGN is abundantly expressed in both human and mouse intestinal K cells, and that SCGN regulates nutrient-induced GIP secretion. <italic toggle="yes">Scgn</italic> deficiency leads to insufficient secretion of GIP and insulin, which disrupts the regulation of postprandial glucose levels. This disruption may subsequently elevate the risk of developing diabetes. By restoring intestinal SCGN expression and enhancing the secretion of incretin hormones, we anticipate the potential for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="bvaf022-s4"><title>Funding</title><p>The present study received support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82170852), the Scientific Research Fund Project of the Hunan Provincial Health Commission (B2019126), the Major Science and Technology Project of the Nanshan District Health System in Shenzhen City (NSZD2023044 and NSZD2024017), and the General Science and Technology Research project of Nanshan District Health System in Shenzhen City (NS2024018).</p></sec><sec id="bvaf022-s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>J.Y. and G.F. designed the experiments.
