Accurate diagnosis and timely management of AKI are essential for improving the outcomes of in-hospital AKI, and delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis hinders advancements in AKI care. To ameliorate this problem, several electronic AKI alert systems have been proposed but have shown inconsistent effects on AKI outcomes. Before electronic systems can improve AKI outcomes, it is important to confirm their diagnostic accuracy. The purposes of the present study were to establish an easy-to-construct computerized algorithm for the diagnosis of renal impairment and to test its accuracy. The present study retrospectively included 1551 patients hospitalized in Wanfang Hospital with serum creatinine (SCr) levels&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.3&#x000a0;mg/dL. A computerized algorithm was constructed to identify AKI events and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in these patients. Previous SCr tests were reviewed to define baseline SCr levels. A SCr level increased&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.5 times from baseline was defined as AKI. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;days was defined as CKD. Discharge diagnoses made by the attending physicians were defined as &#x0201c;clinician&#x02019;s diagnoses.&#x0201d; The researcher&#x02019;s diagnoses, made by experienced nephrologists according to the same criteria, were the gold standard to which the computerized algorithms and the clinician&#x02019;s diagnoses were compared. The diagnoses made by the computerized algorithm and clinician were compared with the researcher&#x02019;s diagnoses to define their accuracy. Among the included patients, the mean age was 73.0&#x000a0;years; in-hospital mortality was 14.8%, and AKI was present in 28.6% of patients. Regarding the diagnostic accuracy for AKI, the computerized algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 98.8%. The main cause of false-negative (FN) AKI diagnosis was AKI occurring prior to the outpatient visit, before the indexed hospitalization. Regarding the diagnostic accuracy for CKD, the computerized algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 100%. The main cause of FN CKD diagnosis was the lack of previous eGFR records. The computerized algorithm exhibited significantly superior accuracy compared to the clinician&#x02019;s diagnoses for both AKI (95.0% vs. 57.0%) and CKD (96.5% vs. 73.6%). We developed a simple and easy-to-construct computerized algorithm for the diagnosis of renal impairment that demonstrated significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for AKI and CKD compared to that of clinicians. In the future, an algorithmic approach for the differential diagnosis of AKI and a decision guide should be incorporated into this system.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute kidney injury (AKI)</kwd><kwd>Chronic kidney disease (CKD)</kwd><kwd>Intensive care unit (ICU)</kwd><kwd>Hospitalization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Medical research</kwd><kwd>Nephrology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University</institution></funding-source><award-id>111-wf-f-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Chung-Te</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100020595</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSTC 113-2314-B-038-132</award-id><award-id>NSTC 112-2314-B-002-312-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Chung-Te</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsieh</surname><given-names>Hui-Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par13">Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications among hospitalized patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, is associated with high in-hospital mortality and long hospital stays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. If not treated appropriately, AKI may become irreversible and progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In official reports, the annual cost associated with AKI was as high as &#x000a3;1 billion in the United Kingdom and $5.4&#x02013;$24.0 billion in the United States, causing a heavy burden on the healthcare system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Early and accurate diagnosis is one of the most accepted strategies for attenuating the medical burden associated with AKI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">Although the criteria for AKI are clearly defined by clinical guidelines, it is often overlooked by clinicians, which increases medical costs and mortality among hospitalized patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. One solution to improve the diagnosis of AKI is to use an electronic AKI alert system. In a previous study conducted in intensive care units (ICUs), an electronic AKI alert system significantly improved renal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In another multicenter study of hospitalized patients, a computerized clinical-decision support system resulted in small decreases in hospital mortality, dialysis use, and length of hospital stay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The results of these studies suggest that computerized or electronic AKI alert systems may be a solution for improving in-hospital AKI outcomes. However, this approach has certain drawbacks. In an observational cohort study with segmented regression analysis conducted in the United Kingdom, implementation of an electronic AKI alert system and AKI-related staff education did not reduce the severity or mortality associated with AKI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In a previous study conducted in Korea, although the implementation of electronic AKI alerts with automated nephrologist consultations improved the likelihood of AKI recovery, the mortality of patients with AKI was not affected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In another multicenter trial involving electronic AKI alert systems, AKI care bundles, and educational programs, the incidence of AKI paradoxically increased, and 30-day AKI mortality was not reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To date, whether electronic AKI alert systems with automated nephrologist consultation or AKI care bundles improve the outcome of AKI remains unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">While the early recognition of AKI is beneficial, the electronic AKI alert system has not been shown to improve AKI outcomes. One reason for this disappointing result is that electronic AKI alert systems do not change the clinical management of AKI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Frequent automatic alerts are likely to cause alert fatigue, which means clinicians become desensitized to the alerts and fail to response effectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, the uncertain accuracy of the electronic AKI alert system hinders its application in clinical practice. In our experience, electronic AKI alert systems often provide excessive alerts containing CKD or ESRD results that do not require immediate evaluation. To avoid this, an electronic AKI alert system must provide accurate and streamlined alerts. The accuracy of electronic AKI alert systems, however, has not been validated in previous studies, rendering it infeasible to evaluate their real effect on the outcomes of patients with AKI.</p><p id="Par16">To compensate for this gap, the present study aimed to develop and test the accuracy of a computerized algorithm for the assessment of renal impairment that is capable of accurately classifying renal impairment data into the diagnosis of AKI or CKD, providing correct AKI alerts, and avoiding overabundant messages to clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par17">The study was conducted at Wanfang Hospital, Taipei Medical University. Medical records of patients hospitalized between March 2020 to December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients older than 20&#x000a0;years with at least one record of a serum creatinine (SCr) level&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.3&#x000a0;mg/dL were included in the analysis. The &#x0201c;clinicians&#x02019; diagnoses&#x0201d; of AKI or CKD were made independently by the attending physician or surgeon and documented in discharge summaries. Remarkably, the clinicians&#x02019; diagnoses were made without further validation, further demonstrating the need to verify the accuracy of such diagnoses. The series of SCr data from more than 90&#x000a0;days before admission to the end of hospitalization was interpreted using the computerized algorithm established in this study to automatically generate the diagnoses. The &#x0201c;researcher&#x02019;s diagnosis,&#x0201d; made by two experienced nephrologists based on a review of the same series of laboratory data, was the gold standard to which the computerized algorithm and clinician&#x02019;s diagnoses were compared to define their accuracy. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of Taipei Medical University (N202111017). All the participants provided informed consent.

Otherwise, AKI was not observed. 3. For those without any previous SCr tests, the patient was assumed to have a normal baseline SCr level, and AKI was defined as present.

Of all the included patients, the mean age was 73.0 (SD 14.9) years, 63.1% were male, in-hospital mortality was 14.8%, and AKI was present in 28.6%. Regarding the admission departments, 70.9% were admitted to medical services, and 29.1% were admitted to nonmedical services. Regarding the source of patients, 56.6% were admitted from the emergency department (ED), and 43.4% were admitted from the outpatient department (OPD). Compared to patients admitted from the OPD, those admitted from the ED were significantly older and had significantly higher mortality and more AKI events. Additionally, patients admitted to the ED had significantly more cases of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, dementia, and acute stroke. In contrast, patients admitted from the OPD had significantly more cases of dyslipidemia and solid cancer.

These results indicate that the computerized algorithm outperformed clinicians in various hospital settings (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>The comparison of diagnostic accuracy between the Computerized Algorithm and the clinicians for renal impairment.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Characteristics</th><th align="left">Computerized algorithm accuracy</th><th align="left">Clinician&#x02019;s accuracy</th><th align="left"><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3">AKI</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">Total patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1551)</td><td align="left">1474 (95.0%)</td><td align="left">884(57.0%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Medical patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1100)</td><td align="left">1040 (94.6%)</td><td align="left">589 (53.6%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Non-medical patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;451)</td><td align="left">434 (96.2%)</td><td align="left">295 (65.4%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3">CKD</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">Total patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1551)</td><td align="left">1496 (96.5%)</td><td align="left">1141 (73.6%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Medical patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1100)</td><td align="left">1070 (97.3%)</td><td align="left">836 (76.0%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Non-medical patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;451)</td><td align="left">426 (94.5%)</td><td align="left">305 (67.6%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using chi square method.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>The diagnostic accuracy of the Computerized Algorithm and the clinicians for renal impairment in patients from ED and OPD.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Characteristics</th><th align="left">Computerized Algorithm accuracy</th><th align="left">Clinician&#x02019;s accuracy</th><th align="left"><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="4">AKI</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1551)</td><td align="left">1474 (95.0%)</td><td align="left">884(57.0%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ED (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;878)</td><td align="left">821(93.5%)</td><td align="left">434(49.4%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">OPD (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;673)</td><td align="left">653(97.0%)</td><td align="left">450(66.9%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4">CKD</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1551)</td><td align="left">1496 (96.5%)</td><td align="left">1141 (73.6%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ED (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;878)</td><td align="left">848(96.7%)</td><td align="left">673(76.7%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">OPD (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;673)</td><td align="left">647(96.1%)</td><td align="left">468(69.5%)</td><td align="left">&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>ED, emergency department; OPD, outpatient department; AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using chi square method.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par30">The computerized algorithm used in the present study identified AKI events in hospitalized patients with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 98.8% and identified CKD in hospitalized patients with a sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 100.0%. The main causes of FN AKI cases were AKI occurring before the time of the indexed hospitalization and frequent SCr tests obscuring the increase in the highest SCr from its baseline. FN CKD was exclusively caused by the absence of past medical records. Despite these weaknesses, the computerized algorithm showed significant superiority over attending clinicians in terms of diagnostic accuracy for both AKI and CKD.</p><p id="Par31">A major finding of the present study was that that both AKI events and CKD were underdiagnosed by the attending physicians and surgeons, which may have postponed appropriate management and referrals. Because we did not interview the clinicians individually, the reasons for this could not be explicitly explained. A possible explanation may be that, in cases in which a patient was not admitted because of AKI or was not managed by a nephrologist, minor or moderate increases in SCr that just fulfilled the AKI criteria may have been overlooked by the attending clinicians. Although an electronic AKI alert system is expected to improve the outcomes of patients with AKI, previous studies have reported inconsistent results. In the author&#x02019;s opinion, two important tasks must be performed before an electronic AKI alert system can improve AKI outcomes. The first is the standardization of the methodology of electronic AKI alert systems to ensure that the alert is accurate and appropriate. The second is an algorithmic approach for the differential diagnosis of each specific case of AKI, which may provide personalized treatment instead of a unified AKI care bundle.</p><p id="Par32">At a United Kingdom AKI consensus conference, experts recommended that, for the development of electronic AKI alert systems, a guide should be provided on how current diagnostic criteria should be applied and how baseline SCr levels should be selected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Although many studies have investigated how electronic AKI alert systems change AKI outcomes, their diagnostic accuracy has seldom been reported. In a large-scale study involving 53,816 ED visits, Jonsson et al. tested the diagnostic accuracy of computerized algorithms applied to the original KDIGO AKI criteria and several modified criteria. The original KDIGO AKI criteria exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 94%, respectively. However, the modified criteria that use the mean SCr of the last 30&#x000a0;days or 3&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months may increase the sensitivity and specificity to 92&#x02013;93% and 95&#x02013;96%, respectively, which shows that the selection of baseline SCr levels is crucial for the diagnostic accuracy of electronic AKI alert systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the present study, we aimed to standardize the methodology of electronic AKI alert systems so that they are applicable to smaller hospitals, which may encounter more cases without past SCr records. Regarding the diagnostic accuracy for AKI, the computerized algorithm used in the present study achieved a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 98.0%. In contrast to the study by Jonsson et al. referred to above, we did not use the mean SCr of the past period, but the last SCr value as the baseline SCr level. As the mean SCr may be confounded by episodes of fully recovered AKI, the last SCr record is a more reasonable baseline. Notably, we also attempted to use the first abnormal SCr level for the computerized algorithm to define the occurrence of AKI in this study, but it resulted in lower sensitivity. This was because the first abnormal SCr level may not have been as high as 1.5 times of its prior reading, and the AKI event of the higher SCr test that occurred later was neglected. Thus, in the present study, the highest SCr level during hospitalization was used by the computerized algorithm to define AKI. Nonetheless, in the context of real-time renal monitoring, AKI events are eventually detected as SCr increases to&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.5 times its previous value.</p><p id="Par33">In addition to diagnosing AKI events, the computerized algorithm was used to identify CKD cases. Unlike the management strategies for AKI, CKD requires early diagnosis and appropriate referral to specialists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Several electronic tools with various diagnostic algorithms have been developed for the early diagnosis of CKD. Approaches to diagnostic algorithms include identifying diagnostic codes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and checking eGFR laboratory criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> with or without consideration of proteinuria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The sensitivities and specificities of these algorithms range from 87 to 100% and 96&#x02013;99%, respectively, demonstrating the high accuracy of CKD diagnostic algorithms on average<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In the present study, although the computerized algorithm used only eGFR laboratory criteria, it achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 94.7% and 100.0%, respectively. Notably, all FN CKD cases were missed due to the absence of past laboratory data. The results show that the accuracy of the computerized algorithm for CKD in the present study is acceptable.</p><p id="Par34">While the underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of AKI by clinicians is an issue that needs to be emphasized, the present study objectively shows its significance. A major cause of this situation may be that minor fluctuations in SCr level are considered prerenal AKI, which is a sign of a changed volume status and is less likely to adversely affect outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, the diagnosis of AKI may be neglected. Nonetheless, such minor and evanescent increases in SCr may progress to intrinsic structural AKI and cause adverse outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. To address this, computerized algorithms may alert clinicians to pay attention to minor but important changes in SCr levels and initiate appropriate management. A major cause of the underdiagnosis of CKD may be that the current definition of CKD is controversially considered to cause overdiagnosis in some cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. For example, elderly female patients with an eGFR of 50&#x02013;59&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> without proteinuria are considered to have CKD stage 3a according to the current definition. For many nephrologists, such low eGFR values are considered a normal age-related decline rather than true CKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This may contribute to the reason patients with CKD are underdiagnosed by clinicians.</p><p id="Par35">Different applications of the KDIGO criteria can yield varying AKI incidences. A 2020 post hoc analysis tested 30 methods using SCr, urine output, and their combination and found an AKI incidence ranging from 28 to 75%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this study, the lowest incidence occurred when urine output was not considered, suggesting that the present study, which was based only on SCr, may underestimate the incidence of AKI. However, measuring urine output requires at least 6&#x000a0;h, which limits the point-of-care decisions required in the present study.</p><p id="Par36">Although AKI alert systems have been tested in many studies, most have reported higher AKI documentation rates, while their accuracy has rarely been mentioned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In a randomized controlled trial testing the value of an electronic AKI alert system, the sensitivity and specificity were reported to be as high as 99.8% and 97.7%, respectively, which are higher than those in the present study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> This supports the finding that our computerized algorithm has better diagnostic accuracy than clinicians.</p><p id="Par37">In the near future, we intend to implement the program as a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for our existing health record viewers. This will enable clinicians to receive real-time alerts for potential AKI and CKD and may improve the early diagnosis of renal impairment. The goal is to provide a tool for more accurate and timely identification of renal impairment, which can lead to improved patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par38">The limitations of the present study include its retrospective design; its accuracy remains to be validated in another prospective study; a relatively small number of cases in which its application needs to be further tested; and a lack of interventions that may truly improve patient outcomes. To compensate for these limitations, we will soon incorporate an algorithmic approach for differential diagnosis and a decision guide into the computerized algorithm and investigate how this changes the outcomes of AKI in a trial. Additionally, the present single-center approach limits the extension of our findings to other centers. Another limitation is that patients with ESRD could not be automatically excluded using the computerized algorithm. Therefore, fluctuating SCr levels due to hemodialysis treatment may be falsely interpreted as AKI events, and higher SCr levels may be observed in the non-AKI group. This limitation may be compensated by avoid SCr test on after dialysis sessions. For patients without previous SCr test results, the baseline SCr level was assumed to be normal to avoid missing treatable AKI events. Although stationary renal function in some patients with CKD may be falsely classified as an AKI event, this approach is relatively conservative.</p><p id="Par39">In conclusion, we developed a simple and easy-to-construct computerized algorithm for diagnosis of renal impairment. The computerized algorithm improved the diagnostic accuracy for AKI and CKD, which may lead to the earlier diagnosis and appropriate management of renal impairment. In the future, an algorithmic approach for the differential diagnosis of AKI and a decision guide may be incorporated into this system to achieve higher decision aid capability.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AKI</term><def><p id="Par2">Acute kidney injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CKD</term><def><p id="Par3">Chronic kidney disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p id="Par4">Emergency department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eGFR</term><def><p id="Par5">Estimated glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESRD</term><def><p id="Par6">End-stage renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FN</term><def><p id="Par7">False negative</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FP</term><def><p id="Par8">False positive</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p id="Par9">Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCr</term><def><p id="Par10">Serum creatinine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TN</term><def><p id="Par11">True negative</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TP</term><def><p id="Par12">True positive</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>These authors contributed equally: Chung-Te Liu and Hui-Ling Hsieh.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported, in part, by the research grants from the Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University (111-wf-f-1, 111-wf-f-2, 112-wf-swf-03), National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (NSTC 112-2314-B-002-312-MY3, NSTC&#x000a0;113-2314-B-038-132).
