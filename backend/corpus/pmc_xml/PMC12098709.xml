To investigate the regulatory state of a kinase, numerous methods have been developed to infer kinase activities from phosphoproteomics data using kinase-substrate libraries. However, few phosphorylation sites can be attributed to an upstream kinase in these libraries, limiting the scope of kinase activity inference. Moreover, inferred activities vary across methods, necessitating evaluation for accurate interpretation. Here, we present benchmarKIN, an R package enabling comprehensive evaluation of kinase activity inference methods. Alongside classical perturbation experiments, benchmarKIN introduces a tumor-based benchmarking approach utilizing multi-omics data to identify highly active or inactive kinases. We used benchmarKIN to evaluate kinase-substrate libraries, inference algorithms and the potential of adding predicted kinase-substrate interactions to overcome the coverage limitations. Our evaluation shows most computational methods perform similarly, but the choice of library impacts the inferred activities with a combination of manually curated libraries demonstrating superior performance in recapitulating kinase activities. Additionally, in the tumor-based evaluation, adding predicted targets from NetworKIN further boosts the performance. We then demonstrate how kinase activity inference aids characterize kinase inhibitor responses in cell lines. Overall, benchmarKIN helps researchers to select reliable methods for identifying deregulated kinases.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Kinases regulate cellular processes, making their study essential for understanding cellular function and disease.

It is controlled by kinases, which, together with their substrates and phosphatases, form a large network that controls diverse biological processes ranging from cell cycle progression, cell growth and differentiation to apoptosis. There are roughly 540 kinases encoded in the human genome that phosphorylate 20,000 proteins at more than 350,000 phosphorylation sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. By catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group to threonine, serine, tyrosine or histidine residues, they affect the substrate protein&#x02019;s activity, stability, localization and/or interaction with other molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Aberrant kinase activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, obesity and diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, as well as various cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Protein kinases are also one of the most targeted protein families for inhibition by small molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Hence, investigating the regulatory state of a kinase has emerged as an important objective in many biomedical contexts, including identification of disease-specific drug targets, development of patient specific therapeutics and prediction of treatment outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Enabled by mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies, measuring global phosphorylation events has provided new opportunities for the systematic analysis of kinases and their activities. Large-scale identification and quantification of phosphorylation levels can be obtained by MS, which can provide measurements for up to 50,000 unique phospho-peptides that span over 75% of all cellular proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This snapshot of the phosphoproteome reflects the activity of kinases and phosphatases. For example, to better understand dysregulation of phosphorylation in cancer, phosphoproteomic profiling approaches have been routinely applied to tumor cohorts in Clinical Proteogenomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> studies. Additionally, phosphoproteomic profiling has recently been applied to better understand the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection on cellular signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Phosphoproteomics data can be used to infer the activity of a given kinase based on the phosphorylation profiles of the kinase&#x02019;s targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, referred to as &#x02018;kinase activity analysis&#x02019; or &#x02018;kinase state analysis&#x02019;. Several tools have been developed to carry out this inference utilizing computational algorithms with varying complexity. For example, PTM&#x02010;SEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, uses the single-sample gene set enrichment algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, whereas KSEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> calculates a z-score based on the aggregation of phosphorylation site levels for known targets relative to the background set of overall phosphorylation site levels. A common feature of all these methods is that prior knowledge of the target phosphorylation sites of the respective kinase is required. Typically, the kinase target site sets are extracted from manually curated databases of known targets such as PhosphoSitePlus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, SIGNOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, or Phospho.ELM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, only a small percentage of phosphorylation sites can be attributed to any kinase, and, of those that can be, many are often attributed to a small handful of well-studied kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This can affect kinase activity inference since activity cannot be inferred if too few substrates of a given kinase are measured, and inferences that are based on low numbers of substrates may not be as accurate as those made using a greater number of reliable substrates. Therefore, it is critical to determine if we can increase the number of assessable kinases and enhance performance by boosting the number of potential substrates that are considered. One way to accomplish this is by including sites identified as targets in large in vitro screening assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Alternatively, one could consider sites predicted as targets by computational tools, such as NetworKIN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Given that multiple different methods have been, and continue to be, developed to infer kinase activity and that the performance of these methods is dependent on the kinase targets sets that are chosen, it is critical to establish mechanisms to evaluate the kinase activity inference performance in order to determine the optimal approaches for estimating kinase activity from phosphoproteomics data. So far, smaller comparative analyses have been performed that relied on perturbation studies aimed at identifying perturbed kinases from phosphoproteomic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, using perturbation studies alone for evaluation has been limited to a subset of well-studied kinases, is only available in an in vitro setting, and may be affected by unknown off-target effects.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we present two complementary benchmarking strategies designed to evaluate various combinations of computational algorithms and kinase-substrate libraries for inferring kinase activities. For the kinase activity inference, we included a diverse set of kinase activity inference methods ranging from rank-based approaches to statistical enrichment tests, linear models, and descriptive statistics. However, we have not considered methods that focus on time-series data such as CLUE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> or multi-condition comparisons such as KinasePA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, require a specific input file like INKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> or were designed for single-sample analysis like KSTAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. For the first strategy, cell-based kinase perturbation-based evaluation, we expand the existing gold-standard benchmark set of perturbation experiments to encompass a broader set of kinases for evaluation. The second strategy utilizes a tumor-based benchmarking approach based on the multi-omics CPTAC datasets to ultimately determine the optimal methodology for inferring kinase activities in human tumors. We implement these benchmarking approaches in the R package benchmarKIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://benchmarkin.readthedocs.io/">https://benchmarkin.readthedocs.io/</ext-link>) to facilitate the evaluation of novel methodologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Building an evaluation framework for kinase activity inference</title><p id="Par8">Kinase activity inference methods typically aim to identify deregulated kinases in a given biological context.

We then implemented three metrics to assess the performance of a method: P<sub>Hit</sub>(k), scaled rank, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). P<sub>Hit</sub>(k) quantifies how often the perturbed kinase&#x02019;s activity ranks among the top <italic>k</italic> kinases in the respective experiment. Similarly, the scaled rank evaluates the perturbed kinase&#x02019;s rank and adjusts for the size of inferred activities by dividing the rank by the total number of kinases in that experiment. For these metrics, we first compute an average for a kinase across all experiments in which it is perturbed to ensure that kinases that are more frequently perturbed in multiple experiments aren&#x02019;t disproportionately affecting the overall results. Finally, we calculate AUROCs by ranking the kinases across all experiments based on their inferred activities. In this context, true positives (TPs) are the perturbed kinases, while true negatives (TNs) include all other kinases with inferred activity in a given experiment. To account for the class imbalance across TPs and TNs, we subsample the TNs 1000 times to the same number of TPs. In general, all metrics assume that the highest activity change will be observed by the direct target of a perturbation, without specifically accounting for off-target or downstream effects.</p><p id="Par10">For the evaluation, we assessed 19 different methods that rely on a set of kinase-substrate interactions ot predict kinase activity scores from phosphoproteomics data, namely fgsea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (fast gene set enrichment analysis), Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (Fisher), KARP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (Kinase activity ranking using phosphoproteomics data), KSEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis), the Kologomorov-Smirnov test (KS test), the linear model implemented in RoKAI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> (lm RoKAI), the Mann-Whitney-U test (MWU test), the mean, the median, a multivariate linear model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> (mlm), the normalized mean (norm mean), PCA (principal component analysis), PTM-SEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (PTM-Signature Enrichment Analysis), the sum, a univariate linear model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> (ulm), the upper quantile (UQ), VIPER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> (Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon analysis), the z-score as implemented by RoKAI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> (z-score) and the Chi-squared test (&#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> test) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

For the evaluation, we only considered perturbation experiments where at least five targets of the perturbed kinase were identified for this library, reducing the number of experiments considered to 135 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Additionally, similar to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, we also tested how the number of targets for each kinase might affect the performance by using the measured number of targets in an experiment as the kinase activity. For the scaled rank and the AUROC metric, the z-score method demonstrated the best overall performance with an average scaled rank of 0.24, and an average AUROC of 0.79. For P<sub>Hit</sub>(k) the z-score method had the highest performance across methods for k&#x02009;=&#x02009;20 and the third highest average percentage across methods with P<sub>Hit</sub>(k) values of 0.89, 0.43, and 0.27 for k&#x02009;=&#x02009;20, 10, and 5, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d&#x02013;f</xref>). For the Hijazi dataset, we focused on the manually curated list of perturbation targets for the evaluation, as it led to a 0.1 increase in the average AUROC (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). All methods, except for KARP and the number of targets, achieved an average P<sub>Hit</sub>(k) of at least 0.43, an average scaled rank of at least 0.35, and an average AUROC of at least 0.68. We then compared the scaled rank of different methods when applied to tyrosine kinases (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) and serine/threonine kinases (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31) separately. Overall, the performance was higher for serine/threonine kinases, with an average scaled rank of 0.29 compared to 0.41 across methods (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). For both kinase classes, the z-score, KSEA, ulm and PTM-SEA were among the top 5 performing methods based on the average scaled rank, and we observed a strong Pearson correlation of 0.82 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.26 &#x000d7; 10&#x0207b;&#x02075;) between the two kinase groups across methods, indicating that the relative performance of methods was largely consistent for the two kinase classes. For the overall top-performing method, namely the z-score, we also investigated whether certain kinases consistently ranked high even when not perturbed in an experiment, potentially biasing the scaled rank performance (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). The average scaled rank of the evaluation kinases whenever not perturbed in an experiment was 0.53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08.

Specifically, this strategy utilizes CPTAC proteomics and phosphoproteomics data to identify tumors with high kinase levels for the positive set and tumors with low kinase levels for the negative set.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Development of a human tumor-based benchmarking approach using multi-omics data from CPTAC.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Summary of CPTAC datasets used in the current study.

Since overall phosphosite levels are commonly dependent on the levels of the corresponding host proteins, we first tested the correlation between phosphorylation sites and their host protein level in the CPTAC data. Phosphorylation sites showed similar distributions for correlation with their corresponding host proteins, with medians ranging from 0.36 to 0.47, for most cancer types (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). However, colon (COAD), ovarian (OV), and pancreatic (PDAC) cancer, with median correlations of 0.32, 0.26, and 0.31, respectively, had distributions that were markedly lower. Since we also previously observed that common targets of the same kinases were less well correlated with each other in these three cancer types than in the others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, we excluded them from subsequent analyses. Therefore, this benchmarking approach focuses on breast cancer (BRCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, glioblastoma (GBM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">To use this resource to benchmark kinase activity inference in tumors, we started with the hypothesis that tumors with the highest kinase protein levels would have the highest kinase activities whereas tumors with the lowest levels would have the lowest activities. Accordingly, we defined a gold standard set of kinase-patient pairs to benchmark different methods of kinase activity inference (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, methods section <italic>&#x0201c;Development of a tumor-based benchmark&#x0201d;</italic>). Briefly, for each kinase in each cancer type we included the patients with the highest protein levels in each tumor (top 5%) in the gold standard positive set and the patients having tumors with the lowest protein levels (bottom 5%) in the negative set (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, top). This resulted in a total of 12,850 kinase-patient pairs in the gold standard set, covering 388 unique kinases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Next, we applied ROC analysis to determine how well each method distinguishes between kinase-tumor pairs in the positive and negative sets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). To mitigate cancer type differences while maintaining the power gained from including all seven cancer types, the gold standard kinase-patient pairs were selected for each kinase in each cancer type separately, and the inferred kinase activity scores were converted to z-scores within each cancer type. To mitigate against data leakage, auto-phosphorylation sites were removed from the target sets used to calculate activity scores. The ROC analysis was then performed on the combined set of kinases and cancer types. To also assess the stability of the results from the ROC analyses, we subsampled 80% of the gold standard set 1,000 times. With AUROC values of ~0.66&#x02013;0.67, seven methods, including KSEA and PTM-SEA, performed similarly to, but slightly lower than, the best performing method, the z-score (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). With AUROC values of ~0.64&#x02013;0.66, eight of the remaining methods were only marginally worse than the eight best performing methods, whereas the performances for KARP and the &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> test were significantly lower than any of the other methods and barely better than the number of target control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Similar trends were observed when using different thresholds (top/bottom 2.5% and 10%) to select positive and negative pairs for the gold standard sets which we also included in the benchmarKIN package (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b, c</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">One caveat of this approach is that it relies on the assumption that high kinase protein levels result in high kinase activity. While we intentionally selected tumors from the tails with the highest and lowest levels to maximize the possibility that the positive set includes the most active kinases, and the negative set includes the least active kinases, we also recognize that the activities of some kinases are themselves regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs). Therefore, we also include an alternative tumor-based gold standard that is based on PTMs that are known to regulate kinase activity. Using PhosphositePlus annotations in combination with manual review of the literature, we identified 787 phosphorylation sites on 280 kinases that are associated with activation of their host kinases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d</xref>). Using the levels of these activating sites instead of kinase protein levels, we defined this alternative site-based gold standard using the same approach described above (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, bottom). Here, we defined a total of 3,446 kinase-patient pairs, covering 96 unique kinases as the gold standard set (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). When using activating sites to select positive and negative pairs for the gold standard sets, the results showed a similar trend as the results for the protein-derived gold standard with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.54&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x0207b;<sup>12</sup>). Overall the AUROCs were slightly higher for the activating site derived standard, possibly because activating sites are more directly associated with activity than the protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3e, f</xref>). Notably, both benchmarking approaches were also consistent with the established perturbation-based approach with a Pearson correlation of 0.84 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.63&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x0207b;<sup>6</sup>) and 0.79 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.33&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x0207b;<sup>5</sup>) for the protein-based and activating site-based approach, respectively, while incorporating more kinases in the evaluation set. For all three evaluation approaches, simpler methods such as the mean or z-score performed similarly to more complex methods such as PTM-SEA.</p><p id="Par17">The fact that multiple data types are available for the same set of samples used to develop this benchmark allows us to investigate possibilities for applying multi-omics data integration to kinase activity inference. To provide an example of this, we investigated whether normalizing phosphorylation site levels to host protein levels prior to calculating kinase activity improves performance. Since phosphorylation sites are often well correlated with and reflective of host protein levels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>), one potential concern is that phosphorylation site differences driven by changes in host protein levels may mask differences due to changes in the activity of upstream kinases. Here, we focused on two types of normalization strategies: linear regression to account for host protein levels and subtraction of host protein log intensities from site log intensities (subtract). For linear regression, we used three approaches: a single global linear model for all sites vs. corresponding host proteins (global), separate linear models for all sites on each protein separately (protein), and separate models for each individual site (site). Unnormalized data provided the best input for maximal performance for all kinase activity inference methods when using the protein-based gold standard and most methods when using the activation site-based benchmark (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). Data that was normalized with the global linear regression approach resulted in modest reductions in performance in the protein-based benchmark, but was equivalent to, or, in some cases, slightly better than unnormalized data in the activation site-based benchmark. For z-scores evaluated using the protein-based benchmark, the mean AUROC was 0.662 for the unnormalized data and 0.645 for the global linear regression normalized data (similar trends were observed for other methods). However, all other normalization strategies resulted in AUROCs lower than 0.62, suggesting that the adjustments imposed by these normalization approaches may be overcorrections that remove meaningful information in addition to potential confounding effects from the host protein levels. For the activating site benchmark, the trends were similar, but overall performance was slightly higher (~0.71&#x02013;0.72 for unnormalized data and data normalized using the global linear model), and the impact of other normalization methods on performance was not as severe. In support of the possibility that the protein data already contains some relevant signal that may be removed by normalization, we found that host proteins of common targets of the same kinases showed significantly higher correlation than host proteins for targets of different kinases in the CPTAC data (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Evaluating the impact of kinase-substrate libraries on inference methods</title><p id="Par18">In addition to PhosphoSitePlus, several other kinase-substrate libraries can be used for kinase activity inference.

In terms of kinase-substrate interactions, iKiP-DB and NetworKIN had among the highest number of interactions (iKiP-DB: 26,786, NetworKIN: 22,788), which is expected since interactions from these resources are not limited to those that are experimentally validated in cellular systems (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Additionally, we examined overlaps and biases across the libraries. Curated databases reported similar substrates for each kinase, while OmniPath, NetworKIN, and iKiP-DB had a large number of unique substrates, which is likely to impact the accuracy of kinase activity predictions (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

We then compared the performance of the combinations across the three benchmarking approaches and observed high agreement with a Pearson correlation of at least 0.93 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009; 10&#x0207b;<sup>16</sup>). For all of the approaches, the best performing method across priors was the z-score with an AUROC of 0.76, 0.70 and 0.65 for the perturbation-based, activating site-based and protein-based benchmarks, respectively (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). When comparing the performance of the kinase-substrate libraries across methods, the curated combination library had the highest AUROC of 0.73 for the perturbation-based benchmark, while NetworKIN and GPS gold had the highest AUROCs of 0.68 and 0.66, for the activating site-based and protein-based benchmark, respectively (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Next, we examined the performance for the different libraries more closely for the z-score and assessed the number of unique kinases included in the gold standard sets for each benchmark (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). When comparing the performance of the libraries across benchmarks the curated combination performed the best with an average AUROC of 0.73. For the evaluation of this library 37, 45, and 77 unique kinases were considered in the perturbation-based, activating site-based and protein-based benchmark, respectively. In comparison, OmniPath and iKiP-DB had lower average AUROC scores of 0.71 and 0.59, respectively, but also included a larger number of unique kinases in each evaluation: 46 (OmniPath) and 42 (iKiP-DB) in the perturbation-based benchmark, 61 (OmniPath) and 54 (iKiP-DB) in the activating site-based benchmark, and 120 (OmniPath) and 158 (iKiP-DB) in the protein-based benchmark (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Since the kinases included in each evaluation set can impact performance, we also assessed each library&#x02019;s performance on a common subset of kinases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). This subset only consists of 19 unique kinases for the perturbation-based, 17 unique kinases for the activating site-based benchmark and 31 kinases for the tumor-based benchmark. For these reduced gold standard sets, NetworKIN and OmniPath with mean AUROCs of 0.77 and 0.76, respectively, performed even better than the curated combination with an AUROC of 0.75.</p><p id="Par22">We then evaluated the performance for each library for kinases classified as rich, medium, and poor kinases based on their number of targets identified in the curated combination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). For the perturbation-based benchmark, we hereby chose the scaled rank as the evaluation metric due to the reduced number of true positives for each group. In both the perturbation-based and activating site-based benchmarks, kinases classified as medium demonstrated the highest performance across libraries (mean scaled rank = 0.22; mean AUROC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74), while rich kinases showed the best performance in the protein-based benchmark (mean AUROC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82). Additionally, we observed a performance drop for NetworKIN and iKiP-DB in the perturbation-based benchmark when evaluating poor kinases, which we consider to be less well studied. The performance also improved for NetworKIN and iKiP-DB in the activating site- and protein-based benchmark for rich kinases, which represent more well-studied kinases. Similarly, we assessed the performance of each kinase-substrate library separately for serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Given that phosphotyrosine enrichment was not performed in the CPTAC dataset, we focused on the perturbation-based benchmark and compared the average scaled rank across kinase classes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). As previously observed for the inference methods, the kinase-substrate libraries exhibited a better performance for the serine/threonine kinases with an average scaled rank of 0.28 compared to 0.40 for the tyrosine classes. We also observed a Pearson correlation of 0.73 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039) between the two kinase classes across libraries, suggesting that the relative ranking of libraries remained largely consistent between kinase classes.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, manually curated databases, especially the combination of GPS gold, PTMsigDB and PhosphoSitePlus demonstrated superior performances when assessed across the three benchmarking approaches. Additionally, when stratifying kinases by the number of targets, overall performance was higher for kinases with more targets, particularly in libraries like NetworKIN and iKiP-DB. This trend was especially pronounced in the tumor-based benchmarking approaches, where the gold standard kinase set is derived from global kinase profiling data rather than being limited to well-studied kinases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Combining kinase-substrate libraries to boost kinase activity inference</title><p id="Par24">One way to potentially improve accuracy and boost the number of sites that are considered for the activity inference of a given kinase is to combine different libraries or add predicted or in vitro identified substrates from databases such as NetworKIN or iKiP-DB, respectively. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of each kinase activity inference method in all benchmarks when using just the curated target combination to the performance obtained when complementing this set with targets from OmniPath, the NetworKIN database or iKiP-DB.</p><p id="Par25">Overall, the addition of targets from OmniPath, NetworKIN and iKiP-DB boosted the number of kinases for which an activity could be inferred in both the CPTAC and the perturbation datasets and increased the number of kinases considered for evaluation for all benchmarks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#x02013;c</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Furthermore, using the combined set of targets from the curated combination and NetworKIN as substrates resulted in either the same or an improved overall performance for both tumor-based benchmarking approaches over using just curated targets for all methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>). Once again, using the z-score resulted in the best performance (protein-based: AUROC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69, activating site-based: AUROC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.677), while the performance for PTM-SEA (protein-based: AUROC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.681, activating site-based: AUROC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.673) was only modestly lower. However, this improvement could not be observed for the perturbation-based benchmarking approach (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Additionally, adding iKiP-DB targets led to a decrease of performance in both benchmarking approaches (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, c). Hereby, it is important to keep in mind that the evaluated kinases do not necessarily overlap between the two benchmarking approaches.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Inferred kinase activity scores provide a better indication for response to kinase inhibitor treatment than protein levels.</title><p><bold>a&#x02013;c</bold> Kinase activity inference performance (AUROC) using the <bold>a</bold> perturbation-based, <bold>b</bold> activating site-based and <bold>c</bold> protein-based benchmark approach when considering the target set combining known targets from the curated combination (PhosphoSitePlus, PTMsigDB and GPS gold) with targets from OmniPath, NetworKIN or iKiP-DB.

For kinase inhibitors, thus, we strive to target tumors with elevated kinase levels/activity. To determine if inferred kinase activity scores would serve as more effective indicators for response to treatment with a given kinase inhibitor than kinase protein levels, we utilized a systematic resource for testing drug response in the NCI60 collection of cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Since proteomics and phosphoproteomics data is available for many of the cell lines tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, we correlated drug responses across these cell lines to protein levels of the corresponding kinase as well as to kinase activity scores. As an example, high CDK4 activity inferred using the z-score method from RoKAI and targets from the combination of the set of curated targets with those from NetworKIN was associated with better response (lower AUC) to Palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, whereas higher protein levels tended to be associated with worse response (high AUC) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). A systematic analysis of the association of drug response with target kinase measurements is shown in the dumbell plot in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>. Here, a lower AUC indicates better response; thus, the more negative the correlation, the better the association of a given kinase metric is with inhibitor response. The measurement best associated with response for the most inhibitor-kinase combinations tested (20/38) was the kinase activity score inferred using the combined set of curated plus NetworKIN predicted targets, while kinase protein levels showed the greatest number of worst (highest) correlations (22/38). On the other hand, while the correlations with response for activity scores calculated using just curated targets alone was often similar to those for scores calculated using targets from both the curated combination and NetworKIN, this metric was only the best associated with response for 6/29 drug-target combinations. Thus, high kinase activity scores inferred using the combination of curated targets and predicted sites from NetworKIN may be better indicators of the likelihood for tumors to respond to treatment to the corresponding kinase inhibitor than kinase protein levels or activity scores inferred using known targets alone.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Activating sites on kinases are better associated than protein levels with kinase activity when activating site-host protein correlation is low.</title><p><bold>a</bold> CDK4 activity scores are higher, whereas CDK4 protein levels are lower, in cell lines with better response to palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

However, the difference between mean Pearson r values was only 0.048, and the analysis presented in previous sections was based on the assumption that kinase activity was already largely dependent on kinase protein levels, which prompted a more nuanced investigation.

When sites and host proteins are well correlated, the difference in the correlation for the two to the activity score tends to be smaller, but activating sites tend to show better correlation than protein when the correlation between the site and host protein is poor.

One potential application of this analysis may be to determine which kinases could be assayed with a simple metric such as measurement of the kinase protein itself and which would require further investigation to identify suitable biomarkers. Therefore, we further analyzed the protein data for each of the kinases included in this analysis and identified kinases for which protein levels may serve as biomarkers of kinase activity because the kinase protein levels and activity scores are well correlated across multiple cancer types (top of heatmap in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). To determine if phosphosite measurements could serve as alternative biomarkers for kinases that aren&#x02019;t associated with activity (bottom of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>), we investigated correlation of the phosphosites that were identified in the CPTAC data from these kinases with the kinase activity scores. The heatmap in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref> shows a set of sites that have relatively high correlation with kinase activity despite having poor protein-activity correlation. This set includes nineteen sites on twelve unique kinases.

Thus, considering associations between activity scores and the multi-omics data associated with a given kinase on a kinase-by-kinase basis allows us to prioritize proteomic features to serve as potential biomarkers for kinase activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par33">The identification of deregulated kinases is a crucial component of biomedical research as they play central roles in signaling and serve as important drug targets. Therefore, computational tools have been developed to infer kinase activities from phosphoproteomics data. To interpret these findings accurately, it is important to critically evaluate the reliability and coverage of kinase-substrate libraries and prediction tools, as well as the impact of different computational algorithms.</p><p id="Par34">In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of methods and prior knowledge resources for kinase target sets that can be used for kinase activity inference and introduce an additional benchmarking strategy to identify the most reliable methods. Evaluation of all combinations of methods and prior target sets using the classical perturbation-based benchmarking approach identified that simpler computational methods like the z-score used by RoKAI or KSEA are comparable if not superior to more sophisticated methods like fgsea, or multivariate linear models. These findings also align with previously conducted benchmarks, which were performed on a subset of experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, manually curated target resources, especially a combination of PhosphoSitePlus, PTMsigDB and GPS gold, perform the best. Furthermore, we introduce a complementary benchmarking strategy based on multi-omics data from human tumors where again, simpler computational methods performed among the best. We next used both benchmarking approaches to test whether boosting curated targets with predicted targets from various resources could enhance kinase activity inference. Adding targets predicted by NetworKIN but not other prediction tools did improve performance noticeably in the tumor-based benchmark, but only modestly in the perturbation-based benchmark. Finally, we showcase the potential for kinase activity inference to inform precision oncology by identifying active kinases in a given sample.</p><p id="Par35">We employed two complementary approaches for the evaluation of kinase activity inference methods because both have distinct strengths and limitations. The perturbation-based approach is straightforward and focuses on assessing the direct effect of the perturbation on the kinase&#x02019;s activity. However, it is limited to usually well-studied kinases that have been experimentally perturbed and profiled by phosphoproteomics. Here, we also observed some bias for well-studied kinases, with the number of targets as a metric for kinase activity inference performing considerably well in the benchmark. Additionally, it could be confounded by downstream kinases or feedback regulations and usually does not account for off-target effects of drug perturbations. There have already been some efforts in identifying the target spectrum of kinase drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>; however, these are usually linked to binding assays and as such do not necessarily reflect a change in activity. Ideally, further perturbation studies with very specific drugs would be useful to minimize the limitations of this benchmark approach. Specificity is critical because a major assumption of the perturbation-based approach is that non-targeted kinases are less affected by the perturbation and treated as negatives, which could result in decreased performance if they are in fact also affected by the perturbation.</p><p id="Par36">Experimental perturbations require experimental systems that lack the complexity of the tumor microenvironment present in humans. In contrast, the tumor-based benchmark approach aims to better account for this complexity, but it is primarily based on the assumption that tumors with high kinase protein levels have high kinase activity whereas tumors with low kinase protein levels have low activity. This may not necessarily be the case as kinases are also subject to post-translational regulation and abundance thus may not necessarily translate into activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. While we offer an alternative version of this benchmark that relies on selecting kinase-tumor pairs for the gold standard using activating sites on kinases, this approach is also biased towards well-studied kinases and reduces the number of kinases that can be utilized for the benchmarking analysis. This version is not limited by the assumption that kinase activity is directly associated with protein levels, but the tradeoff is that fewer kinases can be assessed with it (i.e., 45 kinases were evaluated in the activating site-based benchmark for the combined curated library whereas 77 were evaluated in the protein-based benchmark; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Furthermore, while the tumor protein-based approach does bypass some of the bias towards considering mainly well-studied kinases, allowing for the inclusion of under-studied kinases in the evaluation, kinase activity inference still requires having a set of reliable target sites for a given kinase in order to obtain scores to evaluate in the first place.</p><p id="Par37">Both benchmarking strategies face limitations in assessing tyrosine kinases, primarily due to the scarcity of measured tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which typically requires specialized enrichment techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Even though we attempted to mitigate these limitations by incorporating perturbation datasets targeting tyrosine kinases, we encourage readers to contribute to the benchmark in the future to enhance its coverage and robustness. While the CPTAC datasets used to establish the tumor-based benchmarks lacked phosphotyrosine enrichment, phosphotyrosine enrichment and enrichment for other post-translational modifications has been utilized for studies in progress and should be more routine in the future. Thus, the potential exists to further refine the tumor-based benchmark to address this critical issue. Finally, while off-target effects of a perturbation are not an issue with this approach, it is still likely that, in a tumor with high kinase levels, downstream kinases will also be active. Because of the advantages and disadvantages of these complementary approaches, we recommend using both and determining the consensus between the two.</p><p id="Par38">Aside from evaluating kinase activity inference methods and kinase target sets themselves, the benchmarks described here can be used to evaluate other potential strategies for improving inference. For example, when proteomics data is available for the same samples that have been profiled with phosphoproteomics, as is the case for the CPTAC cohorts, a logical hypothesis would be that normalizing phosphosites to their host protein levels may reduce the possibility that substrate protein levels, which are often well correlated with phosphosite levels, confound kinase activity inference. However, all of the techniques we tested for normalizing sites to host protein levels resulted in decreased performance in both tumor-based benchmarks, suggesting that there may be signal present that is associated with kinase activity in the protein data already and that removing this signal impairs our ability to accurately infer that activity. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that the host proteins of common targets of the same kinase already show higher correlation than the targets of kinases from different groups, possibly because many kinases and their substrates may lie in common pathways. Alternatively, the noise present in both the phosphosite and protein data may be amplified by the normalization process; thus, normalization may actually be decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio. Both of these possibilities are supported by our observation that the reduction in performance is most severe when attempting to make this adjustment on a site by site basis (subtracting or using the per site linear model) but is minimal when the adjustment is made by considering the data as a whole (global linear model). The development of normalization strategies that mitigate these issues may allow us to better account for the effects of substrate protein levels when inferring kinase activity in the future.</p><p id="Par39">By assessing the impact of utilizing predicted targets for kinase activity inference on performance, benchmarking may also allow us to evaluate the biological relevance of those predictions. Despite good performance for the curated libraries, current kinase-substrate libraries are limited in their coverage of both kinases and phosphorylation sites. As a result, much of the information measured in phosphoproteomics cannot be used for the prediction of kinases activities and activity inference is restricted to a certain set of kinases, limiting the interpretation of the results. To bridge these gaps, a variety of substrate prediction tools have been introduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. However, besides NetworKIN, the tools tested here did not improve performance. This might be due to the fact that these tools solely focus on the amino acid sequence, neglecting context-dependency and the regulatory environment of kinases, introducing false target identification. Similarly, in vitro libraries such as iKiP-DB might identify phosphorylation targets which do not appear under physiological conditions, reducing the accuracy of kinase activity inference. As such, incorporating factors such as protein-protein interactions (PPI), subcellular localization, and the presence of inhibitors or activators could be crucial components to identify direct targets of kinases and ultimately improve predictions for kinase activities. Despite being the oldest of the prediction methods we tested, NetworKIN likely provided the best performance because the predictions are informed by PPI in addition to sequence homology to known targets. Unfortunately, NetworKIN is not actively maintained, and the substrate predictions used for our analysis were obtained by mapping the sites in our data to predicted sites from KinomeXplorer-DB downloaded from the website; predicted targets would have been overlooked if they could not be mapped properly. More modern kinase substrate prediction methods that use current protein sequence databases (or that are database agnostic) and incorporate biological context are likely to further improve performance, and our benchmarking tools should provide the means to evaluate how well they do so. Besides increasing the coverage of kinases and phosphorylation sites, newer methods also incorporate additional types of interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> or additional omics layers such as transcriptomics data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> to improve the prediction of kinase activity inference. However, the evaluation for the latter is still limited as perturbation-based benchmarks would require multi-omics datasets, and multi-omics evaluation strategies - such as the tumor-based approach presented here - might face difficulties in avoiding data leakage. We also chose to focus on inference from phosphoproteomics data in order to provide a benchmarking resource that is more broadly applicable at present. Currently, many studies feature phosphoproteomics data without possessing the additional layers of omics data needed for multi-omics driven inference. When multi-omics profiling becomes more accessible to the broader scientific community in the future, developing strategies to benchmark kinase inference from multi-omics data will become more critical.</p><p id="Par40">Kinase activity inference also has the potential to inform precision oncology. Tumors with high kinase activity scores may be candidates for therapy with the corresponding kinase inhibitors. Our cell line analyses indicated that the method and target site set that were among the best performing in the benchmarks also generated scores that were consistently best associated with inhibitor response. However, this analysis was performed using data from cell lines, and further studies will need to be carried out to confirm these trends in more complex biological systems. Furthermore, performing phosphoproteomic profiling of tumors to identify kinases to target is not practical in a clinical setting. A simpler and more quantitative assay using specific peptides that are representative of kinase activity would be more ideal. Our comparison of activating sites on kinases to kinase protein levels suggests that the best approach to select markers for kinase activity may be to consider each kinase on an individual basis; for some kinases, the protein levels may provide a sufficient readout for activity whereas activating sites or specific target sites that are well correlated with kinase activity may be better candidates for other kinases.</p><p id="Par41">In summary, we performed a comprehensive comparison and identified curated targets in combination with targets from NetworKIN and z-score implemented by RoKAI as the best performing approach for kinase activity inference. Furthermore, all benchmarking approaches and metrics are available in the R package benchmarKIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://benchmarkin.readthedocs.io/">https://benchmarkin.readthedocs.io/</ext-link>).

Based on the analysis of site-host protein correlations, we chose to focus on data from the breast cancer (BRCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, glioblastoma (GBM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> studies. Specifically, we used the proteomics and phosphoproteomics absolute abundance data from the harmonized dataset, in which peptides were assigned (for both proteomics and phosphoproteomics) and aggregated (for proteomics) to protein isoforms using Ensembl Id&#x02019;s in GENCODE V34 as described in Document S1 from Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For each cancer type, the protein data for each kinase was used to identify samples for the Gold Standard positive (GS+) (those in the top 5% relative to the normal distribution of the protein levels; z-score &#x0003e; 1.645) and negative (GS-) (bottom 5% relative to the normal distribution; z-score &#x0003c;1.645) sets after filtering out proteins with fewer than 30 measurements and with variance &#x0003c;0.1. Alternative GS sets were also established using the top 2.5% (|z| &#x0003e; 1.96), 10% (|z| &#x0003e; 1.282), and 15% (|z| &#x0003e; 1.036; not analyzed here, but presented as an option in the benchmarKIN package). To establish alternative GS sets using activating sites on kinases, the same thresholds were applied to kinases&#x02019; phosphosite levels for the sites defined in the &#x0201c;<italic>Analysis of activating sites on kinases</italic>&#x0201d; methods section instead of kinase protein levels. In both versions of the benchmark, samples with missing values for a given kinase were excluded from the analysis used for selecting kinase-tumor pairs for that kinase for the GS set.</p><p id="Par74">For benchmarking using these GS sets, we first median centered the log2 MS1 intensity data for each site within each cancer type to use as input for calculating kinase activity scores as described above (<italic>Computational methods for kinase activity inference</italic>). To ensure that there was no leakage from the data used to define the GS sets to the data used to calculate kinase activity scores, phosphorylation sites for the respective kinase were removed from each kinase target set from each prior knowledge kinase-substrate resource prior to kinase activity inference. Measurements for at least five target sites in the library for a given kinase in a given sample were required to calculate the kinase activity score; otherwise, the value for that sample-kinase pair was set to NA. Within a cohort, at least 30 kinase activity scores were required for the kinase to be included in the benchmarking evaluation. For evaluation, the activity scores for each kinase were first converted to z-scores across all samples within a cohort, and receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate how well the z-scores distinguished between kinase-tumor pairs in the GS+ and GS- sets for all kinases across all cancer types pooled together. To account for variability, ROC analyses were repeated 1000&#x000d7; after randomly subsampling 80% of the kinase-tumor pairs from each GS subset for which activity scores are available. Functions (R code) for using this benchmarking approach with any of the GS sets described here given kinase activity scores calculated from the same CPTAC datasets are available in the benchmarKIN R package.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Normalization of phosphosite levels to protein levels</title><p id="Par75">To normalize the phosphosite data to host protein levels, we first filtered the protein and phosphosite log2 MS1 intensity data to remove proteins and sites with fewer than 30 measurements. Sites lacking measurements for respective host proteins were then removed. We then employed multiple strategies to normalize the level of each site in each dataset to the corresponding values of the host protein. Thus, the unnormalized data used for this analysis is different from the data used for the corresponding analyses presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The first normalization strategy involved subtracting the log2 MS1 intensity of the protein in a given sample from the log10 MS1 intensity of the site. The remaining strategies relied on using the residuals from linear regression of the sites to their host proteins. We used three different types of models for the linear regression normalization: a single global linear model for all sites vs. corresponding host proteins (global), separate linear models for all sites on each protein separately (protein), and separate models for each individual site (site). Site median-centered data was used as input for kinase activity inference using PhosphoSitePlus targets as described above (<italic>Computational methods for kinase activity inference</italic>) and evaluation was carried out using the tumor-based benchmark.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Analysis of activating sites on kinases</title><p id="Par76">A list of manually curated activating sites from the literature was updated with sites annotated as promoting kinase activity in the regulatory sites file downloaded from PhosphoSitePlus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> in March 2022. For all activating sites with host proteins measured in the CPTAC data, Pearson correlation coefficients between the sites and corresponding host proteins were calculated for each cancer type. To determine if these correlations were lower than expected by chance, empirical p-values were calculated by randomly sampling an equal number of sites in each dataset and calculating the Pearson correlation between sites in these samples and the corresponding host proteins. The p-value is the fraction of these samples that had median correlation coefficients that were equal to or lower than the median for all of the activating sites in a given cancer type. Pearson correlations were also calculated between activity scores calculated using the RoKAI z-score with targets from the combination of PhosphoSitePlus and NetworKIN and kinase activating sites or kinase protein levels. To assess differences between the correlations of the activity scores with activating sites and their correlations with kinase protein levels, paired (by kinase) two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Correlation of kinase metrics to kinase inhibitor response in cell lines</title><p id="Par77">Proteomics and phosphoproteomics datasets for the NCI60 cells lines were obtained from Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, respectively, from Frejno, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Phosphosites were aggregated by the combination of HGNC symbols with the 11mer sequence flanking the site by keeping the rows with the least number of missing values for the same gene symbol-11mer combination. In cases where there was a tie between the number of non-missing measurements, the rows were averaged. The protein dataset was processed similarly except that the data was aggregated by the HGNC symbol alone. Sites and proteins with measurements in less than 20 cell lines were removed, and the phosphosite data was centered by the median value for each site. The site data was then used as input for kinase activity inference calculations as described above (<italic>Computational methods for kinase activity inference</italic>) using either the targets from PhosphoSitePlus alone or in combination with NetworKIN. Drug inhibitor response data from the GDSC was downloaded from the Sanger Institute website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/drug_data">https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/drug_data</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> and filtered to NCI60 cell lines and to inhibitors that target kinases. Spearman rank correlations between AUROC values for inhibitor response and either kinase activity scores or protein levels were calculated for kinases having both measurements that are established targets of a given inhibitor in at least 20 cell lines. For this analysis, we focused on inhibitors with a minimum AUROC difference of 0.3 between the least and most responsive cell lines in order to focus on those that are more likely to have variable effects in different cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par78">Further information on research design is available in the&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec47" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
