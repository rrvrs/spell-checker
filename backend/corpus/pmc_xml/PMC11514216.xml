Here, we report that PANoptosis, a coordinated PCD pathway, including pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis, is activated by DNA damage. The Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is the apical sensor of PANoptosis and essential for PANoptosome assembly in response to DNA damage. We find endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are activated by DNA damage and act as ligands for ZBP1 to trigger PANoptosis. By using ZBP1 knock-out and knock-in mice disrupting ZBP1 nucleic acid-binding activity, we demonstrate that ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis contributes to the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, which is dependent on ZBP1 nucleic acid-binding activity. We found that ZBP1 expression is downregulated in tumor tissue. Furthermore, in colorectal cancer patients, dsRNA is induced by chemotherapy and sensed by ZBP1 in normal colonic tissues, suggesting ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis is activated by chemotherapy in normal tissues. Our findings indicate that ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis is activated by DNA damage and contributes to the toxic side effects of DNA-damage-based chemotherapy. These data suggest that ZBP1 could be a promising therapeutic target to alleviate chemotherapy-related side effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Necroptosis</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No.32170748</award-id><award-id>No.32170748</award-id><award-id>No.32200453</award-id><award-id>No.82204481</award-id><award-id>No.32200453</award-id><award-id>No.82204481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jiangping</given-names></name><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Wenqing</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yaxing</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology,21490714300 and 1841072060</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology, No. 22ZR1448000</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Key Research and Development Program of Ningxia (No.2022BFH02012)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare ADMC 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Triggering DNA damage-induced cell death has been implicated as an important mechanism in cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, many aspects of DNA damage-induced cell death are not fully understood. For example, theoretically, the main role of DNA damage compounds in chemotherapy is to target rapidly dividing cancer cells to trigger cell death while minimizing damage to normal, healthy cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, normal cells can also be damaged by chemotherapy drugs, which could contribute to side effects of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The toxic side effects of chemotherapy on the human body are not only the major dose-limiting factors in clinical practice but also cause serious reduction in the quality of life. Therefore, the identification of key mechanisms that are involved in chemotherapy-induced damage in normal cells could provide an exciting opportunity to optimize chemotherapy treatment and improve cancer care.</p><p id="Par4">PANoptosis is a coordinated cell death pathway that integrates key components of pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is regulated by a single cell death-inducing complex named PANoptosome, which contains key molecules crucial for pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis and is able to activate all three to execute proinflammatory cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently, several types of PANoptosome complexes have been characterized, including ZBP1- (Z-DNA binding protein 1 or DAI, DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factors), AIM2- (absent in melanoma-2), RIPK1- (receptor-interacting protein kinase 1), and NLRP12 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 12)-PANoptosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In ZBP1-PANoptosome, ZBP1 acts as a PANoptosis senor to activate NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3 in response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this scenario, caspase-6 (Casp-6) was reported to facilitate the interaction between ZBP1 and RIPK3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis has been shown to play a critical role in infectious and inflammatory diseases such as viruses and fungi infections and septic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, whether ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis is involved in DNA damage-induced cell death is not investigated.</p><p id="Par5">ZBP1 is a cytosolic nucleic acid sensor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell death and inflammation, particularly in the context of viral infection and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. ZBP1 contains two Z&#x003b1; domains (Z&#x003b1;1 and Z&#x003b1;2) in its N-terminus and two RHIM (receptor-interacting protein [RIP] homotypic interaction motif) domains in the middle. ZBP1 uses its two Z&#x003b1; domains to bind with left-handed Z-DNA or RNA and then drives the RHIM-mediated interactions with receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) to trigger inflammatory cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In sterile conditions, ZBP1 has been shown to recognize ERV-derived dsRNA to induce necroptosis and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we find that ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis is activated by DNA-damaging compounds. Mechanistically, ERVs are reactivated by DNA damage and act as ligands of ZBP1 to trigger PANoptosis. We further show that ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis contributes to the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. These data suggest that ZBP1 could be a potential therapeutic target to alleviate chemotherapy-induced side effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par7">Etoposide (MCE, China, Cat#HY-13629), MNNG (MCE, China, Cat#HY-128612), CDDP (MCE, China, Cat#HY-17394), 5-FU (MCE, China, Cat#HY-90006), CBL0137 (MCE, China, Cat#HY-18935A) and PFN-&#x003b1; (MCE, China, Cat# HY-123076).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Antibodies</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>WB</title><p id="Par8">The following antibodies were from commercial sources: anti-Cleaved Caspase &#x02212;3 (CST, USA, Cat#9664, 1:1000); anti-Caspase-3 (ABclonal, China, Cat#A2156, 1:1000); anti-phospho-MLKL (Abcam, USA, Cat#ab196436, 1:1000); anti-MLKL (ABclonal, China, Cat#A5579, 1:1000); anti-FLAG-Tag (ABclonal, China, Cat#AE004, 1:1000); anti-ZBP1 (Adipogen, Switzerland, Cat#AG-20B-0010-C100, 1:1000); anti-GSDME-N-terminal (Abcam, USA, Cat#ab215191, 1:1000); anti-phospho-RIPK1 (CST, USA, Cat#31122, 1:1000); anti-RIPK1 (BD, USA, Cat# 610458, 1:1000); anti-phospho-RIPK3 (CST, USA, Cat#91702, 1:1000); anti-RIPK3 (CST, USA, Cat#95702, 1:1000); anti-Caspase-6 (CST, USA, Cat#9762, 1:1000); anti-Cleaved Caspase-6 (CST, USA, Cat#9761T, 1:1000); anti-&#x003b3;-H2AX (CST, USA, Cat#9718, 1:1000); anti-H2AX (ABclonal, China, Cat#A11463, 1:1000); anti-phospho-p53(CST, USA, Cat#9284, 1:1000); anti-p53 (Proteintech, China, Cat# No. 10442-1-AP, 1:1000) and GAPDH (HUABIO, China, Cat# ET1601-4, 1:100000).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>IF/IHC</title><p id="Par9">The following antibodies were from commercial sources: anti-dsRNA J2 (SCICONS, Hungary, Cat#10010200, 1:200); anti-Z-DNA/Z-RNA [Z22] (Absolute antibody, UK, Cat#T2028A11, 1:200); anti-DDDDK-Tag (ABclonal, China, Cat#AE004, 1:200); anti-ZBP1(Proteintech, China, Cat#No. 13285-1-AP, 1:100) and anti-CD45 (Invitrogen, USA, Cat# 11-0451-85, 1:100).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Plasmids and lentiviral particles</title><p id="Par10">The mammalian cell expression plasmids of Flag-tagged mouse ZBP1 and Flag-tagged mouse ZBP1-mutZ&#x003b1;1&#x003b1;2 (N46A/Y50A/N122A/Y126A) were purchased from Synbio Technologies (Suzhou, China).

Additionally, compared with the control cells, ETO-induced Casp-3 cleavage, MLKL phosphorylation and GSDME cleavage were all suppressed by Casp-6 knockout (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>), suggesting Casp-6 is required for DNA damage-induced PANoptosis.</p><p id="Par61">Given that ZBP1 regulated RIPK3 phosphorylation in DNA damage and Casp-6 is required for DNA damage-induced PANoptosis, we then tested whether ZBP1 could form a PANoptosome complex with RIPK3 and Casp-6 in response to DNA damage.

Our data indicate that ERVs are transcriptionally upregulated by DNA damage and act as ligands for ZBP1 to trigger PANoptosis. Under normal conditions, the expression of ERVs is switched off epigenetically. Multiple processes, such as epigenetic aberrations, inflammation as well as infections can lead to the activation of ERVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It has been shown that 5-FU could activate ERVs to elicit inflammatory responses in hematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, it has not yet been comprehensively demonstrated that ERVs can be transcriptionally upregulated by DNA damage. Our data indicate that DNA damage agents ETO and CDDP also activate ERVs. Therefore, one outstanding question is how ERVs are activated by DNA damage. It has been shown that 5-FU inhibited the expression of SETDB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], a known epigenetic regulator in ERV silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which may lead to the activation of ERVs. Whether DNA damage agents share a similar mechanism to activate ERVs remains to be determined. And it will also be interesting to investigate whether the ADAR1 RNA editing enzyme is able to prevent ZBP1 activation and PANoptosis by disrupting dsRNA formation in DNA damage.</p><p id="Par72">Our data reveal that ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis contributes to chemotherapy-induced toxicity and inflammation in mice. DNA damage agents, such as ETO, CDDP and 5-FU, are commonly used for cancer treatment. However, the optimal use of these chemotherapy agents is restricted by dose-limiting side effects, which may result from the damage of normal cells. Consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], we found ZBP1 expression was low or absent in tumor tissue, which suggests ZBP1-derived PANoptosis is most likely activated by chemotherapy in noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, we observed that dsRNA was induced by chemotherapy and can be sensed by ZBP1 in normal colonic tissues in CRC patients. Although we still need to gain more clinical evidence to comprehensively investigate the role of PANoptosis in chemotherapy-induced side effects, it would also be interesting to develop therapeutic approaches to mitigate side effects of chemotherapy by targeting ZBP1 in future studies.</p><p id="Par73">In summary, our data reveal that ERVs are activated by DNA damage and can act as ligands for ZBP1 to trigger PANoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>). This improved our understanding of the mechanistic basis in DNA damage-induced cell death. Furthermore, as ZBP1 expression is largely restricted to normal tissues in cancer patients, our findings suggest that ZBP1-derived PANoptosis contributes to chemotherapy-induced toxicity. These results, therefore, indicate that the inhibition of ZBP1-derived PANoptosis could be a potential therapeutic approach to alleviate chemotherapy-induced side effects and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
