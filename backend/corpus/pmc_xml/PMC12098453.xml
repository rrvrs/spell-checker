Coordination of messaging about beverages and between-provider communication may be important for facilitating behavior change.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In preparation for a planned intervention, during Spring through Fall of 2021, we conducted a qualitative study to understand perceptions around family beverage choice discussions across three groups: parents of WIC-enrolled children, WIC nutritionists and practicing clinicians. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 individuals, with sample size determined a priori. Thematic content analysis was used to summarize transcribed data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">There was broad agreement that children should not consume sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), but disagreement on tap water safety. Both clinicians and WIC nutritionists reported educating families about healthy drink choices, and parents recalled similar messages during these conversations. Parents were very supportive of fruit juice as part of the WIC package, with near universal opposition among clinicians. Many parents expressed concerns about tap water. Both provider groups perceived difficulty in reaching out to each other, and felt more communication would be helpful.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions for Practice</title><p id="Par4">Our findings highlight a need for more regular communication between WIC nutritionists and children&#x02019;s healthcare providers within our system, and more consistent parental education on juice and tap water safety. Future studies could evaluate whether these types of communication gaps and perceptions are regional or more widespread across the US.</p></sec></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="Significance"><title>Significance</title><p id="Par5">Prior studies explored perceptions of WIC-enrolled families regarding beverage choice. Our study builds on this by interviewing WIC nutritionists and clinicians to better inform consistent family counseling around beverage choices. Our findings showed broad agreement across groups that children should not consume SSB, but parents expressed concerns about tap water. Parents and WIC nutritionists were supportive of fruit juice being part of WIC package, while pediatric clinicians were almost universally opposed to this. Both provider groups reported difficulty in communicating with each other about patients, but felt it would be helpful if there were a way to efficiently do so.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sugar-sweetened beverage</kwd><kwd>Fruit juice</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>WIC</kwd><kwd>Low income</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Wake Forest University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by the Carolinas Consortium.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Excess sugar consumption has a well-documented association with childhood obesity and other health outcomes (Bleich &#x00026; Vercammen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>; Malik &#x00026; Hu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>), with sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) remaining a leading source of added sugars for American children (Bailey et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Bleich &#x00026; Vercammen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Consumption of SSB is greater among children from low-income households, contributing to disparities in obesity and other health outcomes (Bably et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>; Charvet &#x00026; Huffman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>). Although 100% fruit juice is not a SSB, it is an important contributor to total sugars consumed by young children, and may be associated with adverse health consequences or poorer diet quality if consumed early or in excess of recommended amounts (Nguyen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2024</xref>; Shefferly et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>; Sonneville et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>; Thompson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is a federally-subsidized program offered to low-income pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children up to 5 years old (Anderson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>). WIC provides supplemental foods, nutrition education, and counseling and referrals to healthcare and social services (US Department of Health and Human Services &#x00026; Agriculture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>). Given the patient population it serves, the WIC program is ideally situated to mitigate disparities in nutritional outcomes (Charvet &#x00026; Huffman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>), including discouraging the provision of SSB, and promoting guideline-recommended levels of fruit juice intake, namely - no fruit juice before age 1 and limiting to 4 ounces per day for toddlers(Heyman, Abrams, Section On Gastroenterology, Nutrition, &#x00026; Committee On, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Lott, Callahan, Welker Duffy, Story, &#x00026; Daniels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>). Similarly, pediatricians are also positioned to provide regular education and support for healthy beverage choice in childhood and are encouraged to screen for SSB and fruit juice consumption as part of a comprehensive approach to obesity prevention (Krebs et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Little is known about whether these 2 groups of providers (WIC nutritionists and pediatricians) are communicating consistent, guideline-driven messages on child beverage choice to WIC participants. To better understand this issue and inform development of a planned beverage choice intervention for WIC-enrolled children, we conducted interviews with parents of WIC-enrolled children, WIC nutritionists and pediatricians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design &#x00026; Setting</title><p id="Par9">This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to inform the development of a planned health-system embedded intervention to promote healthy patterns of beverage consumption among WIC-eligible or enrolled infants and toddlers.

We recruited parents or caregivers of WIC-enrolled children consuming above guideline-recommended levels of SSB or fruit juice. Parents/caregivers (collectively: parents) were considered eligible if they cared for a child under 5 who was currently participating in the WIC program and consuming 2 or more servings of fruit juice or SSB a day. A list of potentially-eligible parents was identified using child electronic health record (EHR) data (Lewis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>).

Eligibility criteria for WIC nutritionist interviews were that the participant was currently practicing within the local county WIC program. For clinician interviews, we required that an individual was in primary care practice in our health system and treating WIC-enrolled pediatric patients. Potential participants for provider interviews were identified using standardized invitation emails to employees in both groups.

As with the parental guide, provider interview guides were written collaboratively by the research team and Q-PRO. The provider interview guides were designed to address several topics, including educating parents about beverage choices, perceptions of fruit juice and WIC benefits, communication between pediatricians and WIC nutritionists, and feedback on the proposed intervention.</p><p id="Par16">All interviews were conducted 1:1 with participants over the phone and field notes were taken on a standardized form. Each interview lasted between 25 and 30&#x000a0;min and was digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions were cleaned by the Q-PRO team by reviewing the transcript against the audio to ensure accuracy of the transcription.

Two Q-PRO teammates conducted a thematic content analysis of transcripts to reveal patterns and overall themes in the data. First, each reviewed two transcripts from each interviewed group (parents, clinicians, and WIC nutritionists) and developed a draft codebook for each group. The study team reviewed the codebook and provided input for revisions. The revised codebook was tested by completing coding on several additional interview transcripts and further revised. All interviews were then independently coded in Atlas.ti version 9 by two Q-PRO teammates and coding was compared; any discrepancies were discussed and resolved to consensus. Once all transcripts were coded, code reports were run and summaries for each report were written. Code summaries were analyzed for patterns and themes, which are presented below. Differences between parents, clinicians, and WIC nutritionists were explored. COREQ criteria for reporting qualitative research were reviewed and, where relevant, followed in the preparation of this manuscript.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p id="Par19">One hundred and eight potentially eligible parents were reached by phone for recruitment.

When asked about limiting these drinks, the main reasons parents provided were concerns about a &#x0201c;sugar rush&#x0201d; and agitation/hyperactivity as well as the long-term health consequences of sugar. The main limitation tactics reported by parents were diluting a child&#x02019;s drink with water or replacing it with flavored water.</p><p id="Par25">WIC nutritionists noted the high prevalence of advertising and marketing of drinks to children as something that makes it harder for families to make healthy choices. For child health, WIC nutritionists highlighted how sugary drinks (either SSB or excessive fruit juice) could affect children&#x02019;s eating patterns, dental health and shorter-term health outcomes like weight gain. WIC nutritionists described the guideline recommendation to allow 4&#x02013;6 ounces of 100% fruit juice per day for children and were generally in alignment with this stance.</p><p id="Par26">All interviewed clinicians expressed negative feelings about sweet drinks, including both SSB and fruit juice. One clinician indicated that children should not have any fruit juices, despite guideline recommendations allowing for small amounts. Another clinician stated they &#x0201c;absolutely hate juice&#x0201d; and called it &#x0201c;the poison&#x0201d;. Clinicians were focused on the effect of both beverage types (SSB and fruit juice) on child weight gain and related health problems. One clinician specifically mentioned an increasing frequency of children with fatty liver disease due to consumption of processed foods, and high triglyceride levels due to corn syrup consumption. When asked about facilitators of unhealthy drink choice in families, one clinician noted that family members perceived as senior (e.g., grandparents, aunts) can negatively influence parents&#x02019; choices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Topic 2: Consumption of Water</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Theme: Parents Do not Perceive Replacement of SSBs with Tap Water as Safe (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>)</title><p id="Par27">Although all three interviewed groups agreed about limiting SSB for infants and toddlers, they disagreed on replacement of SSB with tap water. Most parents reported health benefits of their child drinking water, including fluoride in tap water for dental health and the importance of maintaining hydration. Fourteen (93%) parents indicated a distrust of tap water and sentiment that it was unsafe, with reasons including brown color, and the smell and taste of chlorine. No parent reported their family drinking exclusively tap water, with eleven (73%) reporting only drinking bottled water. Parents didn&#x02019;t report hearing that tap water was unsafe from any source in particular, but some attributed the belief to their experiences growing up.</p><p id="Par28">Among interviewed WIC nutritionists, all reported a perception that local tap water was a safe option, but two indicated specifically that for infants, purified or filtered water should be used. All interviewed clinicians reported a perception that tap water was a safe alternative beverage to SSB or fruit juice, though one clinician clarified that well water was not recommended for infants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Topic 3: Education about Healthy Drink Choices</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Theme: Providers Report Frequent Discussions with Parents about Beverage Choices, and Parents Report Receiving Consistent Messages (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>)</title><p id="Par29">Providers placed priority on educating families about healthy drink choices. Despite some perceived differences between providers (e.g. a perception by pediatricians that WIC may counsel differently than a clinician), parents recalled similar messages from these conversations.</p><p id="Par30">Most parents reported discussing beverages with their child&#x02019;s WIC nutritionist and clinician. The main message parents took away from discussions with providers was that children should drink more water and avoid all sugary drinks. Most parents reported that they had reduced the amount of sugar in their child&#x02019;s diet based on the recommendation of either a WIC nutritionist or clinician. Nine parents (60%) reported that a WIC nutritionist advised them on the appropriate amount of fruit juice for their child, which most parents remembered as 1&#x02013;2 servings/day. Parents reported that both WIC nutritionists and clinicians educated them about 100% fruit juice and its sugar content.</p><p id="Par31">WIC nutritionists spoke extensively about their role in educating parents, including discussing health effects of SSB and fruit juice, particularly risk of childhood obesity and dental caries. WIC nutritionists noted frequently correcting parental misconceptions, especially around 100% fruit juice, however, none advised parents to completely avoid fruit juice for their children. Instead, they reported counseling on strategies such as staying within the recommended serving size for fruit juice, diluting juice, and finding lower-sugar alternatives such as carbonated/flavored water. Regarding education around water consumption, WIC nutritionists reported that they did not tend to initiate this conversation but did advise on the safety and benefits of tap water if asked.</p><p id="Par32">All interviewed clinicians reported discussing beverage choice at well-child visits if they had concerns (e.g., based on child BMI, dental health), or to correct parental misconceptions about specific drinks like fruit juice. Interviewed clinicians tended to advise little or no fruit juice in these conversations. Three clinicians reported discussing the health effects of SSB and fruit juice with parents, citing weight gain and associated health issues including diabetes. The primary tactic suggested to reduce SSB and fruit juice consumption was for parents to completely avoid having either beverage in the house. Like WIC nutritionists, clinicians said they did not initiate conversations about tap water but would advise on its safety and benefits if asked.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Topic 4: Provision of Fruit Juice by the WIC Program</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Theme: Strong Parental Support, Strong Clinician Opposition, with WIC Holding a Middle Ground Stance (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>)</title><p id="Par33">Parents were universally positive about the fact that WIC benefits include a provision for fruit juice purchase using electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards and agreed that the current amount of fruit juice vouchers was enough. For some parents, juice was among the first purchases they make when the EBT voucher arrives each month. All interviewed parents indicated it was good that fruit juice was being provided by WIC benefits because otherwise fruit juice was expensive.</p><p id="Par34">Most WIC nutritionists were supportive of the fact that WIC provides fruit juice vouchers. Two nutritionists pointed out that the amount of 100% fruit juice provided each month meets the daily guidelines for pediatric consumption. Two nutritionists mentioned that they have had parents suggest that WIC should provide more fruit instead of fruit juice.</p><p id="Par35">All five clinicians had negative opinions about fruit juice vouchers being provided by WIC, as they felt it communicated mixed messaging to families and led to excessive fruit juice intake.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Topic 5: Communication between Providers</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Theme: both Provider Groups Perceived Difficulty in Reaching Out To the Other, but Felt It Would Be Helpful and Desired a Tool To Facilitate Communication (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>)</title><p id="Par36">Both interviewed provider groups perceived difficulty in reaching out to each other, but felt it would be helpful if there was more communication. Only one WIC nutritionist reported that a clinician had reached out to them in the past (about fruit juice). In contrast, all WIC nutritionists reported having reached out to a clinician. They reported this communication was primarily focused on discussions of milk, formula, and other nutritional supplements in relation to a child&#x02019;s weight. No WIC nutritionist reported reaching out to a clinician about SSB. WIC nutritionists reported frequently reaching out to clinicians by phone, although they noted that they could not be connected directly to the clinician. Almost all WIC nutritionists indicated a desire for a better system of communication with clinicians.</p><p id="Par37">All but one clinician reported having reached out to WIC nutritionists and stated that their outreach had been focused on discussions of milk, formula, and other nutritional supplements in relation to a child&#x02019;s weight.

Almost all clinicians indicated a desire for a better system to communicate with WIC.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par38">In this qualitative study about child beverage choices among WIC-enrolled families, pediatric clinicians conveyed a stricter view on SSBs and more negative views on fruit juice than WIC nutritionists and parents. Although all interviewed providers felt that tap water was an ideal substitute for SSB or fruit juice, it was viewed as unsafe by parents in our sample. Our results highlight the need for work to understand the scope of these issues beyond our system, and, locally, a need to improve communication between providers.</p><p id="Par39">Although several prior studies have explored the perceptions of WIC-enrolled families regarding SSB, fruit juice, and water, our study builds on this literature by interviewing WIC nutritionists and clinicians. Consistent with other studies (Morel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>), parents in our sample described their child&#x02019;s taste preference for &#x0201c;sweet&#x0201d;, and parental convenience as driving factors for child SSB and fruit juice consumption. Similar to several other studies, providers in our sample indicated that parents often perceive fruit juice or fruit-flavored drinks as a healthy option for children (McElligott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Moran &#x00026; Roberto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Morel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>; Vercammen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>), and cited the influence of targeted marketing or advertising, another theme that has been expressed in prior studies with WIC-enrolled families (Morel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par40">WIC nutritionists and clinicians in our sample held different views on WIC&#x02019;s provision of fruit juice. Interviewed clinicians worried that, by providing fruit juice, WIC could create a mixed message. They took a more rigid stance on complete avoidance of fruit juice for small children. The WIC nutritionists we interviewed adopted more of a &#x0201c;harm reduction&#x0201d; stance, that fruit juice is not as good as water, but it is a better choice than SSB.</p><p id="Par41">Health behavior education from providers can positively impact nutritional and other lifestyle choices made by patients(Eckel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>; Halm &#x00026; Amoako, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>; Oberg &#x00026; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). This idea was supported in our interviews, as parents repeatedly described making changes to their child&#x02019;s SSB and fruit juice intake based on prior education from their WIC nutritionist and/or clinician. A current missed opportunity may therefore be expanding these conversations to routinely address tap water intake. Although both interviewed provider groups indicated they would talk about tap water if prompted, it was not something that they addressed with every family. Given that all interviewed parents perceived tap water was unsafe, and many were exclusively purchasing bottled water for their families, this topic could be addressed routinely during conversations in our health system about beverage choice with WIC-enrolled or eligible families. This same theme of parental concern about safety of tap water and preference for bottled water has emerged in other studies exploring barriers to water consumption in similar populations (Beck et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>; Morel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">Lastly, both groups of providers in our study expressed a general perception of communication between WIC and the health system being a &#x0201c;one-way street&#x0201d; - although each group reported frequent outreach to the other, neither felt their outreach was routinely reciprocated. Given the potential health benefits of greater care coordination (Bailey-Davis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>), this finding highlights the need for understanding whether there is demand beyond our health system for strategies to make WIC-clinician provider communication easier and more frequent. Such conversations might prevent confusion on the part of parents and could serve to promote provider synergy on shared goals such as increasing water consumption, decreasing SSB, promoting guideline-appropriate levels of fruit juice intake, and reinforcing messages from one another.</p><p id="Par43">There are several important limitations of the study. Because parents/caregivers were selected for interviews based on having young children in WIC who over-consumed either SSB or fruit juice, their views may not be transferrable to families not enrolled in WIC, or those whose children are consuming at or below guideline-recommended levels of these beverages. Also limiting transferability is the fact that all participants were selected from one health system in a distinct geographic region in the Southeastern US; thus, our findings may not be reflected among other populations. Our sample of Hispanic parents was limited, with only 1 of the 15 parents identifying as a person of Hispanic origin. This was likely related in part to our requirement for English speaking. Some parents in our sample may have found questions about child beverage choice to be a sensitive topic, thus it is possible that social desirability bias impacted their responses. Lastly, the timing of the interviews coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have resulted in lower parental response rate or altered parent or child behaviors around beverage consumption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">WIC nutritionists and clinicians have frequent contact with nutritionally at-risk families, and are uniquely positioned to provide key education and counseling messages regarding beverage choices. This qualitative study revealed areas of disagreement between provider groups and WIC-enrolled parents in our health system. Additional work in similar populations could further elucidate how widespread these issues are and clarify the need for programs to promote more consistent provider counseling. Communication of consistent messages on beverage choice to WIC parents is a goal that may be more readily achieved with better care coordination and communication between the WIC program and health systems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by a grant from Healthy Eating Research, a program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (Grant HER283-4134).
