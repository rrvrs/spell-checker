Introduction</title><p>The current shortage of research non-human primates (NHPs) has elevated interest in African green monkeys (<italic toggle="yes">Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic>) [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On the Caribbean islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, there are an estimated 37,000 free-roaming African green monkeys based on the most recent census [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A small founding population of African green monkeys was introduced to the islands in the 17th century, and the population has greatly expanded, such that they have become an invasive species, creating major problems for the local agricultural industry [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Humane procurement to enlist for biomedical research contributes to population management and allows for research husbandry to occur within a primate source country where animals can be housed in an outdoor naturalistic setting. Consequently, we have sought to optimize strategies for establishing safe and effective social housing for African green monkeys that are housed in research facilities.</p><p>The freedom to participate in social interactions is one of the most important enrichments available for NHPs housed in captivity [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The African green monkey is a social species, and isolation can quickly cause an increase in stress and lead to immunocompromise [<xref rid="B6-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is both a serious welfare issue as well as a factor that can compromise study data [<xref rid="B8-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Compared with single housing, social housing can lead to a better appetite, faster recovery from study procedures, and improved overall health as reflected by data from bloodwork and physical exams [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there is currently limited published information about procedures for initiating and maintaining pair housing for African green monkeys and no information about trio housing. As their contributions as a research species are increasing, it is important to document the behavioral differences between Caribbean-origin African green monkeys and, presently, the more commonly enlisted macaque species. Comparatively, green monkeys originating from St. Kitts and Nevis are more reserved, behaving more like a prey species hiding vulnerabilities [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], often showing more subtleties in behavior and less rigid dominance hierarchies compared to macaques [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Another distinctive behavior of African greens is territoriality and fierce defense of their home ranges [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a behavior that is also demonstrated in the setting of home enclosures in captivity [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Unlike macaques, African greens are proportionately more arboreal than terrestrial, making vertical space an important component of not just their environmental enrichment but critical to social dynamics and overall behavioral health [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While macaques benefit from a gradual introduction to new social partners through protective barriers, this is not true for African greens. It has been theorized that the species requires full physical contact to enable normal behavioral interactions surrounding a social introduction [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Many studies are designed to have treatment groups containing three animals each, which previously has made pair housing a challenge, as only two of the three could be paired in a group. Same-sex social groups are preferred for most pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, or behavioral studies conducted, due to the variable impact that sexual interactions could have on maintaining stable biochemistry and behavior. Consequently, our emphasis has been on creating compatible same-sex treatment groups of African green monkeys that are socially housed for studies that may last for a year or longer.</p><p>The current study aimed to delineate which factors during the introductory period of the social group would optimize successful establishment of male or female trios. A second objective was to quantify the success rate of pair and trio social groupings of either female or males using these procedures. Our hypothesis was that for both female and male groupings, those with a greater body weight differential within the group would be more successful than those with equivalent weights, as one animal would likely be rapidly identified as the dominant animal. It was also hypothesized that groups provided with a larger cage size would be more successful, as it provided more space to perform introductory behaviors. Finally, based on the historical observations of pair housing in our colony, it was hypothesized that the female trios would be more successful than the males.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-vetsci-11-00667"><title>2.1. Facility Organization of Animal Housing</title><p>The animals are housed at a contract research organization with NHP facilities located on the island of St. Kitts, operating at the Saint Kitts Biomedical Research Foundation. The facility is situated on former agricultural land with substantial research infrastructure that currently accommodates up to 1500 African green monkeys, which includes a combination of wild-caught and purpose-bred animals. There are typically about 700 animals housed in large outdoor social enclosures (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>There are multiple types of animal groups housed in these social enclosures: all adult males or females (about 10&#x02013;12 animals/enclosure), all juvenile males or females (about 12&#x02013;14 animals/enclosure), and breeding enclosures (1 male with about 6&#x02013;7 females, along with their juvenile and infant offspring). The facility also has enclosures specifically designated for same-sex geriatric animals or for dams and young infants that have not yet been assigned to an established breeding group.</p><p>Within the testing facility there are typically about 500 animals participating in studies at any one time. These animals are housed in study buildings, which are built using plastic lumber with slatted walls to promote natural breeze ventilation and visual and auditory connections to each other and the outside environment (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Further information on the facility, intake, and quarantine procedures are elaborated on in <xref rid="app1-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="app">Appendix A</xref>.</p><p>When animals are enrolled in a study, all will participate in the social housing program, unless there is an IACUC-approved or veterinary reason for single housing. This often involves grouping animals that have been assigned to the same treatment group of a study. Frequently, these groups contain two or three animals, so there are very limited options for selecting partners among those screened for participation in the study. There are a wide array of study types conducted, including ophthalmic, neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and toxicological studies, and the study type and design will determine how the treatment groups are established. For example, many gene therapy studies involve use of viral vectors, where theoretically, a virus could be spread to a cage partner, and social housing should not mix different treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>2.2. Establishment of Animal Groupings</title><p>Our social housing method aims to combine similarly aged males or females that have a clear weight discrepancy, ideally at least a 0.5&#x02013;1 kg difference, in an enclosure that is novel to these animals to avoid territorial aggression. A novel cage setup in this context is referring to two or more connected individual cages (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) that have not been previously lived in by any of the members of the new pair or trio. For adult males, introduction is initiated after sedation with intramuscular ketamine alone (5&#x02013;8 mg/kg) or ketamine and xylazine (8 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg, respectively). Ketamine alone is the preferred sedation method for introductions. However, a ketamine/xylazine cocktail is the common sedation method for performing study procedures. To avoid multiple sedation events unnecessarily, pairs or trios may be introduced opportunistically while sedated with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail for other procedures. Animals are observed by veterinary staff as they recover in this novel enclosure. The social housing method is detailed further in <xref rid="app2-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="app">Appendix B</xref>.</p><p>The success of pairs or trios is determined based on a compatibility assessment of a group starting during the introductory period and continuing throughout the course of the study (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If signs of incompatibility are noted, a group is evaluated to determine if separation is warranted (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A pair or trio that needs to be permanently separated during a study is determined to be unsuccessful. Permanent separation is determined based on the frequency and level of aggressive behaviors noted in a group and any emotional distress from one or more of the group members (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In some cases, though, a group may be separated early due to concerns from the study team about occasional contact aggression (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="app3-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="app">Appendix C</xref>) that develops during the introduction period. Pair/trio housing is not terminated simply due to contact aggression, however. Decisions of intervention must balance the welfare of the animal with the monkeys&#x02019; need to establish social relationships and hierarchies between themselves. Previous studies at other institutions have used 14 days after the initiation of full contact as a time point that signifies success of a social group [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; however, in this dataset, we wanted to define success as maintaining a social group throughout the entirety of a study, as there often are no other social housing options if the treatment group in question fails as a pair/trio. Studies can range from 3 months to 1 year long, and animals in non-terminal studies can remain in this successful social group after the conclusion of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vetsci-11-00667"><title>2.3. Statistical Analysis of Social Housing Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot3dot1-vetsci-11-00667"><title>2.3.1. Retrospective Analysis&#x02014;Historical Method</title><p>A retrospective analysis of pairing data from 1986 to 2023 was conducted based on pairing statuses entered in the medical records database (DVMAX) by veterinary staff. Four medical record codes were used in the analysis: pair housing&#x02014;no mesh divider/full contact, pair housing&#x02014;mesh divider/protected contact, pair housing&#x02014;separated, pair housing&#x02014;removed due to aggression. &#x0201c;Pair housing&#x02014;separated&#x0201d; includes multiple reasons for incompatibility (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and &#x0201c;pair housing&#x02014;removed due to aggression&#x0201d; will specify which of the pair members was instigating the aggression. For this analysis, both &#x0201c;pair housing&#x02014;separated&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pair housing&#x02014;removed due to aggression&#x0201d; were grouped together to be considered a failed pairing attempt. Data were analyzed from the first pairing attempt of 443 animals. Details on the participating animals are included in <xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A successful pairing in this dataset was defined as a pair that did not need to be permanently separated. If during the introductory period or any time afterwards, a pair needed to be temporarily separated but was able to be successfully reintroduced, that was also considered as a success. Successful pairing was separated into &#x0201c;full contact&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;protected contact&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Full contact&#x0201d; is the ideal scenario, where there are no barriers dividing the two animals. &#x0201c;Protected contact&#x0201d; provides a mesh barrier between the two animals, which still allows for visual and tactile contact through the divider. Animals labeled as &#x0201c;protected contact&#x0201d; in the medical record were able to coexist next to each other, showing no signs of distress once the mesh divider was in place (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). An animal that showed any signs of distress during &#x0201c;protected contact&#x0201d; was moved and recorded as &#x0201c;separated&#x0201d;. Protected contact was most often employed in animals that were not able to be given full contact due to research study constraints but allowed the animals to have some tactile social enrichment during that study. Protected contact was also used on a case-by-case basis if a pair of animals was displaying some signs of incompatibility when given full access but were showing no signs of distress as neighbors, which allowed for a higher degree of social enrichment than full separation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>2.3.2. New Method for Male Pair Housing</title><p>Between 2022 and 2024, 20 male pairs were created on research studies (40 total male monkeys). All pairs were given additional cage space, with two top cages and one lower cage, or two bottom cages and one top cage, in an L configuration (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In some instances, the males were able to be given all four cages in the quad, at least during the first two weeks of the introductory period (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). After the introductory period, if building constraints required, the pair was brought back to having two connected horizontal cages (no earlier than four weeks after introduction), either the top two or bottom two cages (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot3-vetsci-11-00667"><title>2.3.3. Trio Housing Method</title><p>Starting in 2022, the established method of social housing was modified to include trio housing, as many study treatment groups include three same-sex members that could not be housed with members of another treatment group. To achieve trio housing, different modifications of the pair housing procedure were instituted for each sex.</p><p>For the analysis reported here, all female and male trios that were created for research studies from 2022 to 2024 were analyzed for group success, as defined above, throughout the course of that study. The number of male and female trios were necessarily constrained by the designs of the studies conducted during that period. Due to these constraints, there were an uneven number of female and male trios analyzed. More female trios (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 25) were created during this period (75 total female monkeys) than male trios (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11) (33 total male monkeys).</p><p>For females, most trios initially underwent sedation with intramuscular ketamine alone (5&#x02013;8 mg/kg) or ketamine and xylazine (8 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg, respectively) while moved to novel cages in the same study building. For animals that were given the ketamine/xylazine cocktail instead of ketamine alone, this was because introductions were performed on the same day as baseline activities, as this already scheduled sedation event aided in animal movement and cage set up. Thus, to avoid an additional sedation event for social grouping, the groups were often opportunistically created on this day. For the female trios in Study 1 (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), who were the first four female trios created, groups were introduced without sedation because of historical evidence of success for awake female pairing introductions. Space constraints in the study building did not allow for novel caging to be provided for these females, so they were grouped together by pulling the dividers between the females in their home cages while awake. These females had existed in protected contact for at least one week without any signs of incompatibility (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) before being moved to full contact. All subsequent female trios in this dataset were sedated and moved to novel caging.</p><p>If there was sufficient cage space available, each female trio group was given an additional cage, so that the three animals were housed in four cages. In these instances, the quad of four cages (two top cages and two bottom cages) was organized in a C-formation (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The floor of one of the top cages was removed; this cage still had perches present and often was a favorite spot for the animals. For the female trios, the variables of sedation, novel caging, caging configuration, age difference, age group, and weight difference were all recorded, but the variables could not be meaningfully analyzed for their impact on the outcome since all trios were successes in this dataset.</p><p>All male trios in our study were either sedated with intramuscular ketamine alone (5&#x02013;8 mg/kg) or ketamine and xylazine (8 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg, respectively) to initiate social housing. All male trios were introduced in caging that was novel/neutral for each member. Whenever possible, males were housed in (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> + 1) caging, organized in the C formation (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In two of the male trios in Study 15 (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), this was not possible due to constraints in the room, so in these cases, three animals occupied three cages in an upside-down L formation (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In one other male trio in Study 12 (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), the C-formation was not possible due to constraints in the room, so the three males were given four cages connected horizontally, with sight barriers between each one.

As such, there were some aspects of the study design that could not be controlled, as the social groups were created as part of these ongoing research studies. Within the weight ranges the studies allowed, groups were created with a weight discrepancy whenever possible. Determining a social group failure while enrolled on a research study was a limitation, as some groups may have been successful with more time, more space, or less study activity, but the social groups needed to fit into the ongoing study designs and timelines.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-vetsci-11-00667"><title>3.

Some pairs that were not as compatible with full contact, and for which no other pairing options were available at the time, were able to have protected contact with their pair and live compatibly as neighbors. Protected contact still allowed for these animals to have some physical contact with their neighbor, to allow for the benefits of enriched social interaction, but also to provide them protection from any contact aggression that might occur. These animals were also considered successful pairs, as they still had social interaction, but were included separately in the percent success (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>3.2.

Trio Housing</title><p>Socially housed female trios had a 100% success rate, whereas male trio success was substantially lower than for female trios or male pairs (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). It should be noted that for male trios, two used the old method of one animal per cage (Study 15), and for trio housing, this was unsuccessful in both cases, as it resulted in contact aggression. All animal injuries were assessed by the veterinarians as minor wounds. However, study personnel were concerned about leaving the groups together for a longer period of observation while on the study in case aggressive behaviors escalated. In these instances, in Study 15, the member of the trio observed by the behavioral staff and veterinary staff to be instigating the aggressive behaviors was shifted to protected contact where they were able to interact with the remaining pair safely, without any observed signs of distress (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The other male trios that used the new <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> + 1 (or <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> + 3) caging method were mostly successful (66.6%). None of the trios in our study ever inflicted serious wounds on any of the other animals (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For male trios, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests were performed to determine the influence of weight difference and age difference on trio success, and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were performed to determine the influence of cage type and age group on success. Weight difference (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.42) and cage type (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.24) were not statistically significant in this dataset; however, with a larger sample size, these variables may be found to influence success. It appears that age difference is a significant contributor to male trio success (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.02), in that the larger the difference in age, the less likely that a male trio will be successful. The males that were closer in age were the most successful. It also appears that age group is a significant contributor to male trio success (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.015), in that the male trios were more likely to be successful in the juvenile age group. For this dataset, the juvenile males who were close in age were the most successful.</p><p>For female trios, all the trio housing attempts were successful, so we were unable to determine statistically whether success was influenced by age difference, weight difference, age group, or cage type; however, for this dataset of female trios, the majority were close in age, with only two trios having greater than a 2-year difference in age. The majority were in the adult age group, except for five, who were juvenile groups, and the majority were close in weight as well, with all having less than 1 kg difference except for two groups. The other variables to consider were that four female trios were introduced without sedation and were not able to be given novel caging. As all trios were equally successful, it appears that these variables may not influence trio-housing success in females.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vetsci-11-00667"><title>4. Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-vetsci-11-00667"><title>4.1. Historical Pairing Method</title><p>This study evaluated three different methods of social housing for the African green monkey at animal facilities on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. The first method was our facility&#x02019;s historical pair-housing method, which involved creating same-sex pairs with a significant weight difference between members (at least 0.5&#x02013;1 kg) and sedating the animals before introducing them to one another in a novel caging environment. Overall, this method has been very successful in creating lasting pairs of females (90% success). For male pairs, while still successful (69% success), this study sought to evaluate a modification of the historical approach to improve success. Based on the territorial nature of the African green and the importance of vertical space for this semi-arboreal species [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], a new method for male pairing was devised.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>4.2. New Pairing Method</title><p>This new method hypothesized that by providing at least one additional cage for these pairs during the introductory phase (2&#x02013;4 weeks) and including vertical space (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), the pairing success could be improved by creating conditions more appropriate for the natural behaviors needed for a social introduction. Other factors that were evaluated were the weight difference between members, the age difference between members, and the age group of the members (juvenile, adult, or mixed). For testing this new method, 20 male pairs on a variety of different research studies were evaluated (40 total animals), with a total percent success of 90%, which was a great improvement. Due to the nature of the research studies being conducted, the male animals participating in the studies had been selected within a narrow range for weight and age, to control these variables in these studies. Likely due to these constraints and the smaller sample size, the weight difference, age difference, and age group did not statistically influence male pair success in this dataset. Additional studies need to perform a more controlled comparison to evaluate the degree to which these factors influence male pair success. However, the high success rate using this new method within a narrower weight and age range is encouraging for other research organizations providing social enrichment for male African greens participating in similar research studies.</p><p>Providing the larger cage space with an ample vertical component, even just temporarily during the introductory period, resulted in a significant increase in pair success compared to the historical method, allowing for more animals to receive all the benefits of social enrichment. The increase in cage space in these successful pairs was able to be reduced back to two horizontal cages per pair after the introductory period had passed in some of the pairs, which, in our study, was at least four weeks after successful introduction. This reduction in space, which was due to building needs, was performed in conjunction with the animal care behavioral staff, research staff, and veterinary staff, with frequent observation for any adverse responses. McGuire [<xref rid="B29-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] described wild-caught African greens from St. Kitts being relocated from a larger enclosure in St. Kitts to a smaller enclosure in California and noted that the smaller space increased affiliative behaviors and had no effect on aggression. To our knowledge, this is the only known study in African greens specifically looking at cage space and the effect on group social interactions; however, this involved much larger groups being moved to a smaller novel environment. We observed a significant increase in success with male pairs that were provided larger cage space in a novel cage environment. We theorize that this is especially critical during the introductory phase, but once the group is established and successful, it appears that reducing the space for these successful pairs does not contribute to any aggressive behaviors.</p><p>Further research is needed to determine the earliest point at which space reduction could be performed, if necessary, as this was not able to be controlled for in our study. Other factors that were not able to be controlled for in our study but warrant further investigation for their influences on pairing success are frequency of temporary separations of the pairs for study activities and frequency of sedation events needed for study activities, as it is theorized that interrupting the introductory period with these episodes may lead to pair failures.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-vetsci-11-00667"><title>4.3. Trio Housing</title><p>Trio housing was established at Virscio in 2022. This was a beneficial enhancement to the animal care program, as many research projects required separate treatment groups of three same-sex animals, and this housing improvement ensured the facility had the ability to house each group of three socially. In our study, all trio-housed males and females enrolled in research studies were analyzed for the success of group housing based on age difference, age group, weight difference, and the amount of space provided. Other factors include the configuration of the caging provided and for some females, whether the group members were sedated for introduction or moved to novel caging. It was observed that regardless of awake or sedated introductions, novel caging, age difference, or weight difference, all female trios were successful for the duration of the studies they were enrolled in. As is the nature of many of the research studies conducted at contract research organizations, there was a narrow range of ages and weights for the animals making up each trio. We were unable to interpret the statistical influence on success for these trios, as all were successful. Further research is needed to fully investigate the effect of these variables on successful social housing.</p><p>For the male trios assessed in our study, age group and age difference were determined to be statistically significant contributors to success. The juvenile and young adult males that were close in age were the most successful in trio housing, either with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> + 1 caging or <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> + 3 caging.</p><p>Mature adult males could be difficult to maintain in trio housing for an extended period. The unsuccessful male trios were often able to maintain compatibility for about two weeks of trio housing, but as these animals were all on studies, it is theorized that the frequent separations for study activities may have interfered with the solidification of social bonds. Further research is needed to investigate to what degree frequent separation can affect these social groups.</p><p>For young adult and juvenile males, when all in a similar age range, adding at least one additional cage increased their success (e.g., three males with four cages). The most successful male trios lasted together for six months before study termination and included males about 4 years old, with caging that allowed each trio to have three additional cages (i.e., three males with six cages). These young males in this 6-month study were also too young for canine recontouring, so these males still had their primary canines with mixed dentition, while all adult males on studies had recontoured canines. Canine length has been attributed to higher social dominance rank in multiple NHPs [<xref rid="B30-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but it is unclear if canine length may have influenced the success of these juvenile trios.</p><p>It has been theorized that for African greens, a period of protected contact with visual access could cause frustration, in both males and females, and hinder the normal introductory process that involves physical contact [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Historically, we have observed similar findings specifically with adult males. Overall, based on the historical findings, none of the adult males that had any prior protected contact were chosen to be grouped together, to give the groups the best chance of success. However, after full contact introductions, in many cases, unsuccessful males were able to live with a mesh barrier between them, with no signs of aggression or distress. While there is no guarantee that two males will be able to coexist compatibly in protected contact after the introductory period, many males have been able to be housed as neighbors with no signs of distress. As this protected contact is sometimes necessary due to research constraints, it is helpful to know that many males can exist in this housing set up without apparent distress.</p><p>In our study, we have attempted to establish a method for selection of potential pairs and trios of African green monkeys and described behaviors and physiological signs that can be utilized to assist in determining success of those social groups. Further research needs to be conducted to investigate which of these behaviors and the frequencies at which they are performed are the best predictors of success. Comparatively, in the heavily researched rhesus macaque, studies have shown that for both males and females, demonstrating proximity, social contact, and tandem threats (called co-enlisting in our study) on Day 1 of pairing were positive predictors of success [<xref rid="B32-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These behaviors were also used in our study to help determine success of a social group, and further research is needed to determine if the frequency of these behaviors in African greens is similar to that seen in the rhesus. Another study in rhesus attempting to evaluate male trio formation found that out of seven trios, only one was successful but eventually also had to be separated after 51 days; it was speculated that transport stress was the ultimate reason that group failed [<xref rid="B33-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The adult male trios in our study had many factors that could have attributed to their failures, but one that needs further research is the effect of stress on bond formation. Our trios were not transported to new locations but did have multiple episodes of sedation and study activities where separation was required and follow up studies need to be conducted to investigate to what degree the frequency of separation episodes contributes to male trio failure.</p><p>A possible solution that could assist with adult male trio formation is the addition of Diazepam during the early introductory period. In a study in adult male rhesus pairs, 16 out of 17 were successful with a dose of Diazepam, likely due to sedation and anxiolytic effects, and were successful without using the typical period of protected contact for macaques [<xref rid="B34-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This further supports our study&#x02019;s success using sedation as one of the many tools for male group formation, as well as provides an additional tool that could be used in more difficult cases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vetsci-11-00667"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>African green monkeys are an invaluable alternative to macaques as an NHP research model given the critical NHP shortage, and many research facilities are now working with African greens for a variety of biomedical research objectives. There are limited publications detailing comparative behavioral differences between African greens and other NHPs in biomedical research and how best to ensure that all animals receive the appropriate and mandated social enrichment. As most of the African greens in research are of Caribbean origin, greater insight into the behavior of the African greens of St. Kitts and Nevis is a valuable addition to the biomedical field. This current analysis demonstrated that in a high-throughput contract research organization where time for in depth temperament testing for social housing is not always available, having existing data on the impact of body weight, age, and sex can be a very helpful starting point in optimizing chances of success when pair or trio housing. This information forms the basis for the behavioral, research, and veterinary teams to create compatible social groups. For females of similar ages and weights, both pair housing and trio housing was very successful. For juvenile males of similar ages and weights, pair and trio housing were very successful as well. Young adult males were most successful when paired, but trio housing can also work well, especially if enough cage space is available to allow for at least one extra cage during introductions. Adult males were most successful in pairs when at least one additional cage was provided for introductions. Adult male trios were the least successful type of grouping in the present analysis, and additional testing is needed to develop a more successful method for grouping three adult males. Assigning treatment groups based on previous social compatibility is currently the most successful strategy for forming adult male trios. Female trio housing was very successful overall and is highly recommended for any studies with treatment groups of three individuals.</p><p>The quantification of recent successes in our social housing program confirms the ongoing refinements in animal welfare at the facility which positively impacts research data emanating from studies utilizing these animals. A cooperative behavioral mindset between animal care, research, and veterinary staff is key to providing successful social enrichment at a large research organization, where all staff are invested in the success of social groups, both for enriching animal welfare and producing the highest-quality data. We hope the techniques described provide some guidelines for improved social housing at other institutions working with African green monkeys with potential relevance to other NHP species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the dedicated animal care, behavioral, research, and veterinary staff of Virscio who cared for all the monkeys in our study and tirelessly watched over each social group to ensure the optimal animal welfare.

Facility Background</title><sec id="secAdot1-vetsci-11-00667"><title>Appendix A.1. Facility Organization of Animal Housing</title><p>There are currently about 700 animals housed in large outdoor social enclosures, which range in size from 10 ft &#x000d7; 16 ft &#x000d7; 8 ft to 20 ft &#x000d7; 16 ft &#x000d7; 8 ft, with many being 10 ft &#x000d7; 16 ft &#x000d7; 10 ft. These enclosures are made of chain link fencing, with sealed concrete flooring and shorter raised concrete walls as wind breakers. In addition to surrounding trees, each enclosure has an opaque fiberglass roof on half of the ceiling to allow shade and protection from the rain as well as direct sunlight from the uncovered portion of the roof. There are multiple stainless-steel bars for perching, as well as hollow hanging plastic barrels with a window, to allow for both a perch and sight barrier. Other forms of enrichment, such as hanging ropes, hammocks, plastic perches, plastic play structures, and various manipulanda, are also provided to promote natural behaviors.</p><p>There are typically approximately 500 animals participating in studies at any one time which are housed in study buildings, built using plastic lumber with slatted walls to promote natural breeze ventilation and visual and auditory connections to each other and the outside environment. Tropical plants are present on the property and around the enclosures to maintain a naturalistic setting. In the study buildings, most cages are arranged in a quad set up, with the ability to connect the space of all four together and, in some quads, can be configured to make even larger cage enclosures. Each building for study housing contains 40 to 80 cages. The facility uses multiple types of caging, including those from Lab Products, Lenderking, Suburban Surgical, and Britz, in addition to custom-made cages. Each cage has a minimum of 4.3 square feet of floor space and 32 inches of height, which meets the requirements for a Group 3 animal (up to 10 kg) as outlined in the Guide [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="secAdot2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>Appendix A.2. Intake and Quarantine</title><p>Agriculture is one of the major industries on St. Kitts and Nevis, and the African green monkey contributes to significant crop loss each year [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and is regarded as a pest species by the farming community. The facility supports these local farmers, several of whom are training and employed as trappers, improving the livelihood of the farming community while benefitting both biomedical research and local ecosystem health and management. Yearly training is provided by facility veterinarians on safe and humane capture methods. Additionally, there is yearly inspection of trapping sites, and a veterinarian examines each animal thoroughly before they are brought into quarantine at the facility. Ketamine sedation is used to safely transport the animals to the facility under veterinary supervision, where they receive an intake exam, any necessary veterinary care, and are acclimated to the facility in quarantine, which is in a separate quiet area of the facility where only necessary personnel are present to provide the most stress-free environment possible. The veterinary staff observe these animals, along with animal care staff, to ensure the animals are adjusting well to their new environment while in single housing. They are transitioned to monkey chow over the first 1&#x02013;2 weeks in quarantine, supplementing their diet with the local fruits to which they are accustomed. The animals receive an identification tattoo and often a microchip as well. The animals receive tuberculosis (TB) testing (2 tests, 2 weeks apart), a thorough parasite treatment (3-day course of albendazole/fenbendazole and ivermectin, as well as 2 praziquantel doses 2 weeks apart), and tetanus vaccination, in addition to any other screening recommended by the veterinary staff before leaving quarantine 28 days later. For example, fecal swabs can be submitted for culture on any animals showing gastrointestinal clinical signs, and a complete blood count, clinical chemistry, or coagulation panel can be taken if warranted by clinical signs. Upon a negative fecal exam and exit from quarantine, the animals are placed into social groupings created by the veterinary and animal care behavioral team, who work together to determine the best placement for each new arrival. Adult African green monkeys also have their canine teeth recontoured prior to social housing to reduce the chance of inflicting injury. Frequent observations by the veterinary and animal care staff of the new social enclosures within the first month of acclimation are performed to ensure the new groups are adjusting well and receiving any additional veterinary care as needed.</p></sec></app><app id="app2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>Appendix B. Historical Pair Housing Method</title><sec id="secBdot1-vetsci-11-00667"><title>Appendix B.1. Establishment of Animal Groupings</title><p>Our social housing method aims to combine similarly aged males or females that have a clear weight discrepancy, ideally at least a 0.5&#x02013;1 kg difference, in an enclosure that is novel to the animals. The veterinary team chooses the social grouping assignments for research studies in accordance with the research protocol restrictions, after consulting with the study team and performing cage side observations on each animal. The research technicians assigned to each study observe each animal twice daily, along with animal care staff, and are also able to assess temperament informally based on the animal comfort level with the technicians&#x02019; presence and reactions to conspecific neighbors in the study building. All this information is discussed with the veterinary team, the proposed groups are approved by the study director, and then introductions are performed together by the veterinary and animal care behavioral staff.</p><p>New groups are introduced early in the day and in the first half of the week to facilitate several days of heightened observation prior to the weekend. For adult males, introduction is initiated after sedation with intramuscular ketamine alone (5&#x02013;8 mg/kg) or ketamine and xylazine (8 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg, respectively), commonly while relocating one or both animals from other locations. Animals are observed by veterinary staff as they recover together in an enclosure that is novel to the group members. Observations occur frequently during the first week of introduction, at least every 15 min until fully recovered from sedation, then hourly by the veterinary staff on the first day. Follow-up observations are performed cooperatively by the veterinary staff, animal care behavioral staff, and research staff at least three times a day for the first week and twice daily from then on. Adult males tend to be territorial over their home cage, so that if two adult males have been housed next to each other with protected contact prior to introduction (adjoining cages with a mesh metal barrier between the two), signs of aggression can often develop, even if they would fit the criteria as a good match otherwise. Consequently, introducing adult males to each other in a novel environment has been the most successful strategy to overcome territorial behavior historically. Conversely, juvenile and young adult males have not typically shown these same territorial inclinations historically, and so in some cases, can be introduced into successful pairs and trios without sedation. For consistency in our study, however, all young adult males were introduced to each other under light sedation in a novel environment.</p><p>Pair- and trio-housing status is documented in the medical records of each animal participating in the program, including any types of protected contact, signs of aggression and removal from the pair/trio due to incompatibility, using the DVMAX medical records system. Success rates of pairs or trios are determined based on success of the group throughout the course of this study.</p></sec><sec id="secBdot2-vetsci-11-00667"><title>Appendix B.2. Monitoring of Social Compatibility</title><p>Monkeys are monitored during the initial stages of full contact interaction to determine early signs of compatibility (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="app3-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="app">Appendix C</xref>). If there are no initial signs of contact aggression (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="app3-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="app">Appendix C</xref>) after the animals have recovered from sedation, the observer may leave the room but continues to monitor the group at regular intervals throughout the day. Contact aggression includes any attempts to injure noted between the group or evidence of this having happened (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="app3-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="app">Appendix C</xref>). If contact aggression interactions are brief and resolve without any serious injuries, the group will be observed more frequently to ensure the frequency of contact aggression is decreasing and not increasing, in which case the group would be separated. For a new pair or trio, the facility veterinarian determines the frequency of monitoring for the first two weeks based on observed group interactions on the first day. After the introductory period (2&#x02013;4 weeks), established groups will be observed twice daily to assess continued compatibility, as is the case for all cage-housed monkeys.</p><p>Any time two or more monkeys are allowed to interact, there is the possibility of conflict. Pair/trio housing is not terminated simply due to contact aggression. Decisions of intervention must balance the welfare of the animal with the monkeys&#x02019; need to establish social relationships and hierarchies between themselves. Frequently, a clear dominant and submissive relationship between the two monkeys will develop. This is a natural NHP behavior and is not necessarily a sign of incompatibility. However, aggressive behaviors or fearful behaviors (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="app3-vetsci-11-00667" ref-type="app">Appendix C</xref>) from the subordinate monkey that continue beyond the initial introduction phase (first 2&#x02013;4 weeks) can result in decreased quality of life for the subordinate animal, and the social group may be separated based on consultation with the veterinarians.</p><p>These technicians monitoring these pairs/trios are trained with a behavioral mindset to observe these animals closely for any signs of incompatibility (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). If any signs are noted, the veterinary team is notified, and the group is evaluated. The research technicians will then work together with the veterinary team to create a plan forward with the social grouping. If the study allows, there may be behavioral management interventions that can be performed to help improve the compatibility of this group, such as providing more space, moving the group to a different area in the room/different room, separating during feeding/training, providing more/different enrichment, and any veterinary treatments needed. Depending on the case, the animals may need to be separated and if the study allows, another grouping will be attempted.</p></sec><sec id="secBdot3-vetsci-11-00667"><title>Appendix B.3. Management of Pairs/Trios Enrolled in Studies</title><p>Many efforts are taken to ensure that successful pairs and trios are maintained once they have been established. Frequently, established pairs/trios can be maintained even when enrolled into studies for which single housing is an option in the IACUC protocol or in situations where one of the group members is enrolled in a study while the other is not, on a case-by-case basis. These bonded groups can be allowed to stay together during the study if recommended by the veterinarian. An established pair/trio is not separated without consultation of the facility veterinarian managing the social housing program. Sometimes social partners need to be temporarily separated while enrolled in a study to record a particular endpoint without interference from the other animal (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00667-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>).

Any significant lacerations are often caused by episodes of major contact aggression that occur overnight.
