We report the case of a 57-year-old Sri Lankan man with a one-month history of widespread ichthyosis-like plaques and scales which started on his scalp and progressed in a cranio-caudal fashion and were associated with pruritus and few blisters. Histopathology revealed features consistent with PF, and immunofluorescence studies further confirmed the diagnosis of PF. This case highlights the atypical presentation of PF resembling ichthyosis, emphasizing the need to consider autoimmune blistering diseases for unexplained scaling dermatoses. The unusual nature of PF presenting with ichthyosis-like scaly plaques highlights the need for further research.

The lesions started on his scalp and gradually spread in a cranio-caudal fashion and were itchy. The patient has no past medical history of chronic illnesses and this is his first episode. He has no known medical allergies and he does not take any medications. He works as a chauffeur for a family and he denied any sick contacts or recent infections. He also denied a history of alcohol consumption, illicit substance abuse, or smoking. Initially, he sought the opinion of different physicians but no accurate diagnosis was obtained. Physical examination revealed multiple scaly ichthyosis-like plaques on the skin distributed over his scalp, face, neck, shoulders, upper limbs, chest, abdomen, back, upper buttocks, and bilateral thighs (see Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Ectropion of the eyes was also noted (see Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Moreover, flaccid bullae were noted on the right side of his abdomen and waist as well as his right upper buttock (see Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Furthermore, his oral mucosa and examination of the nails and genitalia were unremarkable.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>(A) Multiple scaly ichthyosis-like plaques were seen on the face. (B) Chest examination showed multiple scaly ichthyosis-like plaques. (C) Ectropion of the right eye was noted which was also present on the left eye. (D) Flaccid bullae were seen on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to scaly ichthyosis-like plaques.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0016-00000074675-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Our main differential diagnoses were impending erythroderma, bullous pemphigoid (BP), PV, acquired ichthyosis, plaque PsO, and pustular&#x000a0;PsO. Under local anesthesia, we took both lesional and perilesional punch biopsies for histopathology and immunofluorescence studies, respectively. Furthermore, we prescribed oral prednisolone 60 mg once daily, and the patient started to gradually improve. Histopathological examination using hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) stain revealed features suggesting PF including subcorneal blisters with acantholysis, detached stratum corneum, and a neutrophilic cell infiltrate in the superficial layers of the epidermis. The upper dermis showed mild perivascular lymphocytic cell infiltrate with few eosinophils (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) test showed&#x000a0;fluorescent&#x000a0;epidermal&#x000a0;intercellular staining of IgG and C3&#x000a0;(see Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).&#x000a0;Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test of monkey esophagus (ME) also revealed positive&#x000a0;staining of&#x000a0;intercellular&#x000a0;deposition (see Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Finally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed a high titer of DsG1 autoantibodies measuring 184.7 which was considered positive since it was above 36. On the other hand, the titer of DsG3 autoantibodies was 17.2 which was considered negative since it was below 19. Hence, our final diagnosis was PF.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Acantholysis, detached stratum corneum, and a neutrophilic cell infiltrate in the superficial layers of the epidermis were observed with the upper dermis showing subcorneal blisters, mild perivascular lymphocytic cell infiltrate, and few eosinophils using H&#x00026;E stain.</title><p>H&#x00026;E: hematoxylin and eosin</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0016-00000074675-i02" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>(A) DIF revealed fluorescent epidermal intercellular staining of IgG and C3.

However, scaly plaques resembling ichthyosis are unusual for PF [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, a case report from the literature mentioned a rare variant of PF presenting with erythroderma resembling our case [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ichthyosis is typically characterized by generalized scaling, often due to inherited or systemic diseases rather than autoimmune [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Acquired ichthyosis, while rare, is typically associated with systemic diseases such as malignancies, infections, or metabolic disorders, which were absent in our patient [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Given this unusual presentation, our initial differential diagnoses included&#x000a0;impending erythroderma,&#x000a0;BP, PV, acquired ichthyosis, plaque PsO, and pustular PsO. Ultimately, histopathological examination and immunological studies proved essential in differentiating PF from other diagnoses. Based on the literature, histopathological features of PF include characteristic subcorneal acantholysis and neutrophilic infiltrates [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, immunofluorescence studies further solidify the diagnosis, with DIF showing epidermal&#x000a0;intercellular staining&#x000a0;of IgG and C3, a hallmark of PF, and IIF of ME confirming the presence of IgG autoantibodies from the serum [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. High levels of DsG1 autoantibodies, detected through ELISA, helped differentiate between PF and PV, as DsG3 autoantibodies were negative in our patient [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The significance of this case lies in the rarity of PF presenting in a form closely mimicking ichthyosis, which may lead to confusion, misdiagnosis, and delay in appropriate management. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis can reduce morbidity and improve outcomes. Our case highlights the importance of considering PF in patients with unexplained ichthyosis-like lesions, particularly when typical ichthyotic patterns are absent or when ichthyotic lesions are associated with pruritus and blisters. Our case contributes to the limited literature on atypical PF cases and may help guide clinicians in recognizing and diagnosing similar unusual cases in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The case of PF, which resembled ichthyosis, highlights the complexities and diagnostic challenges associated with atypical autoimmune blistering diseases. PF classically presents with superficial&#x000a0;blisters and erosions, but the patient's ichthyosis-like plaques led to the consideration of other diagnoses such as PsO and acquired ichthyosis. This case emphasizes the importance of thorough immunopathological evaluation to differentiate PF from other dermatoses. The report advocates for increased clinical awareness and consideration of autoimmune etiologies in cases of unusual scaling, especially when classic ichthyotic-like patterns and systemic associations are absent. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment and improved patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Adnan Ahmad</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Adnan Ahmad, Fatmah Al-Sughayer</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Adnan Ahmad, Manaf Shaban, Shatha Al-Roomi</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Fatmah Al-Sughayer, Manaf Shaban, Shatha Al-Roomi</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Manaf Shaban</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus: an overview of the clinical presentation, investigations and management</article-title><source>Clin Exp Dermatol</source><person-group>
