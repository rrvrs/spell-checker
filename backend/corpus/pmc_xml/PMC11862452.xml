Anxiety is also common, characterized by excessive worry or intense fear. The occurrence of these symptoms varies based on cannabis quantity, individual sensitivity, and surroundings. Although not all users experience these effects, the link between cannabis and psychotic or anxiety symptoms highlights the need for a thorough risk assessment.</p></sec><sec id="sec0648"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our goal is to analyze trends in cannabis use, as well as the psychotic and anxiety symptoms experienced by users, and to examine whether cannabis use is associated with other substances consumption.</p></sec><sec id="sec0649"><title>Methods</title><p>We collected demographic and substance consumption data from two groups: 29 individuals aged 18 to 28 who had tried cannabis at least once and 19 regular consumers through a structured questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec0650"><title>Results</title><p>Regular cannabis consumers had a higher proportion of males than those who had tried it once (<italic toggle="yes">X&#x000b2;</italic>
<sub>(1)</sub>=4.81; p=0.028). There were no significant differences in age, alcohol or tobacco consumption between the groups. Notably, regular cannabis consumers had a history of using other illegal drugs, both in the past and within the last month (<italic toggle="yes">X&#x000b2;</italic>
<sub>(1)</sub>=8.53; p=0.003). Regarding cannabis effects, regular users more frequently reported sensations like euphoria, relaxation, altered time perception, tachycardia, motor coordination difficulties, and impaired clear thinking compared to one-time users (X&#x000b2;<sub>(1)</sub>=10.12; p=0.001). Regarding anxiety symptoms during cannabis consumption, both groups experienced a similar frequency. Finally, regular cannabis consumers reported strange ideas or perceptions more often than one-time users (<italic toggle="yes">X&#x000b2;</italic>
<sub>(1)</sub>=0.743; p=0.019). However, the associated discomfort level was similar in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec0651"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights that regular cannabis use is associated with a greater likelihood of using other substances and experiencing more pronounced effects, including psychotic symptoms. However, it doesn&#x02019;t necessarily lead to increased anxiety symptoms compared to one-time users. It&#x02019;s important to acknowledge that the relationship between cannabis and psychosis is intricate and influenced by factors like consumption quantity and individual sensitivity. These findings stress the importance of understanding cannabis&#x02019;s impact on mental health and its connection to the use of other substances.</p></sec><sec id="sec0652"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
