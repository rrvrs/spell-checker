Abnormal expression of OX40 and its cognate ligand OX40L (TNFSF4) have been associated with various autoimmune diseases, indicating that blocking the OX40/OX40L pathway could be a promising strategy for the treatment of a broad range of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here, we screened and characterized a fully human anti-OX40 antibody (JY007) from a na&#x000ef;ve human scFv phage library. JY007 has an affinity constant of 7.71 nmol/L and effectively inhibited the OX40-OX40L interaction at both molecular and cellular levels, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.088 and 10.12 nmol/L, respectively. Furthermore, JY007 demonstrated the ability to deplete activated T lymphocytes through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 5.592 pmol/L. The combination of ADCC and its antagonist activity against OX40 suggests potential efficacy in suppressing inflammatory responses mediated by the OX40/OX40L pathway. Additionally, we employed molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and competitive ELISA to pinpoint the epitopes on OX40. The results revealed that JY007 binds to Pro<sup>37</sup>, Ser<sup>38</sup>, and Asp<sup>40</sup> of OX40. Interestingly, we also found that the most potent anti-OX40 antibody drug in the clinical stage, KHK4083, binds to different OX40 amino-acid residues, including Asp<sup>74</sup>, Lys<sup>82</sup>, Asp<sup>117</sup>, Ser<sup>118</sup>, Tyr<sup>119</sup>, and Lys<sup>120</sup>. This divergence suggests that the novel monoclonal antibody JY007 holds promise as a potential therapeutic option for patients with atopic dermatitis and may find broad applications in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42995-025-00284-y.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Atopic dermatitis</kwd><kwd>OX40</kwd><kwd>Phage display</kwd><kwd>Fully human antibody</kwd><kwd>Computer simulation</kwd><kwd>Epitope scanning</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Ocean University of China 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Atopic dermatitis (AD), one of the most common skin diseases, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by recurrent erythema, pruritus, eczematous lesions, skin thickening, and inflammation (Badloe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Studies have reported a rising incidence and prevalence of clinically diagnosed atopic dermatitis in recent decades, significantly impacting the quality of life for 15%-30% of children and 2%-10% of adults worldwide (Laughter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The development, progression, and chronicity of AD are understood to be influenced by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Factors such as the disruption of the epidermal barrier, pruritus, skin inflammation, and immune deregulation also contribute to the complex etiology of this condition (Bonamonte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>). AD is recognized as a bidirectional T-cell-mediated disease, with Th2 cells primarily involved in the acute and chronic stages, while Th1 cells contribute to the inflammatory response that affects the chronicity of the disease (Kader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2021</xref>). The dysregulation of these immune responses can lead to the onset and persistence of AD symptoms.</p><p id="Par4">OX40, also known as CD134 or TNFRSF4, belongs to the TNFR superfamily and is highly expressed in activated T cells (Calderhead et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1993</xref>). OX40 has a single identified ligand, OX40L (also known as CD252 or TNFSF4), which is expressed primarily on activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as endothelial cells, dendritic cells, and activated B cells (Ohshima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1997</xref>). Upon engagement of OX40 with OX40L, downstream intracellular pathways in T cells are triggered, leading to the transcriptional activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2008</xref>; Vanamee and Faustman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>). Consequently, OX40 signaling activates CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and controls immune responses during various stages of T cell activation (So and Ishii <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). However, upregulation of OX40-OX40L can cause excessive activation and harm to the inhibitory function of Tregs, leading to immune dysfunction and facilitating the onset of autoimmune diseases (Webb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>), including bowel disease, asthma, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Notably, the overexpression of OX40 in atopic dermatitis has garnered significant attention (Furue and Furue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>; Le and Torres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the development of potential novel therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the OX40 on activated T cells for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. For example, GBR 830 (Guttman-Yassky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>), a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody developed by Glenmark, blocks the interactions between OX40 and OX40L to inhibit T cell-mediated immune responses. Another promising candidate is rocatinlimab (formerly KHK4083) (Nakagawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>), a fully humanized anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody that has entered clinical trials. Rocatinlimab has shown the ability to inhibit the OX40-OX40L pathway to suppress the activation and proliferation of effector T cells and reduce the number of activated OX40<sup>+</sup> T cells by ADCC. Clinical trials have demonstrated the significant reduction of symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis treated with these antibodies, highlighting the effectiveness of OX40-targeting antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases like AD. Despite the promising results, some patients may not respond to treatment or discontinue it due to side effects (Guttman-Yassky et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Moreover, prolonged use of monoclonal antibody-based drugs may lead to the development of drug resistance in patients (Brand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>; Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Based on the challenges above, our study utilized a na&#x000ef;ve human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) phage library to screen and characterize anti-OX40 antibodies. Among the identified antibodies, JY007, a fully human antibody targeting human OX40 and binding to distinct epitopes compared to rocatinlimab, exhibited comparable binding and functional activities. These findings suggest the potential of JY007 as a novel drug candidate for treating atopic dermatitis (AD) and other T-cell-mediated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Screening of a human scFv phage display library against OX40</title><p id="Par7">A na&#x000ef;ve human scFv phage display library (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup> pfu/mL) was obtained from Jingyuan Biosciences (Suzhou) Co., Ltd.

In particular, the binding of JY007 to these mutants was less affected, except OX40-5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;3). These data indicated that the epitope binding regions of JY007 and KHK4083 on OX40 are different. Next, we used molecular modeling to explore the binding mode of JY007 or KHK4083, targeting OX40. In the OX40-JY007 and OX40-KHK4083 binding models (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E and F), the two antibodies, JY007 and KHK4083, both occupy the OX40L binding site, but the two themselves are non-competitive, consistent with the competition experiments mentioned above (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). To further validate the 3D model of OX40-JY007, we evaluated the binding of JY007 to OX40 mutations, including Ser<sup>38</sup> and ASP<sup>40</sup>. The binding of JY007 to these mutations was dramatically reduced compared to its binding to wild-type OX40. In contrast, the binding of KHK4083 to these mutants was less affected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;3; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;3). By combining the computer simulations and experiments above, we have established a binding model for JY007 against OX40, which provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent development of novel antibodies against OX40.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Epitope scanning for hotspot identification and model docking. <bold>A</bold> Epitope scanning.

Therefore, an agonistic mAb targeting co-stimulating receptor OX40 on T cells, one of the most promising targets, could promote an antitumor immune response by inducing tumor anti-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses and decreasing immunosuppressive regulatory T cells in vivo (Ruby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>). Stimulation of OX40 has been shown to increase antigen-specific effector T cell responses and patient-specific memory T cell production for therapeutic immunization strategies in cancer to prolong patient survival (Weinberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2000</xref>; Sadun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">By contrast, an antagonistic antibody against OX40 on T cells may suppress autoantigen-specific T cell responses and reduce immune activities in autoimmunity diseases by blocking OX40 signaling. Some studies have shown that in vivo blockade of OX40 signaling specifically suppresses the function of recently activated autoantigen-specific T cells, resulting in inhibition of autoimmune disease without severe immunosuppression (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Malmstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2001</xref>; Nohara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2001</xref>). Current OX40-based antibody therapy for moderate or severe atopic dermatitis has demonstrated remarkable success (Le and Torres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2022</xref>; Newsom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). Nevertheless, there have been instances where patients have withdrawn from clinical trials due to adverse reactions associated with the use of these antibody drugs (Guttman-Yassky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Furthermore, prolonged exposure to monoclonal antibody drugs can lead to the development of drug resistance, thus limiting their effectiveness (Moccia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>; Martinez-Navio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new anti-OX40 antagonist antibody to meet the increasing medical demands of patients.</p><p id="Par37">In this study, we screened a na&#x000ef;ve human scFv phage library against OX40 and discovered that scFv antibody A8 exhibits a high affinity for OX40 and effectively blocks the OX40-OX40L interaction. Research demonstrated that a bivalent immunoglobulin G (IgG) format can improve scFv antibody particular effector function, half-life, and avidity (Sterner and Zehetmeier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>), so we constructed an IgG1 antibody based on the genes of A8 VH and A8 VL and named it JY007 for further research. Our findings showed that JY007 binds to OX40 with high affinity, approximately 3 times higher than the scFv format, likely due to its conventional bivalent format.</p><p id="Par38">In patients with atopic dermatitis, OX40 is highly expressed in damaged skin and is associated with antigen-specific T cells (Cavanagh and Hussell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>), and the OX40L-OX40 axis plays a role in the sustained activation and expansion of effector T cells and effector memory T cells, which can have lasting effects on immune function (Furue and Furue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). Our results demonstrated that JY007 has comparable activities to KHK4083, with strong blocking activity against OX40 signaling and the ability to induce OX40<sup>+</sup> T cells depletion. This suggests the potential efficacy of JY007 in treating patients with atopic dermatitis caused by unregulated OX40 signaling.</p><p id="Par39">Molecular docking has become a fast alternative for studying the molecular basis of antigen&#x02013;antibody interactions (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>). Docking methods can be classified into two categories according to the sampling strategy applied during the simulation. The first class includes exhaustive searches for different antigen&#x02013;antibody conformations without using knowledge of interface residues, the so-called ab initio docking algorithm and methods. The second includes data-driven docking algorithms that use predicted or experimentally determined epistasis and parity constraints to guide the search process (Ambrosetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). In our study, we performed data-driven docking to predict the structural interfaces between OX40 and JY007 or KHK4083. These predictions were based on functional assays of JY007, competitive ELISA between JY007 and KHK4083, and alanine scanning data. Interestingly, we found that JY007 binds to Pro<sup>37</sup>, Ser<sup>38</sup>, and Asp<sup>40</sup> residues of OX40; whereas, KHK4083 binds to Asp<sup>74</sup>, Lys<sup>82</sup>, Asp<sup>117</sup>, Ser<sup>118</sup>, Tyr<sup>119</sup>, and Lys<sup>120</sup> residues. These results indicated that JY007 and KHK4083 target different epitopes on OX40. The function of JY007 provided a solution for the drug resistance caused by KHK4083 in AD therapy, providing more choices for AD patients. In further studies, JY007 will be further evaluated through animal experiments to assess its therapeutic effect on atopic dermatitis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="42995_2025_284_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 1626 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Zhen Li and Lin Liu These authors contributed equally to this work and shared co-first authorship.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jingyuan Biosciences (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. for providing the na&#x000ef;ve human scFv phage library.
