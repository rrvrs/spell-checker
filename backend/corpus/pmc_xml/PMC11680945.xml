Therefore, this study aimed to assess help-seeking intention for mental illness and associated factors among Dessie town residents, Northeast Ethiopia, 2021. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 501 Dessie town residents. The data were collected by face-to-face interview. The General Help Seeking Questionnaire was used to assess help-seeking intention. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis techniques were used. Finally, a statistically significant level was declared at a p-value less than 0.05. Among 501 participants, 67.5% were likely to seek help from health professionals. Being female (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.695, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.63&#x02013; 13.50), being single (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.330, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.12&#x02013;0.89), and having good knowledge (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.030, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.25&#x02013;7.35) were significantly associated with help-seeking intention. This study indicated that the participants&#x02019; help-seeking intention was inadequate. Sex, marital status, monthly income, and knowledge of mental illness were found to be associated with help-seeking intentions for mental illnesses. Therefore, community healthcare workers, healthcare administrators, and religious and community leaders should work to enhance the help-seeking intention of the community.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Help-seeking intention</kwd><kwd>Mental illness</kwd><kwd>Dessie Town residents</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Psychology</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Psychiatric disorders</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par16">Mental health problems are increasingly prevalent, affecting approximately 450&#x000a0;million people worldwide, and the impact of these problems is significant on an individual and the national level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. According to the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO) Global Burden of Disease Collaborator study, mental health disorders are known to represent two of the ten prominent causes of disability and account for 35.6% of the total burden of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Mental illnesses affect the social, economic, academic, occupational, and recreational aspects of the functionalities of victims, family members, caregivers, and the whole community.</p><p id="Par17">Professional help-seeking intention refers to an individual&#x02019;s perceived likelihood of seeking assistance from health professionals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Mental health help-seeking intentions are an adaptive coping mechanism where individuals attempt to obtain external help if they believe they are mentally ill. This response typically involves consulting a doctor, mental health professional, psychologist, or social worker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It can be influenced by factors such as personal beliefs, social norms, perceived illness severity, and the accessibility of health services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> The mental health literacy of the community can also directly affect the help-seeking intention for mental illness from health professionals. People with good mental health literacy have better help-seeking intentions and vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Despite a variety of management options available, around two-thirds of people with a known mental disorder worldwide do not seek help from health professionals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A research review conducted in developing countries indicates that supernatural causes of mental disorders are more widely believed and traditional sources of help, such as spiritual healers, are preferred over medical advice for a variety of mental health problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">A study conducted in Rwanda revealed that only 36.0% of participants received help from a healthcare unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Another study done in Butajira, Ethiopia, also shows only 41% of the society preferred seeking help from health institutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A study conducted in Jimma town also showed that the most frequently visited source of help was the informal help sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, a study conducted at the holy water site of Gebremenfes Kidus Church, Ethiopia, showed that most of the respondents had help-seeking behavior from traditional forms of help like religious leaders, holy water sprinkling, and individuals who believed to have a special power of knowing mental illness and prescribing traditional treatment for mental illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">In the study area, many healthcare institutions are providing mental health services. However, evidence-based data are scarce regarding the status of the help-seeking intention of the community for mental illnesses and mental health service utilization in Dessie town and Northeast Ethiopia at large.

In the second stage, four kebeles (two from each selected sub-city) were also selected by the lottery method. Thirdly, based on their household size, a proportional allocation of the sample was done to each selected kebele. Finally, the households were selected using a systematic random sampling technique in every 18th household (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The first household was selected randomly and continued every 18th interval until the required sample was obtained. One of the adults in each household was included in this study.

It also identified different factors significantly associated with the help-seeking intention.</p><p id="Par57">The study found that 67.5% (95% CI of 63.3-71.7%) of the respondents had the intention to seek help for mental illness from health professionals. This finding was supported by two community-based cross-sectional studies conducted in Aykel town<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and Gondar Zuria District<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> of Ethiopia, which found that 71.2% and 63.8% of participants had an intent to seek help from any health professionals. This similarity might be because of using a similar assessment tool (GHSQ), similarity in study design, and similarities in study participants&#x02019; socioeconomic and demographic as well as religious characteristics. The healthcare system is also similar among the study areas.</p><p id="Par58">This finding was higher than two community-based studies done in Jimma town<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and Seka Chekorsa district of Jimma zone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Ethiopia, which found that only 49.4% and 38.8% of the participants sought help for common mental health problems, respectively. This difference might be due to differences in sample size, data collection tool (the Jimma town study used the Actual Help Seeking Questionnaire), and participants&#x02019; differences, in which 33.6% of Jimma town study participants were mentally ill and the Seka Chekorsa study participants were rural residents.

This discrepancy might be due to the differences in the general population of the four countries and differences in sample size. The Rwanda study was done among two population groups. The Greek study used the Inventory of Attitude towards Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS) tool, and the majority of the participants were females. The other reason might also be the differences in study design, in which the Swiss study was a retrospective follow-up study involving mainly adults in the age group of 16&#x02013;40 years and mentally ill patients.</p><p id="Par60">On the other hand, this study&#x02019;s finding was lower than studies conducted in Mertule Mariam town, Ethiopia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, in which 81.5% of respondents had a help-seeking intention from healthcare workers; a cross-sectional survey study conducted in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> among a rural adult population that revealed approximately 80% of the participants were willing to seek psychological help if needed; and a study conducted in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which reported 85.9% of participants would seek help from formal sources. The possible reasons for this difference might be socio-demographic and cultural variations among participants, sample size, data collection tool, and methodological differences. The health literacy of the Chinese and Japanese might be higher than Ethiopians. The healthcare system might also be better in China and Japan compared to Ethiopia.</p><p id="Par61">Variables that had a significant association with help-seeking intention for mental illness from health professionals were female sex, being single, monthly income of &#x02265;&#x02009;1201 ETB, and good knowledge of mental illness.</p><p id="Par62">Female respondents were 4.7 times more likely to have mental health help seeking intention for mental illness compared to males. This finding was in line with studies conducted in Ethiopia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which demonstrated that being female was a positive predictor of help-seeking intention. This consistency might be because of similarities in study design, analysis method, and assessment tool (GHSQ). The other possible reasons might be more positive attitudes concerning psychological openness in women compared to men, as well as gender-role differences where men&#x02019;s traditionally advantaged social status and greater power may make it more difficult to seek help for mental health issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, culturally, men&#x02019;s masculinity is demonstrated through power, dominance, self-control, and self-reliance, in which expressions of psychological distress, and related help-seeking behaviors might be regarded as a lack of masculinity.</p><p id="Par63">Participants who were single in marital status were 67% less likely to seek help for mental illness from health professionals compared to single once. This finding was supported by the studies conducted in Ethiopia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, in which married participants had significantly more positive help-seeking intentions for mental disorders than single ones. This consistency might be due to similarity in study design. However, this finding was inconsistent with two Ethiopian studies conducted in Aykel town<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and Mertule-Mariam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and the study conducted in the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which revealed participants who were not in a relationship had greater help-seeking intention. The possible reasons for this inconsistency might be sample size variation (both studies used a larger sample size than the current study), and the Aykel town study was aimed to assess help-seeking intention for depression only. The other reason for the decreased intention to seek help for mental illness from health professionals among single participants might be that a single person could not get any parental, familial, or spouse role of advising, pushing, helping, or supporting to seek help for mental illness from health professionals.</p><p id="Par64">Participants who had a monthly income of &#x02265;&#x02009;1201 ETB were 3.23 times more likely to seek help for mental illness compared to participants who had a monthly income of &#x02264;&#x02009;750 ETB. This study finding is supported by the study conducted in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which demonstrated lower income was associated with decreased likelihood of help-seeking intentions. This is because people who have enough money might have access to different media and other information and can be able to get help from health professionals. A person whose income is good can also afford healthcare costs.</p><p id="Par65">Furthermore, respondents who had good knowledge were 3.03 times more likely to seek help from healthcare professionals compared to those who had poor knowledge. This finding was supported by studies conducted in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, England<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and four European region populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> that higher or better mental health knowledge was a positive predictor of help-seeking intention. This might be because a person with a higher level of knowledge can recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness early and can understand the benefits of mental health treatments and options. A person with good mental health knowledge can also avoid the embarrassment of seeking help for mental illness from healthcare professionals.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p id="Par66">This was the first study in Northeast Ethiopia, particularly in Dessie town, which reported the residents&#x02019; intent to seek mental health help and associated factors. The study had an adequate sample size, which was representative of the population and supports the generalizability of the findings. However, the study had limitations. One of the possible limitations of this study could be its cross-sectional nature, in which it does not show a cause-and-effect relationship. Social desirability biases may also exist, leading respondents to report more socially desirable responses that may not accurately reflect real-life experiences. The other limitations might also be related to the interview techniques, and variables with a p-value&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.25 were not included in the analytical approach. There might also be recall bias for some variables from participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Implications and feature direction</title><p id="Par67">Despite the availability of many healthcare facilities that are providing mental health services, the mental health help-seeking intention of Dessie town residents is still inadequate. This implies different strategies have to be designed and implemented to enhance the mental health help-seeking intention of the community.</p><p id="Par68">Regarding clinical and community practices, implementing gender-based interventions, mental health education programs, and utilizing different peer support models are important to enhancing the community help-seeking intention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par69">Policymakers should also develop mental health awareness campaigns targeting urban and rural populations, integrate mental health services with primary healthcare facilities, and support mental health research projects with adequate funding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par70">Because this research has limitations, future research, such as longitudinal studies, which can explore cause-and-effect relationships, and qualitative studies, which can investigate barriers to mental health help-seeking intention, like cultural influences from the community, healthcare workers, and health managers&#x02019; perspectives, is required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion and recommendations</title><p id="Par71">The findings of our study indicate that only two-thirds (67.5%) of the participants had an intent to seek help for mental illnesses, which indicates the mental health help-seeking intent of Dessie town residents was inadequate. This result is even lower than the findings of some of the previous studies done in Ethiopia. Additionally, being female, having a monthly income of &#x02265;&#x02009;1200 ETB, and having good knowledge were found to be positively associated with the participants&#x02019; mental health help-seeking intention. On the other hand, being single in marital status was found to be negatively associated with help-seeking intentions for mental illnesses.</p><p id="Par72">Therefore, health practitioners, community healthcare workers, healthcare administrators, religious and community leaders, and other stakeholders should consider implementing strategies to increase mental health knowledge and mental health literacy through face-to-face trainings for the community and primary health workers, national and local level community and school based campaigns, use of technologies such as online delivery of trainings and consultations, and dissemination of information via printed and audio-visual materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> to enhance the mental health help-seeking intention of the community. Integrating mental health literacy in the educational system has also a positive effect on the help-seeking intention for mental health problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. There should also be activities to improve economic burden of the community help seeking intention for mental illness. The government and other stakeholders shall subsidize mental health services and expand health insurance coverages, improving employment opportunities and income security, and support community based mental health initiatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AOR</term><def><p id="Par2">Adjusted Odd Ratios</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATSPPHS</term><def><p id="Par3">Attitude towards Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par4">Confidence Interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMD</term><def><p id="Par5">Common Mental Disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COR</term><def><p id="Par6">Crude Odd Ratios</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GBD</term><def><p id="Par7">Global Burden of Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GHSQ</term><def><p id="Par8">General Help-Seeking Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICCMH</term><def><p id="Par9">Integrated Clinical and Community Mental Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LAMICs</term><def><p id="Par10">Low and Middle-Income Countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAKS</term><def><p id="Par11">Mental Health Knowledge Schedule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RIBS</term><def><p id="Par12">Reported and Intended Behavior Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p id="Par13">Statistical Package for Social Science Studies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSOSHS</term><def><p id="Par14">Self-Stigma of Seeking Help Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par15">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Wollo University for giving us ethical clearance and other necessary cooperation letters to conduct this research.</p><p>We also would like to thank the Dessie Town Administration health department and its staff members and different stakeholders for their cooperation in giving us the necessary documents and information.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Habtam G and HG contributed to the conception of the study.
