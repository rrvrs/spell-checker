NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver damage starting with liver steatosis and lipid disorders presented as the hallmark. Cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R) is the receptor of endocannabinoids mainly expressed in immune cells. Our preliminary study revealed the preventative role of CB2R in liver injury related to lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of CB2R in NAFLD and the underlying mechanism related to microbial community. High-fat diet-induced NAFLD model was established in mice. We found that hepatic CB2R expression was significantly reduced in NAFLD mice and CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice fed with normal chow. Interestingly, cohousing with or transplanted with&#x000a0;microbiota from WT mice, or treatment with an antibiotic cocktail ameliorated the NAFLD phenotype of CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice. The gut dysbiosis in CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice including increased Actinobacteriota and decreased Bacteroidota was similar to that of NAFLD patients and NAFLD mice. Microbial functional analysis and metabolomics profiling revealed obviously disturbed tryptophan metabolism in NAFLD patients and NAFLD mice, which were also seen in CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice. Correlation network showed that the disordered tryptophan metabolites such as indolelactic acid (ILA) and xanthurenic acid in CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice were mediated by gut dysbiosis and related to NAFLD severity indicators. In vitro and in vivo validation experiments showed that the enriched tryptophan metabolites ILA aggravated NAFLD phenotypes. These results demonstrate the involvement of CB2R in NAFLD, which is related to gut microbiota-mediated tryptophan metabolites. Our findings highlight CB2R and the associated microbes and tryptophan metabolites as promising targets for the treatment of NAFLD.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</kwd><kwd>cannabinoid-2 receptor</kwd><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>tryptophan metabolites</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Pharmacological Society 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver damage starting with liver steatosis and lipid disorders presented as the hallmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nowadays, approximately 25% of the world&#x02019;s population is living with NAFLD. The growing worldwide epidemic during the past decades led NAFLD to become the most rapidly growing contributor of liver mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. And it has already been one of the most common etiologies for liver transplantation in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, there still no approved therapies for NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The unclear molecular mechanisms that cause the initiation and progression of NAFLD challenged the drug development.</p><p id="Par3">Endocannabinoids are lipid mediators that interact with G protein-coupled receptors cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) and cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CB1R is highly expressed in the central nervous system and much lower in peripheral tissues including the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It was widely recognized that the endocannabinoid/CB1R system became overactive in metabolic syndrome including NAFLD, leading to increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, the CB1R antagonists were once being promising clinical candidates for treating metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the psychiatric side effects halted the developing of CB1R blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In contrast, CB2R is mainly expressed in peripheral tissues with immune functions and play critical roles in inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our preliminary study revealed the preventive role of CB2R in liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Unexpectedly, the metabolomics analysis related it to lipid metabolism. These findings enlightened us that the CB2R might be involved in diseases featured by lipid disorders like NAFLD, spurring us to explore the underlying mechanism of CB2R in modulating lipid metabolism.</p><p id="Par4">Over the past decades, the critical role of gut microbiota in NAFLD has been increasingly recognized. The impact of gut microbiota on lipid metabolism was extensively investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. And the modulating role of gut bacterial community on host lipid metabolism was relied on a wide variety of microbial metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Altered microbes were associated with liver steatosis in NAFLD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Gut microbiota and their metabolites controlled the absorption, emulsification, solubilization, synthesis, transportation and catabolism of lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Restoration microbial community by probiotics reversed the dyslipidemia and liver steatosis of NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Due to the well-established role of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism, it is inevitable to explore the possible relationships between CB2R and gut dysbiosis in NAFLD development.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we aimed to reveal the role of CB2R in NAFLD using high-fat diet (HFD)-induced model mice and CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Meanwhile, the potential correlation between CB2R and gut dysbiosis in NAFLD was investigated by structural and functional analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, metabolomics approaches and correlation network were performed, and validation experiments were conducted to explore the underlying mechanism mediating the impact of CB2R on NAFLD development. Our study might provide novel insight for endocannabinoids system on NAFLD in the perspective of CB2R and suggest promising targets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human samples</title><p id="Par6">Serum and fecal samples for further 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were obtained from the NAFLD patients who visited the liver clinic and were diagnosed with fatty liver disease at Xiangya Hospital during June 1, 2022 and June 1, 2023.

Interestingly, microbiota transplantation from WT mice ameliorated the NAFLD phenotype of CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice. Further, we revealed that the microbial structure including the increased Actinobacteriota and decreased Bacteroidota of CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice was resemble to that of NAFLD patients and model mice. Notably, the microbial functional analysis and metabolomics profiling results together pointed out obviously disturbed tryptophan metabolism in NAFLD patients and mice, which were also exhibited in CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Correlation network presented that the disordered tryptophan metabolites such as ILA and Xa were modulated by gut dysbiosis and related to NAFLD severity indicators of obesity, oil red positive area, serum AST and liver TG content. Treatment with enriched tryptophan metabolites, especially ILA, aggravated hepatic steatosis in the in vitro and in vivo model of NAFLD. These results demonstrated the crucial role of CB2R in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. And the underlying mechanisms were linked to gut microbiota-mediated perturbed tryptophan metabolism. Our novel findings suggested CB2R and the associated microbes and tryptophan metabolites as promising targets for NAFLD.</p><p id="Par43">The present study showed that CB2R expression was obviously decreased in NAFLD mice. And CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice developed NAFLD even feeding with NCD. CB2R was widely recognized in the modulation of inflammatory process, while it has been acting as an underappreciated aspect of eCB signaling in metabolic disorders. The role of the endocannabinoid system in metabolic diseases was long-term known mainly attributed to the CB1R. For example, it was reported that the heightened eCB/CB1R activity was related to the susceptibility of metabolic diseases among racial groups. Studies demonstrated that the CB1R overactivity contributed to hepatic steatosis. Therefore, CB1Rs was considered as a promising clinical target for the treatment of metabolic disorders especially NAFLD which lacking FDA-approved drugs. However, the adverse psychiatric effects of CB1R antagonists discontinued the developing of CB1R blockers. Functional studies indicated opposing effects of CB2R and CB1R in liver fibrosis, whereas the role of CB2R in hepatic steatosis was unknown. In this study, we revealed that mice lacking CB2R developed NAFLD, supporting that the depletion of CB2R promoted NAFLD progression. These results recommended that selective modulation of CB2R signaling may provide novel insights for the treatment of NAFLD.</p><p id="Par44">Here, we uncovered the microbial community of CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice including the high abundance of Actinobacteriota and <italic>Blautia</italic>, and the low abundance of Bacteroidota and <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic> was similar to the trend of NAFLD patients and mice. Plenty of studies demonstrated the causative role of the dysbiotic gut microbiota in the development of NAFLD. In line with our results, the increased Actinobacteriota and decreased Bacteroidota were also reported in NAFLD models and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. And the depleted <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic> and <italic>Eubacterium xylanophilum</italic> levels&#x000a0;observed in our CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice were shown to be negatively correlated to HFD-induced biochemical and pathological indexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The supplementation of <italic>Blautia</italic> caused liver inflammation and fibrosis and promoted the progression of NAFLD in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Whereases, the underlying mechanisms by which NAFLD induced gut dysbiosis has not yet been figured out. The phenomenon that CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice housed with WT mice ameliorated NAFLD phenotypes in our study indicated that CB2R mediated the NAFLD-associated microbial signatures. Actually, the modulating role of eCB signaling in gut microbiota has been reported in inflammatory diseases such as ARDS, colitis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and HIV/SIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Interestingly, the microbial similarity of CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice and NAFLD model mice seems to prevent FMT colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and CB2R<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice transplanted microbiota from NAFLD mice did&#x000a0;not aggravate NAFLD phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#x02013;e</xref>). Accordingly, our novel findings revealed that one of the mechanisms by which CB2R contributed to NAFLD development was through regulating gut microbiota.</p><p id="Par45">The microbial functional analysis noted that CB2R modulated the microbial activity in tryptophan metabolism, which was supported by metabolomics findings. The endocannabinoid signaling system was considered as an important regulator of energy homeostasis. The mechanisms by which endocannabinoid signaling modulates metabolism especially lipid metabolism have been partially investigated. On the one hand, endocannabinoids are bioactive fatty acid amides and esters in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For instance, 2-arachidonoylglycerol which is the most abundant endocannabinoid, was known as an endogenous lipid signaling mediator and its immediate metabolite arachidonic acid was an essential fatty acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. On the other hand, anandamide, another endocannabinoid, was reported to increase adipocyte differentiation partially through inducing PPAR-&#x003b3; gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Since both 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide were effective ligands of CB2R, the above-mentioned mechanisms failed to explain the reason why depletion of CB2R promoted NAFLD development. Considering the relevance of eCB system and microbial metabolites in the manipulation of metabolic process, our findings indicated the tryptophan metabolites might be the critical effector of CB2R in facilitating NAFLD development.</p><p id="Par46">Furthermore, the correlation network linked the significantly enriched tryptophan metabolites including ILA and Xa to NAFLD severity parameters of obesity and oil red positive area in CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice. And these perturbed metabolites were associated with the increased Actinobacteriota genera and decreased <italic>Eubacterium xylanophilum</italic>. A large array of metabolites drives the interaction between gut microbiota and the host. Among which, the tryptophan metabolites were the most studied categories. Tryptophan was&#x000a0;directly converted into indole and its derivatives such as ILA, which were directly controlled by intestinal microorganisms. Previous in vitro experiment revealed that Actinobacteriota genus produced ILA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Here, we noticed the linkage between disordered Actinobacteriota genera and enriched ILA in CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice. As one of the indole derivatives, ILA was considered to be almost harmless in previous studies of inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Similar to ILA, Xa modulated by gut microbiota was another AhR ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These typtophan metabolites could maintain immune homeostasis of the intestine, skin and tumor microenvironment in an AhR-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, patients and mice with metabolic syndromes including NAFLD were characterized by increased ILA and Xa as reported in our or previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Recent researches in metabolic diseases showed that enhancing AhR expression promoted obesity and insulin resistance. And activating hepatic AhR signaling led to liver steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Based on these findings, we speculated that the microbial mediated-ILA and Xa enrichment might promote NAFLD development in CB2R<sup>-/-</sup> mice via activating AhR.</p><p id="Par47">There were still several limitations in our study. Firstly, this study mainly focused on the role of CB2R in the metabolic disorders of NAFLD, whether CB2R depletion affect the inflammatory process especially in the progressive NASH stage required further investigation. Secondly, the concrete mechanism by which CB2R modulated gut microbiota deserved systematic researches. And the essential role of tryptophan metabolites in CB2R-mediated NAFLD development should be validated. Lastly, it is worth exploring the putative influence of CB2R upon CB1R signaling during NAFLD progression.</p><p id="Par48">In conclusion, a major finding of our study was that the depletion of CB2R contributed to NAFLD progression via modulating gut microbiome. We suggested tryptophan metabolites as microbial messengers to be involved in CB2R-mediated NAFLD development. These novel findings highlighted the role of CB2R in metabolic process and revealed the modulating effect CB2R in microbial community of NAFLD. This CB2R-microbiome-tryptophan metabolites axis might open a new avenue for cannabinoid system-based therapeutics to prevent and treat NAFLD. However, more clinical investigations are essential to validate this concept.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
