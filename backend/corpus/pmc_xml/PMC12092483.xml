The present study aimed to test whether the binding between a distractor and a response is influenced by self-relevance, too. We assumed that targets&#x02019; self-relevance should increase executive control processes and therefore reduce the influence of distractors on current performance. In a distractor&#x02013;response-binding (DRB) task, which measures the strength of binding between distractor stimuli and responses, we varied target relevance so that participants responded to targets that either were or were not self-relevant. Our design made it possible to measure DRB effects for both relevance conditions separately. DRB effects were diminished if targets were self-relevant compared to when they were not. These results expand our understanding of the influence of self-relevance on cognitive performance. The influence of self-relevance is not purely perceptual (Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>, <italic>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 38</italic>[5], 1105&#x02013;1117), but also found in higher-order processes such as executive control. Moreover, whereas for different paradigms binding advantages of self-relevance are assumed (Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015a</xref>, <italic>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</italic>, <italic>19</italic>[12], 719&#x02013;728; Humphreys &#x00026; Sui, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>,&#x000a0;<italic>Cognitive Neuroscience,&#x000a0;7</italic>[1/4], 5&#x02013;17), this study identifies an important boundary condition, in that distractor&#x02013;response binding is reduced by target self-relevance.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Self-relevance</kwd><kwd>Cognitive control</kwd><kwd>Executive control</kwd><kwd>Distractor&#x02013;response binding&#x000a0;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;t des Saarlandes (1036)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="Par2">Distracting stimuli are everywhere in the environment that surrounds us. When pursuing an action goal, stimuli that do not contribute to this goal or even interfere with it can (at least temporarily) be seen as distractors. In many theories of attention and executive control, it is assumed that not only are targets amplified, but distractors are suppressed in order to achieve goal-directed behaviour (Gaspelin &#x00026; Luck, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>; Neumann &#x00026; DeSchepper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1991</xref>; Sawaki &#x00026; Luck, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>; Tipper &#x00026; Cranston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1985</xref>). Yet, irrespective of whether a distractor is suppressed, it can still impact upon action control via binding and retrieval (Frings, Rothermund, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>; Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Giesen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>) found that in a distractor&#x02013;response binding task, distractors are bound to target responses; thus, subsequent presentation of the distractor stimuli can cause retrieval of these target responses irrespective of the amount of interference the distractors could elicit during prime integration. This can be advantageous if irrelevant features have a predictive effect on the occurrence of relevant features; hence it seems functional that our cognitive system exploits these contingencies via distractor-based retrieval mechanisms (Miller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1987</xref>; Wiswede et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Distractor processing can be modulated by several aspects. There are numerous instances in the literature that show that distractor processing and distractor suppression, in particular, are modulated by context. For example, valent distractors might attract more attention than non-valent distractors and are harder to ignore (Frings, Rothermund, et al.,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>;&#x000a0;Frings, Wentura, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>; Wentura et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). Distractors that are associated with current concerns or needs receive more attention and again are harder to ignore (Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>), whereas distractors presented at predictable locations are easier to ignore (Wang &#x00026; Theeuwes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>). Stress, on the other hand, can make target selection more effective, such that distractors lose their ability to draw attention (Chajut &#x00026; Algom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>; Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Here we focus on a particularly powerful modulating context factor, namely self-relevance. In the recent literature, it has been suggested that self-relevance&#x000a0;has an impact on selection processes by enhancing executive control (Golubickis &#x00026; Macrae, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2023</xref>; Svensson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2023</xref>). Specifically, in a series of Stroop experiments, Dignath et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2022</xref>) found less interference from response-incompatible stimuli if participants were primed with self-relevant stimuli. In another study it could be shown that persons can inhibit a response to a self-relevant item (operationalized by whether an item belongs to the person himself or to another person) better after a stop signal than to a non-self-relevant item (Golubickis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2021</xref>). Also, Golubickis and Macrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>) found that self-relevant targets cancelled out the impact of distractors entirely. In their experiment, participants were presented with an item deemed to be &#x0201c;owned&#x0201d; by them and an item deemed to be &#x0201c;owned&#x0201d; by a friend; their task was to judge whether target stimuli belonged to them or the friend. These target stimuli were surrounded by distractors that were either compatible with the target (i.e., distractors and targets were identical), neutral (the distractor was not owned by either person) or incompatible (the distractor was owned by a person who does not own the target). They found a flanker-interference effect when the target was related to the other person, but no such effect when the target was self-relevant. In other words, (incompatible) flanking distractors just had an influence when the targets were not self-relevant. The overarching conclusion drawn from this research is that self-relevance can influence top-down mechanisms like executive control processes.</p><p id="Par5">Given this backdrop, we were interested in whether distractor&#x02013;response binding (DRB; Frings, Rothermund, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007a</xref>) is modulated by self-relevance. The DRB task is a paradigm rooted in action control research. It has been suggested that in sequential tasks that have a prime-probe structure, features of all stimuli (including distractors) are bound to the response (the <italic>binding</italic> part, resulting in an event file; Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Then, if a feature is repeated in the next display, the entire previous episode or event file is retrieved (the <italic>retrieval</italic> part), which in turn modulates response execution. If a distractor is repeated in a sequential paradigm, it facilitates performance if the required response is repeated as well, but hampers performance if the response changes between prime and probe displays. Similarly, when a distractor changes between prime and probe displays, performance is facilitated when the required response changes, too. It is hampered if the response has to be repeated.</p><p id="Par6">The <italic>Binding and Retrieval in Action Control</italic> framework (BRAC; Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>), assumes that binding and retrieval can be separately influenced by top-down and bottom-up mechanisms (see also Hommel &#x00026; Wiers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>), which also applies for distractor&#x02013;response binding. Several studies have yet shown an influence of bottom-up processes on distractor&#x02013;response binding. For example, grouping by color (Laub et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>) or by stimulus intensity (Laub &#x00026; Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2021</xref>) impacts distractor binding. When distractors and targets are grouped, distractor integration is enhanced. Recently, it was also shown that figure-ground mechanisms influence DRB effects (Schmalbrock &#x00026; Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">We propose that self-relevance is an additional factor that will have an impact on DRB, assuming that self-relevance increases executive control and thereby diminishes the impact of distractors in a top-down manner. If a target is self-relevant, distractor processing should decrease, which in turn should result in the reduction (or even absence) of DRB effects.</p><p id="Par8">We run a variant of the DRB task in which participants responded to pronouns that were either self-relevant (e.g., &#x0201c;I&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;myself&#x0201d;) or not self-relevant (e.g., &#x0201c;he&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;she&#x0201d;). Pronouns were presented on shapes that were irrelevant to the task&#x02014;these were the distractors. We used eight different pronouns (four of them self-relevant) mapped onto four response keys. Our assignment of pronouns to response keys made it possible to orthogonally vary distractor and response repetition between prime and probe separately within each (self-)relevance condition. In other words, the paradigm allowed us to calculate DRB effects independently for the two relevance conditions (i.e., self vs. other). We expected to find diminished DRB effects for the condition with self-relevant targets.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Method</title><p id="Par9">Raw data and analysis scripts for the experiment can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/3gkrp">https://osf.io/3gkrp</ext-link>.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par10">With regard to power planning, we consulted Schmalbrock and Frings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2022</xref>).

There were four response keys&#x02014;D, F, J, K&#x02014;that were assigned to the left middle finger, left index finger, right index finger, and right middle finger, respectively. Each response option was always associated with two stimuli (e.g., D for &#x0201c;I&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;myself&#x0201d;; F for &#x0201c;me&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;my&#x0201d;; J for &#x0201c;he&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;she&#x0201d;; and K for &#x0201c;you&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;your&#x0201d;).

Each trial began with a fixation point (an asterisk) presented centrally. Participants pressed the space bar to begin. After a 500-ms blank screen, the prime display was shown, comprising a word (i.e., the target) and a shape (i.e., the distractor). The display was shown in the center of the screen until a target response was given. After the response, the screen remained blank for 500 ms, and then the probe display appeared, comprising another target word and distractor shape; this was again presented centrally and remained on-screen until the participant responded. At the end of each trial, a further blank screen was shown for 500 ms.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Example trial procedure and key assignment. <italic>Note.</italic> In this example trial, the geometric distractor shape changes between prime and probe.

Also, the distractor was repeated (distractor repetition; DR) or changed (distractor change; DC) between prime and probe. This resulted in four different hypothesis-relevant trial types: response repetition and distractor repetition (RRDR), response repetition and distractor change (RRDC), response change and distractor repetition (RCDR), and response change and distractor change (RCDC). Each prime target appeared equally often with each geometric shape. In distractor-change trials, the probe distractor shape was randomly chosen from the three shapes that differed from the prime display.</p><p id="Par18">Prime and probe targets were varied orthogonally, that is, each combination of prime and probe target appeared equally often. However, we defined three types of trials for the analysis: (1) we defined a trial as self-relevant if both prime and probe target were self-relevant (i.e., I, myself, me, my); correspondingly, (2) we defined a trial as other-relevant if both prime and probe target were other-relevant (i.e., he, she, you, your; see <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec"><italic>Design</italic></xref>). These trials constituted our experimental trials. Of note, for our main analysis we disregarded target-repetition trials to obtain DRB effects that were not biased by target-repetition effects; however, in a supplementary analysis we calculated DRB effects with target-repetition trials included. Finally, (3) trials with a relevance change between prime and probe were treated as filler trials (serving mainly to disguise the design for participants), although they were used as a third set of trials in some exploratory analyses.</p><p id="Par19">In summary, there were 512 trials (8 prime terms &#x000d7; 8 probe terms &#x000d7; 4 prime shapes &#x000d7; 2 [i.e., repetition vs. random change] probe shapes). Half of these trials (i.e., 256) were experimental trials, with each condition (i.e., RRDR, RRDC, RCDR, RCDC) implemented 64 times. The specific target was repeated in half the response-repetition trials; in the other half, prime and probe used different targets of the same relevance (i.e., self- vs. other-relevant). The remaining 256 trials were filler trials (i.e., there was a relevance change between prime and probe).

These trials may provide an indication of whether self-related moderation of DRB effects is dominantly located in the prime trial (i.e., change in binding processes) or the probe trial (i.e., change in retrieval processes). As can be seen, in one condition&#x02014;that is, self-to-other change&#x02014;there was a notable difference in RTs between distractor change and distractor repetition that fits the general DRB pattern; it was statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(53) = 2.33, <italic>p</italic> = .012, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>Z</italic></sub> = 0.32 (<italic>t</italic>[53] = 1.34, <italic>p</italic> = .093, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>Z</italic></sub> = 0.18 for errors).

Therefore, we explored another approach to integrating these trials into the analyses: If we tentatively assume that the processes responsible for the relevance differences in the DRB effects are located in the probe trial (i.e., if we assume differences in retrieval processes), the DRB differences between self and other should be more pronounced if the other-to-self change trials are subsumed under the self-relevant category and the self-to-other change trials are added to the other-relevant category rather than the other way around. Indeed, defining relevance as <italic>probe</italic> relevance, we found significant distractor&#x02013;response binding in trials without self-relevance, <italic>M</italic> = 26 ms (<italic>SE</italic> = 11 ms), <italic>t</italic>(53) = 2.45, <italic>p</italic> = .009, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> = 0.33, but no significant distractor&#x02013;response binding in self-relevant trials, <italic>M</italic> = &#x02212;13 ms (<italic>SE</italic> = 12 ms), <italic>t</italic>(53) = &#x02212;1.11, <italic>p</italic> = .136, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> = 0.15.

Previous studies (e.g., Dignath et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2022</xref>; Golubickis &#x00026; Macrae, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>) assumed that self-relevance enhances executive control processes. Enhanced control processes should lead to a reduced influence of distractors on performance and should therefore reduce DRB effects in a top-down manner. In our experiment, we presented self-relevant versus non-self-relevant pronouns as targets and geometric shapes as distractors. Our data provided support for the hypothesis: If targets were self-relevant, no DRB effects were found, whereas in non-self-relevant trials, DRB effects emerged. Moreover, the DRB effects differed significantly from each other. Thus, our experiment provides some initial evidence on how self-relevance can influence the short-term binding of distractors to responses. The results support the notion that if a target stimulus has self-relevance, executive control processes are triggered, which not only reduce but can completely prevent processing of distractors.</p><p id="Par30">The present findings provide further insight into how self-relevance influences our actions. Generally, it is assumed that self-relevant stimuli strengthen bindings (Sui &#x00026; Humphreys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015a</xref>; Humphreys &#x00026; Sui,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>). For example, Sui and Humphreys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015b</xref>) found a stronger redundancy gain (i.e., faster reaction times when two conceptually equivalent stimuli instead of one are presented) for self-relevant than for non-self-relevant stimuli. They hypothesized that two self-relevant stimuli are more strongly bound together in a common representation than non-self-relevant ones. This stronger binding of self-relevant stimuli then facilitates perceptual and action processes. Moreover, it has been shown that shapes that someone previously associated with the self are more difficult to associate with another person later on (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2016</xref>). Our results show that the self-relevant stimuli do not appear to nonspecifically enhance binding processes. When two stimuli (in our case a distractor and a target stimulus) occur in a joint event, the distractor is not bound more strongly to a response when the target stimulus is self-relevant. Otherwise, DRB effects should have been stronger for self-relevant trials. Thus, binding advantages for self-relevant stimuli do not appear generally.</p><p id="Par31">As mentioned above, the BRAC framework (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>) assumes that integration and retrieval are two independent processes that can be separately influenced by top-down or bottom-up mechanisms. It has recently been suggested that binding processes are relatively automatic processes that are influenced to a lesser extent by top-down or bottom-up mechanisms than retrieval processes (Frings &#x00026; Rothermund, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>; Hommel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>; Moeller &#x00026; Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). Retrieval is less automatic and thus more susceptible to be influenced by these mechanisms (Hommel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; Ihrke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; Laub et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>; Moeller &#x00026; Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). Since our interpretation of the present results is that self-relevance increases executive control, it is plausible to assume that the relevance of target stimuli influences binding and retrieval processes to different extents. The present experiment cannot fully address this question because our main analyses only included trials in which both prime and probe target were either self-relevant or non-self-relevant. However, taking the trials with relevance changes between prime and probe into account, we can provide an estimate of whether target self-relevance has a stronger effect on distractor binding or distractor retrieval. Including these trials by defining relevance type as probe relevance, we found a more pronounced difference between self- and other-related DRB effects than in the standard analysis. By contrast, the difference between self- and other-relevant DRB effects were less pronounced&#x000a0;if relevance was defined as prime relevance. This pattern suggests that self-relevance has a stronger influence on probe-retrieval than on prime-integration processes. This interpretation meshes well with previous research arguing that integration is more automatic and therefore less easily influenced (here by self-relevance) than probe retrieval (e.g., Hommel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par32">In our study, we used pronouns, that is, verbal materials, to manipulate the self-relevance of targets. Sui et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2013</xref>) demonstrated that the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) shows increased activation when self-relevant label-shape combinations are processed and that the pSTS is specifically also associated with the processing of self-relevant labels (see also Humphreys &#x00026; Sui, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>). Moreover, the pSTS has generally been associated with the processing of linguistic material (e.g., Wilson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>). Thus, our results may depend in particular on the involvement of the pSTS since subjects in our experiment process linguistic stimuli that may or may not be self-relevant. Other studies which investigate influences of self-relevance typically also use non-linguistic stimuli, which are associated with a person&#x02019;s self or another entity (typically geometric shapes are used, but other stimulus types work as well; Sch&#x000e4;fer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2016</xref>). Further studies should investigate how the results are affected when non-linguistic stimuli (such as the geometric shapes just mentioned) are used and the pSTS is less involved in stimulus processing. A reduced activation of the pSTS could lead to a reduced influence of self-relevance, so that in turn the DRB effect might be less diminished. Yet, on the other hand, event-file dynamics underlying binding effects reflect processing in distributed cortical and subcortical networks encompassing a variety of brain areas (Beste et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2023</xref>). It was therefore argued that with respect to brain oscillations theta band activity (TBA; suitable to integrate information across spatial distances) reflects event-file configuration. Intriguingly, TBA has just recently be shown to also reflect processing of self-relevant stimuli in the SPE task (Haciahmet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2023</xref>). The role of the pSTS for the influence on self-relevance on DRB effects remains thus an open question for future research.</p><p id="Par33">We also would like to note the main effect of the relevance condition (both in RTs and errors) was due to slower reaction times respectively more errors in the self-relevant trials. When processing self-relevant stimuli, one usually expects faster reaction times and fewer errors for these trials (see, e.g., Sui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). In this respect, it is noteworthy that participants in our study generally reacted more slowly when responding to self-relevant targets compared to other-relevant targets. However, this pattern does not contradict our finding that DRB effects are moderated by self-relevance. At this point we refrain from a more detailed interpretation of this result, since we do not really have a theoretical basis to explain this effect.</p><p id="Par34">In summary, the present study shows that self-relevance has even more influence on stimulus processing as previously assumed&#x02014;distractor-based binding is diminished if targets are self-relevant. We argue that this demonstrates that self-relevance increases executive control, which in turn modulates the dynamic control of distractor processing.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Appendix</title><p id="Par37">Because previous findings suggest that target repetition cannot fully explain DRB effects (Frings, Rothermund, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>;&#x000a0;Frings, Wentura, et al.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>, Exp. 2), we here additionally report DRB effects where we included target-repetition trials (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>): The DRB effect for self-relevant targets was again numerically negative, <italic>M</italic> = &#x02212;5 ms (<italic>SE</italic> = 9 ms).
