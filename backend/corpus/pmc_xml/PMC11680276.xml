Mandatory reporting to the national electronic communicable disease surveillance system (eCDS) has been required since July 2016. We conducted an evaluation of the hepatitis B surveillance system in Ninh Binh, the province with the highest reported burden of hepatitis B in Northern Vietnam, between 2017 and 2022. Using the CDC&#x02019;s guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems, we assessed four key attributes: simplicity, timeliness, data quality, and acceptability. This retrospective evaluation included document reviews, analysis of hepatitis B data, and in-depth interviews with provincial-level healthcare staff involved in the reporting of hepatitis B cases. The results showed that the eCDS improved reporting frequency, provided more detailed case information, and enhanced data accessibility compared to the previous paper-based system. However, the system faced several challenges, including unclear objectives, difficulties in distinguishing acute from chronic cases, insufficient training for staff, lack of supervision for data quality, and technical software issues. Despite these challenges, stakeholders found the system acceptable but emphasized the need for improvements, including revising the system&#x02019;s objectives, automating case classification, enhancing training, securing funding for maintenance, and implementing regular data review processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hepatitis B</kwd><kwd>public health surveillance</kwd><kwd>simplicity</kwd><kwd>timeliness</kwd><kwd>data quality</kwd><kwd>acceptability</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>the ASEAN-Australia Health Security Fellowship by the Commonwealth Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Master of Applied Epidemiology Scholarship by the Australian National University</funding-source><award-id>274/2019</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Hien Thi Nguyen is funded by the ASEAN-Australia Health Security Fellowship by the Commonwealth Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Master of Applied Epidemiology Scholarship by the Australian National University (Funding No. 274/2019).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p><sup>&#x02021;</sup> These authors contributed equally to this work.</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis B, the cause of approximately 254 million chronic infections around the world with 1.1 million deaths in 2022, remains a major health challenge globally with the highest burden of this disease observed in the Western Pacific and African regions [<xref rid="B1-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To address the global impact of viral hepatitis including hepatitis B, the World Health Organization (WHO) has unveiled its worldwide health sector strategy for 2022&#x02013;2030 with the goal of ending hepatitis B infections by 2030 [<xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During 2020&#x02013;2022, the COVID-19 pandemic was found to have a negative impact on the routine surveillance of hepatitis B in some countries in the world [<xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Located in Southeast Asia with a population of nearly 100 million, Vietnam is among the ten countries that collectively account for nearly two-thirds of the global burden of viral hepatitis B and C, highlighting its significant public health challenge. According to the Global Hepatitis Report 2024 by WHO, Vietnam recorded 6.5 million hepatitis B infections across all age groups in 2022, representing 2.4% of the global burden [<xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. The HBV vaccine was introduced worldwide in 1981 and has shown an efficacy of 80&#x02013;100% in preventing the disease [<xref rid="B6-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The WHO advises that all infants should receive the HBV vaccine ideally within the first 24 h after birth, followed by 2 or 3 additional doses at least 4 weeks apart to complete the vaccination regimen [<xref rid="B7-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While Vietnam has started implementing subsidized HBV vaccination for infants since 2003, there is no equivalent program for adults, particularly those born before the early 2000s [<xref rid="B8-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, only high-risk groups are prioritized for vaccination, as recommended in the National Action Plan (NAP) for Viral Hepatitis Prevention and Control 2021&#x02013;2025 [<xref rid="B9-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], leaving many healthy adults unprotected and vulnerable to HBV, especially in a country with high endemicity like Vietnam, with only 41.7% of infected cases being diagnosed and 1.4% of diagnosed cases being treated in 2022 [<xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In Vietnam, hepatitis B cases in all provinces are regularly reported through an indicator-based surveillance system. With the issuance of Circular 54/2015 by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Guidelines for Reporting and Declaring Infectious Diseases and Outbreaks, starting from 1 July 2016, the national electronic communicable disease surveillance system (eCDS) was officially launched in Vietnam and has become the primary channel for reporting notifiable infectious diseases, including for hepatitis B [<xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. According to the MOH&#x02019;s guideline, each case of this disease must be reported within 48 h of clinical diagnosis. Compared to the previous paper-based surveillance system, the new online system is expected to quickly aggregate data on infectious disease cases, contributing to the early detection of outbreaks and reducing data duplication between reporting units at different levels [<xref rid="B9-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Ninh Binh, located in the south of the Northern Delta, is the province that recorded the highest incidence of hepatitis B infections per 100,000 population in North Vietnam during 2017&#x02013;2022 in the eCDS. Given the high burden of hepatitis B in Ninh Binh, we chose to evaluate the hepatitis B surveillance system in this province through four key attributes including simplicity, timeliness, data quality, and acceptability. Results of this evaluation may contribute to the optimization of the system&#x02019;s performance and broader public health actions. We expect our findings will inform Ninh Binh province in particular, and in Vietnam in general, in adjusting the surveillance strategy towards the WHO&#x02019;s aim to eradicate viral hepatitis as a significant public health concern by the year 2030.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>We evaluated the hepatitis-B-indicator-based surveillance system in Ninh Binh province, Vietnam, over the period of six years from 2017 to 2022. This study followed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA) Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems [<xref rid="B11-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and assessed four attributes of the surveillance system: simplicity, timeliness, data quality, and acceptability. To evaluate simplicity, timeliness, and acceptability, we utilized a combination of desk reviews and stakeholder interviews to gather relevant information. To assess data quality, we applied a mixed-methods explanatory sequential design approach. In the first phase, secondary quantitative data extracted from the eCDS were analyzed to identify patterns and trends in hepatitis B cases. The second phase involved conducting qualitative interviews with relevant staff to provide deeper insights and contextualize the findings from the quantitative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.2.

Ninh Binh is subdivided into eight district-level units, including two municipal cities and six districts. The province&#x02019;s health system is led by the provincial Department of Health and includes several provincial and district-level hospitals, health centers, and commune health stations [<xref rid="B14-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.3. Case Definition</title><p>According to the guidelines from Vietnam&#x02019;s MOH [<xref rid="B15-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the definitions of confirmed cases for acute and chronic hepatitis B are as follows:</p><p>Acute hepatitis B: a case that has both of the following criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM)-positive;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive (or -negative in the window period).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Chronic hepatitis B: a case that meets both of the following criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>HbsAg-positive for more than 6 months, or HBsAg-positive and anti-HBc IgM-positive;</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is evidence of progressive histopathological damage or cirrhosis without other causes.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.4. Data Collection</title><p>For the quantitative data, we extracted data for all hepatitis B cases in Ninh Binh province recorded in the eCDS from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2022. We imported these data into a Microsoft Excel software (Redmond, WA, USA) and performed descriptive analyses using the Pivot Table function to summarize and interpret the data.</p><p>For the qualitative component, we conducted a desk review and developed an in-depth interview guideline based on the Vietnamese government&#x02019;s regulations of operating notifiable disease surveillance systems [<xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and guidelines from the US CDC on evaluating specified attributes of disease surveillance systems [<xref rid="B11-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Regarding the selection of interviewees, we intentionally selected three staff from Ninh Binh Provincial General Hospital (PGH) because this hospital reported 96.9% of all hepatitis B cases in the eCDS system in Ninh Binh province over the period of 2017&#x02013;2022. The participants included one medical doctor and one nurse from the Department of Communicable Diseases, as well as the Head of the Department of General Planning. These individuals were selected based on their active involvement in the hepatitis B reporting system in the province. The interviews were conducted in-person and audio-recorded with verbal consent from the interviewees, in compliance with an ethical waiver obtained from the Australian National University Human Research Ethics Committee under the protocol number 2017/909. Respondents were asked to describe their roles in hepatitis B surveillance, provide their insights about the four selected attributes of this system, and give suggested recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.5. Definitions of System Attributes</title><sec id="sec2dot5dot1-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.5.1. Simplicity</title><p>To evaluate the simplicity of this surveillance system, we assessed the data flow including levels of reporting, reporting structure, and data management based on system documentation and feedback from staff of Ninh Binh Provincial General Hospital (PGH). The system&#x02019;s simplicity can be assessed based on certain criteria. For instance, if the case definition is easy to apply and the person identifying the case is also responsible for analyzing and using the information, the system is considered simple. Conversely, a more complex system may involve additional steps such as special laboratory tests for confirmation, detailed case investigations including home visits, multiple levels of reporting, and the need for specialized training to collect or interpret data [<xref rid="B11-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5dot2-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.5.2. Timeliness</title><p>In our study, the period that elapsed between the hepatitis B diagnosis by a physician or laboratory and the date reported in the eCDS was used as an indicator to assess the timeliness of the hepatitis B surveillance system. Given that the aforementioned information was not available on the eCDS or other systems, we mainly described this attribute based on the views from health staff from Ninh Binh PGH who were involved in the reporting system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5dot3-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.5.3. Data Quality</title><p>For data quality, we assessed the consistency between quantitative data and responses from staff at Ninh Binh PGH. We also evaluated the completeness of variables including vaccination status, epidemiological history, date of onset, date of sampling, date of testing result, current situation (treatment results for inpatients), and date of hospital discharge/referral/death. To calculate the percentage of data completeness, we divided the number of complete records by the total number of records for each variable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5dot4-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>2.5.4.

Data Analysis</title><p>To calculate the incidence of hepatitis B in Ninh Binh and other provinces in Northern Vietnam during the 2017&#x02013;2022 period, we divided the number of new hepatitis B cases reported each year in the eCDS by the total provincial population, which was obtained from the 2019 Vietnam Population and Housing Census [<xref rid="B16-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To describe the system&#x02019;s operation, we integrated relevant content from government documents and responses from interviewees. Descriptive analysis was conducted using the Pivot Table function in Microsoft Excel to assess the quality of surveillance data. The qualitative data from interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Themes were identified inductively, allowing patterns to emerge directly from the data. Verbatim quotes were chosen to illustrate key themes, with selection criteria focusing on their representativeness of broader participant perspectives.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>3.

Among these provinces, Ninh Binh stood out as the province with the highest incidence of hepatitis B during this period, with a peak in 2019 of 262.6 cases per 100,000 population. The unusually high number of reported hepatitis B cases (2579) in Ninh Binh province in 2019 was largely attributed to intensified community screening initiatives. The PGH began a hepatitis B screening program in 2016, scaling up efforts in 2018&#x02013;2019 with bi-monthly screenings across various communes. This led to the early detection of suspected cases and prompted patients to register for local care due to its affordability and convenience compared to central-level hospitals. However, community screenings were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a drop in reported cases in subsequent years. Efforts to resume screenings began in 2022.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;To detect hepatitis B cases early in the community, our hospital launched a screening program in 2016.

From these efforts, we identified several suspected hepatitis B cases and referred them to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. After learning about the hepatitis B management program at the provincial hospital, patients registered immediately, as it saves considerable travel and treatment costs compared to going to central-level hospitals. In 2020&#x02013;2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to conduct community screenings, and patients rarely visited the hospital due to travel restrictions. As a result, the number of new hepatitis B cases reported to the eCDS decreased. Since 2022, we have been working to resume community screenings.

The Guidelines only mentioned types of reporting including case reports, weekly reports, monthly reports, annual reports, outbreak reports, and extraordinary reports [<xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>3.3. Simplicity</title><p>The hepatitis-B-indicator-based surveillance system is part of the national notifiable disease surveillance system in Vietnam. <xref rid="tropicalmed-09-00299-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the data flow in the hepatitis B surveillance system in Ninh Binh province. It consists of multiple levels of reporting. At the commune level, a suspected case may be detected by healthcare workers at health facilities inside companies or organizations, by village health workers, by healthcare workers at private clinics, or by family doctors. The healthcare worker or doctor who identifies the suspected hepatitis B case must notify the commune health station (CHS) of this person for further investigation and verification. If the case is then confirmed as a positive hepatitis B case, the CHS should report it to the eCDS within 48 h from the time of diagnosis confirmation. District health centers, district general hospitals, and provincial hospitals can also directly access the eCDS to report hepatitis B cases that they identified.</p><p>The CHS, district health center/district hospital, or provincial hospitals can monitor other cases in this province reported by other units. In case online reporting to the eCDS is impossible, health facilities should report to higher levels via an official letter (paper-based), fax, or e-mail. For emergency cases, health staff can report to higher authorities in person or by phone call first, and then report to the eCDS or provide a written report within 24 h. The two-way arrows in this system mean one way of data entry to the system and one way for other organizations to verify and send feedback about these cases.</p><p>In Ninh Binh PGH, the Department of Communicable Disease has staff designated as focal points who report all cases of hepatitis B managed by this hospital to the eCDS. In terms of simplicity, the staff reflected during interviews that it did not take too much time or effort to enter the information of a hepatitis case into the eCDS. In comparison, the previously reported paper-based system required them to report monthly, quarterly, and yearly to higher levels, while the eCDS only requires them to report case data once because health authorities in lower levels and higher levels can access these data.</p><p>However, this system requires follow-up actions by health staff for hepatitis B inpatients. After entering the patients&#x02019; data at the time of hospital admission, nurses must monitor their treatment outcomes and then update the case&#x02019;s data to the eCDS when patients are discharged from the hospital, or referred to other medical facilities, or die.</p><p>In addition, respondents were unsure of the eCDS reporting requirements. For example, chronic hepatitis B patients need to go to outpatient clinics inside Ninh Binh PGH every month until the end of their lives to obtain medicines covered by health insurance. Health staff at Ninh Binh PGH were unsure if they only needed to report new cases of hepatitis B, or if they must also update the system about every return visit of outpatients. In the past, some cases were reported more than once into the eCDS based on re-visits, and health staff felt it was complicated and time-consuming to report like this. They also faced significant challenges in reporting hepatitis B cases due to time constraints from managing approximately 4000 cases annually and handling additional administrative demands, such as maintaining medical records for all outpatients.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Only the first patient visit should be reported to the surveillance system, not their follow-up visits. As nurses, we have various responsibilities, such as preparing health records and assisting doctors and patients, so we do not have much time for reporting. Every year, we manage about 4000 cases of hepatitis B, with many outpatients visiting our clinics monthly. Unlike other health conditions, hepatitis B is a special case, requiring us to prepare and store the medical records of all outpatients coming to our hospital&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><attrib>(Interviewee 2)</attrib></disp-quote><p>In the early stages of implementing this new surveillance system, there was only one training provided by Ninh Binh CDC in 2016, and only one staff member from the Department of General Planning at Ninh Binh PGH was sent to this training. On completion of this training, he came back and guided health staff of the Department of Communicable Disease to work with the eCDS, but his verbal instructions were unclear, and no training materials were provided to health staff who directly work with this system. Whenever questions or concerns arose, the Chief Nurse from Department of Communicable Disease phoned a focal point from Ninh Binh CDC to receive verbal guidance without any supporting documents.</p><p>According to our evaluation criteria for simplicity, this surveillance system appears to be complex, not simple. This complexity arises from the necessity for health staff to conduct follow-up actions to update laboratory test results and patient outcomes, as well as the requirement for specialized training to collect and interpret data.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>3.4. Timeliness</title><p>According to guidelines from Vietnam&#x02019;s MOH, hepatitis B is a &#x02018;Class B&#x02019;-reportable infectious disease, which must be reported within 48 h from the time of confirmed diagnosis [<xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, quantitative data extracted from the eCDS did not include information of the reporting date or date of confirmed diagnosis for each hepatitis B case. For time variables, we can only view the date of sampling, date of health check/hospitalization, and date of hospital discharge/referral/death. Therefore, we were unable to assess the timeliness of this surveillance system through eCDS data.</p><p>When asked about the duration from the time of diagnosis to the time of reporting a hepatitis B case to the eCDS, health staff from the Department of Communicable Disease in Ninh Binh PGH reported that they normally input data into the eCDS within a day.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Almost all hepatitis B cases with positive diagnoses are reported the same day.

In that old surveillance system, only authorities in higher levels could access the data reported by lower levels. In contrast, in the eCDS, reporters only need to provide input data once for each case without aggregating data for month, quarter, or year. More variables included in case report forms and warning functions of the software help in reducing duplications in reporting.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Our previous reporting system for hepatitis B was paper-based.

Discussion</title><p>Our evaluation provided a foundational understanding on some strengths and weaknesses of the hepatitis B surveillance system in Ninh Binh province over 6 years from 2017 to 2022 and generated several recommendations for optimizing its operation and usefulness.</p><p>The major strengths of the current hepatitis B surveillance system in comparison with the previous paper-based version include reduced reporting frequencies, the provision of more detail of each case, less duplication of data, and improved data accessibility for health authorities at diverse levels.</p><p>In the age of digital technology, using an electronic system to manage surveillance data enables users to quickly identify disease patterns, populations at high risk, and potential outbreaks in the locality. A number of developed and developing countries also operate electronic reporting systems for fast communication of hepatitis B cases including Germany [<xref rid="B17-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Italy [<xref rid="B18-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and China [<xref rid="B19-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast, Albania is one example of a country that still manages a paper-based surveillance system for hepatitis B, and the evaluation of hepatitis B and C surveillance in this country concluded that a web-based reporting system is required to improve usefulness, data quality, and efficiency of this system [<xref rid="B20-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite the above-mentioned assets, there are various challenges that need to be addressed to improve the performance of this hepatitis B surveillance system. First and foremost, the lack of clearly defined objectives of the surveillance system in the Ministry of Health guidelines poses a significant challenge in assessing the surveillance system&#x02019;s usefulness. It is imperative for the Ministry of Health of Vietnam to thoroughly review and redefine the objectives of the eCDS to ensure clarity and alignment with its intended purpose.</p><p>One of the most critical criteria for evaluating the quality of a disease surveillance system is whether it accurately reflects the patients who meet the standard case definition. The surveillance systems in other countries clearly classify the reporting patients into two clinical types of hepatitis B cases&#x02014;acute and chronic conditions [<xref rid="B17-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our findings revealed that the current hepatitis B surveillance system in Vietnam is unable to differentiate between acute and chronic hepatitis B cases as per guidelines by Vietnam&#x02019;s MOH. A similar issue was reported in a study from China where the country&#x02019;s hepatitis B surveillance system also failed to distinguish between acute and chronic infections [<xref rid="B19-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This issue could be resolved by adjusting the classification of testing types in the eCDS to meet the criteria of standard case definitions for acute and chronic patients. In addition, it may be more efficient if an algorithm is installed in the software to review the input data and automatically classify acute and chronic hepatitis B cases. This function could not only reduce the workload of reporting individuals, but also provide quick advice for physicians to diagnose the disease conditions more accurately, thereby giving the appropriate treatments for patients. Our country should learn from Germany&#x02019;s experience on this, since they already adapted this technology to their surveillance system [<xref rid="B17-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Although health staff from Ninh Binh PGH had been working with the current hepatitis B surveillance system for more than six years, they were still unclear about its objectives and uncertain about the data that should be reported in the eCDS. This problem can lead to delayed reporting, time wasting, and extra workload for health workers, and may result in lower acceptability of the system. One of the main reasons for this confusion was the lack of regular trainings and clear guidelines for people involved with this system. To address this uncertainty, training should be organized and instruction documents should be distributed to all users.</p><p>Timeliness is a crucial attribute for the effectiveness of a surveillance system, typically measured by the time interval between a hepatitis B-confirmed diagnosis by a physician or laboratory and its reporting to the notification system, as highlighted in studies from other countries [<xref rid="B21-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the current hepatitis B surveillance system in Ninh Binh does not track this critical period, leaving a gap in the assessment of reporting timeliness. To improve the system, it is essential to include fields for both the date of confirmed diagnosis and the date of reporting. This addition would enable the verification of timeliness, ensuring alignment with the MOH&#x02019;s guidelines and enhancing the overall efficiency of the surveillance system.</p><p>Data inconsistency and incompleteness were persistent issues in hepatitis B reporting in Ninh Binh province from 2017 to 2022, including important information such as vaccination status and epidemiological history. Similarly, a study examining hepatitis B data across European countries from 2006 to 2012 found that HBV vaccination and transmission route data were also poorly reported [<xref rid="B24-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To address this issue, the Vietnam MOH should establish specific authority and mechanisms for regularly reviewing and providing feedback on data reported in the eCDS. The surveillance results should also be analyzed in depth and disseminated to all relevant stakeholders on a regular basis to increase the usefulness of this system. These recommendations were also suggested by other studies in Italy [<xref rid="B18-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Iran [<xref rid="B25-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In our evaluation, we found that the &#x0201c;epidemiological history&#x0201d; field was blank for all records of hepatitis B. While it is understandable that patients rarely know how they contracted HBV, hospital staff reported that there is currently no questionnaire to collect risk factor data for HBV in Vietnam. Therefore, a case investigation questionnaire should be developed for health professionals to interview patients and capture potential risk factor data. This would help understand trends in risk factors and enable the completion of the &#x0201c;epidemiological history&#x0201d; field. This is also recommended in the guidelines of the US CDC [<xref rid="B26-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Public Health England [<xref rid="B27-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Technical errors and bugs are inevitable problems for every piece of software; therefore, regular monitoring and maintenance are required to handle these issues promptly to minimize the number of delayed reports. However, the eCDS was developed and sponsored by Viettel, a state-owned enterprise managed by the Vietnam Ministry of National Defence. Sometimes, when software glitches occurred, the responsible authority from the MOH had to contact a focal point of Viettel to ask for their support, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. It would be more effective if the MOH could allocate some funds to own this software and directly manage and maintain the operation of the eCDS.</p><p>In this study, we found that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected routine reporting of hepatitis B cases in Ninh Binh province as health workers had to devote all their efforts and time to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and treat severe cases. This result is consistent with previous findings from other research in the UK [<xref rid="B4-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in some European countries [<xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-09-00299" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This issue calls for action to link and synchronize the eCDS with other existing software such as hospital management and the national vaccination database to automatically update the case information and reduce manual work for the health workforce, especially in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Based on the evaluation findings, several key recommendations were made to enhance the hepatitis B electronic surveillance system in Ninh Binh, Vietnam. Firstly, the MOH should review and clearly define the objectives of the eCDS to ensure alignment with its intended purpose. Software enhancements, including installing an algorithm to classify acute and chronic hepatitis B cases automatically, are essential for improving data accuracy. The MOH should also allocate funds for ongoing software maintenance to address technical issues promptly. To reduce the reporting burden on health staff, linking and synchronizing the eCDS with other systems, such as hospital management and national vaccination databases, is recommended. Regular training sessions and detailed guidelines should be provided to all individuals involved in eCDS operations to enhance capacity. Additionally, a designated authority should be assigned to supervise and regularly review reported data to ensure consistency and completeness. A local public health dashboard should be developed to enhance data visualization, improve accessibility for stakeholders, and facilitate the timely identification and resolution of data quality issues. Surveillance data should be thoroughly analyzed and disseminated to relevant stakeholders to enhance the system&#x02019;s usefulness. Lastly, organizing workshops for experience sharing among eCDS users across different provinces will foster discussions on system improvements and encourage the adoption of best practices.</p><p>Due to limited time, data availability, and resources, we acknowledge various limitations of this evaluation. Firstly, some crucial attributes of the surveillance system such as representativeness, sensitivity, and stability were not investigated or discussed. Secondly, we only interviewed three health staff members from Ninh Binh PGH as they were the primary contributors to the reporting system, accounting for 96.9% of the cases reported in the eCDS. We did not include all types of stakeholders across the system at lower and higher levels and at other health facilities in Ninh Binh province. These stakeholders may have different views and experiences when working with the eCDS and may provide further recommendations to improve the current system. Thirdly, the research team focused solely on analyzing secondary quantitative data extracted from the eCDS to assess the quality of the surveillance data. We did not utilize any quantitative tools to measure the respondent&#x02019;s feedback on other attributes of the surveillance system, which may have limited the depth and scope of this evaluation. Fourth, there may be potential biases related to the underreporting or overreporting of cases within this surveillance system. Due to the lack of corroborative data from other sources, we cannot ascertain the presence, magnitude, or impact of these biases on the results. Lastly, our study provided insights from health workers in only one province in Northern Vietnam; thus, the findings may not be generalized for other areas that have different settings. Further comprehensive evaluation should be conducted on a larger scale in the future to determine the best practices and key challenges of the hepatitis B surveillance system across the country and to provide viable solutions for improvements across the system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-tropicalmed-09-00299"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>To summarize, the hepatitis B surveillance system in Ninh Binh province, Vietnam, was acceptable for monitoring this disease pattern in the locality during 2017&#x02013;2022. Certain concerns such as the lack of frequent trainings, the inability of the system to distinguish acute and chronic hepatitis B cases, the inability for the early detection of poor data quality, and technical issues reduced its performance. In light of the findings, several recommendations were made for the system enhancement, including (1) a thorough review and redefinition of eCDS objectives by the Ministry of Health, (2) installing algorithms in the software to automatically classify hepatitis B cases, (3) allocating funds for software maintenance to ensure smooth operation, (4) linking the surveillance system with other software for streamlined reporting, (5) conducting regular training on system objectives and operations, (6) providing detailed guidelines for system usage, (7) establishing a mechanism for regular data review to ensure consistency and completeness, (8) analyzing and disseminating surveillance data to relevant stakeholders, and (9) organizing workshops for experience sharing and system improvement discussions among users from different provinces.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Ninh Binh Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Ninh Binh Provincial General Hospital for their contributions to this evaluation.
