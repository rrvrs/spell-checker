CTD&#x02019;s manual curation process extracts from the biomedical literature molecular relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, phenotypes, diseases, anatomical terms, and species. These relationships are organized in a highly systematic way in order to make them not only informative but also scientifically computational, enabling inferential hypotheses to be formed to address gaps in understanding. Integral to CTD&#x02019;s functionality is the use of structured, hierarchical ontologies and controlled vocabularies to describe these molecular relationships. Normalizing text (i.e. translating raw text from the literature into these controlled vocabularies) can be a time-consuming process for biocurators. To facilitate the normalization process and improve the efficiency with which our scientists curate the literature, CTD evaluated and integrated into the curation process PubTator 3.0, a state-of-the-art, AI-powered resource which extracts and normalizes from the literature many of the key biomedical concepts CTD curates. Here, we describe CTD&#x02019;s long-standing history with Natural Language Processing (NLP), how this history helped form our objectives for NLP integration, the evaluation of PubTator against our objectives, and the integration of PubTator into CTD&#x02019;s curation workflow.</p><p>

CTD&#x02019;s core curation module is composed of highly specialized edge relationships between chemical/drugs (referred to hereafter simply as chemicals) and gene/proteins (referred to hereafter simply as genes); chemicals and phenotypes; genes and diseases; and chemicals and diseases. These carefully constructed relationships are defined based on detailed biocurator review of the literature (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>); each relationship is associated with a specific PubMed Identifier (PMID).</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>CTD Curation Overview. CTD biocurators review the literature (circle 1), transforming authors&#x02019; free text using a specific methodology to make it informative and computational. Well-defined controlled vocabularies are used for every biological aspect of CTD, including chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases, anatomical terms, pathways, exposures, and species, as well as edges which represent the relationship between terms. Here, the CTD biocurator normalizes the free text <italic toggle="yes">heme oxygenase 1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HO-1</italic> to the NCBI Gene primary symbol <italic toggle="yes">HMOX1</italic> (circle 2). Curation is rendered in CTD using a highly structured, systematic methodology (circle 3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baaf013f1" position="float"/></fig><p>The process by which CTD selects articles for curation is a well-documented, two-pronged methodology. First, CTD biocurators review, cover-to-cover, 19 relevant toxicological journals on an ongoing basis [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, CTD selects other articles by targeting specific chemicals or chemical classes (e.g. bisphenol A, PFAS) from our Chemical Priority Matrix, and querying for them in PubMed [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; returned articles mentioning the targeted chemical(s) are then ranked by CTD&#x02019;s text mining pipeline, and the highest ranked are curated [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>One of the core principles that underlies CTD curation is the use of highly structured, controlled terminologies throughout the database, not only for biomedical concepts (i.e. chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases, anatomical terms, species) but also for internally developed action terms that are used to form edge relationships between these biomedical concepts [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Utilizing this disciplined approach has allowed CTD to become highly computational, enabling it to not only be a knowledgebase, summarizing for scientists the state of research for one or more specific biomedical concepts in a systematic manner, but also a discoverybase, identifying prospective relationships between concepts that have not yet been reported. For example, if one study demonstrates that the chemical <italic toggle="yes">Sildenafil Citrate</italic> increases the expression of gene <italic toggle="yes">ADIPOQ</italic>, and another study shows that <italic toggle="yes">ADIPOQ</italic> is a potential target for the treatment of the disease <italic toggle="yes">Myocardial Ischemia</italic>, then we can computationally infer a hypothesis that <italic toggle="yes">Sildenafil Citrate</italic> could have a potential effect on <italic toggle="yes">Myocardial Ischemia</italic>. These types of prospective connections are available in CTD in the form of chemical-disease, gene-disease, and phenotype-disease inferences [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>], and the former two are scored and ranked based on the topology of the local network used to generate the inference [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. By extending this logic, we can assemble prospective four-unit stepwise molecular mechanisms, linking an initiating chemical, an interacting gene, an intermediate phenotype, and a disease outcome; these information blocks are known in CTD as <italic toggle="yes">tetramers</italic> [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>This type of prospective computational chaining would not be possible in the absence of manual curation based on highly structured ontologies and controlled vocabularies (referred to hereafter as controlled vocabularies). At CTD, a subset of the &#x0201c;Chemicals and Drugs&#x0201d; [D] branch of the National Library of Medicine&#x02019;s Medical Subject Headers (MeSH) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] is used to characterize chemicals; a subset of National Center for Biotechnology Information&#x02019;s (NCBI) Gene vocabulary [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is used for genes; MEDIC [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a hierarchical integration of the &#x0201c;Diseases&#x0201d; branch of MeSH and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], is used for diseases; the Gene Ontology (GO; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), particularly the biological process branch, has been successfully leveraged by CTD as a source to annotate chemical-induced phenotypes (defined at CTD as nondisease biological events) reported in the literature, such as vehicle emissions-induced increases in &#x0201c;leukocyte migration&#x0201d; (GO:0050900), cadmium-induced changes in &#x0201c;heart contraction&#x0201d; (GO:0060047), and arsenic trioxide-induced &#x0201c;gluconeogenesis&#x0201d; (GO:0006094) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; NCBI Taxonomy [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] is used for species; and the &#x0201c;Anatomy [A]&#x0201d; branch of MeSH is used for anatomical terms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Importance of term normalization at CTD</title><p>To the uninitiated, it might seem like a relatively simple proposition to curate within the context of a highly disciplined, structured environment; in reality, this is not the case. For example, the gene &#x0201c;aryl hydrocarbon receptor&#x0201d; may appear in the literature as <italic toggle="yes">AHR, AhR 1, AHR1, AHR1A, Ahre, AH receptor, AH-receptor, aromatic hydrocarbon receptor, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor, arylhydrocarbon receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1</italic>, etc.; it is the job of the biocurator to deduce, from raw text, the proper NCBI Gene primary term. The process biocurators use to translate raw text from the literature into controlled vocabularies is called <italic toggle="yes">normalization</italic> [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Structuring of this nature from free-form text tends to be an inherently tedious and time-consuming process, and curation efforts are typically resource-heavy [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The web-based CTD Curation Application (CAPP) is the ultimate arbiter of term normalization at CTD [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During the curation process our biocurators enter into the CAPP only primary terms, or unique synonyms to primary terms, within the context of the most recent version of the respective controlled vocabulary (which is typically less than a month old). The tool integrates a tightly controlled, internally developed notation to enable biocurators to quickly enter complex interactions. For example, the biocurator may want to note the following complex interaction based on review of a reference:</p><disp-quote><p>BAK1 protein affects the reaction [BAX protein affects the reaction [mirdametinib promotes the reaction [MK 2206 promotes the reaction [romidepsin results in increased apoptotic process]]]]</p></disp-quote><p>In order to capture this interaction, the biocurator will enter the following structured notation in the CAPP:</p><p>G1/p 1rxn [G2/p 1rxn [C1 +rxn [C2 +rxn [C3 +phe P1]]]]</p><p>This interaction involves two genes, G1 and G2, three chemicals, C1, C2, and C3, and one phenotype, P1. For each of these actors, the biocurator must translate the raw text from the literature into a primary term, or a unique synonym to a primary term (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). The need for Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based tools to assist biocurators with this seemingly simple task of term identification, normalization, and entry (as well as other computational tasks) has been an important ongoing focus of our research and development at CTD.</p><fig position="float" id="F2" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Term normalization during CTD curation application interaction entry. CTD biocurators use a structured notation as shorthand to capture an interaction (circle 1), in this case requiring the entry of two genes (G1 and G2), three chemicals (C1-C3), and one phenotype (P1). Once the notation is entered, labeled input fields (circles 2&#x02013;7) are dynamically generated to allow the biocurators to enter the appropriate terms. In this example, the biocurator enters (circle 2) the gene <italic toggle="yes">BAK</italic>, which is the actual term used by the authors in the reference, for G1; however, <italic toggle="yes">BAK</italic> happens to be a nonunique synonym for the primary NCBI Gene term <italic toggle="yes">BAK1</italic> and, because of this, the entry is flagged as invalid (as indicated by the purple field background). The biocurator enters (circle 3) the correct primary NCBI Gene term <italic toggle="yes">BAX</italic> (with validation indicated by the green background). The biocurator enters (circle 4) chemical <italic toggle="yes">PD 0325901</italic>, which is an invalid entry (as indicated by the red background) because it contains two spaces between <italic toggle="yes">PD</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">032</italic>. The biocurator enters (circle 5) the valid chemical <italic toggle="yes">MK-2206</italic>, which is a unique synonym for primary MeSH term <italic toggle="yes">MK 2206</italic> (as indicated by a yellow field, which is used for valid unique synonyms). The biocurator enters (circle 6) the correct primary MeSH term <italic toggle="yes">romidepsin</italic>. The biocurator enters (circle 7) the nonunique, invalid synonym used in the reference, <italic toggle="yes">apoptosis</italic>, rather than the correct GO primary term, <italic toggle="yes">apoptotic process</italic>. The biocurator will be unable to save the interaction to the database until all the field entries are made valid (i.e. all the terms have been fully normalized to CTD&#x02019;s controlled vocabularies, as indicated by either a green or yellow background).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baaf013f2" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3"><title>NLP research and development at CTD</title><p>Although CTD has been named a member of the &#x0201c;golden set of databases that have consistently served as authoritative, comprehensive, and convenient data resources&#x0201d; widely used by the scientific community [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], our staff has, since its inception, been comparatively small. In order to make the most of our limited resources, CTD&#x02019;s team is relentlessly focused on improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our curation [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref>]. Over a decade ago we recognized not only the aforementioned need for NLP-based tools to assist with the process of term identification and normalization, but also the fact that CTD could play an important role in the development of such tools based on our vast portfolio of manually curated content.</p><p>Consequently, CTD became an active member of the Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology (BioCreAtIvE) group steering committee. BioCreative challenge evaluation tasks collectively represent an international biomedical community-wide effort, assembling NLP and biology expertise to develop and evaluate a variety of text mining and information-extraction systems within the biological domain [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Over the years, CTD team members have organized challenge evaluations and provided corpora for aggregate gene-, disease-, and chemical-based Named-Entity Recognition (NER) and document-level prioritization [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; Web Services-based gene, disease, and chemical NER extraction [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CTD also worked closely with NCBI to assist with the development of BioC, a common, interoperable interchange format to represent, store, and exchange data computationally [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Concurrent with our community research-related efforts, we assembled and built our own NLP tools for internal use. Open source-related components were used at CTD to build a prototype document ranking application [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The prototype and associated tools were subsequently leveraged as the basis for development of a highly effective, fully functional, algorithmic rules-based text mining pipeline. This pipeline assigns document relevancy scores (DRS) to prospective articles, ranking each in terms of their suitability for curation within the context of specifically targeted chemicals, and has been demonstrated to increase productivity, efficiency, and the collection of novel content [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Integral to the ranking algorithm is NER extraction using a set of locally installed, third-party tools adapted for CTD use: Abner [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for gene NER, Oscar3 [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for chemical NER, and MetaMap [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for disease NER, as well as supplementary chemical and gene recognition. Although the CTD text mining pipeline has been highly effective, we found that the problems inherent in local installation of NER tools are many, nontrivial, and multiply over time. As is typically the case with shared runtime libraries, local tool installation requires software engineers to address tool-specific issues such as operating system compatibility, third<sup>-</sup>party library requirements, process modularity and inter-process communications, programming language interpretation/compilation-related compatibility, and multi-thread capacity [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, libraries are static in nature; consequently, they are improved only with new releases, which, if implemented, may again give rise to many of the aforementioned technical issues.</p><p>This somewhat difficult experience with local libraries led us directly to our research associated with Web Service-based NLP. Web Services are services designed to accommodate interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over the Web [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Rather than locally installed libraries, Web Services provide the capability to make HTTP-based calls to remote sites for NER extraction. This approach tends to be inherently simpler than direct local integration because the technical details of the tools themselves are abstracted by the Web Service. The use of Web Services is particularly attractive for applications where asynchronous processing is a viable alternative, given that remote Web Service calls may or may not meet real-time curation application performance requirements.</p><p>Our Web Services-related BioCreative work demonstrated not only the dramatic advantages of remote tool integration, but also the utility of a standard, interoperable exchange format [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Use of an exchange format such as BioC is clearly superior to an output format that is tool-specific. In the latter case, unique format translation software must be written and maintained for every integrated library (as was the case with our text mining pipeline).</p><p>Finally, our NLP-related research and development experience underscored the importance of determining how well NER tools would comport to our controlled vocabularies. For example, our text mining pipeline library, MetaMap, maps disease, chemical, and gene terms to the National Library of Medicine&#x02019;s Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; Oscar 3 is tightly coupled with Chemical Entities of Biological Interest [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for chemicals. Tools that map to non CTD-integrated controlled vocabularies, or tools that simply extract the actual terms used in the paper as biomedical concepts, require an additional layer of computational algorithms for term normalization, and are therefore less desirable than tools that map directly to CTD-integrated controlled vocabularies.</p><p>The experience and knowledge that we gained in conjunction with these projects enabled CTD to more judiciously pursue methods to integrate NLP tools into our curation process. These tools would be integrated in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our curation staff, assisting our biocurators, as well as our computational processes, with identifying, normalizing, and entering chemical, gene, phenotype, disease, anatomical, and/or species (C-G-P-D-A-S) terms from the literature.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Objectives for NLP tool evaluation</title><p>The general objectives in undertaking this project were to:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Integrate into our curation process state-of-the-art NLP/NER tools for as many relevant C-G-P-D-A-S biomedical concepts as are available, using these tools as the basis for (i) creating a user interface for biocurators to view abstracts with clearly highlighted biomedical concepts, and (ii) ensuring the biomedical concepts are easily selectable, rather than requiring manually keying/copying-and-pasting for curation entry.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ensure the NLP tools align biomedical concepts as closely as possible with our underlying controlled vocabularies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Integrate NLP tools that: (i) are, if possible, available for use via a Web Service or similar web-based remotely accessible tool, rather than locally installed libraries, and (ii) employ an interoperable exchange format.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ensure that the tools are well maintained, production ready, and likely to be supported for the foreseeable future.</p></list-item></list><p>It should be noted that NLP tool-related response time was not an important factor in our evaluation. Of paramount importance was that whatever plan we implemented help speed curation, not slow it down. Being mindful of that principle, the assumption was that we would preprocess articles in an asynchronous fashion, storing the results in our database prior to curation, rather than running NLP tools synchronously during curation; it simply did not seem feasible to perform NLP processing for up to six different biomedical concepts (i.e. C-G-P-D-A-S) at run-time. Moreover, our plan was to integrate NLP tools into the CAPP as well as multiple text mining pipelines. Were we to perform all text mining processing synchronously, many of our references would be text-mined at least twice&#x02014;one or more times during DRS scoring and later during actual curation. Therefore, it would be most efficient to store the results initially in our database during DRS scoring and ranking (for those articles requiring DRS scores); the NLP metadata extracted during DRS scoring would then be available for use by the CAPP during curation. Also, this preprocessing approach easily accommodates the potential integration of additional text mining tools into the curation process. For example, CTD is currently studying the use of Large Language Models for entity and relationship recognition; the metadata associated with these types of tools could be combined with PubTator metadata by storing the results in the database for later use without regard to the source. Although preprocessing the literature would be significantly more complex from a workflow and software engineering perspective, it was the approach that would ensure biocurators would not be adversely affected by NLP integration; consequently, preprocessing rendered the response times of the NLP tools of little significance.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>CTD/PubTator 3.0 compatibility</title><p>CTD had collaborated with members of the Literature Search group at NCBI on several of the aforementioned NLP-related projects and been highly impressed with their professionalism and expertise. We were aware that this group was responsible for PubTator Central [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], an online tool for viewing annotated concepts in biomedical literature, but had never had the opportunity, from a resource perspective, to carefully review PubTator in terms of its suitability for CTD. Given this knowledge and prior experience, we decided to evaluate PubTator for potential integration into CTD.</p><p>As we closely examined PubTator, we were pleased not only with its functionality and effectiveness, but also with its compatibility with CTD&#x02019;s environment (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Similar to CTD, diseases and chemical names are normalized by PubTator to MeSH identifiers; genes are normalized to NCBI Gene identifiers; and species are normalized to NCBI Taxonomy identifiers [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, four of the six C-G-P-D-A-S biomedical concepts we were interested in securing NLP support for were already addressed by PubTator directly, requiring no need for additional computational term normalization. Of note is that PubTator also uses NLP tools to identify cell lines and protein variants.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>CTD/PubTator controlled vocabulary overview.

We had anticipated the need to develop an interface for our biocurators which highlighted C-G-P-D-A-S biomedical concepts based on the integrated NLP tools; fortunately, we discovered that this requirement was no longer necessary. Instead, PubTator, with its color-coded, selectable, and hyperlinked biomedical concepts, was more than adequate to address our near-term requirements. We had also expected that PubTator would provide solely abstract-based annotations but found that full text was provided where available. This full-text capability is extremely beneficial to CTD, because we are often required to review the full text in cases where the abstract is incomplete or requires further clarification. After evaluation and testing, we realized that it would be highly advantageous to integrate the PubTator online user interface component into our curation workflow; consequently, we modified the CAPP to hyperlink to PubTator (in addition to our existing PubMed hyperlink) and directed our biocurators to start using the PubTator online user interface as the basis for curation at their discretion.</p><p>We found that the strength of PubTator is not limited only to its online interface. In addition, the online tool is closely matched with a fully functional, Web Service-based Application Programming Interface (API); the API enables computational processes to extract, in a variety of methods and formats, the underlying metadata used to power/support the online tool. More specifically, PubTator&#x02019;s API provides very detailed information about each processed reference and the associated biomedical concepts, including, for each concept, its spatial orientation in the paper, its type and accession identifier, and the raw text that was used to identify and normalize it.</p><p>In CTD, curated content is referenced via PMIDs. NCBI&#x02019;s PubMed archive contains primarily abstracts from nearly all of the biomedical literature. Alternatively, PubMed Central is NCBIs full-text archive; it is indexed by PubMed Central identifiers (PMCIDs). PMCIDs are only available for a subset of PMIDs, primarily limited to those papers published in open access journals. A very useful extraction feature provided by the PubTator API is that applications need not have <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> knowledge of the PMCID to secure metadata associated with full text; knowledge of the PMID is sufficient for full-text extraction. Given that CTD is solely PMID-centric, the ability to extract full-text annotations using PMIDs is extremely beneficial.</p><p>The PubTator API supports three different output formats, including two that are BioC-based (BioC-XML or BioC-JSON). This was an important factor in our positive evaluation not only because CTD was already familiar with BioC, but also because we could address four of the six aforementioned biomedical concepts using a single format translating parser.</p><p>At PubTator&#x02019;s core is AIONER, an effective, robust, cutting-edge deep learning NER transformer model, which is used to target and normalize the six aforementioned biomedical concepts supported by PubTator [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. AIONER has been evaluated against 14 NER benchmark tasks; performance on these benchmark tasks validated that AIONER is an effective, robust tool, matching or surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This was among our most important requirements, and we were very impressed anecdotally with how well AIONER performed.</p><p>In the final analysis, PubTator was not only met with overwhelming approval by the CTD curation team from a qualitative perspective, PubTator successfully fulfilled virtually every CTD evaluation target requirement (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). The tool is state-of-the-art in terms of its effectiveness, addressing the full normalization of four of the six C-G-P-D-A-S biomedical concepts directly to its respective underlying CTD-integrated controlled vocabulary. It provides an online interface our biocurators can use for curation. The online tool is tightly coupled with a Web Service-based API that can be leveraged computationally to generate selectable drop-down lists of concepts for our staff. The interchange format for the APIs is BioC-based, greatly simplifying the translation to CTD. Finally, the tool is built and maintained by NCBI, a respected and, equally importantly, stable organization with which to partner for the long term. Given these factors, we determined that it was a better use of our limited resources to begin integrating PubTator into our curation workflow immediately rather than searching for and evaluating additional NER tools.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>CTD NLP objectives.

As previously discussed, preprocessing provides the fastest online performance and thus is the most efficient option for our curation pipeline. We extract metadata in PubTator&#x02019;s BioC-JSON format, forming the request using a concatenated string of PMIDs, and extracting full-text- or abstract-based biomedical concepts for genes, chemicals, diseases, and species. Each identified biomedical concept is reviewed to determine if it exists in CTD. Note that CTD does not store complete controlled vocabularies, but rather only those concepts that are relevant to our curation mission (e.g. our curation is limited to the <italic toggle="yes">Eumetazoa</italic> branch of NCBI Taxonomy, so only those species are included in CTD). The relevant metadata is then stored in two core PostgreSQL database tables, one organized by reference, and the other organized by biomedical concept within the context of reference.</p><fig position="float" id="F3" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3.</label><caption><p>CTD/PubTator engineering architecture and workflow. In most cases, CTD identifies articles for curation by either targeting specific chemicals or chemical sets from a &#x0201c;Chemical Priority Matrix,&#x0201d; or curating articles from 19 important toxicological journals on an ongoing basis. CTD&#x02019;s Biocuration Manager (circle 1) creates a list of PMIDs from these sources and forwards it to CTD software engineering for preprocessing. A member of the software engineering team (circle 2) takes the list and executes a process (circle 3) to extract metadata from PubTator by PMID using PubTator&#x02019;s API; the metadata is returned to the process from PubTator in BioC-JSON format (circle 4). The metadata is then stored in a CTD Postgres database (circle 5). Once the preprocessing is complete, the Biocuration Manager assigns the PMIDs to the biocurators for curation. The CAPP computationally extracts the metadata from Postgres by PMID during curation (circle 6), assisting the biocurators with term identification and normalization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="baaf013f3" position="float"/></fig><p>The minimal modifications required to the CAPP&#x02019;s user interface were implemented as nonintrusively as possible. A new &#x0201c;Text Mining Summary&#x0201d; button was added to enable users to execute a report which provides an overview of the NLP-related activity associated with the reference (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). The report provides an option to view the abstract, either on the page or via a hyperlink to PubTator. It is segregated into four sections, one each for genes, chemicals, diseases, and species. The report provides only those terms integrated into CTD. Hyperlinks are provided for each biomedical concept to CTD and the respective source controlled vocabularies provider. PubTator not only identifies suspected genes that appear in the text, but also attempts to determine the species and appropriate accession of the gene (given that NCBI Gene accessions are species-specific); consequently, the report provides each gene&#x02019;s primary term along with its nominal text-mined species.</p><fig position="float" id="F4" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4.</label><caption><p>Text mining summary report.

The user may click on the <italic toggle="yes">TEXT MINING SUMMARY</italic> button to execute the Text Mining Summary Report for the respective reference (circle 2).

The process is largely unchanged with one major exception: Rather than biocurators having to normalize and then enter terms into chemical, disease, gene, and species fields, drop-down lists are provided containing the fully normalized, CTD-validated concepts provided by PubTator. Biocurators may choose to select entries from those drop-down lists or enter their own valid terms. Similar auto-fill, drop-down schemes have been found to have accelerated task completion time by 49% compared with manual normalization and entry [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F5" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5.</label><caption><p>CTD/pubtator integration.

An excerpt is provided of the Text Mining Summary Report (circle 2), which summarizes the chemicals identified by PubTator that are relevant to CTD. The fully normalized MeSH chemical terms are aggregated to create a distinct list of chemicals identified by PubTator (circle 3). CTD biocurators can use this list to enter an interaction during curation via the CTD CAPP&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Interaction Entry Page</italic> (circle 4).

This is important because identifying the correct gene symbol is the most time-consuming aspect of CTD biocuration.

On the contrary, CTD biocurators have found PubTator to be highly effective at identifying key biomedical concepts, confirming anecdotally the results of the aforementioned PubTator benchmark testing. There are, however, many instances where PubTator correctly identifies a biomedical concept that does not fall within the necessary requirements for CTD curation. For example, an abstract may include the following sentence: &#x0201c;Noncoding RNAs including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been documented to play prominent role in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD).&#x0201d; In this case, although PubTator may correctly identify &#x0201c;neurodegenerative diseases&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Parkinson&#x02019;s disease&#x0201d; as cited diseases, the sentence contains no association between the cited diseases and specific chemicals or genes; consequently, it will not be used for CTD curation.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>We have not yet completed all of the desired objectives with respect to this project; we still expect to integrate NER tools into our curation process for anatomical terms and phenotypes (i.e. GO).
