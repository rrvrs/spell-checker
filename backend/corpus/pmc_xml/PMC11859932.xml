Epidemiological studies have established a complex relationship between cannabis consumption and a heightened risk of psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. However, this connection is multifaceted, influenced by genetics, environment, and individual psychology. Surprisingly, despite a surge in emergency room (ER) visits associated with cannabis consumption and psychosis, there haven&#x02019;t been significant increases in hospital readmissions. This rise in ER visits can be attributed to the increasing social acceptance of cannabis and its legalization in some regions, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects. Furthermore, the higher potency of contemporary cannabis can trigger psychotic reactions, particularly in those consuming elevated levels of THC, its primary psychoactive component.</p></sec><sec id="sec3968"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to compare the rates of readmissions and ER visits one year after hospital discharge among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, stratified by cannabis consumption.</p></sec><sec id="sec3969"><title>Methods</title><p>We collected sociodemographic and clinical data from 109 patients after discharge from a psychiatric hospitalization unit.</p></sec><sec id="sec3970"><title>Results</title><p>Patients who consumed cannabis (N=35) were younger than non-consumers (M=31.4; SD=10.0 vs M=44.3; SD=11.4; t(107)=5.71; p&#x0003c;.01), with no significant gender differences, hospital stay durations, or proportions of schizophrenia diagnoses (33.3%).

This study reveals that patients with psychosis and cannabis consumption tend to visit ER services more frequently despite utilizing fewer hospital resources like hospitalizations. Notably, despite the increased ER visits, there hasn&#x02019;t been a corresponding rise in hospital readmissions. These would be due to individuals experiencing cannabis-related psychotic episodes receiving suitable assessment and treatment in the ER, obviating the need for prolonged hospitalization. Furthermore, some psychotic episodes may naturally resolve over time, particularly with reduced or discontinued cannabis consumption. Our result highlights the need for personalized care approaches targeting this group, effectively addressing acute episodes related to cannabis use and psychosis. Addressing this trend requires a multidisciplinary approach involving mental health professionals, addiction specialists, and emergency response teams.</p></sec><sec id="sec3972"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
