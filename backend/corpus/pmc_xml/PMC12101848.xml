</self-uri><abstract><p>The use of plant-based biostimulants is a sustainable strategy to enhance crop growth while mitigating the environmental impact of synthetic agrochemicals. Broccoli by-products, rich in bioactive compounds, have emerged as a promising resource, though their composition is influenced by plant growing conditions. This study investigates the biostimulant potential of broccoli-derived extracts obtained from leaves, stems, and petioles of plants cultivated in three different seasons (autumn, winter, and spring) and their effect on the germination and early growth of pak choi (<italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> subs. <italic toggle="yes">chinensis</italic> L.) seeds. A comprehensive biochemical characterization, including mineral content, glucosinolates, and phenolic compounds, was conducted to explore how seasonal and tissue-specific variations impact their composition and biostimulant efficacy. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed distinct metabolic profiles across seasons and plant tissues, with leaf-derived extracts showing higher correlations with phenolic acids and trace minerals, whereas petiole and stem extracts were associated with macronutrients. Germination assays demonstrated that extracts from autumn and winter exhibited the highest biostimulant activity, likely due to their enriched secondary metabolite profiles and well-balanced mineral composition. In contrast, spring extracts, despite their higher macronutrient content, showed limited biostimulant effects, possibly due to physiological constraints in broccoli plants during spring, when they experience reduced bioactive potential. PCA and correlation analysis identified metabolites, particularly sinapic acid and glucobrassicin, as key contributors to enhanced seedling development. Furthermore, a positive relationship between sulfur content and glucosinolate levels suggests that sulfur concentration could serve as a useful quality marker for assessing the bioactivity of broccoli-based biostimulants. This study underscores the potential of broccoli-derived extracts as sustainable biostimulants for improving germination and seedling development in pak choi. The findings highlight the influence of seasons on the bioactive composition of extracts, with low temperatures and high relative humidity favoring the accumulation of secondary metabolites and an optimal nutrient balance in plants.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion</institution>

Introduction</title><p>In the contemporary context, there is an imperative for the implementation of valorization and recycling alternatives for all by-product materials generated through agricultural production processes [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, a significant barrier still exists when it comes to translating scientific knowledge into technical application. In response to significant agro-waste generation and in line with the emerging trend of biostimulant application, the use of this material as a source of phytochemicals is a solution that is both practical and viable. Specifically, broccoli stands out as a promising crop due to its high yield and rich bioactive compound profile, making it a valuable resource for the elaboration of biostimulants.</p><p>The large-scale production of broccoli (<italic toggle="yes">Brassica oleracea</italic> L. var. <italic toggle="yes">italica</italic>) and cauliflower generates substantial agricultural by-products, with global production exceeding 25.84 million tons in 2021 (FAOSTAT, 2023). Furthermore, although it is a mild-cool season annual plant, its relatively short growing time allows farmers to obtain multiple harvests per year under a Mediterranean climate, enhancing its economic yield [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, commercial production focuses primarily on the florets and upper stems, leaving substantial by-products such as lower stems, leaves, and petioles. Previous studies, such as Liu et al. (2018) [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], have pointed out the composition of leaves and stems of broccoli &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">Gipsy&#x0201d;</italic> cultivar. In this work, the study of secondary metabolites has demonstrated that broccoli leaves show elevated concentrations of glucosinolates (GSLs), such as hydroxyglucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin, and phenolic compounds. GSLs are defined as key secondary metabolites in Brassica plants. They are essential for defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. Upon tissue damage, they are enzymatically converted into bioactive products. These compounds trigger resistance mechanisms against environmental stresses [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, phenolic acids are included in the secondary metabolism of broccoli. Among them, caffeic and sinapic acids, which are the main ones, have been related to their defense mechanisms and overall plant health [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These phenolic acids possess antioxidant properties that help protect the plant from oxidative stress caused by environmental factors such as UV radiation, drought, and pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>As previously mentioned, plant-derived biostimulants can be defined as complex products whose function is to enhance or benefit diverse physiological processes, such as nutrient uptake and efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress and crop quality [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, biostimulants can be applied at various stages of plant development, including germination, vegetative growth, flowering, and fruit production [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the utilization of biostimulants during the germination stages in order to reduce the nursery time [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this way, it has been demonstrated that extracts derived from broccoli by-products could enhance the growth of broccoli seedlings by reducing oxidative stress and regulating essential metabolic pathways [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, despite these findings, several aspects related to the variability of broccoli extracts and their bioactive potential remain unexplored. It is essential to consider the impact of sowing time, growth phase and seasonal variation on the secondary metabolism of these broccoli by-products, in order to determine the composition of the subsequent biostimulants that will be industrially produced. Previous studies have found that the highest concentrations of GSLs were observed in field conditions during spring, in contrast to autumn and winter [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the age of the plant significantly affects the accumulation of metabolites, indicating that the stage of development, as well as seasonal timing, should be carefully considered to optimize the nutritional and functional profile of broccoli [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In summary, the bioactive profile and biostimulant potential of broccoli extracts are shaped by the morphology of different tissues, their biochemical composition, and seasonal environmental conditions. Understanding these seasonal variations is essential for optimizing the use of broccoli by-products as bioactive extracts. Moreover, previous studies have largely focused on individual compounds, overlooking the interactions between macro- and micronutrients and secondary metabolites. This gap limits our understanding of how these components work synergistically to enhance biostimulant activity.</p><p>Pak choi (<italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> subsp. <italic toggle="yes">chinensis</italic> L.) is an under-studied brassica crop, but increasingly valued in the market for its nutritional benefits and agricultural potential. Also known as bok choy, it is a widely cultivated leafy vegetable, particularly in Asia, where it is an essential component of the diet due to its rich content of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions and short cultivation cycle makes it a highly efficient crop for sustainable agricultural practices [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unlike Arabidopsis, which is widely used in research but has limited agronomic relevance, pak choi represents a commercially important crop with practical applications, providing an effective model for evaluating the potential benefits of plant-derived extracts [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>For all these reasons, the main hypothesis of our study is that broccoli-derived extracts from leaves, stems, and petioles of plants cultivated under three different environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) during autumn, winter, and spring in greenhouse conditions would exert a different biostimulant activity on pak choi seed germination. It was further anticipated that seasonal variations and plant tissues would influence the mineral content and secondary metabolite profiles of the extracts, thereby affecting their biostimulant potential. Addressing the identified gaps, the aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between nutrients, secondary metabolites, and seedling development, in order to provide insights into the potential formulation of customized extracts with enhanced efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2.

A positive correlation was also found with the phenolic compound sinapic acid (<italic toggle="yes">R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001</italic>), as well as with the two GSLs detected in the extracts, glucoraphanin (<italic toggle="yes">R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01</italic>) and glucobrassicin (<italic toggle="yes">R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.46, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001</italic>) (<xref rid="pone.0323848.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). Furthermore, <xref rid="pone.0323848.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref> illustrates the interrelationships between all the variables, that is, all the components of the extracts. Some of these interrelationships are particularly noteworthy, such as the correlations between chlorogenic acid and Ca and Ni, or the correlation between S with sinapic acid and glucobrassicin. Additionally, it is worth noting that there are strong positive correlations between carbon and nitrogen with all macronutrients.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323848.g011"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323848.g011</object-id><label>Fig 11</label><caption><title>Overall correlation analysis of broccoli extracts components.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Correlation coefficients of seedling weight with various variables, including micronutrients, macronutrients, phenolics, and glucosinolates.

Discussion</title><p>The seasonal variation in glucosinolate content of field-grown broccoli has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, it has been previously demonstrated that broccoli extracts rich in secondary metabolites promote shoot development while also creating a memory effect in plants, enhancing their growth at later stages [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, using broccoli by-products from various seasons, it became crucial to determine how this seasonal variability (<xref rid="pone.0323848.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) impacted the composition of extracts derived from broccoli by-products (stems, petioles and leaves). Furthermore, to assess the potential stimulatory effect of these extracts, we analyzed their composition in relation to pak choi germination (<xref rid="pone.0323848.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> 2). This research holds particular relevance for the agricultural industry, as it seeks to standardize germination conditions, optimize sprout size, and accelerate the transition from seedbed to field [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In order to gain an understanding of the physiological state of the plants from which the extracts would be obtained, biomass determinations (FW and DW) and nutrient profile analysis of the aerial parts were conducted. While no significant differences in FW were observed between autumn and winter, a notable reduction in FW was recorded in plants harvested after three months in spring. This decline coincided with higher temperatures (25&#x02013;30&#x000b0;C) towards the end of the experimental period, suggesting that increased temperature-induced water loss may have contributed to biomass reduction. Elevated temperatures accelerate water evaporation, which not only decreases overall water content but also may impair biomass accumulation. Therefore, it is likely that the reduced biomass observed in spring could be partly attributed to water stress, which affects not only the overall water content but also the plants&#x02019; ability to accumulate fresh biomass.</p><p>A clear distinction in mineral nutrient composition was observed between broccoli plants cultivated in spring and those grown in other seasons, suggesting that elevated temperatures significantly influence both nutrient uptake and overall yield. These enhancements have been reported to be related to temperature-dependent alterations in nutrient transport and absorption, processes that are closely linked to transpiration rates, which tend to increase under high-temperature conditions [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite the seasonal variation in FW, DW remained stable, indicating that FW differences were primarily due to reduced water content rather than biomass accumulation. The primary nutrient shifts included a decrease in P and an increase in B. Interestingly, B uptake, unlike that of other nutrients, appears unaffected by elevated temperatures. In fact, studies on tomato plants have shown that B uptake does not diminish at high temperatures; instead, it increases at 35&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A similar trend may explain the higher B levels observed in broccoli plants harvested in spring.</p><p>The composition of broccoli extracts obtained was analyzed to evaluate the impact of the components on their activity in stimulating germination. At the nutrient level, leaf extracts showed significant divergence from those derived from petioles and stems. Seasonally, a similar trend to that of the plant was observed, with spring extracts diverging most significantly from those obtained in autumn and winter. However, the overall composition of the extracts was not significantly influenced by the development stage of broccoli plants (1.5 or 3 months). This suggests that seasonal environmental factors, such as temperature and water availability, play a more dominant role than plant age in shaping the nutrient composition of the extracts. The regulation of nutrient uptake is highly responsive to external conditions, which may override developmental effects. Additionally, the early establishment of metabolic patterns in broccoli could explain the negligible influence of plant age on extract composition.</p><p>With regard to the secondary metabolites examined in the extracts, it is noteworthy that an increase in GSLs and phenolics was observed in the samples derived from the material obtained in the spring season, particularly in the leaves, both at 1.5 months and at 3 months. This may be due to the fact that these metabolites are associated with defense mechanisms against abiotic stresses, such as high temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and against biotic stresses, such as pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed, higher temperatures generally promote the proliferation and spread of plant pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, plants would increase the production of defensive compounds to protect themselves and accumulate them in the leaves, as they are the main photosynthetic and metabolically active organs, which are particularly susceptible to pathogen attack.</p><p>Moreover, although the extraction process enriched phenolic compounds and GSLs, very low levels of glucoraphanin were detected in the winter and the spring samples. These samples were obtained from plants grown under conditions of higher temperature stress than those obtained from autumn samples. It is probable that the plant was degrading compounds such as glucoraphanin to yield their degradation products, which are distinguished by heightened bioactivity relative to the GSLs themselves [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This hypothesis aligns with the findings of a study conducted under drought conditions, which revealed that the accumulation of aliphatic GSLs did not directly enhance stress tolerance. However, increasing the content of GSL degradation products, such as ITCs, may contribute to enhancing tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this way, the degradation product of glucoraphanin, sulforaphane, may be produced in the aerial part of broccoli plants as a defense mechanism against temperature stress.</p><p>Regarding germination-stimulating activity, extracts obtained in autumn and winter exhibited the strongest effects, whereas those from spring had a more limited impact (<xref rid="pone.0323848.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0323848.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> 1B). Autumn extracts contained higher concentrations of secondary metabolites, whereas spring extracts showed elevated levels of micro- and macronutrients (<xref rid="pone.0323848.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> 1A). However, the increased macronutrient levels in spring extracts had a comparatively lower influence on seedling development. Notably, these treatments also demonstrated a high concentration of chlorogenic acid and boron. Recently, it has been reported that plants are capable of generating chlorogenoborate complexes, which may have been formed as a result of these high concentrations. Since these complexes have not been extensively investigated, their elevated concentrations could potentially exert a detrimental impact on plant growth [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Winter extracts, by contrast, displayed a balanced composition of these components. Excessive mineral nutrients in the growth medium can induce oxidative and osmotic stress in seeds and seedlings, as high nutrient levels can alter root-zone pH, ultimately significantly reducing shoot growth, as demonstrated in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, the most beneficial effects of spring extracts were observed at lower dilutions, suggesting that reduced nutrient concentrations may promote growth even in the presence of fewer secondary metabolites. This could be explained by a hormetic effect, where low concentrations of certain nutrients act as biostimulants, while excessive levels may induce osmotic stress and negatively impact germination [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Additionally, some secondary metabolites, such as phenolics and GSLs, may exert inhibitory or allelopathic effects at high concentrations, which could limit germination and seedling growth [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, the optimal balance between nutrient availability and metabolite concentration in diluted extracts likely enhances germination by minimizing potential stressors while still providing essential growth-promoting elements.</p><p>Several macro- and micronutrients present in the extracts demonstrated a positive correlation with seedling weight, indicating that these elements exert a biostimulant effect at appropriate concentrations (<xref rid="pone.0323848.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Notably, K and S contents of the extracts were strongly correlated with each other. K is considered essential to ensure optimal plant growth as it is an activator of enzymes involved in protein synthesis, sugar transport or C and N metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, S is an essential nutrient, as it serves as a structural component of proteins, vitamins, and cofactors required for proper plant growth and development. In fact, a large amount of S is required during seed development [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and in a study where an external source of additional S was applied to bean, pea, wheat, and maize seeds, germination success and seedling size increased while the time to germination decreased [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>When comparing different aerial tissues as leaf, stem and petiole, the best results in autumn and winter were obtained from stem extracts, while in spring, extracts from 3-month-old leaves showed superior efficacy. These leaves contain lower levels of macronutrients but are rich in glucobrassicin and sinapic acid, which may explain their growth-stimulating effects. This aligns with our previous findings that glucobrassicin promotes shoot growth [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The correlation analysis supports this, showing a strong positive relationship between GSLs and phenolic compounds in the extracts and seedling weight, highlighting the significant role of secondary metabolites in enhancing growth (<xref rid="pone.0323848.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Specifically, sinapic acid exhibits a strong correlation with shoot weight and is most abundant in the autumn extracts, which have shown the most pronounced biostimulant effect. Recent research has explored the biostimulant potential of phenolic compounds, showing that these compounds, when applied either foliarly or through the roots, can increase biomass and photosynthesis in mature plants [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], as well as promote germination, rooting, sprouting [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and adventitious roots formation in shoots [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is clear that sinapic acid and glucobrassicin significantly influence the development of pak choi seedlings, as demonstrated by the results with autumn extracts. In contrast, the germination test using spring extracts did not produce similarly positive outcomes. Despite the high levels of sinapic acid, caffeic acid, and glucobrassicin in the leaf extracts, these also contained elevated concentrations of micronutrients such as B, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Si, which may have toxic effects. Moreover, the dose-dependent effect observed when seeds were treated with specific extracts&#x02014;particularly those from spring samples&#x02014;appeared to diminish. This could be due to the excessive mineral content in these extracts.</p><p>The correlation found between total S content in the aerial parts of broccoli plants and the GSLs content in the extracts is particularly valuable (<xref rid="pone.0323848.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). This relationship suggests that S content could serve as a reliable quality marker for estimating the GSLs levels in extracts derived from broccoli by-products, providing a straightforward analysis tool to assess the bioactive potential of these biostimulants. Given that GSLs may represent up to 30% of the total sulfur content in plants, their accumulation is closely linked to the overall sulfur status of the plant [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that sulfur levels are often correlated with GSL content, as shown by the increased GSL concentrations associated with an increase in the sulfur content of the plants, which also depends on the nutritional supply [<xref rid="pone.0323848.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, during standard sulfate fertilization (1&#x02009;mM), the relationship has not been established until now. This insight enables more efficient quality control in the production of GSLs, ensuring consistency and bioactive efficacy across batches by monitoring sulfur as an indirect indicator of GSL content.</p><p>Notwithstanding the valuable information provided by this study on the seasonal variability and biostimulant potential of broccoli extracts, certain constraints need to be noted. Firstly, the sample size was limited to specific seasonal conditions and to a single broccoli variety, which may restrict the generalizability of the results to other cultivars or growing conditions. Furthermore, the study concentrated predominantly on the biochemical composition of the extracts and their effects on germination and seedling growth, overlooking other potential physiological effects on plant development. To comprehensively elucidate the underlying mechanisms, further studies incorporating specific metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses are essential. Notwithstanding these limitations, the study underscores significant trends that may inform future research and the development of optimized biostimulant formulations.</p><p>In summary, the differential effectiveness of broccoli extracts across seasons can be attributed to the distinct nutrient and secondary metabolite profiles influenced by environmental conditions. Autumn and winter extracts (characterized by low temperatures and high relative humidity), exhibited higher concentrations of secondary metabolites and a balanced nutrient composition, making them more effective biostimulants for seedling growth. In contrast, spring extracts (characterized by high temperatures and low relative humidity), rich in macronutrients, demonstrated limited effectiveness, which may correspond to the fact that broccoli plants were growing less during this season. The elevated mineral nutrient content in spring extracts could also lead to oxidative and osmotic stress at higher concentrations, potentially inhibiting growth. Furthermore, the observed positive correlations between specific compounds, such as sinapic acid and glucobrassicin, and the seedlings growth underscore the significance of secondary metabolites in promoting seedling development. These findings highlight the necessity of considering both nutrient types and concentrations, along with seasonal variability and plant developmental stages, in biostimulant formulation. Additionally, understanding the specific differences between extracts from various plant parts could be key for the elaboration of &#x02018;&#x000e0; la carte&#x02019; extracts, which can be customized to contain specific levels of particular nutrients or elements to develop more precise and targeted applications. Finally, the strong correlation between sulfur content and GSLs levels indicates the potential of sulfur determination as a simple quality marker for estimating the bioactive potential of broccoli extracts, aiding in the standardization and optimization of their use as biostimulants.</p></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323848.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Mineral content analysis.</title><p>Nutrients in the aerial part of broccoli plants at the different harvesting points (1.5 and 3 months) and seasons (autumn, winter, and spring).
