Herein, we present two cases in which AIG was found to be a complication during follow-up of PBC, both histologically diagnosed as AIG with positive autoantibodies and also serologically typical for AIG, including pepsinogen and gastrin. In the first case, a 60-year-old woman with PBC was suspected of having AIG based on endoscopic findings. A definitive diagnosis of AIG was established based on a positive anti-parietal cell antibody test and characteristic histologic findings. The patient exhibited a low pepsinogen I level (5.5 pg/mL; normal: &#x0003e;70 pg/mL) and hypergastrinemia (637 pg/mL; normal: 37-172 pg/mL). Additionally, she was diagnosed with Hashimoto&#x02019;s thyroiditis, confirmed by the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and an enlarged thyroid gland.</p><p>In the second case, a 70-year-old woman with PBC was suspected of having AIG due to the low pepsinogen I level (5.8 pg/mL). The definitive diagnosis was established based on the presence of positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies and characteristic histologic findings. The patient also exhibited hypergastrinemia (2845 pg/mL), but no additional autoimmune diseases were observed. In reviewing past case reports, we identified seven previous reports of AIG with PBC other than our two cases. Approximately half (4/9) were macrocytic anemia, and approximately half (4/9) were positive for anti-thyroid antibodies, which is higher than that expected for conventional PBC. Because AIG should not be misdiagnosed because of the high frequency of associated malignancies, other concomitant autoimmune diseases, and vitamin B12 deficiency, it should be considered in the surveillance of PBC, especially in those with macrocytic anemia or positive antithyroid antibodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>anti-thyroid antibody</kwd><kwd>autoimmune disease</kwd><kwd>autoimmune gastritis</kwd><kwd>macrocytic anemia</kwd><kwd>primary biliary cholangitis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is now widely understood by clinicians, and it has become clear that it is more common than previously expected [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Accurately diagnosing the disease is crucial because gastric cancer and neuroendocrine tumors are frequent complications [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the disease can trigger other autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as well as neurological disorders and macrocytic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. However, the diagnostic criteria vary, and some aspects remain ambiguous. In Japan, autoantibody seropositivity (anti-parietal cell antibody and/or anti-intrinsic antibody) and findings compatible with AIG in either endoscopic or histologic findings have been used as diagnostic criteria by clinicians [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, some researchers believe that AIG cannot be diagnosed without histology. There are also cases where accurate diagnosis is difficult because of false-positive or false-negative results for autoantibodies or when AIG is not accurately suspected by histology. Thus, it is important to educate pathologists about the typical pathological findings of AIG. Pepsinogen and gastrin levels are often abnormal in AIG due to the disappearance of chief cells and hypergastrinemia induced by hypoacidity. This suggests that AIG can be predicted using a cutoff value of these serological markers [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>As already mentioned, AIG is often complicated by other autoimmune diseases. Hashimoto&#x02019;s thyroiditis is the most common autoimmune complication of AIG, but type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome, and vitiligo can also occur [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic, autoimmune-related progressive cholestasis common among middle-aged women, also occurs frequently in combination with other autoimmune diseases, and the most common of these are rheumatoid arthritis, Raynaud&#x02019;s phenomenon, and Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A report revealed that AIG occurred in three of 111 cases (3%) in patients with PBC [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, 4% of patients with PBC have pernicious anemia, most of whom are speculated to have advanced-stage AIG [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The prevalence of anti-intrinsic factor antibody positivity for AIG in PBC is 3.8% [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the estimated incidence of AIG in PBC is approximately 3-4%. However, there are few reports regarding the clinical picture of AIG complicated with PBC.</p><p>This article presents two cases of AIG identified during follow-up for PBC and reviews previously reported cases of PBC and AIG complications. In particular, we discuss what clinical background of PBC should be considered concerning the possibility of AIG complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>Case 1</p><p>A woman in her 60s was diagnosed with asymptomatic PBC in her 50s.

Case 1 was initially diagnosed based on typical endoscopic findings, and Case 2 was initially diagnosed using PG test results. We conducted a PubMed search to identify related cases and found seven cases in which the clinical information was evaluated among the cases of AIG co-existing with PBC. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of the nine patients, including two from our report, eight were positive for either anti-parietal cell or anti-intrinsic factor antibodies and met the pathological criteria for AIG. The remaining patient tested positive for anti-intrinsic factor antibodies and showed atrophic changes predominantly in the corpus on endoscopy, although no histological evaluation was performed. Consequently, all patients met the Japanese diagnostic criteria reported by Kamada et al. [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the laboratory findings of these cases, macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume &#x0003e;100 fL and hemoglobin level &#x0003c;11.4 g/dL in females) was observed in four cases (44%). Anti-thyroid antibody positivity was also observed in four cases (44%). The reported rate of macrocytic anemia in AIG ranges from 39.1% to 50% [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the rate of anti-thyroid antibody positivity ranges from 38% to 53% [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], similar to cases with AIG co-existing with PBC. The gastrin levels of the nine previously reported cases (475-2955 pg/mL) are similar to those reported in an AIG case series (median: 1310 pg/mL [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and mean: 2845 pg/mL [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Therefore, it is thought that most of the reported cases of AIG complicated with PBC showed typical laboratory findings similar to advanced florid-phase AIG.</p><p>However, as approximately half of the cases showed macrocytic anemia and positive anti-thyroid antibodies, our findings were unexpectedly higher in patients with AIG complicated with PBC than in many patients with PBC alone, which is an important finding.

Therefore, it is necessary to perform regular upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to check for esophageal varices, which can lead to fatal complications when managing PBC. Most patients with PBC regularly undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; thus, there are several chances to detect AIG. However, endoscopists who are unaware of the characteristic findings can misdiagnose AIG. It should be noted that during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a patient with PBC, characteristic findings for AIG, such as corpus-predominant atrophy, a sticky adherent mucus, a remnant oxyntic mucosa, and characteristic hyperplastic polyps, should not be overlooked. If in doubt, checking for autoantibodies, such as anti-parietal cell antibodies, as well as the pathological findings, including the disappearance of parietal cells or enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia based on chromogranin A staining, should be performed to evaluate for AIG. The differential diagnosis is <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastritis with advanced atrophy. <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastritis is diagnosed by antrum-predominant atrophy, which is different from that of AIG, which shows corpus-predominant atrophy. In addition, some hypothesize that there are cases in which findings not normally seen in PBC are observed, such as iron deficiency anemia (seen in early AIG) and peripheral neuropathy caused by vitamin B12 deficiency; these observations could be due to a lack of intrinsic factors associated with parietal cell destruction. In such cases, AIG should also be suspected, and examinations for the same autoantibodies and pathologies described above should be performed.</p><p>A prior report suggested a possible link between PBC and AIG via <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but this has not been definitively proven. However, in four of the nine cases we reviewed, PBC, AIG, and anti-thyroid antibodies were all positive, suggesting that some autoimmune mechanisms at work are not coincidental.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An accurate diagnosis of AIG is important in daily clinical practice because of the high incidence of 1) malignancies, 2) other systemic autoimmune diseases, and 3) vitamin B12 deficiency. Here, we presented two cases of AIG associated with PBC. After reviewing previous case reports, we suggest that the possibility of AIG complicating PBC, which has characteristic findings, should be considered. Considering that about half of the cases of PBC with AIG exhibited pernicious anemia or were positive for anti-thyroid autoantibodies, we suggest considering the possibility of AIG in patients with such symptoms, especially those with PBC. Even in the absence of macrocytic anemia or thyroid autoantibodies, attention should be paid to corpus-predominant atrophy during endoscopic examinations of patients with PBC, and autoantibody measurements and pathological examinations should be performed to ensure a thorough evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Aya Sasaki, Clinical Laboratory, Tokyo Dental College, Ichikawa General Hospital, Japan, for her advice on the histological findings.
