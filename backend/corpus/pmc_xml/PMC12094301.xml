A lack of such care often stems from a combination of issues, including financial hardship, limited education, challenges in accessing healthcare, inadequate medical services, and insufficient social support. The study aimed to assess how iron supplements given during prenatal care affect the prevalence of anemia and whether lack of prenatal care leads to increased maternal and fetal morbidity. This analysis is based on the retrospective evaluation of medical data from 125 patients admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Sf. Pantelimon Hospital in Bucharest, Romania, from August 2024 to February 2025. The parameters considered in this study include prenatal care access, mode of delivery, antepartum anemia and its severity, iron supplementation, postpartum anemia and the necessity of blood transfusions, and length of hospitalization. The link between prenatal care and reduced antepartum anemia underscores the importance of monitoring during pregnancy to mitigate risks. Postpartum hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in patients who received prenatal care, leading to a decrease in severe and moderate anemia cases. Additionally, prenatal care was associated with shorter hospital stays for newborns. Comprehensive prenatal care demonstrably enhanced both maternal and neonatal prognoses across the continuum of pregnancy and the puerperium, thereby contributing to a significant reduction in rates of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prenatal care</kwd><kwd>antenatal care</kwd><kwd>high-risk pregnancy</kwd><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>iron deficiency</kwd><kwd>blood transfusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Prenatal visits promote maternal and fetal health by carefully monitoring risk factors and treatment of complications as soon as they arise [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Clinical and psychological outcomes during pregnancy and the postpartum period are improved by proper prenatal care, thus reducing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lack of prenatal care refers to the insufficient or complete absence of medical care and support provided to a pregnant woman during her pregnancy [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The main pathologies observed that are associated with the lack of prenatal visits are premature birth, intrauterine growth restriction, or low birth weight, as well as the occurrence of anemia and maternal or fetal infections in the prenatal or postnatal period [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the lack of prenatal care is mainly the result of the negative impact of several factors, including socioeconomic factors, such as low income and lack of education, difficult access to health services, the quality of medical services, and lack of social support [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Over time, certain categories of patients have been identified as more likely to attend fewer prenatal visits and, in some cases, receive no prenatal care until delivery [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Financial barriers, particularly the pregnant woman's economic situation, play a major role in limiting access to care [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has been shown that a precarious financial situation is extremely detrimental to the degree of prenatal care, which is why free health services during pregnancy have been tried to remedy this problem. Unfortunately, other frequently encountered risk factors lead to the absence of prenatal visits, such as lack of education in the population [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>A low level of education has been strongly associated with the absence of prenatal care, making it one of the main reasons for limited access to medical assistance in general [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, higher levels of education have been linked to better pregnancy monitoring, even among women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, various studies have shown that pregnant women without a partner tend to have fewer prenatal visits compared to those who are married, as partner support during pregnancy encourages adherence to prenatal care programs [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In contrast, the lack of support from the partner contributes to the lack of prenatal care, with a reduced number of consultations during pregnancy [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Multiparity has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for the lack of prenatal care compared to primiparity [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies have shown that multiparous women, especially those without a history of obstetric complications, are less likely to seek medical services during pregnancy, especially those who do not have family support [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, a short interval between two pregnancies has also been associated with reduced utilization of prenatal care services [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It has been shown that patients who have had unpleasant experiences with the hospital environment&#x02014; whether during prenatal visits, childbirth, or the postpartum period&#x02014;often develop increased resistance to prenatal care recommendations and frequently reject the idea of attending prenatal consultations [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To address this issue and rebuild trust in the medical system, several measures should be considered to create a more favorable environment, such as respect for patients, for their questions, time, and problems, increasing accessibility through a predictable environment, flexibility, responsiveness, and overall patient-centered care [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Another group at increased risk of inadequate prenatal care includes young women, particularly adolescents. Similarly, advanced maternal age, particularly in women over 40 years, has also been linked to lower rates of prenatal care utilization [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, it has been shown that pregnant patients who use tobacco, alcohol, or illegal substances are at increased risk of receiving poor prenatal care [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unplanned pregnancies are also directly associated with reduced utilization of medical services during pregnancy if the pregnancy is continued [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is important to note that a significant proportion of maternal deaths are caused by complications related to abortion [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Unwanted pregnancies can be associated with unsafe abortion techniques, which can lead to increased maternal mortality, and the prevention of unwanted pregnancies is a critical point in health systems [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Psychological factors, such as denial of pregnancy or depressive syndromes, are also major reasons why some patients avoid prenatal visits [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Access to prenatal services, however, depends not only on the availability, quality of care, facilities, and financial resources but also on the woman&#x02019;s perception of the need for prenatal visits and whether she considers them useful and acceptable [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, cultural and religious values also impact this decision [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, multiple studies have identified patient groups more likely to receive appropriate and comprehensive prenatal care. These include women with multiple pregnancies, comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, a history of antepartum vaginal bleeding, or diagnosed anxiety disorders [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In some cases, an excess of prenatal visits can even be observed, with no real benefit on the outcome of the pregnancy, but with excessive and improper use of financial resources [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Anemia in pregnancy is a significant public health concern impacting women around the world, with prevalence rates differing across regions [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This variation is significantly influenced by economic status, healthcare access, nutritional deficiencies (particularly iron and folic acid), and comorbidities [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 37% of pregnant women globally are affected by anemia, with particularly high rates noted in low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recent statistics indicate that the prevalence of gestational anemia in Romania is 25.3% [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Maternal anemia is linked to a heightened risk of negative pregnancy outcomes [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During pregnancy, anemia can compromise maternal health, contributing to complications such as premature rupture of membranes and postpartum hemorrhage. In addition, it negatively impacts fetal development, raising the likelihood of low birth weight, preterm delivery, and neonatal asphyxia [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mechanisms behind these outcomes are complex and biologically plausible. Anemia reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of maternal blood, prompting compensatory adjustments within the body [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For example, the body increases cardiovascular and peripheral vascular pressure to satisfy the oxygen requirements of the fetus, which can lead to gestational hypertension [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Anemia reduces hemoglobin levels in maternal blood, diminishing its oxygen-carrying capacity and limiting the fetus&#x02019;s access to adequate oxygen, which could result in hypoxia and asphyxia [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Postpartum hemorrhage is a major cause of mortality, and several studies have shown that severe anemia during pregnancy elevates the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, which may be linked to increased nitric oxide secretion and decreased contractility of uterine smooth muscles [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Postpartum anemia is defined as a decrease in hemoglobin levels below 11 g/dl within the first 42 days following delivery [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In developing countries, the prevalence of postpartum anemia ranges from 50% to 80% [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Research indicates that women who were anemic before delivery are about four times more likely to experience postpartum anemia than those who were not anemic [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Maternal health issues associated with postpartum anemia include depression, fatigue, and cognitive impairment, which can lead to decreased physical and mental performance, potentially affecting the bonding between mother and child and reducing the duration of breastfeeding [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The research gap highlights the need to consider diverse populations and geographical variability. This study specifically focuses on Romania, where access to prenatal care may be limited in certain regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|method" id="S2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>The fundamental objective of prenatal care is to optimize the health status of pregnant women and the fetus by carefully monitoring risk factors and providing early therapeutic intervention in the event of complications. Adequate pregnancy monitoring significantly improves clinical and psychological outcomes both during the gestation and postpartum periods.</p><p>The hypothesis of this study was based on the suspicion that antenatal care reduces maternal and fetal morbidity by decreasing the number of cases of anemia during pregnancy and postpartum and by reducing the number of days of hospitalization. In order to rigorously validate the formulated working hypothesis, the following specific objectives were established, each aimed at contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the investigated phenomena and providing a solid foundation for the conclusions of the study:</p><p>

</p><p>Following data collection, an Excel database was created for statistical analysis. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0 (30-day trial version), Armonk, NY: IBM Corp was used to process the data. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables are presented with descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Associations between categorical variables were assessed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test when chi-square assumptions were not met. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the degree of correlation between parameters.

Medical care appears to be more common among older individuals, reflecting an increased need for monitoring with advancing age or improved access to healthcare services.

These findings suggest that primiparity may increase the likelihood of receiving prenatal care (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0,05). The results suggest a possible inequality in access to healthcare services for women with multiple children. This may be related to available resources, the prioritization of younger or smaller groups, or other social or medical barriers.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Correlations between parity and access to prenatal care</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMedLife-18-306-g002" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="S3_2"><title>Correlations between prenatal care and mode of delivery</title><p>Regarding the method of delivery, 38,4% of patients gave birth vaginally, while the majority (61,6%) underwent c-section.

By comparison, antenatal care patients had a higher average Hb level and Hct values, indicating fewer cases of severe anemia. Furthermore, MCH values were slightly higher in the prenatal care group. The WBC was lower in the group who received prenatal care, indicating fewer infections or inflammations.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Descriptive analysis of hematological parameters</p></caption><table frame="border" rules="all"><thead valign="top"><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="2">Prenatal care</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">

As for iron supplementation, antepartum iron administration did not appear to directly influence the need for postpartum transfusion. However, the need for transfusion might be better explained by factors such as the severity of prenatal anemia, blood loss during delivery, or other obstetrical complications.</p></sec><sec id="S3_10"><title>Correlations between prenatal care and length of hospital stay</title><p>A significant difference was observed in the length of hospital stay for infants based on maternal prenatal care status (t = 2.737, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007).

These visits facilitate the systematic monitoring of various physiological parameters, enabling the early detection of potential complications such as anemia, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and infections [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Timely intervention and appropriate treatment of these conditions can significantly mitigate adverse outcomes, reducing the need for extended hospital stays following birth [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The benefits of prenatal care extend beyond the purely clinical domain, encompassing improvements in psychological well-being during pregnancy and postpartum. By providing education, counseling, and emotional support, prenatal care empowers women to make informed decisions about their health and the health of their infants, fostering a sense of control and reducing anxiety [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Although the proportions were relatively similar, a marginal majority of patients in this cohort did not receive prenatal care services. A statistically significant correlation was observed between advanced maternal age and prenatal care utilization. This may be attributed to a heightened awareness of potential pregnancy-related complications among older individuals, leading to increased engagement with healthcare providers or to improved access to healthcare resources for this demographic. Primiparous women (first-time mothers) demonstrated a greater propensity to enroll in antenatal care programs than multiparous women (those with prior births). These findings suggest a complex interplay between maternal age, parity, and access to or engagement with prenatal care services, warranting further investigation to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential barriers.</p><p>Antepartum anemia was prevalent within a substantial segment of the studied population. Implementing prenatal care interventions was demonstrably associated with a reduced incidence of antepartum anemia, underscoring the critical role of systematic prenatal monitoring in mitigating associated risks. Notably, women who actively participated in prenatal care programs predominantly exhibited mild forms of anemia, with no instances of severe anemia documented within this subgroup. Conversely, the cohort of women who did not receive prenatal care displayed a more heterogeneous distribution of anemia severity, including the presence of severe anemia cases. This disparity highlights the protective effect of prenatal care in preventing the progression of anemia during pregnancy.</p><p>A statistically significant difference was identified in postpartum hemoglobin levels between patients who availed themselves of prenatal care services and those who did not engage in such medical consultations. Specifically, patients who underwent prenatal monitoring had significantly elevated postpartum Hb values compared to their counterparts. This observation underscores the beneficial impact of prenatal care on maternal hematological status following parturition.</p><p>Regarding neonatal outcomes, a significant association was observed between the provision of prenatal care and a reduced duration of hospital stay for newborns. While it is acknowledged that various factors, such as neonatal infections, can influence the length of hospitalization for newborns, and while antepartum anemia does not appear to be a primary determinant, a notable correlation exists between the absence of prenatal care, the administration of antibiotics to newborns, and the overall duration of their hospital stay. This suggests that inadequate prenatal care may contribute to adverse neonatal outcomes, potentially increasing the risk of infections and prolonged hospitalization. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the complex interplay between prenatal care, neonatal health, and hospital length of stay.</p><p>The limitations of this study include a relatively small sample size and the possibility of confounding variables that can influence the results and make it difficult to establish causality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Proper prenatal care plays a vital role in reducing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. By proactively addressing potential health issues, optimizing clinical and psychological outcomes, and promoting healthy behaviors, prenatal care contributes significantly to the overall well-being of pregnant women and their offspring. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the implementation of comprehensive prenatal care programs as a critical strategy for improving reproductive health outcomes and reducing healthcare disparities. Further research is needed to identify and address barriers to prenatal care access, ensuring that all women, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location, can benefit from these essential services. Investment in prenatal care represents a cost-effective approach to promoting healthier pregnancies, healthier babies, and healthier communities.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="S6"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sf.
