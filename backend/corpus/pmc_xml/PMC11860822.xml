Introduction</title><p>The outbreak of FMD poses a significant threat to the robust development of animal husbandry and public health safety. Over an extended period, scholars worldwide have dedicated substantial efforts to conducting extensive and in-depth research on this issue [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, antiviral research has emerged as a promising new frontier, achieving remarkable progress. Traditional antiviral strategies have primarily centered on drug and vaccine development. Regarding drug development, scientists have been actively seeking compounds capable of directly inhibiting FMDV activity [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In vaccine development, more efficient and safer production technologies are continuously being explored [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, with the deepening understanding of viral replication mechanisms, it has become increasingly evident that relying solely on traditional methods is insufficient. The importance of exploring new targets and innovative strategies has thus gained prominence. Heavy ion irradiation technology, as a promising novel approach, has garnered considerable attention in the biological field. Numerous studies indicate that radiation can induce cellular mutations that may affect viral replication [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With the deepening understanding of viral replication mechanisms, traditional research methods have gradually revealed their limitations. In recent years, heavy ion irradiation technology, as an emerging biophysical approach, has garnered significant attention in the field of biology. Studies have shown that heavy ion irradiation can induce specific genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications in cells, thereby influencing the regulation of cellular signaling pathways and altering the viral replication environment [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, research on the biological effects of heavy ion irradiation on FMDV and its host remains limited, particularly regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between heavy ions and the virus&#x02013;host system. This presents an important direction for future research.</p><p>At the molecular level, heavy ion irradiation has been demonstrated to modulate the function of <italic toggle="yes">MAVS</italic> (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) and influence viral replication by activating key signaling pathways, such as mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), <italic toggle="yes">NF-&#x003ba;B</italic> (nuclear factor kappa B), and <italic toggle="yes">COX-2</italic> (cyclooxygenase-2) [<xref rid="B8-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These findings are closely related to the replication mechanisms of FMDV. For instance, FMDV infection promotes the translocation of mTOR to lysosomes, enhances the interaction between <italic toggle="yes">mTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Rheb,</italic> and activates the <italic toggle="yes">PI3K/AKT/TSC2/Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K1</italic> signaling pathway to facilitate viral replication [<xref rid="B8-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, the FMDV 2C protein interacts with <italic toggle="yes">Nmi</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">N-myc</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">STAT</italic> interactor) to negatively regulate virus-induced type I interferon production while inducing apoptosis to promote viral replication [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Notably, <italic toggle="yes">MAVS</italic>, as a crucial adaptor protein in the <italic toggle="yes">RLR</italic> (RIG-I-like receptor) pathway, plays a pivotal role in antiviral immunity. Research has revealed that the FMDV structural protein VP3 interacts with <italic toggle="yes">MAVS</italic>, inhibiting its expression by interfering with mRNA synthesis, thereby reducing the host&#x02019;s antiviral capacity and creating favorable conditions for viral replication [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Based on these findings, heavy ion irradiation may modulate the normal functions of host cells, inducing intracellular environmental changes conducive to FMDV replication, thereby promoting viral replication within cells. This characteristic offers new insights for screening cell lines with high replication efficiency and opens new avenues for viral culture techniques in vaccine production.</p><p>Regarding vaccine production, cell suspension culture technology is gradually showing significant advantages. By employing suspension culture and domesticating BHK-21 cells after heavy ion irradiation, we can achieve efficient and stable vaccine production. Suspension culture provides a larger cultivation space, which facilitates rapid cellular proliferation and substantial viral replication. Compared to traditional adherent culture methods, suspension culture not only enhances production efficiency but also reduces costs. In this study, BHK-21 cells were irradiated. After screening and evaluation, the mutant somatic cell line BHK-7 was finally obtained. Under suspension culture conditions, the viral productivity of the BHK-7 cells was markedly higher than that of wild-type BHK-21 cells, providing robust support for large-scale foot-and-mouth disease vaccine production. Additionally, this research offers valuable methodologies and strategies for the development of other vaccine cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-12-00167"><title>2.

Once these cells reached stable growth, they, along with control BHK-21 cells, were diluted to a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Subsequently, FMDV infection was performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 16 h, followed by quantification of the 146S antigen content. As illustrated in <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c, mutant cell lines, such as BHK-7, 15B9, 15B11, c8, 5G3, 5G7, and 20E9K1, exhibited significantly higher 146S antigen levels compared to the control BHK-21 cells, with BHK-7 showing the most pronounced increase. To further investigate the replication efficiency of FMDV in BHK-7 cells, an infection experiment was conducted at an MOI of 1.0 for 16 h. The results, shown in <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a,b, demonstrate that the mutant cells had significantly enhanced FMDV replication, both in terms of complete virus particle (146S) content and viral gene expression levels. Additionally, the TCID<sub>50</sub> of the FMDV-infected BHK-7 cells was evaluated at 4h, 8h, and 16h post-infection. As depicted in <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c, BHK-7 consistently exhibited higher TCID<sub>50</sub> values than BHK-21 at all time points. Notably, the growth rates of BHK-7 and BHK-21 cells were comparable, as shown in <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d. These findings suggest that BHK-7 is a cell line that effectively promotes FMDV replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-vetsci-12-00167"><title>3.3. Adaptation of BHK-7 Cells to Suspension Culture</title><p>Given that cell adaptation to suspension culture is a gradual process, we progressively increased the proportion of the suspension medium by mixing it with the adhesive medium DMEM in varying ratios. Following acclimatization, as illustrated in <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a, mutant BHK-7 successfully adapted to suspension culture and exhibited a growth state comparable to that of the control BHK-21 suspension cells (a cell line used to produce the foot-and-mouth disease vaccine by China Agricultural Veterinary Biology Ltd. Lanzhou, China). <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b demonstrates that the BHK-7-FC cells maintained stable growth and viability over 10 passages. <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c,d indicates that the cell density reached 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL on day 3, with the cell viability exceeding 95%. These results confirm that BHK-7 has successfully undergone suspension adaptation and has been designated as BHK-7-FC for subsequent studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-vetsci-12-00167"><title>3.4. Analysis of Metabolites in BHK-7-FC Suspension Culture</title><p>Key substrates in cell suspension media, including glutamine (GLN), lactate (LAC), glucose (GLUC), and ammonium ions (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), play a crucial role in viral infection and cell growth, serving as critical indicators of the quality of suspension media. The consumption and accumulation of these substrates are directly linked to the energy supply required for cell growth and viral replication. Upon examination, the changes in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, LAC, and GLUC levels in BHK-7-FC cells were not significantly different when compared to control BHK -21 cells (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b&#x02013;d). However, GLN levels were markedly reduced 12 h post-infection with FMDV in BHK-7-FC cells (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a). The possible reason is that heavy ion irradiation induces the GLN-related metabolic functions of mutant cells, which results in the upregulation of GLN metabolism, which is consistent with the findings of many previous studies [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Based on our research results, where BHK-7 shows a significantly enhanced consumption of GLN, we speculate that GLN might be one of the important substrates for the replication of FMDV in mutant BHK-7. Therefore, we conducted the subsequent experiment of adding GLN to the culture medium, suggesting that GLN may play a pivotal role in FMDV replication. Subsequently, various concentrations of GLN were added to the BHK-7-FC cell suspension medium, and the levels of 146S particles were measured post-FMDV infection to evaluate the effect of GLN on viral replication. As shown in <xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>e,f, the addition of 1 mmol/L GLN to the medium resulted in a significant increase in 146S particle content. When 1 mmol/L GLN was added simultaneously to both BHK-21 and BHK-7-FC cell culture media, the results indicated a substantial increase in 146S particle content in BHK-7-FC cells following GLN supplementation, while no significant difference was observed in BHK-21 cells infected with FMDV. This suggests that the surface mutant BHK-7-FC may enhance FMDV replication by altering metabolic pathways and increasing energy consumption. The transmembrane glycoproteins in the viral envelope mediate membrane fusion and viral entry by binding to host cell receptors. Infected host cells substantially upregulate glutamine metabolism to generate ATP and precursors for macromolecular synthesis (such as nucleotides and lipids), thus supporting the assembly and release of progeny viruses [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, glutamine serves as a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids, all of which are essential to produce new viral components. Studies have demonstrated that glutamine is implicated in the replication of multiple viruses and is involved in cellular metabolism. For instance, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) facilitates the catabolism of glutamine into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Solute carrier family 1 member 3 (SLC1A3) is a crucial regulator of glutamine metabolism. Silencing SLC1A3 reduces the levels of glutamate and glutamine catabolism and promotes the replication of NDV. Likewise, findings from studies in BHK cells indicate that the replication of Sendai virus (HVJ) necessitates glutamine. The absence of glutamine in the culture medium inhibits the release of HVJ and the synthesis of envelope proteins [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In summary, supplementing the suspension medium with 1 mmol/L GLN can significantly improve FMDV replication efficiency. Additionally, the inclusion of GLN in BHK-7-FC culture media can further enhance viral production.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-vetsci-12-00167"><title>3.5. Evaluation of the Stability of the BHK-7-FC</title><p>To comprehensively and accurately assess the replication performance of BHK-7-FC cells against FMDV after suspension domestication, we conducted a serial passage experiment over 10 consecutive generations. During this process, the levels of 146S particles and TCID<sub>50</sub> were measured every three passages. The results, following a meticulous analysis, clearly demonstrated that the mutant BHK-7-FC cells exhibited high stability in replicating FMDV post-suspension domestication. Specifically, both the 146S particle count and TCID<sub>50</sub> levels remained stable throughout continuous passages, strongly indicating the robustness of BHK-7-FC cell replication against FMDV post-suspension acclimation (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a,b). Further analysis revealed that the 146S antigen production by the BHK-7-FC cells was consistently and significantly higher than that of the control BHK-21 cells. Similarly, there were notable differences in their TCID<sub>50</sub> levels. These findings were consistent with those observed in the mutant BHK-7 cells studied previously.</p><p>The results confirm that the suspension adaptation process successfully preserves both the viral sensitivity and genetic stability of this engineered cell line. Notably, the 146S yield obtained in this study exceeds the highest reported values for suspension-adapted BHK-21 systems. When compared to the results of previous studies, it shows a significant increase in the 146S yield [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This indicates that BHK-7-FC cells have the potential to substantially cut down vaccine production costs. This can be achieved by reducing the cell culture volume and the requirements for downstream purification. These findings firmly establish BHK-7-FC as a robust platform for industrial-scale FMDV production. They provide both theoretical and practical bases for future vaccine development, thereby paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective vaccine manufacturing processes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vetsci-12-00167"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The outbreak and spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have inflicted substantial economic losses on the global livestock industry and posed a significant threat to animal health and safety. Consequently, the implementation of effective prevention and control measures is crucial for safeguarding the development of animal husbandry. Currently, inactivated FMD vaccines play a pivotal role in disease prevention, with their immunogenic efficacy directly impacting both animal health and the stability of the livestock sector. The concentration of 146S antigen in the vaccine is critical for eliciting an immune response [<xref rid="B20-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], indicating that enhancing the 146S antigen content represents a key strategy for improving the quality of FMD vaccines.</p><p>In this study, wild-type BHK-21 cells were irradiated with 12C6 heavy ions, and the irradiation parameters were meticulously optimized. The results showed that cell viability decreased significantly as the heavy ion dose increased. This reduction in viability can be attributed to the extensive damage inflicted by high doses of heavy ions on cellular structures, thereby disrupting normal metabolic processes and compromising cell survival. However, within a specific dose range, viral replication levels exhibited a gradual increase. Specifically, FMDV inhibition was observed at doses below 15 Gy, while doses exceeding 15 Gy slightly promoted FMDV replication. These findings align with the research by K. Lumniczky et al., which indicates that high doses primarily exert immunosuppressive effects, whereas low doses modulate immune responses [<xref rid="B22-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lower doses of heavy ions may inhibit FMDV replication by activating cellular immune functions, while higher doses promote viral replication through immunosuppression, likely due to the complex regulation of cellular immunity. At lower doses, cells may initiate various immune defense mechanisms, enhancing their resistance to viral infection. Conversely, at higher doses, severe immunosuppression facilitates viral replication within the cells.</p><p>In other areas of virology research, relevant studies have previously been published. One study demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of BHK-21 cells can enhance their susceptibility to rabies virus [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The research by P. E. Ceccaldi et al. further confirmed that ionizing radiation can increase the infection intensity and prolong the duration of rabies virus infection in mouse brains through an immunosuppressive mechanism in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Specifically, higher radiation doses resulted in more severe viral infections and longer infection durations in the mouse brains [<xref rid="B24-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This phenomenon exhibits a similar trend to the results observed in this study. In our study, as the induced dose of heavy ions increased, the replication level of FMDV gradually rose (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00167-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b). Additionally, it is noteworthy that irradiation techniques, including heavy ions and rays, have been widely applied in the inactivation of viruses for vaccine development [<xref rid="B25-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Heavy ions possess unique physical and biological characteristics. Compared with traditional rays, they can deposit more concentrated and intense energy in organisms, thereby triggering specific biological changes in cells. It can induce a high mutation rate, a wide mutation spectrum, and excellent mutant stability [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The generated mutants can increase the possibility of discovering new virus&#x02013;host interaction mechanisms. Moreover, this approach avoids the limitations that may be caused by the purposeful manipulation of specific genes. It is closer to the variation in the natural state and can produce multiple different mutation types, providing richer materials for research [<xref rid="B28-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These advantages make heavy ion irradiation a highly promising research tool.</p><p>The content of FMDV 146S in the mutant BHK-7 cells obtained by heavy ion irradiation-induced screening was significantly increased. These findings unequivocally demonstrate that heavy ion irradiation can effectively induce mutant cells with enhanced viral replication capacity. The development of these mutant cells offers a novel cellular resource to produce FMD vaccines. Following adaptation to suspension culture, we observed that the growth rate of mutant BHK-7 cells was comparable to that of control BHK-21 cells. This suggests a feasible method for large-scale vaccine production. Suspension culture confers several advantages, including the provision of a larger culture volume, facilitation of rapid cell proliferation, and substantial viral replication. Additionally, this culture method can enhance production efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs [<xref rid="B30-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the metabolic analysis of BHK-7-FC suspension cultures, it was observed that glutamine (GLN) may play a pivotal role in FMDV replication. The addition of an appropriate concentration of GLN can enhance the replication efficiency of FMDV, providing a foundation for optimizing medium composition. By examining key substrates, such as GLN, lactate (LAC), glucose (GLUC), and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), in the cell culture medium [<xref rid="B31-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vetsci-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we observed that changes in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, LAC, and GLUC levels in BHK-7-FC were not significantly different compared to the control BHK-21 cells. However, GLN levels decreased markedly 12 h post-infection with FMDV, indicating a strong correlation between GLN consumption and viral replication. GLN likely plays a critical role in energy provision or biosynthesis during viral replication. Supplementing the medium with an optimal amount of GLN can enhance FMDV replication efficiency, thereby providing a crucial basis for medium optimization. Adjusting GLN concentrations in the medium can improve viral replication efficiency, thus increasing vaccine antigen production. The results of ten successive generations of passage experiments demonstrated that the mutant BHK-7 exhibited stable replication of the FMDV virus following adaptation to suspension culture. This indicates that the mutant cells induced by heavy ion irradiation possess excellent genetic stability and are suitable for long-term vaccine production. To further evaluate the stability of the mutant cells, we conducted ten successive generations of passages and monitored changes in the levels of 146S particles and TCID<sub>50</sub> every three generations. The findings revealed that the replication of FMDV in mutant BHK-7 remained stable after suspension adaptation. This suggests that the mutant cells induced by heavy ion irradiation exhibit robust genetic stability and can consistently replicate the virus over extended passages. Such stability is crucial for vaccine production, ensuring consistent quality and efficacy.</p><p>In summary, this study successfully developed a mutant somatic cell line BHK-7 that enhances FMDV replication through the application of heavy ion irradiation technology. The research further explored its potential in vaccine production via suspension culture domestication and metabolic analysis. This work offers novel insights and methodologies for FMD vaccine development, potentially increasing production efficiency and reducing costs, thereby significantly contributing to the sustainable development of global animal husbandry. Additionally, this study provides valuable references for the development of other vaccine cell lines and broadens the application scope of heavy ion irradiation technology in vaccine research. Future research could delve into the mechanisms of heavy ion irradiation-induced cell mutation, optimizing irradiation parameters and screening methods to enhance mutant cell performance and stability. Moreover, integrating other biotechnological approaches, such as gene editing, may further refine the cell line, improving vaccine quality and efficacy. Concurrently, stringent quality control and safety oversight of the vaccine production process are essential to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness, providing robust support for the healthy development of the global livestock industry.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (LVRI, CAAS), for providing the experimental platform.
