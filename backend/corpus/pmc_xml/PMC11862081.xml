Self-compassion is defined as the ability to be open to and touched by one&#x02019;s suffering and to relate to it with kindness and non-judgmental awareness. Although identifying factors related to treatment adherence remains an important challenge in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, self-compassion has rarely been investigated in this population. Further studies are needed to investigate whether self-compassion training can improve treatment adherence in this population.</p></sec><sec id="sec8147"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between self-compassion and treatment adherence in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec8148"><title>Methods</title><p>thirty stabilized adult outpatients with schizophrenia (n=18), schizoaffective disorder (n=11), brief psychotic disorder (n=1) per DSM-5 criteria were included. Self- compassion was assessed using the 26-item Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). Treatment adherence was assessed using the Medical Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). Socio- demographic characteristics, including age, gender, academic level, and mean daily antipsychotic dosages were collected.</p></sec><sec id="sec8149"><title>Results</title><p>
There was no significant difference in SCS scores and MARS scores as a function of gender, age, or academic level. The results of the present preliminary study suggest a positive correlation between the SCS total scores and the MARS scores. It was found that higher levels of self-compassion are related with higher levels of treatment adherence in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and lower levels of self- compassion are associated with discontinuation of medications without a psychiatrist&#x02019;s recommendation. This connection was present in all diagnostic groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec8150"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present preliminary study suggest that self-compassion and treatment adherence are closely related. Improving self-compassion in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may improve their level of treatment adherence. Further studies are needed to investigate whether self-compassion training programs could be useful as an extension of standard psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral therapy to improve treatment adherence in this population.</p></sec><sec id="sec8151"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
