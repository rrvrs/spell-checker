Furthermore, an important element of any non-uniform exposure is the unpredictability of the projected dose&#x02013;response relationship based on standard radiobiological DNA damage and repair models and dose&#x02013;volume histogram interpretations, as the underlying mechanism remains unclear [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One of the crucial factors contributing to this unpredictability is the tissue-sparing effect (TSE), which refers to the acquisition of radiation tolerance at the tissue level caused by exposure to spatially fractionated radiation [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the first observation of TSE in radiotherapy was reported using a grid pattern irradiation in the 1900s [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], several studies have been performed in terms of clinical application of spatially restricted narrow radiation beams [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These pioneer works were succeeded by microbeam radiotherapy (MRT) using various radiation sources [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;14</xref>]. To date, accelerator-based X-ray or particle beams with an adjustable size, particularly microbeams equipped with a single-cell irradiation apparatus, have been developed as popular tools to irradiate individual, micron-sized samples or portions of samples [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], for investigating not only TSE but also &#x02018;non-targeted effects&#x02019; such as abscopal effects, clastogenic effects and bystander effects [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Recently, sub-millimeter beams have been also applied to provide spatially fractionated technique in radiation therapy known as a mini beam using synchrotron X-rays [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], proton beams [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>] or ion beams [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although demands of such mini-beam irradiations have been expanded year by year, there are a limited number of beam apparatuses with an adjustable size in the accelerator research facilities, especially those capable of X-ray irradiation. Therefore, the development of alternative methods has long been expected for radiobiological research purposes.</p><p>In this study, we used a conventional lead (Pb)-shielding collimator providing sub-millimeter width X-ray beam (hereafter, mini beam) to realize the spatially non-uniform radiation exposure conditions using a laboratory X-ray source. In addition to the collimator, we employed human cervical cell line HeLa cells expressing fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicators (FUCCI). The FUCCI technique was developed to augment distinct visualization of cell-cycle phases by fluorescence microscopy [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], suggesting the possibility that it would be useful to detect the non-targeted effects of radiation on cell cycle and mobility [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec5"><title>Cell culture</title><p>A subline of the HeLa-FUCCI cells, RCB2812 HeLa.S-FUCCI [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], was provided by the RIKEN BioResource Center in Japan. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel) and 1% antibiotic&#x02013;antimycotic (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), in a humidified incubator maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere with 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The day before irradiation, logarithmically growing cells (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>cells) were seeded into 35-mm-&#x003c6; cell culture dishes (Falcon), and the medium was changed after X-irradiation to start time-lapse imaging.</p><p>As previously described [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the HeLa-FUCCI cells were able to bypass the G1 checkpoint, whereas the G2/M checkpoint was functional. In fact, a previous study reported that the durations of the red phase do not change even when HeLa-FUCCI cells are irradiated with up to 10&#x000a0;Gy [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The G1/S checkpoint governed by p53 activated through ATM and its downstream factor, Chk2, does not function properly in HeLa cells [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, the G2/M checkpoint could work via a pathway through which cell-cycle checkpoint factors, Chk1 and Cdc25, are activated by ATR [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, there was remarkable G2/M cell-cycle arrest in the exposed HeLa-FUCCI cells, supporting that the release from radiation-induced cell-cycle arrest requires cellular processes that presumably sustain Chk1&#x02019;s inhibition pathway of Cdc2/Cyclin B phosphorylation by Cdc25 [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>We also used hTERT-immortalized human normal fibroblast BJ-1 cells with wild-type p53 function that express FUCCI (BJ-1-hTERT-FUCCI cells). Unlike epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells exist in the extracellular matrix, unbound to their surroundings, and are characterized by their motility. The cells were cultured in the same culture medium and conditions as described above. The cell-cycle checkpoint is functioning normally in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>X-ray settings</title><p>The cells were exposed to a conventional X-rays through the lid of a culture dish using an X-ray generator with a W-target (Softex, Kanagawa, Japan) operated at a tube voltage of 150&#x000a0;kV and a tube current of 4.1&#x000a0;mA [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The samples were exposed to X-rays from the tungsten anode. The energy spectrum from the X-ray machine provided by the manufacturer showed that there are characteristic X-ray peaks ~60&#x000a0;keV ascribed to the tungsten target of X-ray tube. The 0.2-mm aluminum filter was applied to filter out the X-rays &#x0003c;7&#x000a0;keV. We measured the attenuation factor of air at the sample position using an ionizing chamber. The obtained half value of air layer was 10.9&#x000a0;cm at 25&#x000b0;C, 1&#x000a0;atm, indicating that the effective energy of the X-rays was ~45&#x000a0;keV, which was slightly lower than those of characteristic X-ray peaks (around 60&#x000a0;keV) from the tungsten target because of bremsstrahlung in the lower energy region. The X-ray field was ~10&#x000a0;cm in diameter at the sample position. The distance from X-ray window to the sample surface of the cells in the culture dish was 29.6&#x000a0;cm.</p><p>Prior to irradiation experiments, we measured the dose at the sample position by Fricke dosimetry method with a Fricke solution with a depth of a few millimeters based on the assumption that the cultured cell samples were approximated as that of water. We periodically checked whether the dose was properly delivered with an ionization chamber by detecting an X-ray flux (C/kg) used as secondary standard. The Fricke solution was exposed to X-rays for designated time (e.g. 5 or 10&#x000a0;min) without any collimators. The dose rate was determined with the measured dose and exposure period to be 1&#x000a0;Gy/min, and the total doses of the X-rays absorbed by the cells were set to 10&#x000a0;Gy at the surface of the collimator. In order to simulate the microenvironment of irradiated tissue, the confluence level before irradiation was ~90&#x02013;100%.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Spatially fractionated irradiation settings using a sub-milli-slit</title><p>Spatially fractionated irradiation settings were performed using the X-ray source and a collimator consisting of lead sheets of 300-&#x003bc;m thickness.

Schematic representation of the sub-milli-slit-modulated irradiation field.

The film was placed directly below the collimator to obtain the picture of a color change profile by the X-ray exposure (see <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The color-changing of the films irradiated with various X-ray doses without the sub-milli-slit were also measured under bright-field illumination using a Leica stereomicroscope (M205C) to obtain a standard curve to estimate the dose in the sub-millimeter range. The acquired images were analyzed for brightness using the line profile function in ImageJ (NIH, 1.54p). A calibration curve was obtained as a fitting curve of the brightness values plotted against doses as shown in the supplemental figure (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p>The collimator image showed a clear difference in the dose distribution, as shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, between the peaks and valleys reflecting the slit width of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m (600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m for peak-to-peak). The irradiated area of the sub-milli-slit profile taken by the Gafchromatic film showed that the dose delivered in the irradiated area was ~6.7&#x000a0;Gy, which was less than the expected value of 10&#x000a0;Gy (see above) because of significant attenuation by the acrylic plate in the collimator. On the other hand, the non-irradiated areas were also delivered a certain dose of an average of 1.1&#x000a0;Gy, presumably because of backscattering components from the stainless sample tray as well as scattered radiations from a plastic lid of the dish, etc. Thus, the average value of the peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR) was 0.16. The relative error of the peak and valley value were 0.017 (1.7%) and 0.007 (0.07%), and there is a clear difference in the dose distribution between the peaks and valleys (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These estimations indicated that, although not as accurate as microbeams, sub-milli-slit irradiation using the collimator was useful enough for radiobiological experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="f2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Dose profile of the modulated irradiation field with a slit size of 300-&#x003bc;m width. The dose distribution was confirmed using a Gafchromic XR-RV3 radiochromic film (A) and PHITS code (B). The measurement results show that the doses in the valley area are relatively higher than the theoretical ones.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rraf020f2" position="float"/></fig><p>The dose profile was also complementally estimated by the Monte Carlo code of Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System (PHITS ver. 3031) [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The PHITS simulation was performed using the geometry shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The X-rays with the provided spectra were set to almost perpendicular to the collimator and only slightly divergent (0.5-degree solid angle). The distance between the X-ray window and the collimator surface, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>, is 50&#x000a0;mm, which is much larger than the experimental condition to save the simulation time. The photons and secondary electrons were simulated in the calculation, where the cut-off energies for photons and electrons were set to be 1.0&#x000a0;keV. <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows the simulated dose profile by the PHITS calculation. The peaks and valleys reflecting the slit width of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m for peak-to-peak, were confirmed. The dose was normalized by the average dose for the peak area. The profile reproduced roughly the dose distribution on the Gafchromatic film. The PVDR value was, however, ~0.05, which was significantly smaller than that obtained by the Gafchromatic films (0.16 as described above). Although we considered the backscattering component from the stainless sample tray in the PHITS calculation, diffusive X-ray trajectory, not exactly parallelism beam, and scattered radiations from a plastic lid of the dish, air layer and culture medium, and diffuse reflections from sidewalls, the ceiling board in the irradiation chamber also needs to be included in the calculation to reproduce the Gafchromatic profiles exactly.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>FUCCI time-lapse imaging</title><p>As previously described [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], to visualize red (570&#x000a0;nm) and green (505&#x000a0;nm) fluorescence emissions from the cell nuclei, a BZ-X700 fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan) equipped with an automatic filter wheel was employed. The cultured samples were observed with 4&#x000d7; and 20&#x000d7; magnification objective lenses to capture FUCCI-fluorescent and bright-field images every hour for 24&#x000a0;h. The FUCCI signal fluorescence was emitted only from cell nucleus. The boundary of a cell was confirmed by overlying the fluorescent image with the bright-field image.</p><p>Geminin is ubiquitinated during the M and G1 phases and degraded by proteasome, while Cdc10-dependent transcript 1 (Cdt1) is ubiquitinated during the S and G2 phases and degraded by proteasome. Thus, by combining Geminin expressed in the S/G2 phases and Cdt1 expressed in the G1 phase with green and red fluorescent proteins, respectively, the nuclei of HeLa-FUCCI and BJ-1-hTERT-FUCCI cells in the G1 phase are shown in red, and those in the S/G2 phases are green under a fluorescence microscope. The early S phase, when the expression of both overlaps, is yellow. The green and red fluorescence intensities of HeLa-Fucci cells and BJ-1 hTERT-Fucci cells were analyzed by using the line profile function of ImageJ. The fluorescence ratios were calculated based on the intensities as shown in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> (see below).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec10"><title>HeLa-FUCCI cells following exposure to spatially fractionated X-rays</title><p>

The use of sub-milli beams for radiobiological research purposes has long been limited due to the small number of facilities and finite beamtime. Further development of clever shielding techniques, such as lead &#x02018;micro-collimators&#x02019; as an alternative to accelerator-based microbeams, will expand the research on such heterogeneous radiation exposure effects. The accelerator-based microbeam systems typically irradiate single (or multi) cells in discrete positions in a fashion of step-by-step shooting. Thus, one needs longer irradiation time for a larger number of cells and the condition of the initially exposed cells would be different from those of finally exposed cells. Contrary to this, the micro-collimated broad field delivers dose to each exposed area simultaneously, thus preventing cells from variation of exposure times. Furthermore, collimators are more versatile than microbeams because they can be used in a normal laboratory environment and are expected to work with a variety of devices.</p><p>There are technical limitations of the collimator approach. One of the important issues is the higher dose at the valley area of the sub-milli beams, compared to that using synchrotron-generated mini beams. One possible reason is that the beam spread and scattering would occur in the space between the slit and the sample, namely, the dish lid, air layer and culture medium. Thus, to make the slit irradiation more effective in the future, it may be necessary to (1) make the slit and sample surface as close as possible, and (2) shield the beam line and sample with lead to prevent scattering from the surroundings.</p><p>The establishment of a spatially non-uniform irradiation method using the sub-milli-slit irradiation, as shown in the current study, is expected to be a driving force for further development of MRT research, which has been carried out only at synchrotron radiation facilities. In our previous study, we performed sub-milli-slit irradiation of cultured testes using the sub-milli collimator [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, it was not clear whether such an irradiation method would allow examination at the cellular level. This study is first to indicate that the use of collimators is useful for analyzing cellular responses in spatially fractionated radiation fields.</p></sec><sec id="sec14"><title>FUCCI&#x02019;s potential for dosimetric assessment</title><p>In a sub-milli-slit-modulated radiation field, HeLa-FUCCI cells showed the presence of cell-cycle arrest cells confined to the irradiation field, while BJ-1-hTERT-FUCCI cells showed no clear boundary between the non-irradiated and irradiated field in which the cell-cycle distributions were similar. The preliminary results presented in this study suggest that cell behavior in spatially inhomogeneous radiation fields may differ among cell types. In the future, more detailed measurement results will be required for novel biological data analysis, e.g. time-lapse conditions, verification of cell migration for each cell type and statistical treatment of data.</p><p>We also noticed that HeLa-FUCCI cells are a possible indicator of irradiation coverage. Unlike BJ-1-hTERT cells, HeLa cells show distinct G2/M arrests and adhesiveness, making HeLa-FUCCI cells suitable as short-term biomarker for dosimetric assessment in sub-millimeter region. As shown in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, 16&#x000a0;h after irradiation, HeLa-FUCCI cells clearly showed the irradiated and non-irradiated areas. Thus, the FUCCI technique is useful for identifying exposed cells, suggesting potential applications for the dosimetric studies. One of the technical limitations of this study is that we only analyze the behavior of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> HeLa and BJ-1-hTERT cells. Further investigation with other human cell lines is required to validate our findings.</p><fig position="float" id="f7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Relative quantitative changes in fluorescence intensity ratio for HeLa-FUCCI and BJ-1-hTERT-FUCCI cells.

The different response at the tissue level when comparing the case of uniform exposure of all cells in the irradiated area with the case of spatially fractionated exposure may be due to the dilution of radiation effects by the migration of some cells, such as fibroblasts. While dampening the acute effects at the tissue level, it also has the potential to spread the radiation-induced consequences of both the targeted and non-targeted effects, outside the irradiation area through cell migration of irradiated cells. From the viewpoint of radiotherapy and radiation protection, it is necessary to analyze how the radiation response is diluted or diffused in the situation where non-irradiated and irradiated cells are mixed. For this purpose, it will also be necessary to investigate the cellular behavior of each cell within and without the irradiated areas, as suggested by the results of this study. In particular, it is necessary to clarify the significance of the behavior of cells before cell death occurs.</p><p>An efficient way to mitigate the radiation-induced effects at the tissue level would be to promote or inhibit the activity of cell migration. For instance, in radiotherapy, suppressing the migration of tumor cells and keeping them within the planning targeted volume as much as possible could potentially have a significant impact on the response rate. In fact, several studies have indicated a link between cell migration activity and radiation effects for cancer therapy [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Radiobiological studies using lead sub-milli collimators as an alternative to adjustable size system of accelerator-based X-ray beams could contribute to the development of this field.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>supplementary_not_blind_rraf020</label><media xlink:href="supplementary_not_blind_rraf020.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sup2" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>BJ-1_FUCCI_movie_rraf020</label><media xlink:href="bj-1_fucci_movie_rraf020.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sup3" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>HeLa_FUCCI_movie_rraf020</label><media xlink:href="hela_fucci_movie_rraf020.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="sec17"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec17a"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Marubun Research Promotion Foundation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec18"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The data underlying this article will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><ref-list id="bib1"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
