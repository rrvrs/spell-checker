One of the challenges for healthcare providers is finding more targeted treatment options for skin tags, as current methods-like electrodesiccation, laser therapy, cryotherapy, and surgical removal-can be quite expensive. Fortunately, Siddha medicine offers a promising and potentially more affordable alternative. In this case report, we discuss the successful treatment of a giant acrochordon in a 47-year-old male patient using Pachaieruvai Siddha medicine, an indigenous healing tradition from India. The patient applied Pachaieruvai externally for 10 days and experienced only mild, temporary discomfort. Substantial lesion disappearance was observed within two weeks, and subsequent evaluations at three and six months showed no recurrence. These results suggest that Siddha pharmacotherapy may serve as an effective, less invasive, and economical alternative for the management of acrochordons. However, further research and clinical studies are essential to validate its efficacy and develop standardized treatment protocols.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>case report</kwd><kwd>giant acrochordons</kwd><kwd>pachaieruvai</kwd><kwd>siddha medicine</kwd><kwd>skin tags</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acrochordons, commonly known as skin tags, are pedunculated, soft, movable, often flesh-colored, and primarily appear on skin in areas where there&#x02019;s friction or where the skin folds, like the neck, armpits, and groin [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While these growths are generally harmless, they can lead to cosmetic concerns and, in some cases, physical discomfort or irritation [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Acrochordons are particularly prevalent among middle-aged and older individuals, and they tend to be associated with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, acromegaly, mechanical friction, and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is a strong link between acrochordons and obesity. In fact, studies show that 74% of patients with these skin tags are either obese or overweight, and about 24% meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been found in around 80% of skin tags, with subtypes 6 and 11 being the most common. This finding suggests that HPV might play a role in the development of these skin growths, although the precise mechanism behind this connection is still not fully understood [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Acrochordons are typically diagnosed through clinical examination, and physical assessment is sufficient for identification [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When it comes to treatment options, conventional methods often include surgical excision or cryotherapy. However, it's important to note that these approaches can carry risks, such as scarring, infection, and recurrence of the tags [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>This case report delves into the promising potential of Siddha medicine, an indigenous Indian healing tradition, focusing particularly on Pachaieruvai as a viable and cost-effective alternative for managing acrochordon. Siddha pharmacotherapy is a unique aspect of the Siddha medical system, known for its use of specially processed metals and minerals such as mercury, silver, arsenic, lead, and sulfur in treating a variety of ailments. These formulations have a long-standing history of being used to address infectious conditions while minimizing adverse effects. Moreover, Siddha medicine has also shown effectiveness in treating cancer, psoriasis, chronic liver diseases, infertility, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bleeding hemorrhoids, peptic ulcers, and various skin conditions [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 47-year-old man presented to our outpatient clinic with a single, sizable, soft, skin-colored growth located on the back over the right hip joint. The lesion has been present for the past 10 years, gradually increasing in size. The patient reported no associated symptoms such as pain, itching, or bleeding, but noted occasional friction with clothing due to the growth's size. He had no significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, or other systemic illnesses. On examination, the lesion was identified as a large pedunculated skin tag (acrochordon) measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. It was soft, non-tender, and freely movable, attached to the skin by a narrow stalk. The overlying skin was intact, with no signs of inflammation, ulceration, or secondary infection. The surrounding skin appeared normal, and no other similar lesions were noted elsewhere on the body.</p><p>Patient history</p><p>The patient stated that the lesion had been present for a decade, initially small and gradually enlarging over time. He denied any trauma, discharge, or changes in color associated with the growth. Despite its size, the skin tag did not cause functional limitations or discomfort beyond friction with clothing.</p><p>Diagnosis</p><p>The lesion was clinically diagnosed as a skin tag (acrochordon) based on its presentation as a large, soft, pedunculated, skin-colored growth. General and systemic examinations were unremarkable, and no other abnormalities were identified.</p><p>Management</p><p>The patient initially opted for treatment due to persistent irritation caused by friction with clothing. Instead of surgical excision, the patient chose a traditional Siddha medicine approach using Pachaieruvai, a topical herbal preparation. The medicine was administered with the prerequisite of written consent. The treatment involved daily application of the medicine over the stalk for ten consecutive days. During treatment, the patient experienced mild pain, burning sensations at the application site, which lasted for about 30 min after each application. These symptoms were temporary and resolved immediately. These reactions were interpreted as positive indicators of the lesion's regression. The treatment successfully destroyed the growth within 15 days.&#x000a0;Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the progression of the skin tag.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A.

The lesion site had healed well, with no signs of infection or residual growth. At the three-month follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence or adverse effects, confirming the efficacy and safety of the chosen treatment regimen with Pachaieruvai. The patient remained symptom-free, and no complications were reported, highlighting the success of this alternative approach for managing a large acrochordon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Acrochordons, commonly referred to as skin tags, are benign fibroepithelial growths often associated with friction-prone areas such as the neck, axilla, and groin [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While most skin tags are small (typically less than 5 mm), giant skin tags measuring 10 centimeters in diameter are rare. Risk factors for acrochordons include obesity, insulin resistance, and hormonal changes; however, this patient lacked any known contributing systemic conditions [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The significant size of the lesion in this case may be attributed to chronic mechanical stimulation. Although large acrochordons are benign, they can cause discomfort due to friction, aesthetic concerns, or secondary complications such as irritation or infection [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>This case highlights the successful use of Pachaieruvai, a traditional Siddha medicinal preparation, as an effective alternative therapy for treating a large acrochordon. Rooted in ancient Siddha texts, Pachaieruvai is composed of five key ingredients: Vellaipadanam (arsenic trioxide), Aridharam (arsenic trisulfide), Thurusu (copper sulfate), Karchunnam (calcium carbonate), and Kungiliyam (resin from Shorea robusta), each with distinct pharmacological properties [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Research has indicated that Vellaipaadanam, commonly recognized as arsenic trioxide and an essential element of Pachaieruvai, exhibits remarkable anti-glioma and antiviral effects. Evidence suggests that it curtails the growth of glioma cells while enhancing programmed cell death&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Vellaipadanam and Aridharam exhibit potent cytotoxic effects, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thurusu, also known as copper sulfate, exhibits notable cytotoxic properties that inhibit tumor growth and demonstrate antiviral effects. Its mechanism of action involves generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce cytotoxic reactions that disrupt cellular integrity and hinder the proliferation of abnormal cells [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Karchunnam further contributes by suppressing abnormal cell growth [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Kungiliyam, a resin extracted from Shorea robusta, exhibits strong cytotoxic properties that inhibit abnormal cellular growth. Research has demonstrated that extracts from Shorea robusta can suppress the proliferation of cancer cells. Notably, robustic acid derivatives found in the resin have shown potent cytotoxic effects against various cancer cell lines, including HL-60 (human leukemia) and HepG2 (human hepatoblastoma) [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Mode of action</p><p>When combined, these five ingredients work together in a powerful way to specifically target the abnormal cells linked to acrochordons. The cytotoxic effects of Vellaipadanam, Aridharam, Thurusu, and Kungiliyam collaborate to promote cell death and prevent the excessive growth of these abnormal cells. Meanwhile, calcium carbonate plays a crucial role by creating an optimal environment that enhances the effectiveness of these active ingredients. Together, this unique blend not only helps reduce but can also lead to the complete elimination of skin tags by directly attacking the cells responsible for their growth, resulting in noticeable shrinkage or even disappearance of the lesion [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of the study</p><p>This single case report presents several limitations that affect the generalizability and reliability of the findings regarding Pachaieruvai for treating acrochordons. The lack of a larger sample size restricts the ability to draw robust conclusions about its effectiveness and safety across different individuals. Additionally, the absence of controlled trials makes it difficult to ascertain whether the observed results are genuinely due to the Siddha medicine or influenced by natural regression or other factors. While the patient showed no recurrence at three and six months, a longer follow-up period is essential to confirm the treatment's long-term efficacy and safety. The subjective reports of mild discomfort also highlight the variability in patient experiences, as there was no standardized measurement for these outcomes. Furthermore, potential biases in reporting outcomes and the lack of objective data, such as histological analyses, weaken the findings. The mechanisms by which Pachaieruvai's ingredients act on acrochordons remain unclear, necessitating further biochemical research. Moreover, the study points out the need for standardization in Siddha medicine, as preparation and dosage can vary significantly among practitioners. Lastly, although no immediate adverse effects were noted, the inclusion of arsenic-based compounds raises safety concerns that warrant further investigation, especially regarding the long-term risks associated with arsenic exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case report shares an encouraging success story about treating a giant acrochordon using Pachaieruvai, a traditional Siddha medicine. Within just two weeks of starting the treatment, the patient saw complete resolution of a 10 cm skin tag, and follow-up appointments at three and six months confirmed there was no recurrence. What&#x02019;s more, the treatment was well received, with only mild and temporary discomfort during application. This case highlights several benefits of using Siddha pharmacotherapy for acrochordons, such as its non-invasive approach, cost-effectiveness compared to surgical options, and impressive cosmetic results. However, it&#x02019;s important to note that this is just one case, and we can&#x02019;t draw definitive treatment guidelines from it. Moving forward, future research should include controlled clinical trials with larger groups of patients, standardizing how Pachaieruvai is prepared and applied, comparing it to conventional treatments, and assessing the safety of the arsenic compounds involved. While traditional medicines like Pachaieruvai show great promise, their use in modern medicine needs thorough scientific validation, adding to the growing evidence of Siddha medicine's valuable role in treating skin conditions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Saravanasingh Karan Chand Mohan Singh</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Saravanasingh Karan Chand Mohan Singh, V Gowri, Sathiya Vaidhyanathan, A Jayakalaiarasi, Shalini Boopathi </p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Saravanasingh Karan Chand Mohan Singh, A Jayakalaiarasi, Shalini Boopathi </p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Saravanasingh Karan Chand Mohan Singh, V Gowri, Sathiya Vaidhyanathan, A Jayakalaiarasi, Shalini Boopathi </p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Saravanasingh Karan Chand Mohan Singh</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Amla (Emblica officinalis Gaertn), a wonder berry in the treatment and prevention of cancer</article-title><source>Eur J Cancer Prev</source><person-group>
