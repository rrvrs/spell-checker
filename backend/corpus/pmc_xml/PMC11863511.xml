It has a heightened vulnerability to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which manifests as hyperpigmented or hypopigmented macular lesions, lesions resembling pityriasis versicolor (PV) and planar warts, and an increased risk of progressing to skin cancer, especially in sun-exposed areas. We report three cases of EV with varying presentations. One patient, a long-standing case of EV, developed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the vulva and inguinal region. Another patient had a rare association with palmar pits, while the third patient presented with classical EV. All our patients were prescribed oral retinoids and advised to practice stringent photoprotection after histopathology confirmed evidence of EV.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>edv</kwd><kwd>epidermodysplasia verruciformis</kwd><kwd>ev</kwd><kwd>hpv</kwd><kwd>lewandowski-lutz dysplasia</kwd><kwd>squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>vulval carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis. It is characterized by increased susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and typically starts in childhood [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most often, mutations in the transmembrane channel gene EVER1/TMC6 or EVER2/TMC8 genes, which are found on chromosome 17q25, are the cause. EV presents as pityriasis versicolor (PV)-like lesions, plane warts, and verrucous plaques, which typically appear on sun-exposed areas of the face, torso, neck, and extremities [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Patients with EV are prone to developing non-melanoma skin cancers, with commonly associated dysplastic and malignant changes, including actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen&#x02019;s disease, basal cell carcinoma, and rarely, malignant adnexal tumors [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], sebaceous cell carcinoma, and sweat apparatus carcinoma [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Malignant transformations are primarily associated with HPV types 5 and 8 [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For increased survival, strict sun protection and lifetime monitoring for early detection of malignant lesions are essential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>Case 1</p><p>A 42-year-old female with no known comorbidities, born of a non-consanguineous marriage, presented with an infected, non-healing ulcer in the right inguinal region for five months. She also noticed asymptomatic PV-like lesions on her body since the age of 18 years. The lesions started on her chest and then gradually progressed to involve other parts of her body. There were no similar complaints from her family members. The patient had a history of SCC of the vulva, for which excision and a split-skin graft were performed three years ago. The patient was advised to undergo radiotherapy, but she was not willing at that time.</p><p>On physical examination, multiple well-defined PV-like lesions were present on bilateral extremities and trunk (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A few lesions had elevated borders. Multiple warty, keratotic papules were present on the face, neck, and chest (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A large, single, non-healing, tender ulcer with pus, rolled-out edges, and a bony base was present in the right inguinal fossa, measuring 7 x 5 x 4 cm, with surrounding erythema (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Active bleeding was observed when touching the base of the ulcer. Dermoscopy of a hyperpigmented macule was done, which showed continuous marginal scaling and brownish-black areas mixed with hypopigmented areas (Figures <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>-<xref rid="FIG5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).&#x000a0;</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Clinical photo showing multiple well defined PV-like lesions on the trunk</title><p>PV,&#x000a0;pityriasis versicolor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078058-i01" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Clinical photo showing wart-like lesions on the neck</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078058-i02" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Clinical photo showing a large, single, non-healing, tender ulcer, with rolled-out edges in the right inguinal fossa</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078058-i03" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Dermascopic photo showing continuous marginal scaling</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078058-i04" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Dermascopic photo showing brownish-black areas mixed with hypopigmented area</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078058-i05" position="float"/></fig><p>On investigating, her total white blood cell count was elevated, and a pus culture from the ulcer in the right inguinal fossa showed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Intravenous antibiotics were started according to the sensitivity report. The blood culture result was negative. A clinical diagnosis of EV with SCC was considered. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics and other supportive measures. A skin punch biopsy was taken from a hyperpigmented lesion on the right arm, which showed epidermis with irregular acanthosis and marked hyperkeratosis with confluent parakeratosis. The upper epidermis showed a few keratinocytes with steel-grey cytoplasm, nuclear inclusions, and prominent basophilic granules. A superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate was seen around the adnexa and blood vessels. Features suggestive of EV (Figure <xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and a biopsy from the non-healing ulcer were suggestive of SCC (Figures <xref rid="FIG7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>-<xref rid="FIG7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was done, which revealed thermal uptake in the right inguinal region, measuring 7.5 x 7.7 x 6.7 cm. The lesion was seen infiltrating the pectineus, obturator internus, obturator externus, and sartorius muscles on the right side. The lesion also caused erosion of the right femoral head, the anterior column of the acetabulum, and the right pubic bone. The right external iliac artery and vein were infiltrated by the mass. An oncologist was consulted, and radiotherapy was planned, but the patient passed away due to cardiac arrest.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>H&#x00026;E stain of skin biopsy from the right arm under 400x magnification, showing epidermis with few keratinocytes with steel-grey cytoplasm, nuclear inclusions, and prominent basophilic granules</title><p>H&#x00026;E, hematoxylin and eosin</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078058-i06" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>H&#x00026;E staining of skin biopsy from the ulcer</title><p>Figure (A) (40x magnification) and Figure (B) (400x magnification) show skin with focal ulceration and underlying subepithelium showing infiltration nests of moderately pleomorphic cells.

It does not exhibit any preference for a specific sex, race, or geographic location [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The illness is usually sporadic, but there are several reports of familial cases as well. To our knowledge, only two instances of autosomal dominant inheritance have also been documented so far. Apart from the mutations in the TMC6 and TMC8 genes in classic EV, mutations in CIB1 and variants in other genes involved in T cell and natural killer cell immunodeficiency, such as RHOH, CORO1A, CARMIL2, RASGRP1, MST1, DCLRE1C, DOCK8, and TTC7A, have also been reported [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The acquired type of EV is seen in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals, with skin lesions presenting much later in life. More than 30 EV-associated HPV subtypes have been recognized, particularly a subset of beta HPV genotypes, like HPV 5, HPV 8, HPV 12, HPV 14, HPV 15, HPV 17, HPV 19, HPV 25, HPV 36, HPV 38, HPV 47, and HPV 50 [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with HPV 5 and HPV 8 being the most common [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Here, we report three cases of EV with different spectra of disease. One patient, who had a long-standing case of EV, developed SCC over the vulva and inguinal region. Over their lifespan, SCC is known to develop in between 30% and 70% of patients with EV, and these lesions typically occur more commonly in sun-exposed areas [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, our patient developed SCC in a covered region, which is rare. In our literature search, only three such cases of SCC in covered areas, involving the scrotum and perianal region, were reported in patients with EV [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the literature, there was a report of four patients who had synchronous EV and squamous high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) of the vulva, of which two patients had acquired EV and one patient had inherited EV [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the second patient, in addition to classic skin lesions, he also had bilateral palmar pits, which is a rare association in EV. To our knowledge, only two case reports of EV patients with palmar pits have been published so far [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The third patient had classical cutaneous findings of EV. However, due to financial constraints, HPV typing was not done in our patients. It is important to elucidate the histopathological spectrum of EV and to differentiate it from its mimics, especially acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Presently, there is no specific and effective therapy for this condition. Therefore, the goal of EV management is to stop benign lesions from becoming malignant by implementing preventive strategies such as photoprotection, genetic counseling, and early diagnosis of premalignant and malignant lesions [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For increased survival, strict sun protection and lifetime monitoring for early detection of malignant lesions are essential. Treatment options available for EV include topical retinoids, imiquimod, vitamin D analogs, oral retinoids, interferon, intralesional interferon therapy, cryotherapy, and immunotherapy. Techniques attempted for EV include cryotherapy, immunotherapy, interferons, electrodissection, photodynamic therapy, and Mohs micrographic surgery. The ideal medication for palliative care is acitretin (0.5-1 mg/day). Bowen's disease can be effectively treated with topical imiquimod applied five times a week. Photodynamic therapy with a 20% aminolevulinic acid (ALA) solution, using a red light emitting diode (LED) light source of 72 J/sq cm for 20 minutes weekly for three weeks, has shown no recurrence for five years [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Mohs micrographic surgery has been performed to treat widespread EV warts. If numerous vivid presentations of HPV infections occur, systemic interferon therapy (6 million units, weekly, twice) may be added.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>EV remains a complex and rare genetic condition that poses significant clinical challenges due to its strong association with HPV and the risk of developing SCC. The cases discussed in this report illustrate the variability in disease presentation and progression, including rare occurrences such as carcinoma in non-sun-exposed regions and the unusual presence of bilateral palmar pits. These findings highlight the necessity for personalized and vigilant patient management, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring and early intervention to prevent malignant transformation. Moving forward, a multidisciplinary approach that includes genetic counseling, patient education, and rigorous photoprotection will be essential in managing EV and improving patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Priyanka RM, Manuvidhya H, Anuradha Priyadarshini</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Priyanka RM, Manuvidhya H, Adikrishnan Swaminathan, Leena Dennis Joseph</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Priyanka RM, Manuvidhya H, Anuradha Priyadarshini, Adikrishnan Swaminathan, Leena Dennis Joseph</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Priyanka RM, Manuvidhya H, Anuradha Priyadarshini, Adikrishnan Swaminathan, Leena Dennis Joseph</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Priyanka RM, Manuvidhya H, Anuradha Priyadarshini, Adikrishnan Swaminathan</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Two sisters reveal autosomal recessive inheritance of epidermodysplasia verruciformis: a case report</article-title><source>BMC Dermatol</source><person-group>
