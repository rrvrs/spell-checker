The WHO has encouraged the creation of national food-based dietary guidelines that adhere to sustainable healthy diets, taking into account each nation&#x02019;s unique environmental, social, cultural, and economic circumstances [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For &#x0223c;40 y, the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNRs) have served as the scientific foundation for national dietary reference values for nutrients as well as for the food-based dietary guidelines in the Nordic regions (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden), and now also for countries in the Baltic region (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2019, between 11% and 25% of all deaths were caused by dietary risk factors in these countries [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The NNRs are among the most scientifically comprehensive dietary guidelines with specific food-based recommendations, and the final version (NNR2023) was published in June 2023 after a 5-y revision process involving several hundred leading experts [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. The intended target group for the NNRs is the general population within the region. Food-based recommendations were based on epidemiologic evidence, clinical studies, and mechanistic studies for prospective associations with health outcomes relevant to the Nordic and Baltic populations and on the food groups&#x02019; contributions to nutrient intakes. Previously, the NNRs have addressed the beneficial and adverse effects of each food group on health, based on patterns of food consumption in the countries [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, in NNR2023, the impact of food consumption on planetary health was also assessed although the recommendations were primarily based on health outcomes [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Modeling life expectancy (LE) gains based on improvements in dietary patterns can provide policy-relevant evidence to underpin dietary guidelines [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Global Burden of Disease results tool, Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx), provides estimates of overall nutritional risk factors but does not provide projections of gains in health following the implementation of guidelines [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Models, such as the Food4HealthyLife, have illustrated how modifications in food choices can be associated with substantial changes in age-specific LE [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Age-specific LE is a population measure of health status and estimates how much longer individuals at a certain age are expected to live. LE at birth is a common summary measure of a population&#x02019;s health [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At the population level, changes toward diets with higher intakes of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts and lower intakes of red meat, processed meat, and added sugars are expected to improve LE [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consequently, implementation of the NNR2023 is likely to have health benefits for people in the Nordic and Baltic countries, but the potential gains in LE have not been estimated.</p><p id="p0020">In this article, we used the Food4HealthyLife model to project the gain in sex-specific and age-specific LE of adhering to the food-based recommendations in the NNR2023 in each of the Nordic and Baltic countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="p0025">We will first provide a brief description of the Food4HealthyLife model, which is described in more detail in Johansson et&#x000a0;al.

The key inputs were current (baseline) age-specific mortality rates (i.e. before dietary changes), country-specific dietary patterns at baseline, and estimated effect on all-cause mortality following the dietary changes. Inputs on country-specific, age-specific, and sex-specific mortality rates were obtained from the 2019 Global Burden of Diseases and Injuries study [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Meta-analyses provided input on the dose&#x02013;response relationship between the intake of each food group and all-cause mortality (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). As baseline input on dietary patterns, the model used sex-specific data on dietary patterns for each of the Nordic and Baltic countries (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). After a hypothetical individual changed their diet from the current diet in a chosen country, their LE shifted from LE<sub>baseline</sub> (age, sex, and location) to LE<sub>new</sub> (age, sex, and location).

For a 40-y-old female in Denmark with a sustained change to the feasible NNR2023, the largest gains in LE are from increasing the intake of nuts (1.1 y; UI: 0.9, 1.2 y), whole grains (0.8 y; UI: 0.3, 1.3 y), and legumes (0.3 y; UI: 0.1, 0.5 y) and decreasing the intake of processed meat (0.7 y; UI: 0.6, 0.8 y) and red meat (0.7 y; UI: 0.6, 0.8 y).

For 40-y-old adults, adhering to NNR2023 was associated with gains of &#x02264;4 y for the feasible intrepretation (closer to current national diets) and gains of &#x02264;7 y when interpreted toward full-potential ranges of NNR2023 . The LE gain for males was higher than that for females because females generally had healthier diets than males initially.</p><p id="p0075">Increasing the intake of whole grains, nuts, and legumes and decreasing the intake of red and processed meat as well as added sugars were estimated to contribute most to the gains in LE. For nuts and legumes, the current intakes in the Nordic and Baltic countries were particularly low. Since current intakes of meat products are higher than the maximum recommended amount in most countries [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], replacing meat products with plant-based protein sources such as legumes would contribute substantially to the gain in LE. In contrast, although a higher intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced mortality [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], changes in intakes of fruits and vegetables are associated with slightly lower gains as the intakes are already closer to the recommendations in most Nordic and Baltic countries than for nuts, legumes, and whole grains [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, when adopting a feasible NNR2023, it becomes evident that certain food groups, notably eggs and milk/dairy, had negative contributions to LE in some countries. This observation aligns with our expectations, given that the full-potential interpretation tends toward a diet with better health outcomes. It is worth mentioning that the contributions of food groups to LE gain can differ in other settings, for example, a recent study in the United Kingdom using the same model, reported the largest gain from consuming more whole grains, nuts, and fruits and less sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meat [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0080">The findings of this study have implications for those developing and implementing health-related policies, for clinicians, and for citizens. The projected LE gains not only support adherence to feasible and full-potential interpretations of NNR2023 but also demonstrated the public health implications of implementing sustained small dietary changes across the Nordic and Baltic counties. Moreover, understanding the impact of food choices on age-specific LE is valuable for policymakers when setting priority actions to meet the sustainable development goal 3.4 of reducing premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases by 30% by 2030. Our findings are also relevant for clinicians when treating and advising patients on dietary changes to optimize health and for citizens when prioritizing different food choices in everyday life.</p><p id="p0085">There are certain limitations inherent in our study. First, the quantitative food-based recommendations in NNR2023 were derived from convincing or probable causal dose&#x02013;response relationships in qualified systematic reviews, some of which had outcomes other than mortality, and thus did not always overlap with the systematic reviews included in this study [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The systematic reviews and meta-analyses used in this study may not necessarily adhere to the strict inclusion criteria in NNR2023. Second, the meta-analyses used in our model included observational studies only. This data source often exhibits heterogeneity, where the total estimates may not fully account for the variations in settings and the varying degrees of correction for potential confounding factors. However, meta-analyses frequently provide the most comprehensive and unbiased evidence available because they typically account for several of the most important confounding factors. Studies that investigate associations between food groups and mortality before and after adjustment for intake of other food groups in addition to other confounders, often demonstrate minimal alterations in the estimates of mortality risk [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>]. Studies using alternative experimental designs such as randomized control trials could demonstrate different results, but such studies focusing on dose&#x02013;response relationships between food groups and all-cause mortality are rare. Updated meta-analyses, published since our model was developed, may provide greater precision in projections of LE gains. Third, our approach is limited for individual use because the projections do not account for previous or current morbidity, nor do they incorporate other risk factors such as genetic susceptibility, advancements in medical therapies, or lifestyle modifications [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence, the methodology used in this study is not intended for personalized projection of life-years gained, but rather for estimating gains at the population level based on specific assumptions of the model. In addition, the gain in LE could be used as a tool to indicate the likely health benefits of the recommendations and to act as a motivation for individuals to change their diet. According to meta-analyses, adhering to optimum diets is likely to have a protective impact on the risk of obesity [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and this might mediate some of the effects of dietary change on LE. A further limitation is that the current food consumption underlying our estimations are self-reported data from dietary surveys (most using 24-h recall methods), which are prone to information bias, some of which were conducted &#x0003e;1 decade ago. However, the results are broadly similar to the latest Global Burden of Disease analysis, which used various data sources to impute dietary exposures, and found that low whole grain and fruit consumption and high red and processed meat consumption were among the largest attributable dietary risk factors for deaths in the Nordic and Baltic countries [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, relying on average intakes from dietary surveys does not capture variability in consumption patterns across individuals within populations. The definitions of the food groups may also have differed between countries. The reported intakes of fats/oils in most countries were incompatible with the background data that we have used in our model; thus, we excluded the fats/oil intake from the current diet, and it was estimated with the uncategorized food group. Our approach also has strengths. The new NNR recommendations used in this study provide one of the most comprehensive dietary guidelines to date and consider the health effects as well as sustainability [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study used a model that incorporates extensive meta-analyses containing dose&#x02013;response data that adjust for correlations between food group consumption and the risk of all-cause death. Although our model is based on all-cause mortality and does not account for nonfatal outcomes, existing literature indicates that diet greatly affects the risk of common noncommunicable diseases and health-related quality of life [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>]. Further, dietary risk factors for several morbidities have a large degree of overlap with associations with all-cause mortality [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, we established a methodology that incorporates the likely time delay in achieving the health effects following a change in dietary pattern. The quality of the evidence for the various food groups with health outcomes spanned from very low for eggs and white meat to high for whole grains, with the majority falling within the moderate range [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the total level of evidence was assessed as moderate.</p><p id="p0090">In conclusion, changing from a current diet to the dietary pattern recommended in NNR2023 is projected to produce substantial gains in LE in all Nordic and Baltic countries. For 40-y-old adults, this LE gain could be in the range of 4&#x02013;7 y. The study contributes to the evidence base to support the development and implementation of policy measures designed to achieve implementation of the NNR2023.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0095">The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows &#x02013; LTF, J-M&#x000d8;, &#x000d8;AH, KAJ: have been involved in the design of the study; EJA, LTF, EKA, J-M&#x000d8;: have been involved in the analysis of the study; LTF: is the principal investigator; EJA: wrote the first draft of the paper; and all authors: participated in the interpretation of the data, reviewed the manuscript for intellectual content, read and approved the final version of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec6"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0100">Data used in this study are available through various online sources (see Supplementary Material and references to a range of sources).</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0105">This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs1">Trond Mohn Foundation</funding-source>, grant number TMS2019TMT02.
