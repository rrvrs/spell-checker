</self-uri><abstract><p>Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the cornerstone of malaria control, but their effectiveness is threatened by pyrethroid resistance. We embedded a pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial into Uganda&#x02019;s national LLIN distribution campaign in 2020&#x02013;2021, comparing pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide (PBO) LLINs to pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs. Target communities surrounding public health facilities (clusters, n=64), covering 32 districts were included. Clusters were randomised 1:1 in blocks of two by district to receive: (1) pyrethroid-PBO LLINs (PermaNet 3.0, n=32) or (2) pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs (Royal Guard, n=32). LLINs were delivered from 7 November 2020 to 26 March 2021. Malaria surveillance data were collected from health facilities from 1 November 2019 until 31 March 2023. Cluster-level estimates of malaria incidence in residents of all ages (primary outcome) were generated from enhanced health facility surveillance data. Cross-sectional community surveys were conducted in randomly selected households (at least 50 per cluster) at 12-months (24 November 2021 to 1 April 2022) and 24-months (23 November 2022 to 21 March 2023) post-LLIN distribution. Overall, 186,364 clinical malaria episodes were diagnosed in cluster residents during 398,931 person-years of follow-up. At 24-months, malaria incidence was lower than baseline in both arms (pyrethroid-PBO: 465 vs 676 episodes per 1000 person-years; pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen: 469 vs 674 episodes per 1000 person-years); but there was no evidence of a difference between the arms (incidence rate ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91&#x02013;1.22, p=0.47). Two years post-distribution, ownership of at least one LLIN for every two household residents was low in both arms (41.1% pyrethroid-PBO vs 38.6% pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen). Parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years was no different between the arms in either survey (24-months: 26.1% pyrethroid-PBO; 29.5% pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen; odds ratio 1.29 [95% CI: 0.81&#x02013;2.05], p=0.29). The effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs was no different in Uganda, but two years after mass distribution, LLIN coverage was inadequate.</p><p><bold>Trial registration</bold>: NCT04566510.

More recently, however, progress on malaria control has stalled. Globally, malaria cases increased from 230 million in 2015 to 249 million in 2022, with 95% of cases reported from Africa [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Four African countries, including Uganda, accounted for nearly half of all cases worldwide in 2022. In 2022, Uganda reported the third highest number of malaria cases, representing 5% of the global burden of malaria [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Uganda, implementation of malaria control interventions including repeated national LLIN distribution campaigns, indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides in selected high-transmission districts, case management with effective artemisinin-based combination therapy, and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) reduced the malaria burden, with parasite prevalence by microscopy in children under-five decreasing from 45% in 2009 to 9% in 2018-2019 [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

As recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Ugandan Ministry of Health distributes LLINs through mass campaigns approximately every three years, aiming for universal coverage [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Currently, LLINs rely on pyrethroid insecticides, but resistance to pyrethroids has spread rapidly in malaria vectors, threatening the effectiveness of LLINs [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The causal mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance are complex, but point mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel where pyrethroids bind (&#x02018;knock down resistance&#x02019;), and alterations in enzymes that metabolize pyrethroids, commonly cytochrome P450s, are key features [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

One such net includes piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a synergist which inhibits P450 enzymes, overcoming metabolic resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes, and partially restoring susceptibility to pyrethroids [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The WHO&#x02019;s recommendation was conditional due to uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness and durability of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another new type of LLIN combines pyrethroids with pyriproxyfen, an insect growth regulator which acts as a sterilising agent, reducing the vector population density and lifespan of adult mosquitoes. Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs are promising, but trials comparing these nets to pyrethroid-only LLINs in Burkina Faso and Tanzania have produced mixed results [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additional studies evaluating the effectiveness of nets incorporating pyriproxyfen are needed.</p><p>Uganda has embraced next-generation LLINs to combat pyrethroid resistance. While only pyrethroid-only LLINs were available for distribution in 2013-2014, pyrethroid-PBO LLINs were distributed to selected areas in 2016-2017 and were found to be superior to pyrethroid-only LLINs in a large-scale cluster-randomised trial [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In 2020-2021, pyrethroid-PBO LLINs and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs were distributed across Uganda, providing an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of these LLINs in a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; setting. With support from the Ministry of Health, donors, and partners, a large cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP2) was embedded within this national distribution campaign, allowing us to rigorously compare the impact of these LLINs on epidemiological indicators. Leveraging mass campaigns is an innovative, pragmatic approach to evaluate the &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; effectiveness of novel malaria control interventions, which has been applied successfully in Uganda [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

The prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin &#x0003c; 11&#x02009;g/dL) in children aged 2-4 years decreased substantially between 12-months and 24-months, but there was no difference between the study arms at the two timepoints (<xref rid="pgph.0003558.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

When the study LLINs were purchased (in 2019), the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs (Royal Guard, $2.28 USD per net) were slightly less expensive than the pyrethroid-PBO LLINs (PermaNet 3.0, $2.51 USD per net). As of April 2023, market prices of the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs were $0.77 USD lower per net than pyrethroid-PBO LLINs ($2.30 USD for Royal Guard vs $3.07 USD for PermaNet 3.0) [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial embedded into Uganda&#x02019;s 2020&#x02013;2021 LLIN distribution campaign, we compared the impact of two next generation LLINs on malaria incidence across 32 districts in Uganda. Despite a marked reduction in malaria incidence following LLIN distribution in both study arms, there was no difference in malaria incidence among residents of all ages, parasite prevalence among children 2-10 years of age, or anaemia prevalence among children 2-4 years of age from clusters that received pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs compared to those that received pyrethroid-PBO LLINs. Given the lack of difference in effectiveness of the two LLINs studied, we did not conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis as originally planned. Faced with similar effectiveness, the choice of LLIN should be guided by price and other factors.</p><p>Importantly, LLINs will only be effective if coverage is high, and nets are used. Two years post-distribution, we found only around 40% of households were adequately covered by LLINs, while just over 60% of residents reported sleeping under a LLIN the previous night. The Ugandan Ministry of Health is committed to protecting all Ugandans with LLINs delivered through mass distribution campaigns every 3-4 years; the low level of LLIN coverage and use found in this study is disappointing. However, a survey conducted in Uganda 1-5 months post-LLIN distribution found that while 93% of households owned at least one LLIN distributed through the 2020-21 universal coverage campaign (UCC), only 57% were adequately covered by UCC LLINs [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The factor most strongly associated with adequate LLIN coverage was fewer household residents, suggesting that an insufficient number of nets was distributed to many households. Net attrition has also been highlighted as a major problem in previous studies in Uganda, with the lifespan of LLINs generally less than the expected 3 years [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Strategies to limit LLIN attrition and maximise net use have been called for, including sufficient delivery of nets in mass campaigns to cover all household residents, and continuous educational messaging on care, repair and appropriate use of LLINs.</p><p>Pyrethroid-PBO LLINs were superior to pyrethroid-only LLINs in two trials conducted in east Africa, including the original LLINEUP trial in Uganda [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A Cochrane systematic review incorporating both trials concluded that pyrethroid-PBO LLINs reduced parasite prevalence compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs up to 21&#x02013;25 months post-distribution (OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.67&#x02013;0.95]), in areas with highly pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes (defined as &#x0003c; 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays) [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Based on this evidence, the WHO issued a conditional recommendation in 2022 supporting the deployment of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs &#x02018;in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where the principal malaria vector(s) exhibit pyrethroid resistance&#x02019; [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, pyrethroid-PBO LLINs have several potential limitations. Widespread pyrethroid resistance has been reported in Uganda, and across Africa, with both knock-down and metabolic resistance described across several settings [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PBO is a synergist, not an insecticide, and can only restore sensitivity to pyrethroid insecticides if resistance is due to specific metabolic mechanisms. Moreover, PBO may fail to overcome high-level pyrethroid resistance [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Questions about the bioefficacy, durability, and lifespan of PBO-pyrethroid LLINs have also been raised [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], given concerns about the rapid degradation of PBO from nets raised by studies conducted in Kenya and Tanzania [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In Uganda, an evaluation of nets distributed in the first LLINEUP trial found that while the pyrethroid content of LLINs was relatively stable, the PBO content fell significantly over two years; by 55% in Olyset Plus and 58% in PermaNet 3.0 [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The bioefficacy of the pyrethroid-PBO nets also declined over time with only 46% and 79% of mosquitoes knocked down by Olyset Plus and PermaNet 3.0, respectively, after 25 months [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The WHO has highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs, specifically in areas of lower transmission intensity and where pyrethroid resistance is not driven by cytochrome P450 metabolism, as well as on the durability and cost-effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Treating LLINs with a combination of insecticides with different modes of action may improve efficacy and help to prevent or delay the spread of insecticide resistance. Pyriproxyfen is an insect growth regulator, which has traditionally been used as a larvicide [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but also acts as a sterilising agent, reducing the fecundity (egg laying), fertility (production of viable offspring), and longevity of adult mosquitoes [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Pyriproxyfen has a different mechanism of action than pyrethroids, is effective at very low concentrations, and is safe in humans [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In a step-wedge, cluster-randomised trial conducted in Burkina Faso, pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs (Olyset Duo) were associated with lower clinical incidence in children aged 6&#x02013;59 months, and lower entomological inoculation rates than pyrethroid-only LLINs (Olyset Net) [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. More recently, a cluster-randomised trial conducted in Tanzania evaluated three next generation LLINs, including LLINs treated with pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen, pyrethroid-PBO, and pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr (a novel pyrrole insecticide), comparing their effect on parasite prevalence measured by RDT in children aged 6 months to 14 years, as compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this trial, parasite prevalence at 24 months post-distribution in the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLIN arm was no different than in the pyrethroid-PBO control arm (37.5% vs 45.8%, adjusted OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.54&#x02013;1.17]). Similarly, a cluster-randomised trial conducted in Benin studied pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen and pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr LLINs, as compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, evaluating their effect on malaria incidence in children aged 6 months to 10 years [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This study also found no difference between the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen and pyrethroid-only LLINs over 2 years following distribution (0.84 vs 1.03 malaria cases per child-year, hazard ratio 0.86 [95% CI 0.65-1.14]). In both trials, only the pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr LLINs were superior to the pyrethroid-only LLINs after two years [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In March 2023, the WHO updated the guidelines on use of LLINs, supported by the recent results of the trials in Tanzania and Benin, offering a conditional recommendation for the deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas with pyrethroid resistance, and highlighting concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, the WHO issued a conditional recommendation against the deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs instead of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs, noting that the evidence favours pyrethroid-PBO LLINs which were also deemed more cost-effective than pyriproxyfen LLINs. The LLINEUP2 trial adds to the evidence of the effectiveness of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs, but calls into question the recent WHO recommendations, given that the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs (Royal Guard, Disease Control Technologies, USA) were less expensive than pyrethroid-PBO (PermaNet 3.0, Vestergaard S&#x000e0;rl, Switzerland) LLINs in our trial with similar effectiveness. LLIN prices fluctuate, however, so this finding should not be generalised; whichever net has a lower market price on a given day will be the most cost-effective.</p><p>Malaria incidence was the primary outcome measure of the LLINEUP2 trial, which was a strength of the study. Incidence of malaria, defined as the number of symptomatic cases of malaria occurring in a population at risk over time, is considered the gold standard for assessing malaria burden. However, cluster-randomised trials aiming to measure malaria incidence can be very expensive and logistically challenging. In this trial, we leveraged a platform of enhanced health facility-based malaria surveillance, which was built and supported by UMSP [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Strengths of this system include staff training, continuous support supervision, and collection of high-quality, individual-level, malaria surveillance data. Although routinely collected health facility-based data are often limited by incomplete reporting and lack of laboratory-confirmation, our enhanced health facility-based surveillance system acts as an intervention, improving data quality, ensuring nearly all cases of malaria are laboratory-confirmed, and improving case management. Moreover, by defining target areas around MRCs, collecting data on village of residence of malaria, and enumerating the target area populations to determine denominators, we estimated longitudinal measures of malaria incidence at an unprecedented scale across Uganda, at relatively low cost. Embedding large-scale, cluster-randomised trials into Uganda&#x02019;s national LLIN distribution campaigns has provided an innovative, robust method to effectively evaluate next generation LLINs at scale, an exercise which would otherwise be very costly. This design provides a new paradigm for trials evaluating the &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; effectiveness of malaria control interventions.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, due to resource limitations, entomologic surveillance and assessments of LLIN bioefficacy and durability were not conducted. Second, we were not able to survey the clusters prior to LLIN distribution, again due to lack of resources, and thus have no baseline measures of LLIN coverage, parasite prevalence or anaemia. However, MRC surveillance activities were ongoing for at least three months prior to LLIN distribution, providing baseline measures of malaria incidence for all clusters. Third, although no difference in prevalence of anaemia in children aged 2-4 years was observed between the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen and pyrethroid-PBO arms at the 12- and 24-month timepoints, anaemia prevalence dropped markedly in both arms between the two surveys (pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen 34.0% to 19.0%; pyrethroid-PBO 36.2% to 19.7%). Reasons for this change are unclear but likely relate to variation around the threshold cut-off for anaemia (haemoglobin &#x0003c; 11&#x02009;g/dL) and the complex aetiology of anaemia. Although malaria is a major cause of anaemia in endemic areas, other factors contribute including nutritional status, helminths and other infections, and health system factors.</p><p>In the LLINEUP2 trial, we found no difference in the protection provided by pyrethroid-PBO LLINs and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs. Our results suggest that pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLINs could be an effective alternative to pyrethroid-PBO LLINs in Uganda, and elsewhere in Africa with high-level pyrethroid resistance. Rotation of insecticides, including deployment of LLINs treated with different insecticides, has been recommended as a strategy to manage insecticide resistance [<xref rid="pgph.0003558.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Supported by the recent trials in Tanzania and Benin, the WHO has also issued new guidelines on LLINs treated with chlorfenapyr, offering a strong recommendation for the deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr LLINs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs, and a conditional recommendation for deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr LLINs instead of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs in areas where malaria vectors are resistant to pyrethroids. However, the evidence supporting these new recommendations is limited and further research on the effectiveness, durability and lifespan of next generation LLINs is needed. Strategies to ensure high LLIN access, coverage, and use are also called for to maximize the effectiveness of LLINs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Emmanuel Arinaitwe, James Kapisi, Chris Ebong, Bridget Nzarubara, Faith Kagoya, Emmanuel Bakashaba, Isiko Joseph, Paul Oketch, Benjamin Guma, Jolly Job Odongo, Daniel Ochuli, Geoffrey Omia, Leuben Patrick Okello, Geoff Lavoy, Peter Mutungi, Nicholas Wendo, Yasin Kisambira, Catherine Pitt and the administration of the Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration for all their contributions.
