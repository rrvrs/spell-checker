A recent work tested the susceptibility of musicians and nonmusicians to the Solitaire numerosity illusion finding that also perceptual biases underlying numerical estimation are influenced by long-term music training. However, the potential link between musical expertise and different perceptual mechanisms of quantitative estimation may be either limited to the visual modality or universal (i.e., modality independent). We addressed this question by developing an acoustic version of the Solitaire illusion. Professional musicians and nonmusicians listened to audio file recordings of piano and trombone notes and were required to estimate the number of piano notes. The stimuli were arranged to form test trials, with piano and trombone notes arranged in a way to form the Solitaire pattern, and control trials, with randomly located notes to assess their quantitative abilities in the acoustic modality. In the control trials, musicians were more accurate in numerical estimation than nonmusicians. In the presence of illusory patterns, nonmusicians differed from musicians in the esteem of regularly arranged vs. randomly arranged notes. This suggests that the association between long-term musical training and different perceptual mechanisms underlying numerical estimation may not be confined to the visual modality. However, neither musicians nor nonmusicians seemed to be susceptible to the acoustic version of the Solitaire illusion, suggesting that the emergence of this illusion may be stimulus and task-dependent.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13423-024-02496-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Solitaire illusions</kwd><kwd>Psychology of music</kwd><kwd>Gestalt</kwd><kwd>Perception</kwd><kwd>Numerical estimation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100015490</institution-id><institution>Dipartimento di Psicologia Generale, Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Padova</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRID 2023 to Christian Agrillo</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Padova</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The term &#x02018;numerosity illusions&#x02019; refers to a category of visual illusions characterized by a misperception of items presented in the scene. This type of illusions is considered a powerful tool to investigate the perceptual biases underlying numerical estimation of human (Bertamini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2023</xref>; Ginsburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1980</xref>) and nonhuman animals (Beran, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; L&#x000f5;oke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). The Solitaire illusion, originally studied by Frith and Frith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1972</xref>), represents the most investigated numerosity illusion (e.g., Agrillo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>; Parrish et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>). This occurs when observers misperceive the relative number of two different colours of otherwise identical objects in intermingled sets. Items forming a single cluster are supposed to be overestimated. In the most traditional version of the Solitaire array, one set of dots is centrally located in the visual scene and forms a single cluster because of proximity and good continuation, compared with the other set of items forming small separate clusters. The illusion has been reproduced in the auditory modality too (Prpic &#x00026; Luccio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>), raising the intriguing possibility that the above-mentioned Gestalt principles may determine a misperception of numerosity also in auditory modality. This result, together with other perceptual effects reported in the visual and auditory modality (e.g., Gestalt principles of proximity and good continuation in the scale illusion; Deutsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1974</xref>) and good continuation in the illusory continuity tones (Riecke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>), suggests that perceptual mechanisms may be universal and not modality dependent. In the case of numerical estimation, however, there is a debate as to whether numerical acuity variates (Tokita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>; vanMarle &#x00026; Wynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>) or not (Barth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>; Izard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>) based on the perceptual modality. According to some authors (Barth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>; Izard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>), the numerical acuity is domain independent; thus, no differences should be observed in visual and nonvisual modalities. On the other hand, Tokita et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>) reported a different performance in numerosity judgments when stimuli were presented in the visual or auditory condition, advancing the hypotheses of multiple core number systems where visual and auditory numerosities would be mentally represented with different signal variabilities.</p><p id="Par3">Perceptual mechanisms are known to be partially influenced by experience (Lu &#x00026; Dosher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2022</xref>). For instance, various studies have reported statistically significant, although small, associations between musical expertise and a better performance in visuo-spatial tasks (e.g., Raven&#x02019;s matrices: Forgeard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>; subtest of the WISC-II: Rauscher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1997</xref>). Musicians appear to outperform nonmusicians also in numerical tasks (e.g., nonsymbolic numerical estimation; Agrillo &#x00026; Piffer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>). Musicians&#x02019; neural correlates during visuo-spatial and numerical tasks were found to be different from those of nonmusicians (Magne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>; Schmithorst &#x00026; Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Sluming et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>). Taken together, these results support the idea that, although the causal mechanisms are not known, music training may be associated with changes in neural circuits not primarily involved in music per se.</p><p id="Par4">Pecunioso and Agrillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) raised the question of whether long-term music training may also influence the perceptual mechanisms underlying numerical estimation. To address this issue, the authors investigated the susceptibility to the Solitaire illusion in musicians and nonmusicians by asking participants to estimate the number of blue dots in an array comprising yellow and blue dots. The dots were either randomly arranged (control trials) or located in a way to form the Solitaire illusion (test trials). In line with previous literature, Pecunioso and Agrillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) found that participants overestimated the number of blue dots when they formed a single cluster. However, nonmusicians had a greater tendency than musicians to overestimate the numerosity of items forming a single cluster. This finding might be interpreted in the light of professional musicians exhibiting a perceptual advantage in numerical estimation and thus being less susceptible to the Solitaire illusion. In addition, the comparison between control (randomly arranged items) and test trials (orderly arranged items) raised the intriguing possibility that regular-random arrays might be another perceptual cue (beyond the formation of a single cluster) that impacts numerical estimation differently in musicians and nonmusicians. The effect of ordered arrays in numerical estimation is known as the Regular&#x02013;Random Numerosity Illusion (RRNI), in which observers are inclined to overestimate ordered objects compared with those arranged randomly (Beran, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Ginsburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1980</xref>). Results from Pecunioso and Agrillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) indeed suggested that musicians appeared to be less fooled by the regular&#x02013;random effect.</p><p id="Par5">The potential link between musical expertise and different perceptual mechanisms of quantitative estimation may be either confined to the visuo-spatial domain or, instead, occur also in other perceptual modalities. To help shed light on this debate, in the current study, we present an acoustic version of the Solitaire illusion to musicians and nonmusicians. Originally developed by Prpic and Luccio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>), the acoustic Solitaire illusion is characterized by audio files that reproduce an arrangement in pitch space similar to the linear arrangement of dots in the visual Solitaire illusion (Frith &#x00026; Frith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1972</xref>). The pitch space is defined by the relative pitch of two tones from two different musical instruments (i.e., piano and drums). The two types of notes corresponded to the different-coloured dots of the visual illusion. Prpic and Luccio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) provided the first evidence of a numerosity misperception with the auditory pattern. However, as participants were involved in relative numerosity judgments (more piano or drum sounds?), it was not possible to assess the exact magnitude of numerosity misperception.</p><p id="Par6">Starting from the illusory stimuli developed by Prpic and Luccio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>), we generated the auditory version of the Solitaire illusion with piano and trombone tones. Should musicians perform better than nonmusicians in the numerical auditory estimation, this would support the idea that musical training has a universal and modality-independent influence on numerical estimation. On the contrary, if we did not observe a difference between musicians and nonmusicians in the auditory modality, we might conclude that the perceptual mechanisms that permit musicians to be less susceptible to the Solitaire illusion (Pecunioso &#x00026; Agrillo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) are modality dependent and probably confined to the visual modality.</p><p id="Par7">Lastly, we analysed the performance of musicians and nonmusicians with regular (the illusory patterns) versus random patterns of notes (control trials) to see whether the accuracy of the two groups differ when the target notes were regularly and randomly arranged. As far as we are aware, no study has currently investigated the equivalent acoustic version of the RRNI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par8">Forty volunteers participated in the experiment and were assigned to a group of musicians or nonmusicians.

The experiment was built and run with E-Prime 2.0. The task was conducted in quiet rooms located at either the Conservatory of Padua or at the home of participants in Brescia. Testing participants in different places was not meant to affect their performance as all subjects were placed in a quiet room and wore noise-cancelling headphones (used also to present the stimuli) and an eye mask as a strategy to limit visual inputs coming from the different environments. This latter strategy also allowed participants to focus on acoustic stimuli.</p><p id="Par10">The stimuli consisted of a sequence of trombone and piano notes (.wav format, 75 dB SPL) created using MuseScore3 software (Version 3.0.1.20439). We chose piano and trombone tones because of their highly different timbre. Stimuli were made by three different notes: A (830.61 Hz), B (233.08 Hz), and E notes (77.82 Hz). In nonsymbolic numerical tasks, stimuli are commonly presented for a very limited amount of time to avoid the use of verbal counting (Agrillo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; Halberda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>; Vetter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2008</xref>). Therefore, unlike Prpic and Luccio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>), whose tempo for each audio file was fixed at 120 bpm, we opted for a faster tempo of 200 bpm. Notes were arranged to form three different patterns (Patterns A, B, and C). These corresponded to spatial arrangements that compose the linear version of the Solitaire illusion (Frith &#x00026; Frith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1972</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The three patterns (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold>) of the visual version of the Solitaire illusion (white and black dots) and the corresponding acoustic version (musical score)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13423_2024_2496_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">Firstly, participants received a training phase in which six trials (2 for Pattern A, 2 for Pattern B&#x0201a; and 2 for Pattern C) were presented. These were composed of a total of 32 notes randomly located. Half of the trials included 10 piano notes and 22 trombone notes, whereas the other half presented the opposite arrangement (22 piano notes and 10 trombone notes). Two participants in the nonmusician group were excluded from the experiment at this stage, as they did not prove to understand the task. In the experimental phase, 144 trials were randomly presented. Stimuli were divided into control and test (illusory) trials. They again included 32 overall notes for each file. Control trials consisted of sequences of 14, 16, or 18 piano notes randomly arranged within Patterns A, B&#x0201a; and C (for a total of 108 control trials). Trombone notes were 18, 16&#x0201a; and 14, respectively. Test stimuli (16 piano and 16 trombone notes; piano and trombone notes were orderly presented) appeared 36 times, 25% of the total amount of trials. The limited prevalence of test trials aimed at preventing participants from understanding the regularity of test trials and in using nongenuine strategies of numerical estimation (e.g., by using the metre of the music score). Like the control trials, the test trials were arranged within the three patterns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) but were characterized (a) by the same number of piano and trombone notes and (b) specific orders of notes to form three acoustic versions of the Solitaire illusion investigated by Prpic and Luccio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). Pitch proximity is one of the strongest Gestalt mechanisms for clustering notes (Deutsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). Accordingly, in half of the test trials (<italic>N</italic> = 18), the piano notes had the same pitch in order to form a single cluster; in the other half, they formed two (smaller) clusters as two pitches were presented (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for a summary of the types of stimuli and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">supplementary material</xref> for some examples of the auditory stimuli).

The experimenter clearly explained to each participant which sequence was made by piano notes and which was made by trombone notes. Then, participants underwent a training phase consisting of six acoustic stimuli. After each sequence, participants were asked to estimate, as quickly as possible, how many piano notes they heard. The experimenter recorded the participants&#x02019; response. The following stimulus was played after the participant pressed the spacebar. Once the training phase was concluded, the experiment started. The experimental phase was divided into two blocks with 72 trials each. Participants were free to take a break after the first block, and, as soon as ready, they pressed the space bar to begin the second block of trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Control experiment: Digit span test</title><p id="Par13">The digit span test (a subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale [WMS]) was performed to examine whether any potential difference between the two groups in the main experiment could be ascribed to differences in working memory and attention to the musical training. Specifically, we used the digit span forward (FS) and the digit span backward (BS) tasks: After the experimenter read a sequence of numbers, participants recalled the numbers forward (i.e., in the same order as presented) or backward (i.e., repeated in reverse order). Then, we recorded the overall span forward (FS) and backward (SB), as well as the total number of digits correctly remembered in the hardest trials, both forward (i.e., subscore of the digit span forward [SSF]) and backward (i.e., span subscore of the digit span backward [SSB]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Acoustic Solitaire illusion experiment</title><p id="Par14">For the control trials, we computed the mean number of estimated piano notes for each stimulus type (from now on <italic>absolute response</italic>). Additionally, to understand the extent to which participant estimations deviated from the actual number of notes presented (i.e., the magnitude of numerosity misperception), the error rate of each participant&#x02019;s response was calculated using the following formula [(participant&#x02019;s response &#x02013; target number)/target number] &#x000d7; 100 (Dormal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>; Pecunioso et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Pecunioso &#x00026; Agrillo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>). Thus, error rates are expressed as percentages of deviation from the target number with positive values representing an overestimation and negative values indicating an underestimation of the target number of notes. The error rates obtained were then averaged among the 12 trials of each type of stimulus (from now on <italic>mean error rate</italic>). A mean error rate equal to zero meant a correct estimation (for instance, error = &#x02212;1 in 6 trials and error = 1 in the other 6 trials led to a mean error rate equal to 0). Also, in the test trials, we obtained participants&#x02019; mean absolute responses and mean error rates for each stimulus type.</p><p id="Par15">We analyzed data by means of JASP 0.16.1 (JASP Team, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2022</xref>).

This would imply that the perceptual modifications associated with long-term music training are universal rather than modality dependent. To achieve this goal, we compared musicians and nonmusicians&#x02019; numerical estimation in the presence of an acoustic version of the Solitaire illusion (test trials) and stimuli in which nonordered sequences of notes were presented (control trials). We did not find evidence of differences in participants&#x02019; estimation when piano notes formed a single cluster rather than two smaller clusters. None of the different patterns (A, B, and C) played a significant role in participants&#x02019; responses. It is worth noting that, although our stimuli were created following the instructions provided by Prpic and Luccio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>), they were also different with respect to two important issues. First, we opted for a tempo of 200 bpm (rather than 120 bpm) to avoid the possibility that musicians would have had more time to adopt metric strategies to estimate the number of piano notes. Second, we proposed a different task from that of Prpic and Luccio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>), in which participants had to establish whether there were more piano or drums notes (i.e., a relative numerosity judgment). Instead, in our study, participants were presented with an absolute numerosity task in which they needed to estimate the number of piano notes. The lack of differences reported in our study as a function of the arrangements of the notes suggests that the emergence of an acoustic Solitaire illusion is not exclusively based on the pitch arrangements of the two types of sounds (piano and trombone notes) but may depend also on the physical properties of the stimuli (slower vs. faster tempo) and the task requests (relative vs. absolute numerosity judgments, as previously found with another visual illusion; Parrish et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>). With respect to the comparison between the acoustic and visual arrangements of the items composing the illusory pattern, it is important to acknowledge that Pecunioso and Agrillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) presented the most classical version of the illusion, the cross-like pattern, which is a spatial configuration that unfortunately cannot be transposed in the acoustic modality in any way. Here, we needed to adopt the linear versions of this illusion (Frith &#x00026; Frith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1972</xref>). We cannot exclude that the differential performance of musicians with the acoustic version of the Solitaire pattern might be due to slight differences in the magnitude of the illusory effect with the cross-like pattern and the linear version of the illusion.</p><p id="Par24">As a secondary goal, we aimed to test whether regular patterns, in comparison with random ones, are also overestimated in the auditory modality (e.g., RRNI; Beran, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Ginsburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1980</xref>). We found that clustering (ordered vs. random notes) does influence nonmusicians&#x02019; numerosity estimation. Indeed, nonmusicians were less accurate when piano notes were arranged regularly as compared with when they were randomly located. However, we noticed an important difference between the visual and auditory modalities: In the auditory modality, regularly arranged patterns were underestimated by nonmusicians, whereas the opposite effect was commonly reported in the visual modality (Beran, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Ginsburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1980</xref>; Pecunioso et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). Hence, clustering might have a significant, but opposite, impact on the visual and auditory numerical estimation. One may hypothesize that relatively fast stimuli&#x02014;like the ones used here&#x02014;could increase the difficulty in segregating each sound. However, we believe that this is unlikely as the stimuli presented are below the threshold of gap detection used to delineate temporal resolution in the auditory system (Trehub et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1995</xref>). A different consideration must be made for musicians, where the &#x0201c;regular vs. random&#x0201d; bias was not observed. Musicians were similarly accurate for both regularly and randomly arranged patterns (with responses often close to 16). This is in line with Pecunioso and Agrillo&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) study on the association between long-term musical training and a reduced susceptibility to numerosity illusions.</p><p id="Par25">Analyses of the control trials highlighted a general tendency to underestimate target notes. Nonmusicians were more inclined to underestimate the number of notes compared with musicians. This is not unexpected in the literature as, in the visual modality, there is a general tendency to underestimate large numbers of items (Crollen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>; Izard &#x00026; Dehaene, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Krueger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1982</xref>; Pecunioso et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Zhang &#x00026; Okamoto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>). Data reported here align with this literature and extend it to the auditory modality, suggesting that the tendency to underestimate large numbers is also modality independent. However, musicians estimated on average 15 notes in all control trials, whereas nonmusicians tended to perceive 14 notes. The mean absolute response, together with the lower variability of their responses, indicates that musicians were more accurate in the nonsymbolic numerical task. This issue is debated in the visual modality (Agrillo &#x00026; Piffer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>; Pecunioso &#x00026; Agrillo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) and has never been reported, as far as we are aware, in the auditory modality. It is possible that the physiological enhancements throughout the auditory system associated with musical training (Rammsayer &#x00026; Altenmuller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>; Strait &#x00026; Kraus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>) lead to a better extrapolation of quantitative information from acoustic stimuli. Beyond this, the nature of the stimuli might have partially biased the result: to generate our stimuli, we used a software whose sounds are vaguely reminiscent of musical instruments. Also, in the familiarization phase we ensured that all participants could easily distinguish the two stimuli as a function of timbre. However, because musicians are more likely to be familiar with piano and trombone notes, we cannot exclude that a familiarity/perception advantage with these timbres might have occurred here.</p><p id="Par26">One of the main difficulties in interpreting the differences between musicians and nonmusicians is that most of the studies are correlational ones that cannot firmly ascertain any far-transfer of skill from music training to other cognitive domains, as no direction of causality can be inferred. Also, because most of the studies investigating experts&#x02019; cognitive abilities are quasi-experiments, no random allocation of the participants can be done, a fact that prevents from safeguarding the baseline equivalence between the experimental and control groups. Recent meta-analyses have also argued against any possible association between musical training and enhanced cognitive skills (Sala &#x00026; Gobet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). We acknowledge that our study is another quasi-experiment with the same limits of existing literature (after all, our musicians differed for more than 10 years of musical practice). In determining the criteria for participants&#x02019; recruitment, we selected participants with a similar age, sex ratio&#x0201a; and education, limiting the intrinsic flaws of this widely adopted procedure. In addition, the fact that the digit span test did not show any difference between the two groups in both the control and test trials indicates that the phenomenon observed here cannot be ascribed to differences between the two groups in working memory (Talamini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>) and/or attentional/motivational factors.</p><p id="Par27">To conclude, in agreement with what was observed in the visual modality, we found evidence that a specific clustering of acoustic stimuli (regular vs. ordered arrays) influences numerosity estimation, a fact that encourages the attempts to generate acoustic versions of the RRNI. This susceptibility seems different for individuals who received robust musical training, reinforcing the conclusions by Pecunioso and Agrillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) on a link between musical training and different perceptual biases affecting numerosity estimation. However, the acoustic version of the Solitaire illusion presented here proved to be ineffective in generating a numerosity illusion based on the formation of a single Gestalt. The emergence of this illusion in the auditory modality is likely to be stimulus and task-dependent. Future investigations are now necessary to deepen the proper conditions in eliciting the Solitaire illusion in the auditory modality and to shed light on musicians&#x02019; susceptibility to acoustic numerosity illusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2496_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 117 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2496_MOESM2_ESM.zip"><caption><p>Supplementary file2 (ZIP 8.71 mb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Open practices statement</bold></p><p>The experiment reported in this article was not formally preregistered.
