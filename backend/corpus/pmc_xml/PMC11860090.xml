It is estimated that ~7.6 billion people worldwide are affected by RD, including 2.7 billion with uncorrected RD, 2.0 billion with corrected RD, and 2.9 billion without the need for vision correction (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In China, the prevalence of RD is similarly concerning. The National Health Commission's report on the &#x0201c;14th 5-Year Plan for National Eye Health (2021&#x02013;2025)&#x0201d; highlights the significant health burden of RD, particularly myopia, among children and adolescents (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Uncorrected refractive errors are a major contributor to vision impairment both in China and globally (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The economic impact of RD is considerable, as individuals often incur substantial costs for corrective lenses, eye care services, and potential lost wages due to vision impairment. Moreover, RD have been associated with an increased risk of ocular complications, such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment. RD also affect academic performance, work productivity, and overall quality of life (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Older adults with vision impairment are at greater risk for adverse outcomes, including cognitive decline, dementia, depression, and falls (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, RD is a health issue that can be corrected or prevented, suggesting that early prevention and intervention can significantly reduce its disease burden (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The current prevalence and disease burden of RD represent a significant public health concern, affecting millions of individuals globally. Approximately 90% of individuals with uncorrected RD reside in developing countries. In 2018, China ranked second among the top 10 countries with the highest burden of uncorrected RD and is projected to rank third by 2025 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The prevalence of RD varies across regions, with particularly high rates in metropolitan areas, where lifestyle factors such as increased use of electronic devices and reduced outdoor activities have contributed to the rising prevalence of RD (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In response to these challenges, it is crucial to implement effective public health strategies that focus on increasing awareness, improving access to eye care services, and promoting regular eye examinations. Early detection and timely correction of RD can significantly improve the quality of life for affected individuals and substantially reduce the associated disease burden. Addressing this issue is vital for healthcare systems worldwide, given the increasing prevalence of refractive conditions. Despite the considerable public health implications of RD, several research gaps remain. There is a lack of comprehensive research on the temporal trend of RD, particularly concerning the net effects of age, period, and cohort. Furthermore, the future trajectory of the disease burden of RD remains uncertain. These gaps limit our ability to accurately identify the target population and design effective interventions.</p><p>The aim of this study was to address the existing gaps in understanding the health burden of RD in China. Specifically, we sought to estimate temporal trends in the prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with RD in China, stratified by age and gender, and to compare these trends with global data. By identifying high-risk groups and providing a comprehensive analysis of RD prevalence, we can develop targeted prevention strategies. This approach will help reduce disparities in the global burden of RD and facilitate more effective coverage for refractive errors (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Data source</title><p>The data were extracted from the GBD 2021 dataset, a publicly accessible and comprehensive database that records disease burden indicators for 371 diseases and injuries, and 88 risk factors. This dataset spans a range of conditions, from infectious diseases to non-communicable conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental health disorders, covering 204 countries and territories and 811 sub-national locations from 1990 to 2021. The data sources, statistical models, and core results of GBD 2021 had been previously described in detail (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) GBD Results Tool was used to collect data on RD, including prevalence numbers, DALYs numbers, age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPR), age standardized DALYs rates (ASDALYR), crude prevalence rates, crude DALYs rates, and their corresponding 95% uncertainty interval (UI) for China and globally from 1990 to 2021. The GBD Tool was available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/" ext-link-type="uri">https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/</ext-link>.</p><p>Given that the data used in this study are openly accessible, ethics approval and informed consent were not required.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Trend analysis of disease burden</title><p>This study conducted descriptive analyses and visualizations of the prevalence and DALYs trends of RD in China and globally, with a focus on gender and age differences. To more precisely reveal segmented trends in prevalence and DALYs of RD from 1990 to 2021, the Joinpoint 5.1.0.0 software, available on the National Cancer Institute's website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/download" ext-link-type="uri">https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/download</ext-link>, accessed on April 10, 2024), was employed for segmented regression analysis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This method can identify significant joinpoints, segmenting the overall long-term trends into distinct subsegments (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>For each subsegment, the annual percentage change (APC) was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and the significance of each trend was assessed. Additionally, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) was calculated to summarize the overall trends. An uptrend in a subsegment was indicated if the lower boundary of the APC/AAPC 95% CI was &#x0003e;0; conversely, a downtrend was demonstrated if the upper boundary of the 95% CI was below 0.</p><p>The statistical analyses and visualizations of the data were performed using R statistical software (version 4.2.1) and Joinpoint software (version 4.9.1.0). A <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>0.05</italic> was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 Age-period-cohort model</title><p>The age-period-cohort (APC) model was utilized as a robust methodological framework to explain the temporal trends in prevalence and DALYs of RD from 1990 to 2021. Based on the APC model, the net trends of prevalence and DALYs were analyzed by examining the effects of age, period, and cohort (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To meet the requirements of APC analysis, the data were grouped into successive 5-year age groups (i.e., 0&#x02013;4, 5&#x02013;9, &#x02026;, 95&#x02013;99), consecutive 5-year periods from 1992 to 2021 (i.e., 1992&#x02013;1996, 1997&#x02013;2001, &#x02026;, 2017&#x02013;2021), and corresponding consecutive 5-year birth cohorts (i.e.,1897&#x02013;1901, 1902&#x02013;1906, &#x02026;, 2017&#x02013;2021). We then computed the net drift, local drift, longitudinal age curve, and relative risk (RR) for age, period, and cohort respectively. For APC analysis, the National Cancer Institute's online APC Web Tool, available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://analysistools.cancer.gov/apc/" ext-link-type="uri">https://analysistools.cancer.gov/apc/</ext-link>, was used.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Correlation analysis with SDI</title><p>This study employed Pearson correlation to assess the strength and direction of linear relationships between the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and disease burden indicators. SDI is a composite measure that reflects the development status of a country or region, calculated based on variables such as per capita income, average educational attainment, and fertility rates. A higher SDI value indicates a more advanced development status for a country or region, with values ranging from 0 to 1.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 Autoregressive integrated moving average model</title><p>The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a powerful statistical tool for time series analysis and forecasting. It combines two key components: the autoregressive (AR) model, which captures the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations, and the moving average (MA) model, which models the relationship between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.</p><p>The ARIMA model serves as a robust framework for understanding and forecasting time-dependent data across various fields, including epidemiology, economics, and environmental studies. In previous GBD studies, ARIMA model had been widely used (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Similarly, in this study, the ARIMA model was employed to forecast the prevalence and DALYs of RD in China for the next decade, providing insights into future trends in the health burden of RD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>3 Results</title><sec><title>3.1 Temporal trends of RD prevalence and DALYs in China and globally</title><sec><title>3.1.1 Changes in prevalence between 1990 and 2021</title><p>A comparison of the disease burden of RD in China and globally between 1990 and 2021 was presented in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.

To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of RD burden trends in China using Joinpoint regression analysis in conjunction with the APC model. Previous studies have primarily explored the global health burden of RD, utilizing data from the GBD 2017 or GBD 2019. These studies focused on evaluating the health burden of RD by factors such as year, age, region, gender, socioeconomic status, and other national characteristics, as well as analyzing its socioeconomic inequalities (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We also identified discrepancies in the data following the release of GBD 2021, which could alter the previous understanding of the health burden of RD. GBD 2019 reported the global ASDALYR for RD as 88.9 (95% UI: 60.5, 120.3) in 1990, while GBD 2021 reported the global ASDALYR for RD as 88.0 (95% UI: 62.0, 125.0) for the same year. This discrepancy may be attributed to improvements in the algorithms and models used in the analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the health burden of RD in China using the most recent data from GBD 2021.</p><p>From 1990 to 2021, the proportion of RD cases in China increased from 15.5 to 16.9% globally. The proportion of DALYs in China increased from 17.2 to 18.7% globally. Among 61 countries and regions in Asia, China's DALYs crude rate ranking for RD has risen from 32nd to 13th, with China's DALYs number consistently ranking among the top 3 (i.e., second; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). Compared to most countries and regions in Asia, the burden of RD in China is becoming increasingly significant. Among the six subcategories of blindness and vision loss in China, both the DALYs crude rate and number have consistently ranked second (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), indicating the need for heightened attention to RD within the broader context of blindness and vision loss. Although there are significant differences in the burden of RD among different countries and regions, a study conducted in China did not observe such differences (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), suggesting that geographical factors may not directly affect RD burden, but rather exert their influence through other potential factors such as race, education and economic level.</p><p>According to the current research, although the crude rate and the total number of cases exhibited an overall upward trend, there was an overall decline in the ASPR and ASDALYR for RD in China from 1990 to 2021. Similar patterns were observed in the global population. The decrease in age-standardized rates may be related to the continuous improvement in social development (e.g., SDI) and advancements in ophthalmic care, including early detection and management strategies, which may effectively reduce the prevalence and impact of RD among specific age groups. The increase in crude rates may be mainly attributed to changes in population structure, which result in a doubling of the number of patients in particular age groups, however, the standardized rate may not show significant changes (e.g., age group of 30&#x02013;60 years in China). Research shows, over the past three decades, population aging has significantly altered the demographic structure (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As the population grows and ages, the number of individuals affected by RD is likely to increase substantially (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, the prevalence and DALYs across all age groups increased significantly from 1990 to 2021. However, the decline in age-specific prevalence rates and DALYs rates was more pronounced among middle-aged and older individuals than among younger populations, further indicating that aging is a key factor influencing the health burden of RD. Although ASPR and ASDALYR for RD in China were lower than the global averages, the increase in the crude rate of PR and DALYs in China was considerably higher than the global rate, suggesting that RD burden in China may be disproportionately affected by population aging.</p><p>Notably, several significant turning points occurred between 1990 and 2021. The jointpoint regression analysis revealed that the ASPR and ASDALYR shifted abruptly from an upward to a downward trend after 2000, while the upward trend of the crude rate decelerated, potentially attributable to a decline in age-specific rates. Similarly, turning points were observed in 2015, where a downward trend reversed to an upward trend, and in 2019, where the trend reversed again from upward to downward. The former may be associated with the widespread use of electronic devices, while the latter may be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some studies suggest that home confinement during the pandemic affected people's lifestyles, leading to an increase in RD among children (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Further research is required to determine whether the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic varies across different age groups.</p><p>Our study also demonstrated that the health burden of RD exhibits two peaks across different age groups, with a smaller peak in the 5&#x02013;9 age group and a larger peak in the 65&#x02013;69 age group. This suggests the need for increased attention to both children and the older adult in future healthcare planning. Since RD primarily encompasses myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia, the overall trends in the health burden of RD reflect these conditions collectively. Myopia is highly prevalent among young individuals and tends to stabilize between 15 and 16 years of age (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In China, myopia is also the most common type of RD among school children (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Hyperopia is more common in younger children and typically decreases with age as the lens of the eye loses elasticity. Astigmatism often coexists with myopia or hyperopia. In young children, myopia and astigmatism remain the leading causes of uncorrected RD worldwide (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Presbyopia, however, affects nearly everyone over the age of 40, with a global prevalence reaching ~85% in this age group (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). With the aging of the population, the number of individuals affected by presbyopia is likely to increase further (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Given that myopia cannot be completely cured, the health burden of RD in the older population is influenced by both myopia and presbyopia. Cataract and glaucoma surgeries may also contribute to the high prevalence of RD in the older adult (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The rise in myopia due to lifestyle and environmental changes, coupled with the increase in presbyopia due to population aging, are the primary drivers of the RD disease burden.</p><p>In terms of gender differences, females consistently display a greater RD burden than males. Similar findings have been reported in previous studies (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Based on the GBD 2019, the overall prevalence of visual loss in women was also higher than that in men in China (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Several factors contribute to the gender disparity in RD. Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy have been implicated in the development and progression of RD (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A genetic component also plays a significant role, with the heritability of refractive errors in females being higher than in males (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Gender-based disparities in healthcare access exacerbate this issue (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Consequently, special attention should also be given to women.</p><p>The results of the APC model analysis indicated that, although the ASPR and ASDALYR exhibited an overall downward trend for the total population, significant differences remained across various age groups. Among the younger population, the standardization rates trended upward over time, whereas the middle-aged and older populations showed a downward trend. This may be associated with increased exposure of younger individuals to electronic devices. The study also revealed considerable variations in disease burden across different age groups, with the middle-aged and older populations bearing a significantly higher burden compared to younger groups. These findings suggest that the current disease burden of RD is primarily attributed to the middle-aged and older populations. However, the increasing health burden of RD among younger individuals should not be overlooked. Regarding the effects of age, period, and cohort, there was little variation in disease burden among different birth cohorts. The burden was more pronounced across different periods, showing an overall downward trend after 2005. This trend may be linked to the government's growing focus on RD and improvements in medical care in recent years.</p><p>Based on data from 1990 to 2021, this study predicts the future health burden of RD in China. Consistent with previous research findings (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), we also found that the prevalence and DALYs rates for RD are expected to continue declining over the next decade. However, as noted earlier, the actual health burden of RD should not be underestimated due to the increasing prevalence of myopia and an aging population. The prevention of RD should focus on high-risk populations and specific risk factors. According to our findings, the high-risk groups primarily include older women, older men, girls, and boys.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that RD are influenced by a variety of risk factors, including environmental, genetic, lifestyle, ocular health, and systemic health factors. Genetics plays a significant role in RD, with familial aggregation suggesting a genetic link (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Insufficient outdoor activity increase the risk of myopia (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Certain ocular conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy, can affect refractive status and exacerbate the burden of RD (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Systemic conditions, including hormonal imbalances (particularly during pregnancy), can also influence refractive development (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Based on a comprehensive understanding of the risk factors and high-risk groups for RD, specific measures should be implemented in the future. Promoting healthy lifestyles among all high-risk population, such as encouraging outdoor activities, can help reduce the risk of RD. Regular eye examinations should be encouraged, especially for children, adolescents, and individuals with a family history of RD, to facilitate early detection and correction of RD. It is also important to monitor and manage systemic conditions that may affect refractive status and to educate individuals on maintaining overall health to protect their ocular health. Raising public awareness and educating the community about RD risk factors and preventive measures through campaigns and programs can further encourage individuals to seek professional advice and treatment when necessary. Additionally, this study identifies a negative correlation between China's SDI and both ASPR and ASDALYR from 1990 to 2021. This suggests that improving SDI levels may contribute to alleviating the overall disease burden of RD.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, due to the reliance on existing GBD data for secondary analysis, there is a potential for misclassification bias. Second, during regular updates to the GBD database, new statistical methods and models may be introduced, which could result in discrepancies between data from previous and updated versions. Third, GBD 2021 does not provide separate disease burden data for specific refractive disorders such as myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, anisometropia, presbyopia, and aphakia, thus limiting the ability to compare their prevalence and DALYs in China. As a result, only the overall health burden of RD could be analyzed. Fourth, GBD 2021 does not offer detailed data at the provincial or city level in China, preventing the analysis of regional differences in the health burden of RD and restricting the exploration of its spatial distribution. Finally, due to the limited demographic data available in the GBD database, it is not possible to fully examine the relationships between factors such as occupation, education, ethnicity, and disease burden. Furthermore, the GBD database lacks risk factor data for RD, which precludes the ability to conduct a risk factor analysis for these disorders.</p><p>Future research on RD should focus more on gender and age disparities through longitudinal studies that track trends, investigate genetic factors influencing gender differences, and examine the socioeconomic impacts on access to ophthalmic care. Investigating the effects of environmental factors, such as screen time and early childhood vision screening programs, as well as cultural variations, could offer valuable insights into the growing burden.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>The findings indicate the age-standardized rates of PR and DALYs of RD have decreased in recent years and may continue to alleviate in the next decades. However, the crude rates of PR and DALYs are on the rise. The health burden of RD is still heavy, with females having a higher burden than males and the older population having a higher burden than young people. These findings suggest that special attention should be given to these populations, who may experience disproportionate impacts due to factors like gender differences and aging. Targeted public health interventions are also essential for reducing the overall burden and improving long-term health outcomes associated with RD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the GBD study collaborations for sharing the data.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
