</self-uri><abstract><p>The posterior oral cavity serves as an entry point to both the digestive and respiratory systems. Optimal oral hygiene, particularly by means of gargling, has been shown to effectively reduce transmission and duration of respiratory illnesses (Clinical Trials registration: NCT06479226). Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of gargling with an antimicrobial mouthwash in preventing the development of respiratory symptoms. To assess the impact of using an antimicrobial mouthwash for gargling in lowering the incidence of upper respiratory symptoms. A total of 150 individuals were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: Control group: participants were requested to brush their teeth twice daily for two minutes using a commercially available fluoride toothpaste; and the Test Group, which also brushed their teeth twice daily for two minutes with a commercially available fluoride toothpaste and additional gargling twice a day with a mouthwash containing 0.075% Cetylpyridinium chloride and 0.28% Zinc Lactate (CPC+Zn). Individuals were asked to complete the WURSS-21 Daily Symptom Report over the course of the three-month study period using a diary. Regular gargling with the mouthwash containing CPC+Zn was efficacious in decreasing both the frequency (21.5% lower) and severity (11% lower) of respiratory symptoms throughout the study. Additionally, individuals that performed consistent cleansing of the posterior oral cavity with mouthwash had greater interference in daily activities, which should be further investigated. Adding gargling with a mouthwash containing 0.075% CPC + 0.28% Zn to a normal oral hygiene routine proves beneficial in lowering the incidence of upper respiratory symptoms commonly associated with cold and the flu.</p><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06479226" ext-link-type="uri">NCT06479226</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Globally, yearly epidemics of viral respiratory infections pose a significant health challenge, leading to increased economic strain on healthcare systems, heightened morbidity, and higher mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2019, the number of upper respiratory infections reached 17.2 billion cases, accounting for 42.82% of all diseases and injuries included in the Global Burden of Diseases for that year [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The global prevalence of respiratory illnesses, including seasonal flu, stands at approximately 1 billion cases per year. Among these cases, approximately 3 to 5 million instances are classified as severe flu infections [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, the estimated economic costs linked to common cold amounted $40 billion annually, whereas influenza incurs an even higher economic burden, surpassing $87 billion each year [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A population-based cross-sectional study conducted in Brazil in May 2020 reported a prevalence of flu-like syndrome symptoms of 3.38% [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, influenza incidence in Brazil is influenced by seasonal variation, with higher rates observed in winter and the lowest rates recorded in January during the summer months [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Regarding the factors associated with upper respiratory infections, literature indicates that the presence of high humidity and low temperatures is related with several virus-related infections worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the oral cavity serves as a gateway for bacteria and viruses, facilitating their entry into the lower airways, such as the bronchi and lungs, which can be affected by respiratory diseases [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Research has also demonstrated that maintaining good oral health care can be effective in preventing the onset of respiratory diseases [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Literature also reports virucidal efficacy of chlorhexidine (CHX), as this product has demonstrated the ability to reduce viral load [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has also proven effective against viruses like Influenza A [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, the virucidal effectiveness of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) has been previously documented, which includes reducing the duration of flu symptoms such as cough and sore throat [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, it has been reported that the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load was significantly reduced after a single rinse with mouthwashes containing CHX or CPC with zinc (Zn) [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CPC+Zn are antiseptic components present in mouthwashes, which are safe to use and have demonstrated excellent antiplaque and antigingivitis efficacy as adjuvants to mechanical oral hygiene practices [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The present study assessed the efficacy of regular gargling with a mouthwash containing CPC+Zn in reducing the incidence of upper respiratory symptoms. The working hypothesis was that individuals who regularly cleansed the posterior oral cavity by gargling with mouthwash would experience a lower incidence of upper respiratory symptoms compared to those who did not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This is a Phase III, open-label, randomized clinical trial that employed a single-blind, parallel design.

Moreover, it was hypothesized that those with carpal tunnel syndrome would perform their oral hygiene in a lower efficiency when compared to those without it.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Experimental groups</title><p>Two experimental groups were employed in this study. In the control group, participants were provided with a commercially available adult soft bristle toothbrush and a toothpaste containing fluoride. In the test group, participants received the same toothbrush and toothpaste. In addition, a mouthwash containing 0.075% CPC + 0.28% Zn lactate in an alcohol-free base was used. Patients were instructed to use only the provided products, though interproximal hygiene was permitted. No placebo substance was used in the control group, as the current study aimed to compare individuals who perform the cleansing of their throat with CPC+Zn in comparison to those who did not perform it.</p><p>In both groups, participants were given instructions to brush their teeth for two minutes, twice daily (morning and evening), using the provided toothpaste. Additionally, only in the test group, after brushing their teeth, participants were requested to gargle with the provided mouthwash. They were asked to pour 20&#x02009;ml of the mouthwash, gargle for 30 seconds, and then spit it out. This procedure was to be repeated twice daily throughout the 90-day follow-up period.</p><p>The distribution of the products was performed in a distinct area from the examination room by site personnel who were not part of the clinical evaluations (MC, NMP, and TMS). Oral hygiene products were provided to participants in sealed bags to ensure consistency in product aesthetics and packaging across study groups. The instructions given to participants included a study group code, guidance for at-home use, and safety information, which encompassed emergency contact details. The treatment products were replenished 30 days after baseline. No dietary restrictions were imposed on participants during the study. Upon finishing the 90-day follow-up period, participants were instructed to return all both used and unused products.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Clinical examination</title><p>During the initial baseline appointment, participants received an oral soft tissue assessment aimed at identifying any abnormal conditions in various areas, including the soft palate, hard palate, gingival mucosa, buccal mucosa, mucogingival folds, tongue, sublingual and submandibular salivary glands, tonsillar region, and pharyngeal areas. This examination was conducted by a trained and blinded examiner (FWMGM). The same clinical examination was repeated after 30 and 90 days of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Outcome</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of upper respiratory symptoms linked to the cold and flu season. Participants were required to diligently fill out the WURSS-21 Daily Symptom Report [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] on a daily basis during the 3 months of follow-up. This questionnaire consists of 21 items designed to evaluate the overall severity of upper respiratory symptoms. It employs a Likert scale, with responses ranging from 0 (indicating no symptoms) to 7 (indicating the most severe symptoms).</p><p>The first 11 questions assess symptom severity, encompassing overall symptoms (with the following question: &#x0201c;How sick do you feel today?&#x0201d;) and the severity of specific symptoms experienced in the last 24 hours. These symptoms include runny nose, congested nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head pressure, chest pressure, and fatigue. Additionally, the questionnaire evaluates how these symptoms interfere with daily activities, which encompass the ability to think clearly, sleep well, breathe easily, engage in physical exercise, perform routine daily tasks, work outside the home, work within the home, interact with others, and maintain one&#x02019;s personal life.</p><p>To encourage compliance to the protocol, subjects were requested to submit photos of the questionnaire on a weekly basis. During these interactions, they were also reminded to consistently use the designated oral hygiene products allocated to them.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Sample size</title><p>The study aimed to include a total of 150 participants, with the expectation that at least 136 (68 in each group) would successfully complete the study protocol. A power calculation indicated that with approximately 75 replicates for each participant, the study can detect a difference in incidence rates of 3% with 80% probability. This calculation factored in an estimated dropout rate of approximately 10% over the course of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>The randomization process was performed by a researcher (NMP) who was not part of the clinical examinations. Simple randomization was employed, and a website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.randomization.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.randomization.org</ext-link>) was utilized for this purpose. This process was performed in blocks of different sizes. However, participants who cohabited were assigned to the same study group. Allocation concealment was also managed by the same researcher, who used opaque and sealed envelopes, which were stored in a room with limited access, to ensure the integrity of the allocation process.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The individual was considered the unit of analysis. The raw symptom severity intensity score data were rescaled to a binary presence/absence score for statistical analysis. Therefore, scores of 1 or 0 were dichotomized in the data set. This strategy was performed to clearly demonstrate any impact of respiratory symptoms.</p><p>Interval plots with 95% confidence intervals were created to facilitate between treatment group symptom rate comparisons. T-test for independent sample was used to statistically compare the treatment group symptom rates. A Group p value less than 0.05 in the t-test indicated statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy-five individuals were enrolled in each experimental group.

This indicates that individuals in the test group, who included regular gargling with CPC+Zn in their oral hygiene routine, exhibited lower respiratory symptoms. Specifically, the test group experienced a 21.5% reduction in overall respiratory symptoms and an 11% reduction in the severity of respiratory symptoms compared to the control group. When these symptoms were analyzed individually, the test group also demonstrated lower symptom severity in several of them, as detailed in <xref rid="pone.0316807.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

The findings consistently revealed that performing an additional step in oral hygiene by gargling with 0.075% CPC and 0.28% Zn Lactate significantly decreased the occurrence and severity of several respiratory symptoms. Based on feedback from test subjects that they experienced higher impact caused by upper respiratory symptoms in their daily activities, further investigation with a larger population is warranted.

In addition, one study showed that CPC+Zn presented higher antiplaque and antigingivitis efficacy when compared to essential oils [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The use of a chemical solution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease resulted in an improvement in respiratory health-related quality of life when compared to the placebo group [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, performing oral hygiene that involves both antiseptics and toothbrushing has proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and shortening the length of stay in intensive care units [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence, it was hypothesized that employing an antiseptic such as CPC+Zn, whether as a rinse or for gargling, may potentially lower the bacterial or virucidal load or delay its subsequent increase. This, in turn, could potentially have a positive impact on respiratory symptoms.</p><p>It is crucial to take into account that the seasonality of respiratory infections tends to be more prominent during periods of low temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recognizing how climatic fluctuations can directly impact the variables of the current study, all data collection was conducted within a narrow timeframe, specifically during the winter in the southern hemisphere. This ensured that all individuals were exposed to the same climatic conditions. Additionally, it is worth noting that Pelotas, Brazil, where the study took place, encounters high levels of relative humidity. This factor may have contributed to an environment conducive to the development of respiratory infections in this population [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The study&#x02019;s findings, demonstrating an overall reduction of 21.5% in respiratory symptoms and an 11% decrease in their severity in the test group compared to the control group, represent a significant outcome that underscores the importance of additional cleansing that targets the posterior oral cavity. Moreover, several specific symptoms, including &#x0201c;how sick do you feel today?,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;runny nose,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;congested nose,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;cough&#x0201d; exhibited statistically significant differences in favor of the test group. These symptoms can lead to financial costs and exert a significant impact on an individual&#x02019;s overall quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Literature has already reported that flu symptoms can impact daily activities [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Given that this additional cleaning through mouthwash is a straightforward and convenient technique, it could be considered as a recommendation for preventing upper respiratory infections. However, higher perception of symptoms was perceived in the test group regarding chest pressure and hoarseness. It may be suggested that patients in this group may have higher expectations of improvement due to the treatment, which might be attributed to novelty of the intervention.</p><p>The data indicated that the Control group generally exhibited more frequent cold/flu symptoms. This is a typical outcome one would expect from administering an efficacious preventative treatment. Interestingly, when afflicted individuals from both groups were asked about the degree to which symptoms interfered in their day-to-day activities, the Test group was found to generally exhibit higher levels of interference. This finding appears somewhat counter intuitive. However, it should be noted that self-reported consumer response data can be subject to bias as a result of the study design with a small sample size. In this study, the hygiene practices of the Test and Control groups were not perfectly matched because the Test group was required to adopt an additional step - the administration mouthwash gargle following brushing. It may be speculated that the addition of this new, adjunctive oral hygiene step may have enhanced the Test group subject&#x02019;s sensitivity to cold/flu symptoms and biased their assessments of symptom interference. Further investigation is necessary to better explain these interference results.</p><p>In terms of the methodology employed to derive these results, it must be highlighted that the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 (WURSS-21) serves as an illness-specific quality of life assessment tool. Its design is geared towards assessing the adverse effects of acute upper respiratory infections, typically presumed to be of viral origin, such as the common cold. This tool has been validated [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and has been used in recent studies evaluating the effectiveness of glycerol throat spray with cold-adapted cod trypsin [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in a mouth spray [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in treating common colds. These studies have reported that the 9-item WURSS-21 domains composite scores served as a sensitive instrument, effectively demonstrating that the treatment significantly enhanced the quality of life for individuals dealing with common colds [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, this tool was previously used in studies examining the connection between the severity of acute respiratory infections and inflammatory biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0316807.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, it must be emphasized that WURSSR-21 serves as a specific tool to assess the impact of upper respiratory symptoms in individuals with this condition. As most of the participants in the present study did not develop any symptom during the 90 days of follow-up, readers must understand that as a possible limitation of the tool. It was noted that symptoms such as a runny nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing showed a stronger association with these biomarkers. It is important to emphasize that, in the current study, participants responded to the WURSS-21 only once at the end of each day over the course of 90 days, providing all self-reported answers.</p><p>The present study has limitations that should be acknowledged. Despite the use of a validated tool for assessing common cold-related outcomes, all the results relied on self-reported data. The absence of direct measurements for other clinical cold symptoms conducted by the researchers may introduce a potential gap in generating precise data regarding the manifestation of cold-related symptoms. Despite this limitation, the favorable outcomes associated with the use of CPC+Zn containing mouthwash in reducing the incidence and severity of respiratory symptoms are noteworthy findings. They can provide valuable insights for future research and further contribute to the body of evidence supporting the use of regular cleansing of the posterior oral cavity as a part of daily oral hygiene. Moreover, as only four individuals (2.67% of the whole sample) reported the use of antibiotics during the follow-up period, we believe that the overall results could not change drastically when removing these individuals from the analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It may be concluded that extending oral care to include the posterior oral cavity through techniques such as gargling with mouthwash has the potential of lowering the incidence of upper respiratory symptoms commonly associated with cold and the flu.</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0316807.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Full protocol assessed by the ethics committee in Portuguese.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0316807.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0316807.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Translated version (in English) for the full protocol assessed by the ethics committee.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0316807.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0316807.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Clinical Trial registration.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0316807.s003.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0316807.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Appendix</label><caption><title>Raw dataset of the study.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0316807.s004.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0316807.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S5 Appendix</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0316807.s005.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>None.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0316807.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Niederman</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Respiratory infections</article-title>. <source>Eur Respir Rev</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>31</volume>:<fpage>220150</fpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">36261160</pub-id>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;During the detailed review of this work, we will be able to identify some questions that are not clear and, on the other hand, allow some questions to be asked.</p><p>Therefore, I begin my contribution:</p><p>1. I thank you once again for trusting me to review this work. Starting with the title, it was not clear what type of analysis was done. If it was a comparison, an efficacy, an effect, an efficiency, I suggest that the title present one of these words that will allow the reader to understand the work much better on a first reading.</p><p>2. TITLE: Here in the abstract it is a little clearer. But I suggest that the title be clearer for reading, probably by incorporating the word Effect.</p><p>3. INTRODUCTION: In the second paragraph, they begin by talking about the prevalence rates of people who have respiratory infections in the United States of America, since the study originated in Brazil. It would be interesting to present the prevalence and/or incidence rates, so that the reader has a clear idea of the situation in which Brazil finds itself in comparison to the data from the United States.</p><p>4. At the end of the introduction. Where the objective of the study is stated, I suggest that it be rewritten to include the word Effect. This will make it clearer and more understandable for the reader.</p><p>5. PARTICIPANTS: Within the eligibility criteria. The authors mention that the participants should have good systemic health. What is not clear is whether the patients had any symptoms of respiratory infection. If they did, I suggest that this be written. If not, justify why these patients were not included.</p><p>6. Within the exclusion criteria. The authors mention that patients with arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome could not participate in the study. Why? Justify your answer.</p><p>7. EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS: The authors mention the composition of the experimental groups:</p><p>a. The negative control group: The authors mention that this group received a toothbrush and a fluoride toothpaste. What is not clear is why this group did not receive a placebo as a product.</p><p>8. SAMPLE CALCULATION: It is not clear how the calculation was performed, what it was based on to arrive at the sample number, I suggest that it be explained and rewritten for the readers' understanding. Since this is a phase 3 of a clinical trial</p><p>9. RENDERING AND ALLOCATION OF PARTICIPANTS: Upon reading, it is not clear how the participants were allocated to their respective experimental groups, which experimental unit was taken into consideration to allocate these patients. I suggest you specify</p><p>10. RESULTS: The authors reported in their results that 01 participant in the control group had adverse effects. One of these patients needed antibiotics for intestinal surgery. What was the justification for remaining in the study? Justify</p><p>11. The authors mentioned that 02 participants in the test group used antibiotics. One of them for pain associated with gastritis caused by Helicobacter pillori and the other for presenting a clinical picture of tonsillitis. Why were they not removed from the study? Within the eligibility criteria, it was written by the authors that they should not have used antibiotics. Justify</p><p>12. In the results, the authors demonstrated that there was a decrease in hoarseness and chest pressure in the participants in the control group. What is this due to?</p><p>13. DISCUSSION: The authors state that due to a subjective test applied to the participants, they demonstrated better results in the absence of upper respiratory symptoms. The questionnaire (WURSSR-21) used serves as a specific tool to assess quality of life in patients with respiratory infection.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Major Revision</p><p>This appears to be a well conducted clinical trial. However, I am very puzzled by the reporting (see below).</p><p>Lines 28 and elsewhere</p><p>I suggest replace: &#x02018;Negative Control&#x02019; by &#x02018;Control&#x02019;</p><p>Lines 130-132 &#x00026; 160-161&#x00026; Tables 1 &#x00026; 2</p><p>Although I am not familiar with the WURSS-21 Daily Symptom Report which, as the authors state, uses the Likert Scale from 0 to 7 but the mean scores given in Tables 1 and 2 are all close to zero with the corresponding SD suggesting negative values are possible. I presume this is a consequence of rescaling to obtain a binary response for analysis. Why not use the Likert Scale itself? This seems very strange so the rational and process used by the authors need to be clearly explained in the paper.</p><p>Line 161 95% confidence intervals are mentioned here but are not included in the tables.</p><p>Line 163 Since there are only two groups better to use the t-test (however ANOVA is not incorrect)</p><p>Lines 164-165</p><p>The Tukey multiple comparison test does not appear appropriate when comparing 2 groups.</p><p>Tables 1 &#x00026; 2</p><p>Assuming the measures summarised are OK, the difference between the groups needs to be included. For example, Runny nose 0.153 &#x02013; 0.178 = &#x02212;0.025 and the 95%CI added.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Moreover, we have checked if any cited study was retracted. That was not the case for all of them.</p><p>Reviewer #1: During the detailed review of this work, we will be able to identify some questions that are not clear and, on the other hand, allow some questions to be asked.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: Thank you very much for the effort in reviewing and improving our manuscript. The authors are available for further questions.</p><p>Therefore, I begin my contribution:</p><p>1. I thank you once again for trusting me to review this work. Starting with the title, it was not clear what type of analysis was done. If it was a comparison, an efficacy, an effect, an efficiency, I suggest that the title present one of these words that will allow the reader to understand the work much better on a first reading.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: We understand that this is a study of efficacy that compared two experimental protocols for an outcome of upper respiratory symptoms. Therefore, the title was changed to: "Efficacy of regular gargling with a Cetylpyridinium Chloride plus Zinc containing mouthwash can reduce upper respiratory symptoms."</p><p>2. TITLE: Here in the abstract it is a little clearer. But I suggest that the title be clearer for reading, probably by incorporating the word Effect.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: The title was changed to: "Efficacy of regular gargling with a Cetylpyridinium Chloride plus Zinc containing mouthwash can reduce upper respiratory symptoms."</p><p>3. INTRODUCTION: In the second paragraph, they begin by talking about the prevalence rates of people who have respiratory infections in the United States of America, since the study originated in Brazil. It would be interesting to present the prevalence and/or incidence rates, so that the reader has a clear idea of the situation in which Brazil finds itself in comparison to the data from the United States.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: The following sentences were included to clearly demonstrate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in Brazil, including its seasonality based on the weather: "A population-based cross-sectional study conducted in Brazil in May 2020 reported a prevalence of flu-like syndrome symptoms of 3.38% [7]. Furthermore, influenza incidence in Brazil is influenced by seasonal variation, with higher rates observed in winter and the lowest rates recorded in January during the summer months [8]."</p><p>4. At the end of the introduction. Where the objective of the study is stated, I suggest that it be rewritten to include the word Effect. This will make it clearer and more understandable for the reader.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: As previously stated, we believed that this is an efficacy study. Therefore, the mentioned sentence now reads: "The present study assessed the efficacy of regular gargling with a mouthwash containing CPC+Zn in reducing the incidence of upper respiratory symptoms."</p><p>5. PARTICIPANTS: Within the eligibility criteria. The authors mention that the participants should have good systemic health. What is not clear is whether the patients had any symptoms of respiratory infection. If they did, I suggest that this be written. If not, justify why these patients were not included.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: The present study did not aim to treat upper respiratory symptoms with the proposed experimental groups. Therefore, individuals with any symptoms during the baseline appointment were not included, as it was aimed to detect the reduction in the incidence of those symptoms. This is now reported under the following sentences: "2) Be in good general health as determined by the study investigators, which included the absence of any respiratory symptoms at baseline. Participants with upper respiratory symptoms were not included, as the current study did not aim to treat these conditions;"</p><p>6. Within the exclusion criteria. The authors mention that patients with arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome could not participate in the study. Why? Justify your answer.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: Literature reports that individuals with arthritis might have poorer oral hygiene behaviors, including a higher prevalence of oral diseases (Chang, Y., Chung, M. K., Park, J. H., &#x00026; Song, T. J. (2023). Association of oral health with risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a nationwide cohort study. Journal of Personalized Medicine, 13(2), 340.). Moreover, it was hypothesized that those with carpal tunnel syndrome would perform their oral hygiene with a lower efficiency when compared to those without it. Based on this information, to homogeneity the sample, decreasing potential biases, these individuals were not included in the present study.</p><p>This information was reported under the following sentences: "9) Carpal tunnel or arthritis in their hands. These individuals were not included as literature shows poorer oral hygiene behaviors, including higher prevalence of oral diseases, among those with arthritis [18]. Moreover, it was hypothesized that those with carpal tunnel syndrome would perform their oral hygiene in a lower efficiency when compared to those without it."</p><p>7. EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS: The authors mention the composition of the experimental groups:</p><p>a. The negative control group: The authors mention that this group received a toothbrush and a fluoride toothpaste. What is not clear is why this group did not receive a placebo as a product.</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: We acknowledge this limitation. However, when preparing the protocol for the present study, we aimed to compare individuals who perform the cleansing of the throat when compared to those without it. To clearly state that, the following sentence was included in this section: "No placebo substance was used in the control group, as the current study aimed to compare individuals who perform the cleansing of their throat with CPC+Zn in comparison to those who did not perform it."</p><p>8. SAMPLE CALCULATION: It is not clear how the calculation was performed, what it was based on to arrive at the sample number, I suggest that it be explained and rewritten for the readers' understanding. Since this is a phase 3 of a clinical trial</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: The study was powered to detect a difference of 0.03 in the proportion of subjects exhibiting at least one symptom. This calculation assumed a within group standard deviation of 0.53, 80% power, and approximately 75 daily observations per participant. The sentence was rewritten to: "A power calculation indicated that with approximately 75 observations for each participant, the study can detect a difference in incidence rates of 3% with 80% probability."</p><p>9. RENDERING AND ALLOCATION OF PARTICIPANTS: Upon reading, it is not clear how the participants were allocated to their respective experimental groups, which experimental unit was taken into consideration to allocate these patients. I suggest you specify</p><p>&#x025cf; Answer: A list of randomization was performed by a researcher not involved in the clinical examination. This procedure was performed using a website specifically developed for it (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.randomization.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.randomization.org</ext-link>). Two experimental groups were specified in the website, and individuals were allocated in the order determined by the website and based on the order of their inclusion. This information is provided by the following sentences: "The randomization process was performed by a researcher (NMP) who did not take part in the clinical examinations. Simple randomization was employed, and a website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.randomization.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.randomization.org</ext-link>) was utilized for this purpose. This process was performed in blocks of different sizes."</p><p>10. RESULTS: The authors reported in their results that 01 participant in the control group had adverse effects. One of these patients needed antibiotics for intestinal surgery. What was the justification for remaining in the study?
