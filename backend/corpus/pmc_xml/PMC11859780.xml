Patients may even mutilate themselves or apply toxic substances in order to get rid of these hypothetical organisms. Sometimes they bring samples of these hypothetical parasites to the office to prove their existence, which is known as the &#x0201c;matchbox sign&#x0201d;, a pathognomonic finding.</p></sec><sec id="sec8597"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this clinical case is to make visible the impact that this psychiatric condition can have on the patient&#x02019;s quality of life</p></sec><sec id="sec8598"><title>Methods</title><p>We present the case of a 40-year-old woman from Peru who was admitted to the otorhinolaryngology unit for injuries compatible with necrosis of the right pinna.

Different effective treatments have been described, among them pimozide, atypical antipsychotics and some SSRIs. However, the complexity of treatment arises when dealing with the irreducible idea that the patient has of being infested, refusing in most cases to receive psychiatric treatment. This can degenerate into major organic and psychological problems that turn the patient&#x02019;s life into a real hell, which often end up losing much of their daily functionality. The fact of empathizing with the patient and trying to elaborate a plan adjusted to the reality and needs of the moment, can help us to establish a good therapeutic bond that facilitates an early start of treatment and greater therapeutic adherence, enabling a significant improvement in their quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="sec8601"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
