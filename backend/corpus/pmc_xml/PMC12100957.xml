The decision to initiate RRT is influenced by several indications, such as worsening acidosis, severe fluid overload, and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The timing of RRT initiation is a crucial factor that can impact the patient&#x02019;s outcome, as early intervention may improve prognosis [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, several other variables, including the underlying cause of the AKI, the patient&#x02019;s hemodynamic stability, and their response to other treatments, also play key roles in determining the need for RRT [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Patients who require RRT typically face worse outcomes compared to those who can recover with medical management alone. The choice between iHD and CRRT is often guided by the patient&#x02019;s hemodynamic status and the specific need for fluid removal [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. iHD is often preferred for stable patients with less severe fluid overload or those who do not require continuous monitoring. CRRT, on the other hand, is more commonly employed in critically ill patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who require ongoing, continuous fluid and electrolyte management [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These patients may also need mechanical or pharmacological circulatory support, which makes the continuous nature of CRRT a better option in these high-risk settings. Patients receiving CRRT typically have more nonrenal comorbidities because of severe hemodynamic instability and fluid imbalances, which increase their overall risk of complications. If these patients still achieve better ESRD outcomes, it&#x02019;s particularly significant given the complexity of their underlying conditions.</p><p>The use of CRRT in AKI has been extensively studied, but its outcomes remain variable. While some research has shown no survival benefit from CRRT compared to other therapies, other studies have suggested that early initiation of CRRT may be associated with reduced mortality rates [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For instance, data suggest that starting CRRT early in the course of AKI can lower the degree of mortality, especially in critically ill patients with other complications. As more research emerges on the use of CRRT in critically ill populations, particularly its safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes, the evidence base continues to evolve, offering more nuanced insights into its role in managing severe AKI [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have explored the relationship between the need for RRT and the long-term prognosis of patients with AKI, particularly the risk of developing dialysis dependence or progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). One such study [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], conducted in 2013, focused on the mortality and long-term outcomes of a cohort of 863 ICU patients who were initiated on CRRT between 2008 and 2011. These patients had varying degrees of AKI and ESRD. The study found that hospital mortality was significantly higher in AKI patients, at 61%, compared to 54% in those with ESRD. The study identified key risk factors for mortality, including older age, a baseline creatinine level greater than 3 at the time of CRRT initiation, lactate levels greater than 4, and the presence of comorbid liver disease. These factors were associated with a higher likelihood of poor outcomes, underscoring the importance of early and precise identification of patients at high risk of deterioration.</p><p>Another study, published in 2021 [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], expanded on these findings by examining a larger cohort of 1,135 patients with AKI. This retrospective study assessed mortality rates and the need for CRRT reinstitution or liberation (discontinuation of therapy). The study found that mortality was highest in patients who were liberated from CRRT (62%), followed closely by those who had CRRT reinstituted (59%). Interestingly, the mortality rate was 40%. This study further revealed poor 90-day outcomes for AKI patients treated with CRRT, as a substantial number of patients required long-term dialysis or had irreversible kidney damage. Despite these findings, some data from different points in time have shown that CRRT can offer a benefit in the management of severe AKI, especially in terms of improving short-term survival in hemodynamically unstable patients.</p><p>The risk of needing long-term dialysis after an episode of AKI and the progression to ESRD is a subject of ongoing research. Several major trials and studies have focused on identifying predictors of dialysis dependence after AKI, including factors such as the duration of CRRT, the underlying cause of the AKI, and the patient&#x02019;s overall health status [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In general, AKI that is severe or prolonged, particularly when associated with comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, or liver disease, increases the likelihood that the patient may eventually require chronic dialysis [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with AKI requiring RRT, our study aimed to investigate the real-time risk of dialysis dependence and progression to ESRD in patients with AKI. We conducted a retrospective analysis using the MarketScan database, a large administrative claims database, to identify the incidence and likelihood of requiring HD in patients with AKI. By analyzing these data, we aimed to shed light on the long-term outcomes of AKI patients, particularly the factors that increase the risk of dialysis dependence and ESRD progression within 90&#x02009;days of discharge. Our analysis seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the prognosis for these patients and potentially identify early interventions that could reduce the long-term burden of dialysis and kidney failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" disp-level="1" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2001"><title>Search strategy</title><p>This analysis was conducted using data extracted from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database (Marketscan, Merative), covering the period from 2005 to 2021.

The database contains reimbursed claims within the United States from &#x0003e;130 payers for &#x0003e;56 million employees, dependents, and retirees covered annually under private insurance plans. No Medicaid or Medicare data are included. Patients are included for the duration of their enrollment in a given insurance plan, and the database includes inpatient claims, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and pharmaceutical claims. The database allows for large-scale, longitudinal research studies in various fields of healthcare, including the management of acute kidney injury (AKI).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2002"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>We identified all inpatient admissions with an International Classification of Diseases 9<sup>th</sup> (ICD-9) or 10<sup>th</sup> (ICD-10) diagnosis code for AKI (ICD-9: 584, 584.4, 584.6-584.9; ICD-10: N17, N17.0-N17.2, N17.8, N17.9) from 2005 to 2021. For patients with multiple admission in this time frame, we used only the first admission.

Ninety-seven days was used because we included a 7-day window for outcomes at 90&#x02009;days after discharge. Patients were also required to have either hemodialysis or CRRT (or both) during the admission. These were determined using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes of 90935 (hemodialysis) or 90945 (CRRT).</p><p>We excluded patients with hemodialysis or CRRT within 90&#x02009;days prior to admission, and those with end stage renal disease (ESRD) or a kidney transplant for the same time frame.

These findings are important as they suggest that CRRT may offer distinct advantages over iHD in this patient population, especially for those with more severe or complex forms of AKI who require RRT.</p><p>A key insight from our study is the consistent association between CRRT and a decreased risk of dialysis dependence and progression to ESRD. The continuous, gradual nature of CRRT, which operates over 24&#x02009;h, provides a more controlled and stable removal of solutes and fluids [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This stands in contrast to the episodic nature of iHD, where large volumes of fluids are removed rapidly during a session. These rapid shifts in fluid and electrolytes in iHD can induce hemodynamic instability, potentially aggravating renal injury and leading to further damage to the kidneys, which in turn increases the risk of sustained dialysis dependence and progression to ESRD [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The less aggressive, continuous nature of CRRT may therefore protect the kidneys from additional injury and promote recovery, particularly in patients who are critically ill and are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of rapid volume shifts.</p><p>Moreover, the hemodynamic stability offered by CRRT likely plays a critical role in its association with better outcomes. CRRT is better tolerated in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, which is common in those with severe AKI [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The continuous slow fluid removal avoids the variability in blood pressure and volume status that may be seen with iHD, providing a gentler approach that supports more stable cardiovascular function. This can be crucial in preventing the cycle of worsening kidney injury and subsequent complications such as fluid overload, which can further exacerbate AKI and increase the risk of progression to ESRD. All of these factors make CRRT the preferred choice over IHD in AKI for patients with hemodynamic instability, severe fluid overload, multi-organ dysfunction, significant electrolyte imbalances, and a high risk of dialysis dependence, as it ensures gradual, continuous renal support with better hemodynamic stability.</p><p>However, it is crucial to acknowledge that patients who receive CRRT are often more critically ill than those who receive iHD. These patients may have a higher baseline risk of poor outcomes due to the severity of their illness. Therefore, while our data suggest that CRRT is associated with better outcomes, the inherent illness severity of CRRT patients could confound the results. It is important to consider that the lower dialysis dependence and ESRD progression observed in CRRT patients could reflect the overall benefit of CRRT as a more supportive therapy, but it is also possible that patients receiving iHD might have had a different risk profile that influenced their outcomes independently of the dialysis modality. These nuances underline the complexity of interpreting results from observational studies and the need for further controlled trials to establish more definitive causal relationships.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="S0005-S2001"><title>Current literature</title><p>Our findings contribute to the broader discussion on CRRT versus IHD in AKI management, aligning with previous studies suggesting that CRRT may help preserve kidney function and reduce long-term dialysis dependence, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The continuous, gradual nature of CRRT minimizes rapid fluid and solute shifts, which are common in IHD and can precipitate hemodynamic instability, potentially exacerbating renal injury. Prior research has similarly highlighted the benefits of CRRT in maintaining hemodynamic stability, supporting its role in critically ill patients who are vulnerable to fluctuations in blood pressure and volume status [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>However, not all studies have found a clear advantage of CRRT over IHD in terms of long-term renal recovery(ref). Some investigations suggest that the timing of CRRT initiation plays a critical role, with early initiation not always translating to better outcomes compared to a more conservative approach [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These differences may be influenced by variations in patient populations, institutional practices, and treatment protocols. While our study reinforces the association between CRRT and reduced dialysis dependence, the inherent severity of illness in CRRT patients introduces potential selection bias, making it challenging to determine whether these benefits are directly attributable to CRRT or other clinical factors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0005-S2002"><title>Clinical relevance</title><p>Identifying factors associated with dialysis dependence after an acute kidney injury event is of the essence, as these factors impact patient outcomes and the utilization of healthcare resources. On average, CRRT use costs $ 870 USD per day, and the risk of needing dialysis after discharge remains more associated with costs [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Longer stay duration can be attributed if these measures failing. Studies have established that the use of CRRT can be associated with variable outcomes. Our study suggests that the use of CRRT can lead to reduced dialysis dependence and ESRD. Knowledge of this can help physicians act immediately on AKI in hopes it would reducing dialysis needs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0005-S2003"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><sec disp-level="3" id="S0005-S2003-S3001"><title>Strengths</title><p>The major strength of our study is its large sample size, drawn from a real-world dataset, which significantly enhances the generalizability of the findings. The diverse patient population captured through the MarketScan database provides a broad spectrum of demographics, comorbidities, and clinical characteristics, making the findings applicable to a wide range of clinical settings. Additionally, the extensive follow-up period (up to 90&#x02009;days) allows for a robust assessment of both short-term and longer-term outcomes, including the critical issue of progression to ESRD. The richness of the data on treatment types, patient characteristics, and outcomes adds robustness to our analysis and lends credibility to the observed associations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3" id="S0005-S2003-S3002"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, as an observational study, causality cannot be definitively established. While we observed strong associations between CRRT and improved outcomes, we cannot conclusively prove that CRRT directly causes these benefits. There are numerous unmeasured confounding factors, such as the specific timing of intervention, comorbidities, disease severity, and patient preferences, that could affect both the choice of dialysis modality and patient outcomes.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of EHR databases like MarketScan introduces the possibility of data inaccuracies, such as misclassification or underreporting of diagnostic codes, procedures, or medications. These inaccuracies could lead to biased conclusions if they differ systematically between the groups receiving CRRT and iHD. Moreover, due to the nature of data in MarketScan, the study did not include patients whose only insurance was Medicaid or Medicare potentially reducing generalizability to populations covered by Medicaid or Medicare, particularly older adults and individuals with lower socioeconomic status. Additionally, the observational nature of the study raises concerns about selection bias, as patients who receive CRRT may differ from those who receive iHD in ways that are not fully captured in the data. For instance, patients requiring CRRT may have had more severe or complex clinical conditions that influence their risk of poor outcomes independently of the dialysis modality used. The use of data from the MarketScan database presents inherent limitations, including the potential for misclassification and underreporting of diagnostic codes and procedures. These data quality concerns may introduce bias, which could impact the accuracy and interpretation of our findings. Another important limitation is the lack of access to clinical variables that may influence kidney recovery, such as baseline kidney function, AKI etiology, hemodynamic status, ICU admission, and comorbidities. These were not available in the MarketScan claims dataset, limiting our ability to adjust for disease severity. Including comorbidities would have required a longer pre-admission enrollment period (6&#x02013;12&#x02009;months), while our study used a 90-day look-back. Similarly, AKI severity could not be assessed, as diagnosis codes lack the clinical detail to capture it accurately. Lastly, the 9, 28, and 47-day time points for length of stay in our regression model reflect the 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile of our data and were used to illustrate non-linear effects, not as arbitrary cutoffs.</p><p>Another limitation is the lack of randomization in our study, inherent to observational studies. Although the large sample size and real-world data offer strong evidence, the absence of random assignment means that patients who receive CRRT may differ from those who receive iHD in terms of other clinical factors, such as overall treatment strategy or medical interventions. This introduces the risk of unmeasured confounding, where differences between the two groups, such as the choice of therapy, could influence the outcomes observed.</p><p>We acknowledge the potential for selection bias, as patients receiving CRRT may have more severe underlying conditions compared to those receiving iHD. This difference in baseline disease severity and comorbidities could influence our findings, and we recognize that the lack of adjustment for these factors is a limitation of our study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" disp-level="1" id="S0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that CRRT is associated with better outcomes in terms of reduced dialysis dependence and a lower risk of ESRD in critically ill AKI patients compared to intermittent hemodialysis. The continuous, gradual removal of fluids and solutes in CRRT likely contributes to its more hemodynamically stable and kidney-protective nature, which may prevent further renal damage and support recovery in severely ill patients. However, due to the observational design of the study, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and further randomized controlled trials, which compare the severity of disease indices, are needed to confirm the causal relationship between CRRT and improved patient outcomes. Ultimately, CRRT remains a promising option for renal replacement therapy in critically ill AKI patients, but clinical decision-making should be individualized based on patient severity, hemodynamic stability, and other clinical factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the support of Penn State Health Nephrology for providing the resources and infrastructure necessary to conduct this research.</p></ack><sec disp-level="1" id="S0008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study did not involve direct patient contact or interventions.
