The dependence of the scaffolds&#x02019; microstructure, PLGA molecular weight distribution, and cell adhesion properties on temperature and injection nozzle diameter was evaluated. All samples consisted of fibers with different inner polymer distributions formed by specific radial, highly porous structures with a mean pore length of less than 50 &#x003bc;m and a diameter below 10 &#x003bc;m. The microstructure formed using a nozzle with a diameter of 160 &#x003bc;m showed a moderate correlation with printing temperature, while for the 330 &#x003bc;m nozzle, there was no significant difference in microstructures formed at different temperatures. Scaffolds produced at lower temperatures of 4 &#x000b0;C with a thin nozzle showed better compression load characteristics in terms of strength. In contrast, a larger nozzle allowed the production of a PLGA structure with improved elasticity. A 10&#x02013;17% change in the molecular weight of PLGA was observed during printing, but no influence on biological properties was found. All types of PLGA scaffolds tested demonstrated good biocompatibility and promoted cell adhesion compared to the control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>scaffold</kwd><kwd>poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid</kwd><kwd>3D printing</kwd><kwd>microstructure</kwd><kwd>multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells</kwd><kwd>mechanical properties</kwd><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Russian Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>22-15-00425</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded and supported by the Russian Science Foundation, grant number 22-15-00425, in regard to 3D printing, scaffold mechanical testing, and biocompatibility testing.

Introduction</title><p>In traumatology, orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, and dentistry, there are extensive bone defects requiring restoration [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The use of bioactive materials in combination with additive technologies is one of the most advanced approaches to such challenges [<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The key component of an implantable bioactive framework is a bioresorbable material that serves as a temporary support for the natural extracellular matrix, helping to maintain tissue volume and shape. This material also promotes the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of cells, making it essential to choose a frame structure based on the mechanical and morphological properties of the native tissues being restored [<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The requirements for such materials are fully met by biocompatible polymers capable of forming highly porous structures with an interconnected network of channels for blood vessel ingrowth, cell attachment, and proliferation. Polymers from the homologous series of aliphatic polyesters (polylactic acid, poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid, poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone), and their copolymers) are among the best-studied synthetic materials of suitable physicochemical and mechanical properties for the fabrication of tissue-engineered constructs [<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They are biocompatible, capable of controlled biodegradation, approved for use in clinical practice, and widely used in biomedical research [<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Traditionally, solutions or melts of these polymers have been used for the fabrication of scaffolds [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some of the well-known major drawbacks of conventional methods for fabricating polymer-based scaffolds often involve the use of high temperatures (higher than 40 &#x000b0;C) or hazardous solvents [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] leading to low porosity and limited compatibility with bioactive components such as cells or growth factors [<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To address this, biocompatible solvents like tetraglycol (TG) are employed. TG can dissolve many polyesters that are practically insoluble in water. Compared to the chlorinated solvents traditionally used for polyesters, TG has no cytotoxic properties and good thermodynamic compatibility with water [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It can be almost completely removed from the polymer solution in any water-containing medium, such as culture serum or intercellular fluid. The polymer scaffold formed during such phase separation can acquire a developed microstructure, including porosity [<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Earlier, we proposed and implemented a method of antisolvent three-dimensional printing of biocompatible PLGA scaffolds for tissue engineering with a radially oriented microstructure and a system of interconnected pores [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We have demonstrated the significant influence of the temperature regime during antisolvent printing on the intensity of mass transfer processes, as well as on the structure of the resulting polymer material [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This technique enables the formation of scaffolds with intricate microstructures and tunable porosity by precipitating PLGA from a biocompatible solvent into a water-based antisolvent system. However, it has been shown that antisolvent-printed PLGA scaffolds have some limitations, the most notable of which is poor mechanical properties [<xref rid="B21-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we explore a combined approach to forming the micro- and macrostructure of PLGA scaffolds by varying structuring temperatures. For this, we combine the antisolvent printing method with a previously developed three-dimensional cryoprinting technique for hydrogels. This technique allows for control over material flowability and prevents fiber deformation under significant temperature gradients, improving spatial resolution [<xref rid="B22-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This study aims to investigate the effects of varying printing conditions on the mechanical, microstructural, and biological properties of PLGA scaffolds produced through an antisolvent 3D printing method. By analyzing the influence of temperature and nozzle diameter, this work seeks to establish a framework for designing scaffolds with enhanced performance for bone tissue engineering.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-17-00501"><title>2.

The dissolution process occurred for 2 days at room temperature, employing a magnetic stirrer (DLab FlatSpin, Beijing, China) for thorough homogenization.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-polymers-17-00501"><title>2.2. Three-Dimensional Printing</title><p>The production of the three-dimensional PLGA scaffolds was carried out on a custom-built 3D printer (Federal Scientific Center &#x0201c;Crystallography and Photonics&#x0201d; of the Russian Academy of Sciences) (<xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) controlled with RepetierHost software (v2.2.4, Willich, Germany). The basis of the printer is a motorized system that provides precise movement of the stepper motor driven syringe dispenser in three dimensions. During the printing process, the polymer solution was deposited on distilled water at coordinates specified in the three-dimensional (3D) digital model. The 3D structure was formed by the method of antisolvent precipitation through the diffusion of tetraglycol from the polymer solution into water.</p><p>The polymer solution was loaded into a 2 mL sterile syringe fitted with a stainless-steel nozzle. Two nozzle diameters, 160 &#x000b5;m and 330 &#x000b5;m, were employed to examine their effects on scaffold properties. To ensure sterility, the syringe was exposed to UV light at 240 nm wavelength for 10 min using a 40 W sterilization setup. Afterward, the syringe was positioned in the 3D printer&#x02019;s dispenser. A sterile 120 mm plastic Petri dish filled with distilled water was placed on the printer table. The temperature was automatically maintained at 4 &#x000b0;C or 25 &#x000b0;C using 3D printer thermoelectric converters (TEC 12,708 type, CryoTherm, St. Petersburg, Russia). A digital model of a 3- and 5-layer lattice disc, each 5 mm in diameter, was used to prepare the G-code for the 3D printer using Cura slicer software ver.4.12 (Ultimaker, Utrecht, The Netherlands). The printing speed selection was limited by the maximum dispenser pressure and dependent on the nozzle diameter and temperature. To obtain a stable printing process, the flow rate was precisely controlled by the G-code and was as high as 0.02 &#x003bc;L/s for the 160 &#x003bc;m nozzle and 0.17 &#x003bc;L/s for the 330 &#x003bc;m nozzle. The layer height was set at 150 &#x003bc;m for the 160 &#x003bc;m nozzle and 330 &#x003bc;m for the 330 &#x003bc;m nozzle.

Mechanical Testing</title><p>The EZ-Test EZ-SX testing machine (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to carry out the mechanical property analysis. The two methods, compression and tensile tests, were used to investigate the mechanical properties of the specimens. Compression tests were performed on all 4 types of scaffold specimens described in <xref rid="polymers-17-00501-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Then, 10 specimens were tested for each type of scaffold in both axial (5 pcs) and radial (5 pcs) tests to obtain the statistics. Each specimen was fixed between testing machine plates using fast-setting acrylic adhesive. Images of the specimens are shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a. To avoid the influence of infill direction on the radial compression test results, the samples were positioned to obtain a 45&#x000b0; angle between any scaffold infill fibers and the loading force direction. As it was difficult to correctly fix the scaffold in the mechanical tensile test stand, individual PLGA fibers were prepared to assess the tensile characterization. To prepare the tensile test sample, the segment of PLGA fiber with a diameter of 190 &#x000b5;m or 350 &#x000b5;m and a length of 15&#x02013;20 mm was fixed between two acrylic plates as shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b. Then, a drop of water solution of poly(vinyl acetate) was used as a glue. After bond hardening, the sample was carefully tightened between the clamps of the testing machine.</p><p>To control the testing machine, TRAPEZIUM X software ver. 1.3.1 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used. The program managed the setting of all the mechanical test parameters (at a speed of 1 mm/min with no specific test limits).

The injector loop (volume 200 &#x000b5;L) was filled with the resulting solution and, after stabilization of the baseline, molecular weight was measured at an eluent flow rate of 1 mL/min.

Their appearance, fabrication parameters, and properties are shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. All the samples were white discs with a lattice structure of perpendicular chords stacked on top of each other, with the degree of filling varying depending on the thickness of the nozzle used.</p><p>It was shown that doubling the print nozzle diameter consistently led to a nearly twofold decrease in printing resolution. Additionally, there was a noticeable effect of jet expansion, likely of a relaxation nature, amounting to 19% for the 160 &#x003bc;m nozzle and 6% for the 330 &#x003bc;m nozzle. This indicates a greater macromolecule orientation force in the 160 &#x003bc;m channel compared to the 330 &#x003bc;m channel, even despite the six-times difference in flow rate (0.020 &#x003bc;L/s and 0.17 &#x003bc;L/s, respectively). On a macroscopic scale, the samples obtained under different conditions differed only in the filament thickness forming the structure. The average fiber diameter is 190 &#x003bc;m from the 160 &#x003bc;m nozzle and 350 &#x003bc;m from the 330 &#x003bc;m nozzle.

Study of the PLGA Scaffold Microstructure</title><p>When developing bone tissue substitutes, it is important to take into account the porosity of the final product. It is usually recommended to use two types of porosity&#x02014;micro and macro (&#x0003e;100 microns) [<xref rid="B24-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Some papers present the results of studies of the properties of lattice frames with approximately the same diameters of fibers and pores [<xref rid="B25-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been shown that PLA scaffolds have a rigid structure and can be used to replace the trabecular bone. PLGA is also successfully used for bone engineering in its pure form [<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as well as with the inclusion of hydroxyapatite [<xref rid="B26-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>As will be shown below, the antisolvent-printed PLGA scaffolds have pores in both ranges. Accordingly, there is reason to assume that they provide better cell attachment (microporosity) and the possibility of osteogenesis in general (macroporosity).</p><p>Previously, we showed that the architectonics of antisolvent-printed samples could depend on manufacturing conditions [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the present study, it was found that the internal structure of the fibers forming the scaffold was not significantly different after alcohol treatment and had a porous structure with a radial orientation (<xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). As shown in the image, the outer surface of each fiber consists of a thin layer no thicker than 1 &#x000b5;m. The appearance of this internal structure is due to the formation of a countercurrent of solvent and antisolvent during the fiber solidification process. An anisotropic density distribution was observed in the structure of all fiber samples, with a tendency to form a hollow channel in the center of the fiber.</p><p>A comparative analysis of the microstructure of the samples showed differences in pore distribution across the fiber cross-section depending on printing conditions. As the temperature increased from 4 &#x000b0;C to 25 &#x000b0;C, a structure formed by large, radial, finger-like pores with characteristic dimensions of 30&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;m was replaced by a network of smaller pores up to 30 &#x003bc;m in length (<xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). For fibers with a diameter of 190 &#x003bc;m, the difference in pore size formed at 4 &#x000b0;C and 25 &#x000b0;C was 30&#x02013;50%. For fibers with a diameter of 350 &#x000b5;m, the differences in large pore size did not exceed 10%. The mean volume of a single pore formed during antisolvent printing directly depended on polymer precipitation time, as larger voids were a product of initial microphase merging. Higher temperatures led to faster polymer precipitation and blocked pore growth. At the same time, a larger depot of solvent in the case of thicker fibers allows the polymer solution to anticipate temperature rises and remain in the liquid state for longer, forming larger pores [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-polymers-17-00501"><title>3.3. Study of the Mechanical Properties of PLGA Scaffolds</title><p>To investigate the tensile strength of the individual fibers, a tensile test was conducted. The results of these tests are shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. The Young&#x02019;s modulus of these samples was calculated as the linear coefficient in the linear relationship between shear stress and strain. Thinner fibers showed greater rigidity, with a breaking force that was about 20% higher than that of thicker fibers. Temperature increases lead to a decrease in Young`s modulus and elongation at break, but this effect is not so pronounced for fibers with a diameter of 350 &#x003bc;m. These results are in good relation with the observed difference in the fibers&#x02019; inner structure (<xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), where the 350 &#x003bc;m fibers are much more uniform than the 190 &#x003bc;m fibers. The obtained results show that the tensile strength of the scaffold cannot exceed 0.7 MPa even if it has a monolithic macrostructure, which makes it suitable only for bone defect implantation with externally compensated or low tensile load.</p><p>Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of scaffolds depend not only on structural elements like fibers but also on their macrostructure. There are many different methods for assessing the strength and elasticity of materials, but for printed three-dimensional scaffolds mechanical compression tests are the most commonly applied [<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B20-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-polymers-17-00501" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Both axial and radial compression tests were conducted. These tests allowed a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanical properties of the scaffold as a whole. The results of the compression tests are presented in <xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. The scaffolds with 160 &#x003bc;m nozzle diameter produced at 4 &#x000b0;C had the highest Young&#x02019;s modulus among the samples in the experiment for both axial and radial compression&#x02014;6 &#x000b1; 1.8 MPa and 7.2 &#x000b1; 2 MPa, respectively. In contrast, for the samples with 330 &#x003bc;m at 4 &#x000b0;C, these values were 1.57 &#x000b1; 0.17 MPa and 1.9 &#x000b1; 0.7 MPa, respectively.</p><p>The changes in temperature conditions had little effect on the strength properties of PLGA samples formed by the antisolvent method. However, statistically significant differences in the relative elongation of samples formed at 4 &#x000b0;C and 25 &#x000b0;C were found, which could be explained by differences in scaffold porosity.</p><p>The presence of larger, elongated pores and an uneven distribution of voids in the samples obtained at 4 &#x000b0;C resulted in significantly greater material elongation when the internal structural elements were aligned with the applied force. In contrast, for the more uniform structure obtained at 25 &#x000b0;C, the pores compressed at a significantly lower strain in the sample.</p><p>The results of the study on individual fibers and scaffolds showed similar qualitative trends towards a decrease in strength and Young&#x02019;s modulus as fiber thickness increased. However, there was no clear quantitative correlation between the microstructural characteristics of the scaffolds and their mechanical properties. This suggests that the macrostructure of the scaffold, including its shape and filling density, also significantly contributes to these properties. It is also important to note that comparisons between properties with different types of loads should be approached with caution. The mechanical properties of the investigated geometries of PLA scaffolds partially align with their intended applications. Even stiffer PLGA scaffolds seem to be not fully suitable for bone defects and need to be mechanically supported in some cases, as their strength is an order of magnitude lower than that of bone. At the same time, elastic scaffolds could be useful for soft tissue engineering. Another factor that could influence mechanical properties is the difference in the molecular weights of PLGA that occurred in the interaction with the hydrophilic solvent TG.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-polymers-17-00501"><title>3.4. Molecular Mass Distribution of PLGA Scaffolds</title><p>After antisolvent printing, the PLGA samples lost some of their molecular weight compared to the original PLGA (<xref rid="polymers-17-00501-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). In all cases, a statistically significant decrease in the average molecular weight (Mw) and average number of molecular weight (Mn) of the molecules was detected. This decrease was due to the hydrolysis process of PLGA macromolecules.</p><p>The diameter of the fibers influenced the resulting molecular weight of the antisolvent 3D-printed PLGA. Fibers with a diameter of 190 microns (&#x003bc;m) showed a molecular mass loss that was 2&#x02013;3% higher than those with a diameter of 350 &#x003bc;m. It can be assumed that the hydrolysis of the PLGA, promoted by the alcohol treatment, mainly occurs on the surface of the fibers, while the polymer in the fibers&#x02019; center remains intact. If this assumption was correct, then fibers with a larger volume-to-surface ratio should show a lower molecular mass decrease, which was observed.</p><p>Samples produced at lower temperatures showed a greater loss of molecular weight. The lower the printing temperature, the more molecular weight was lost, ranging from 10 to 15% at 25 &#x000b0;C to 15 to 18% at 4 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>Even after the antisolvent 3D printing process, the polydispersity (Pd) index of all the samples, including the initial PLGA granules used as a control, was below 2, which is typical for synthetic polymers (<xref rid="polymers-17-00501-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, a slight increase in Pd may indicate the presence of low-molecular-mass PLGA residues, which could affect the mechanical properties of the scaffold.</p><p>No direct relationship was observed between molecular weight and mechanical properties. Even an 18% decrease in PLGA&#x02019;s molecular weight seemed to be too small to significantly affect properties and was likely masked by other factors such as temperature. Given the well-known fact of a loss of polymer strength with a decrease in its molecular weight, it can be concluded that the proposed method allows sufficient molecular weight to be maintained to keep appropriate mechanical and biological characteristics of the created scaffolds.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-polymers-17-00501"><title>3.5.

The ADSCs showed a characteristic morphology, with spreading cells exhibiting polygonal, spindle-, and fibroblast-like shapes. On day 14, a significant increase in the number of cells on the scaffolds was observed. The number of cells attached to the surface of samples printed at 4 &#x000b0;C was slightly higher than that of samples printed at 25 &#x000b0;C. It is suggested that the nature of the scaffold surface, which was formed with a more rigid structure at 4 &#x000b0;C, was more conducive to cell attachment. At the same time, no correlation of the cell viability with a difference in the molecular mass of PLGA scaffold samples was found.</p><p>Three-dimensional printing technology holds great promise for the production of scaffolds to replace extensive bone defects. It allows control over porosity, pore size, and geometry, creating conditions that mimic the microenvironment for cells and promote bone healing. Our study showed that the 3D printing mode&#x02014;the temperature of printing and nozzle diameter&#x02014;affected the microstructure and elastic modulus of the PLGA material, but did not significantly affect its strength and cytocompatibility.</p><p>The produced scaffolds were comparable in morphology and structure to human bone.

Conclusions</title><p>The PLGA scaffolds for bone regeneration were successfully printed using an antisolvent 3D printing technique under different forming conditions. The internal structure of the scaffolds was analyzed, and it was found that the properties of PLGA scaffolds make them promising as a material for scaffolds. At this time, the method presented does not allow for the creation of a tissue regeneration scaffold with mechanical properties that perfectly mimic bone tissue and can withstand a full bone load in vivo. Nevertheless, the obtained PLA scaffold&#x02019;s properties make it promising as a material for an artificial matrix for regenerating extensive defects in mechanically unloaded tissue.</p><p>The results highlight the role of printing parameters, such as temperature and nozzle diameter, in determining the structural, mechanical, and biological properties of the scaffolds. Scaffolds produced at a lower temperature of 4 &#x000b0;C and with a smaller nozzle diameter of 160 microns demonstrated better strength characteristics, while using a larger nozzle of 330 microns allowed the production of a porous PLGA structure with a lower Young&#x02019;s modulus of 20%, which is potentially suitable for soft tissue defects. Despite a measurable reduction in molecular weight (10&#x02013;18%) during the printing process, the scaffolds retained their mechanical integrity and biocompatibility. This indicates the reliability of the fabrication technique and its suitability for further application.
