DDH comprises the reason for about 10% of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and this number is as high as about 30% among individuals aged less than 60 years [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The clinical spectrum of DDH spans from minor acetabular dysplasia to severe, irreducible hip dislocation with accompanying femoral head displacement, compromising limb length and function [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various severity classifications exist, with the Crowe classification, rooted in anatomic landmarks, notably the pelvis height, medial femoral head-neck junction, and pelvic teardrop, emerging as the most recognized and used [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The Crowe classification is based on some anatomic landmarks including the pelvis height, the medial femoral head-neck junction, and pelvic teardrop, which classifies the disease in 4 groups by percentages of hip dislocation (&#x0003c; 50%, 50%-75%, 75%-100%, and &#x0003e; 100%) and proximal displacement of femoral head of pelvic height (&#x0003c; 10%, 10%-15%, 15%-20%, and &#x0003e; 20%), among which the Crowe types &#x02162; and &#x02163; are the most severe forms [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Treatment of DDH depends on the patient&#x02019;s age and the severity of the disease including nonsurgical methods in earlier ages and surgery in individuals generally aged 1.5-2 years which comprises open hip reduction with femoral osteotomy and pelvic osteotomy if needed [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. THA is the gold standard and preferred surgical method in cases of end-stage DDH with osteoarthritis [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">However, THA in DDH patients is not without challenges, with nerve injuries during limb length restoration, particularly to the sciatic nerve. The incidence of sciatic nerve injury is significantly higher in patients with DDH (5.8%) compared to primary THA patients (less than 1%) [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Such injuries manifest in varying degrees of neural damage, including reversible or irreversible nerve palsy [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Surgical maneuvers, such as anterior or medial limb movements, pose a risk to the sciatic nerve, with potential injuries surpassing those attributed solely to nerve traction [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) is a beneficial method to monitor the nerve function during THA surgery and prevent further nerve damage by real-time assessment of the nerve function [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While various methods of nerve monitoring, such as electromyography and motor/sensory evoked potentials, have reported success in THA surgery for DDH and other hip pathologies, these studies predominantly use inactive nerve evokes in patients under general or spinal anesthesia [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. This study seeks to explore the feasibility and outcomes of active nerve monitoring via toe and ankle movements in awake patients undergoing THA for severe DDH under epidural anesthesia, addressing a crucial gap in the existing literature.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study design and population</title><p id="p0025">We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the outcomes of active IONM under epidural anesthesia in patients with severe unilateral DDH undergoing THA.

A single dose of bupivacaine 0.4% with 10 micrograms of sufentanil in total volume of 20 mL was injected after localization of the epidural space using the loss of resistance technique. Epidural catheters were threaded 5 cm cephalad.</p><p id="p0045">After application of the epidural anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position, and an assessment of sensory block was performed after 20 minutes.

Instead, the decision to proceed with STO was made in the event of challenges with hip reduction in maximum traction or the occurrence of nerve-related issues post hip reduction. Attaining the intended lengthening in these cases involved meticulous acetabular reconstruction in the anatomical position without the necessity for osteotomy.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>(a) Preoperative and (b) postoperative imaging of a patient with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).

Any change in active movement or disability to actively perform flexion and extension in toes indicated that the sciatic nerve was under tension and at risk of injury.

If the nerve injury occurred in the process of exposure, we first removed all retractors and searched for probable causes. If this situation occurred during the process of reduction, we decreased the length of the prosthetic femoral head and neck length. If this made no difference, the next step was a femoral STO (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). In need, we performed transverse STO at 2 cm beneath the lesser trochanter. The actual length of the removed bone was measured using a ruler. If it still remained impossible to reduce the hip without a nerve injury, additional bone was gradually resected at the osteotomy site to reach satisfactory hip reduction and normal sciatic motor function. Again, following prophylactic wiring of the proximal and distal segments, sciatic motor function was checked, and the femoral prosthesis was implanted only when we had a normal sciatic motor function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). In the control group, our reference to perform STO or not was based on the soft-tissue tension.

The main findings of this study were the lower rates of nerve injury during THA, the greater extent of mean limb lengthening during surgery, and the lower rates of STO in patients with nerve monitoring while being under epidural anesthesia and actively been asked to move their toe during surgery.</p><p id="p0125">Since the exactly similar studies to the current investigation are rare in literature, we tried to compare our findings with the most similar publications in the field to assess the achieved results. Chen et&#x000a0;al. reported the results of their investigation on the use of wake-up test in 22 THA surgeries in 20 patients with high-riding DDH Crowe type &#x02163;, in which inability of foot dorsiflexion in wake-up test happened in only 1 patient reflecting the nerve injury that led to immediate reduction of the limb lengthening by 1 cm, and patient had drop foot and numbness for 2 months after surgery and all symptoms were resolved thereafter [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Also, all the other patients in their study were eventless after surgery and no neural deficits indicating nerve injury were detected, which led to the authors&#x02019; suggestion of this test as a simple and safe alternative to neurophysiologic IONM during THA in patients with severe DDH [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="p0130">In a study be Kong et&#x000a0;al. on patients with DDH Crowe type &#x02163; who underwent THA in 2 groups of 35 patients with IONM of the femoral and sciatic nerves and 56 patients in a historical controlled group without nerve monitoring, during the surgery of the monitoring group, 10 alerts happened and no neural complications were recorded after surgery, while in the control group 6 (10.7%) patients had neural complications postoperatively [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Also, the extent of limb lengthening was significantly greater in patients with nerve monitoring similar to our study (4.14 vs 3.64 cm, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;= .04). Besides, the rate of STO was much lower in the monitoring group (17.1%) compared to the control group (58.9%) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .005), which were in consistency with our findings [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="p0135">Shemesh et&#x000a0;al. investigated the results of IONM to assess the sciatic nerve injuries in a series of 11 hip surgeries in 9 patients with severe DDH (Crowe types &#x02162; and &#x02163;) in which they stimulated the sciatic nerve before and after the relocation of the hip, with a mean of 28.5 mm leg lengthening (range&#x000a0;= 6-51 mm), and reported 2 of 11 (18.2%) altered nerve response in stimulation after reduction that led to STO and femoral head size reduction [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The authors of that study suggested the use of handheld nerve stimulator as a tool for real-time assessment of nerve injury that helps the decision-making during surgery and preventing major nerve injuries in complex hip injuries [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">In a study by Vanlommel et&#x000a0;al. on 3 patients with 4 hips affected by Crowe types &#x02162; DDH who underwent THA via direct anterior approach and interoperative neurophysiological nerve monitoring was conducted to check the motor and somatosensory functions of the sciatic nerve, the mean leg lengthening was 24 mm (range&#x000a0;= 20-36), and none of the cases had signs or symptoms of acute or chronic nerve damage in a mean follow-up period of 24 months [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The investigators of that study concluded that applying IONM enables surgeons to achieve significant limb lengths without neural injuries and postoperative complications [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0145">While numerous studies highlight the efficacy of IONM in bony structures during hip and pelvic surgeries, a comprehensive systematic review of 32 studies underscores the ongoing controversy and debate surrounding its application. The review emphasizes the diverse array of IONM methods, each with specific advantages and disadvantages, coupled with varying sensitivity and specificity. This heterogeneity complicates the establishment of a universal guideline for IONM use across different surgical cases [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the general agreement is on the expansion of IONM methods to prevent sciatic nerve injuries during harsh maneuvers and positioning of limb in complex surgeries of hip like THA especially in complicated cases like severe DDH [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The less invasive approach, as demonstrated in this study through active toe movement, holds promise for detecting nerve injuries during surgery. Subsequent research endeavors may further solidify the utility of these methods in clinical practice.</p><p id="p0150">The present study used the epidural anesthesia as a novel to keep the patient awake and enable assessment of the sciatic nerve function during surgery. In a large-scale long-term investigation of the rates of perioperative nerve injury in patients undergoing THA surgery based on the type of applied anesthesia, the overall rate of nerve injury was 0.72% (93 of 12,998) during 20 years and this rate was not associated with type of anesthesia [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As the authors of the mentioned study found that regional anesthesia methods like neuraxial anesthesia and peripheral nerve blockade were as safe as general anesthesia and the neurological recovery was independent of type of anesthesia, they recommended the use of regional anesthesia methods for candidates of elective THA considering the clinical benefits of these methods over more general methods [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="p0155">The present study had some limitations. First, the study design was retrospective that limited the follow-up, specifically tracking neuromuscular force grading during the recovery from neural injuries. Second, there is an obvious trend toward reduced nerve injury with the aid of IONM which might have affected the results of the monitoring cohort in this study. Third, the lack of randomization and blinding might lead to selection bias. Additionally, the surgeon operating on patients possibly gained more awareness of nerve injury with increasing experience and took some extra precautions regardless of monitoring which could be associated with lower nerve injuries. In contrast, this study had several strengths like including a significant sample size that makes our findings more valid compared to similar studies, and using a novel technique for IONM by application of epidural anesthesia. Further studies using these anesthesia and surgery methods are suggested to validate the findings of this study and provide the evidence for future possible trials to prove its efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0160">Active IONM via toe movement by patient under epidural anesthesia for THA with a severe DDH diagnosis is a viable option to timely detect and capture the sciatic nerve injury as this method could noticeably reduce the rates of neural damages and need for STO, and increase the degree of leg lengthening, that suggests this method as an alternative method to be used during complex hip surgeries.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0165">No specific grants were awarded for this study by any government, corporate, or nonprofit organizations.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0170">The authors declare there are no conflicts of interest.</p><p id="p0175">For full disclosure statements refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1016/j.artd.2024.101612" id="intref0010">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artd.2024.101612</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Ethics approval</title><p id="p0180">This study received ethical approval from the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (code: IR.SBMU.RETECH.REC.1402.356).
