An online cross-sectional study of 1,519 college students in Poland was conducted between March and April 2021. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale&#x02014;Revised (CESD-R), perceived social support was gauged with the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and academic stress was determined using a short scale of the author&#x02019;s own design. The main analysis used in the study was latent profile analysis (LPA), which represents a person-centered approach. It allows researchers to identify the structure of the research sample due to the presence or severity of the variables included in the analysis. Four profiles emerged from the analysis: (1) low intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress with social support (53%); (2) average intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress with reduced social support from a significant other (19%); (3) high intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress with low perceived social support (10%); and (4) high intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress with support from a significant person (18%). Gender and current use of support were factors that significantly differentiated the profiles. Capturing the diversity of the subjects in terms of the severity of depressive symptoms and academic stress in the context of perceived social support provides an opportunity to gain a better understanding of their situation and, consequently, to take more appropriate measures to improve their situation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="5"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data has been deposited on the OSF platform and are publicly available (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/P2Y84).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data has been deposited on the OSF platform and are publicly available (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/P2Y84).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Researchers are eager to explore the mental health of college students, assuming that they are a group particularly prone to experiencing problems, including increased symptoms of stress and depression [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The reasons are attributed to the peculiarities of the developmental period of early adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and also to the challenges of the study process itself.</p><p>In recent years, a factor that significantly intensified academic stress and increased depressive symptoms among students was the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. According to a report on a survey conducted in 2020 in Poland by the Public Opinion Research Center (<italic toggle="yes">Centrum Badania Opinii Spo&#x00142;ecznej,</italic> CBOS), among respondents aged 18&#x02013;24, &#x0201c;the frequency of experiencing depression, helplessness and weariness among the youngest respondents reached the highest level in the last two decades&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some researchers pointed to a nearly twofold increase [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As a natural consequence of such a state of affairs, it is natural to ask questions about protective factors against the negative impact of stress on mental health and the increase in depressive symptoms among students.</p><p>A factor that can significantly improve students&#x02019; well-being is the informal and formal support received from various sources [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Meta-analytic reviews have indicated that social support predicts better mental health functioning and may be considered a protective factor against the onset of mental health problems [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Academic stress and symptoms of depression among students</title><p>Stress is inherent to student life due to the internal and external expectations and changes that occur at individual and societal levels following university admission. Academic stress is defined as the mental and emotional pressure or tension that occurs due to university requirements [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Research has confirmed that overexposure to academic stress can have negative consequences for mental health [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and is significantly correlated with psychological well-being [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

In addition, severe stress in women significantly increases their risk of depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Not insignificant for mental functioning was the COVID-19 pandemic and its third wave, which lasted from March to May 2021. That wave brought a significant increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations not only in Europe, but also in South America and Asia, due to the emergence of a new, more infectious variant of the virus, Delta, which also led to a more severe course of the disease. In Poland, a record was set on 1 April, with 35,251 new cases &#x02013; the highest daily number since the beginning of the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The highest bed occupancy rates were also reported [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further restrictions were introduced to enforce social isolation, including the closure of hotels, cultural institutions, sports facilities, malls, and shopping centres to a limited extent. A decree issued on 26 February 2021 reinstated the obligation for universities to deliver classes remotely [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Research conducted at the time found that Polish students reported a decrease in life satisfaction and an increase in perceived anxiety as they aged [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Perceived stress, on the other hand, was higher during the first phase of the pandemic and decreased significantly in subsequent waves. Additionally, female gender was a significant risk factor for experiencing severe stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Researchers analysing changes in student functioning over the months of the pandemic observed a decrease in overall pandemic-related anxiety despite an increase in COVID-19-related illnesses and deaths. This decrease may have been a result of adaptation to the stressful situation, although the situation itself did not improve positively despite the passage of time [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the results of a study confirmed that young adults, compared to older adults, fared worse in facing the emotional and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in its third wave [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>College student support vs. stress and depressive symptoms</title><p>The literature uses the terms perceived and received support [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The former refers to the subjective assessment of how individuals perceive friends, family members, and others in the immediate environment as available to provide material, psychological, and general support. Received support, on the other hand, is measured by objective indicators and expresses the real support received. Researchers have indicated that perceived support is a more important determinant of health [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], compared to received support [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Emotional support, which provides a sense of safety and security in stressful situations, influences coping strategies and contributes to an individual&#x02019;s well-being [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], is mainly significant, and promotes lower levels of stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and depression [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Students with low perceived social support are five to six times more likely to experience depressive and anxiety symptoms than those with high perceived social support [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In general, students&#x02019; perceived social support has been associated with a reduced severity of depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and academic stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Of particular importance to students&#x02019; mental health is the emotional support of family [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], mitigating risks to their mental health [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Family support meets an individual&#x02019;s needs for acceptance, belonging, and love [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and is associated with students&#x02019; sense of their ability to cope with difficult experiences related to the study process [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In contrast, low parental support has been associated with a higher risk of academic stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and has been significantly associated with levels of depression [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This is particularly applicable when perceived stress reactivity is low [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Peer support is also important for students&#x02019; psychological well-being [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Friends and acquaintances in early adulthood may be a more important source of support compared to family members [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and their support is a significant predictor of depression [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Perceived peer support has negatively affected depressive symptoms, and both negative and positive indicators of emotional well-being mediated the relationship between perceived available peer support and depressive symptoms in Sun et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Also, international studies conducted during COVID-19 confirmed the indirect effect of perceived social support from friends on the association between social loneliness and depression and indicated that support from friends significantly reduced depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Given the high level of mental health problems among students, questions have been raised about the need to offer students psychological support as well as students&#x02019; willingness to take advantage of it. On the one hand, researchers have pointed to the importance of the social climate on campus and the need for institutional support; conversely, they have investigated students&#x02019; readiness to take advantage of institutional support, including professional psychological and psychiatric help [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Significantly higher readiness in this regard has been shown by women compared to men [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Also, a 2021 report on students&#x02019; mental health prepared by Niezale&#x0017c;ne Zrzeszenie Student&#x000f3;w (the Independent Students&#x02019; Association) and Polskie Stowarzyszenie Student&#x000f3;w i Absolwent&#x000f3;w Psychologii (the Polish Association of Psychology Students and Graduates) [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], based on research with a sample of nearly 3,000 students from all over Poland, indicated that students rated the activities of universities as insufficient in terms of promoting and caring for the mental health of students.</p><p>In Poland, the issue of providing psychological support to students in the educational process has only recently been addressed. Psychological support can help students cope better with their studies and responsibilities. Psychological problems make it difficult to concentrate, stay motivated, and be systematic, and can therefore be conducive to dropping out of studies. Action on student mental health is also a kind of investment in society. We think of university graduates as people who represent the future of the country. Strengthening their health can and should also be motivated by paving the way for their well-being and self-fulfilment.</p><p>Different types of initiatives related to mental health promotion and emotional support have been aimed at students, including activities to level the playing field with regards to people with disabilities, and implemented in different academic environments in Poland [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Most often these are educational activities that spread knowledge about particular mental disorders and ways to support people who suffer from them, but also individual consultations and forms of group support have been provided [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. An important impetus for discussing the need to expand provisions in this area was the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought a significant increase in mental health problems.</p><p>Based on the foregoing findings, it was reasonable to hypothesize that those students with high rates of perceived social support would report lower rates of depressive symptoms and experience less academic stress. In contrast, those in whom perceived social support was low were likely to experience greater academic stress and more severe depressive symptoms. We wondered whether these patterns would appear in the present study, and whether there might be other patterns between the variables. Overall, the main aim of this study was to identify groups among the students surveyed based on the severity of depressive symptoms, academic stress, and perceived social support, and to determine whether the profiles differed in terms of gender and current use of professional support. Specifically, the following research questions were formulated:</p><disp-quote><p>Q1: How many latent profiles can be identified in the sample of surveyed students?</p><p>Q2: What are the characteristics of the identified latent profiles in terms of the severity of the key variables in the study?</p><p>Q3: Do the profiles identified differ in terms of gender proportions?</p><p>Q4: Do the profiles identified differ in terms of the proportion of people currently receiving professional support?</p></disp-quote></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Procedure and participants</title><p>This study was conducted as part of the project &#x0201c;Research on the Demand for Psychological Support of University Students &#x02013; 2021&#x0201d; (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/P2Y84" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/P2Y84</ext-link>). Its implementation included four scientific objectives. One of these was to verify the structure of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale &#x02013; Revised (CESD-R) in a sample of university students.

The use of LPA (latent profile analysis) in our research made it possible to group subjects by similarity in terms of the intensity of variables studied while simultaneously keeping the differences between the emerged profiles separate. A nuanced picture of the study sample then emerged, as opposed to using a purely model-based approach where the relationships between variables play the most significant role. LPA had been successfully used in other studies performed with university students in Poland in relation to issues of behavioural addictions [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], academic burnout [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] or mental health [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p><p>Thus, a novelty of the present study was our inclusion of three types of perceived social support considered a protective factor in the LPA, in addition to depressive symptoms and academic stress.</p><p>The general results confirmed the existence of a positive relationship between experienced academic stress and depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and a negative relationship between perceived social support and depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and academic stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>According to the first research question related to the number of profiles which could be identified, our LPA revealed that four original profiles could be extracted. Regarding the characteristics of the individual profiles according to key variables used in the study, in two profiles the pattern of key variables was as predicted; these included Profile 1 (low intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress, with social support) and Profile 3 (high intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress, with low perceived social support), where we observed the trend that experiencing perceived social support was associated with a reduced severity of both depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and academic stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Difficulties in coping with stress occurred together with experiencing apathy and depression also in a study by Frankowiak and Koty&#x0015b;ko [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], who also used LPA. Profile 1 in this text can be referred to as the Not Needing Support profile, while Profile 3 can be referred to the three profiles In Crisis, Increased Risk (i.e., the presence of suicidal thoughts or behaviors [IR-S]), and Increased Risk Without Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors (IR-NS) per Frankowiak and Koty&#x0015b;ko [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, Profile 2 (average intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress, with reduced social support from a significant other) and Profile 4 (high intensity of depressive symptoms and academic stress, with support from a significant person) showed an unexpected arrangement of variables. In Profile 2, when perceived social support was close to the mean score or slightly lower, levels of depressive symptoms and academic stress also oscillated around the mean. Despite the lower perceived social support from a significant other, people fitting this profile were not characterized by higher rates of academic stress and depressive symptoms. Parental support may have been significant in this case, which was at a level close to average in this profile. This may confirm the regularity captured in some studies that parental support is crucial for students&#x02019; well-being [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Profiles 3 and 4 needed to be studied more closely because of the elevated depressive symptoms. They had low perceived family support in common. This reflected a trend that low social support, including parental support, is associated with elevated rates of depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and academic stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Profiles 3 and 4, conversely, differed in terms of the level of perceived social support from friends and a significant person. It was surprising that Profile 4, despite reporting higher levels of support from friends and a significant other compared to Profile 3, reported the highest levels of depressive symptoms and academic stress. The above-average level of perceived social support from a significant other in this profile may indicate that those experiencing elevated symptoms of academic stress and depressive symptoms express a greater willingness to seek support, including from outside their circle of closest people.</p><p>The third research question regarded gender proportions in extracted profiles. The highest proportion of women was in profiles 1 and 4. The data in Profile 4 are consistent with researchers who found that women are significantly more likely to experience symptoms of academic stress [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and depression [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The last research question concerned whether the profiles differed in terms of the proportion of people receiving support. The percentage of those receiving professional support in Profile 4 was significantly higher than among those who received support from family, friends, and a significant other (Profile 1). Although the two profiles were also characterised by a similar gender ratio, the higher number of people receiving support present in Profile 4 may have its origins in the tendency for women to seek support more often compared to men [<xref rid="pone.0324785.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. From this perspective, the meaning of the support from a special person in relation to the experienced depressive symptoms and academic stress is a topic that requires further exploration. The distinct pattern of variables in Profile 4 begs for hypotheses about who the most significant supportive others are and whether these supports include professionals, like therapists or psychologists. Furthermore, do these individuals appear in the lives of study participants as a result of the participants&#x02019; increased depressive symptoms and academic stress?</p><p>The analysis carried out allowed four profiles to emerge, grouping people according to the severity of their stress and depressive symptoms and perceived social support. The identified groups can be treated as recipients of preventive measures according to the severity of the problems experienced and the actions that should be taken with them. Such an approach can be helpful in designing countermeasures. People in Profile 1 were the recipients of activities at the level of so-called universal prevention oriented towards enhancing well-being and resources. The recipients of selective prevention activities were those assigned to Profile 2. These were people with depressive symptoms, and it would be worthwhile to target them with activities aimed at preventing the problem from developing (i.e., reducing risk factors and strengthening protective factors). In addition to actions oriented towards acquiring competences for coping with academic stress, all kinds of actions oriented towards strengthening relationships within academic communities and integration activities can be helpful for this group.</p><p>Particular attention should be paid to people in profiles 3 and 4. For them, measures from the level of indicative prevention should be addressed, aimed at preventing the worsening of symptoms of stress and depression. Access to both psychological and psychiatric support is becoming increasingly important. Both profiles showed insufficient perceived parental support, which is important for mental health. Its absence can be linked to various other problems in these relationships. In addition, in Profile 3 were those to whom help in the form of support groups could be addressed. This is a formula that promotes better coping with problems, also by establishing relationships with other people in a similar situation and at the same time providing a source of mutual emotional support.</p><p>The results of the present research confirm the need for various measures. They should all be oriented primarily towards enhancing protective factors. In the context of the presented research results, it seems reasonable to strengthen environments conducive to establishing relationships both at the campus level and at the level of individual academic programs or student groups. Universities should work to reduce academic stress.</p><p>Also of importance are initiatives oriented towards strengthening protective factors (i.e., knowledge and skills important for preventing the emergence and worsening of mental health problems, including depression). High rates of depressive symptoms and inadequate perceived parental support should lead to widening the availability of psychological support for students, paving the way for the possibility of psychiatric consultation.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Limitations</title><p>The survey we conducted was not free from limitations. Participants completed questionnaires that were self-report in nature (i.e., reflecting only subjective perceptions of themselves and their own situation). The period of the study, which fell during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, is also significant. It seems necessary to repeat the study in a different period and re-verify the number and specificity of the emerged profiles. Also, the sample was not representative and balanced in terms of gender and year of study. As the study was conducted at a single university, its specificity may also have influenced the results obtained and thus limits the results&#x02019; generalizability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study was conducted with LPA and was able to provide a holistic picture of the situation of the students surveyed with the variables of depressive symptoms and academic stress and the three types of perceived social support. The diversity of the students was shown, which is difficult to capture if only linear relationships between variables are considered. As a results four profiles were identified with an LPA. Profiles 1 and 3 had a pattern consistent with the predictions: Experiencing social support was associated with a reduced severity of depressive symptoms and academic stress. The other two profiles completed the picture of variation in student functioning due to the presence or absence of a specific form of support in relation to experienced academic stress and depressive symptoms.</p><p>The use of LPA allowed for a more informed design of broad prevention activities tailored to the needs of individual recipients. This is another argument in favour of the need for comprehensive measures aimed at students. So far, Poland lacks systemic solutions at universities, which translates into piecemeal actions dedicated to a narrow group of students identified as most in need of support in connection with problems which hamper the process of studying.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all students for their voluntary participation in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0324785.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Auerbach</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mortier</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bruffaerts</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Alonso</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Benjet</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cuijpers</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>WHO World Mental Health Surveys International College Student Project: prevalence and distribution of mental disorders</article-title>. <source>J Abnorm Psychol</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>127</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):<fpage>623</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>38</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1037/abn0000362</pub-id>
