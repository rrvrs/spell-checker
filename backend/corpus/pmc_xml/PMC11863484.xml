There are several advantages to such designs, including increased statistical power, logistical benefits and the ability to explore change over time. However, stepped wedge designs have not previously been used to evaluate school-based physical activity interventions in children. This paper aimed to explore the feasibility of this design, by identifying school constraints, balancing these with statistical considerations and exploring the power of this chosen design under different scenarios.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted three interlinked studies, with the results from one informing the next. Study 1 was a qualitative study to identify school constraints that inform the choice of stepped wedge configuration. Study 2 used simulation to choose a configuration that balanced these school constraints and statistical properties. Study 3 explored the statistical power for the chosen design for different school and pupil sample sizes, using an open cohort design (a mixture of new and repeated pupils).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">School staff considered the proposed data collection feasible, and supported a maximum of 3&#x02013;4 measurements per year and an implementation period of one school term. Study 2 therefore considered incomplete stepped wedge designs with five steps. Statistically, the best designs had a mix of control and intervention measurements in terms 2&#x02013;4 and a spread of measurements across the whole study duration. Power depended on a combination of the overall recruitment rate and the retention rate. For 20 schools with an eligible class size of 30 pupils, we would be able to detect a 6&#x000a0;min difference in average weekday moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with 80% power, provided there were &#x0003e;&#x02009;50% of pupils measured per school at each time. A similarly powered cluster randomised controlled trial would require 42 schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Stepped wedge trials are a viable design for evaluating school-based physical activity interventions.

While schools are ideal settings to promote and provide opportunities for physical activity, to date the impact of school-based interventions on physical activity has been limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In a previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] we identified two key issues with current approaches. Firstly, most interventions do not take into account the school context such as existing programmes, facilities, logistical challenges, ethos, and demographics, which can contribute to poor implementation. Secondly, only a limited range of evaluation designs are currently used. The latter is the focus of this paper. Traditionally, school-based interventions are typically evaluated using a clustered randomised controlled trial design (CRCT), which focuses on internal validity and provides a robust estimate of the intervention effect under the exchangeability assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, for school-based research, practical issues such as lack of blinding, differential loss to follow-up, and imbalance between control and intervention groups can affect both the accuracy and precision of estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Whole school approaches that consider school context have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but evaluation of such complex interventions need to address a broader range of questions than CRCT designs allow, and MRC guidance advocates for a wider range of designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This also aligns with the practice of triangulation from aetiological epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], where results are integrated across different designs, each with different strengths and sources of potential bias. Complex interventions are a specific example where the strategic combination of multiple approaches may produce more robust, nuanced and generalisable results.</p><p id="Par6">Stepped wedge designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] are a type of cluster randomised trial, but instead of randomising to intervention or control arms, clusters are randomised to a sequence of control and intervention states over time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All clusters start under control conditions, and then each sequence transitions to intervention status at a different point in time, with all clusters eventually receiving the intervention. The strength of this design is in repeated measures, as each cluster is measured at multiple times under different conditions. Individuals within clusters may be different at each time point (cross-sectional), the same (closed cohort) or a mixture of new and repeated individuals (open cohort). Recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] has explored incomplete stepped wedge designs where measurements are not taken for all sequences at all time points, for example to allow for an intervention implementation period.</p><p id="Par7">
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Generic example of a stepped wedge trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12966_2025_1720_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e367"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par8">There are a number of advantages to the stepped wedge design. In general, fewer clusters are needed than for a similarly-powered CRCT, especially for cohort designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. They can be logistically easier as intervention implementation support is spread across the study duration, and will often improve uptake as all clusters will eventually receive the intervention. From a statistical perspective, the repeated measures design allows exploration of within and between-cluster variability, between-cluster heterogeneity in intervention effects and the ability to explore how the intervention effect changes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It also provides more intervention measurements (whilst not increasing the total number of measurements), which can be useful for process evaluation and secondary analysis of intervention implementation. However, this design does require multiple measurements within the same school, which can place increased burden on schools and pupils, may lead to higher drop-out rates, and the assessment process itself can affect behaviour. From a statistical perspective, the design is partially confounded by time because early time points are more likely to be under control conditions while later time points are predominantly intervention measurements, and so care must be taken to account properly for time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This makes both the design and analysis of stepped wedge trials more complex.</p><p id="Par9">To our knowledge stepped wedge designs have not yet been used to evaluate school-based physical activity interventions in children, possibly due to this increased complexity. In a CRCT, power depends on the number of pupils per school and the amount of clustering, via the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Stepped wedge trials are more complex firstly because both of these may change over time and secondly because other factors affect power (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). So, as well as the ICC, the power for a stepped wedge design depends on the number of pupils per school <italic>at each time point</italic>, the cluster autocorrelation over time (CAC), plus the specific stepped wedge design; that is, the number of sequences, allocation of schools to sequences, number of steps/measurement periods, and the timings of these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For cohort designs, the power will additionally depend on the individual autocorrelation over time (IAC) and for an open cohort, it will also depend on the pattern of repeated versus new pupils over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Approximate sample size formulae have been derived for many of these elements in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but calculations become more complex when multiple elements occur together. Moreover, much of the existing literature focuses on community or primary care settings, and it is not clear how school-specific constraints, such as school term structures or smaller eligible populations due to class sizes, may impact on the design. In addition, pupil physical activity exhibits strong seasonality in many countries, for example, with levels higher in summer than winter in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and accounting for change over time is particularly important within a design where time is itself a confounder. These elements are all interlinked (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Power will thus depend on the specific configuration of sequences, steps, timings and measurements, which in turn is constrained by school preferences, logistical constraints and specific features of the intervention and/or outcome measures.</p><p id="Par10">

</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study context</title><p id="Par18">This paper focuses specifically on primary schools (ages 4&#x02013;11) in England, although the steps described can be replicated in other settings. In England, each year group in a state-funded primary school typically has 1&#x02013;3 classes, depending on the size and location of the school, with class sizes typically between 20 and 30 (mean of 27, with 11% of classes having over 30 pupils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). The school year begins in September and consists of six terms, each approximately 6&#x02013;7 weeks long and separated by school holidays, with the longest being 6&#x02013;7 weeks over the summer. We consider an intended population of a single year group, a main outcome of accelerometer-measured average weekday minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and a study duration of one school year (September-July), with baseline measures collected at the end of the previous school year in Terms 5&#x02013;6 (May-July).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of simulation approach</title><p id="Par19">Two of the studies presented in this paper rely on simulation methods to explore statistical properties of the design, including power. For complex designs such as this, standard sample size formulae do not always allow the combination of practical constraints that are needed. A simulation approach offers flexibility for non-standard designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], for example to explore the impact of seasonality or different assumptions about pupil recruitment over time, and can be used both to compare different choices of design (Study 2), and to calculate power for the final design (Study 3). The general approach is as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]:</p><p id="Par20">1) <bold>Data generating model</bold>: This is a statistical model describing the relationship between intervention status and outcomes which specifies the different sources of variability. The intervention effect and other parameters are all assumed to be known.</p><p id="Par21">2) <bold>Generate a random simulation of data</bold>: A dataset is generated from the data generating model, with outcomes (weekday MVPA) for each pupil in each school at each time point. It depends on the specific stepped wedge configuration and each simulation will be different due to the variability described in the data generating model.</p><p id="Par22">3) <bold>Fit the analysis model</bold>: We fit a statistical model to the simulated data, estimate the intervention effect and test whether to reject the null hypothesis. As these are simulated data, we know that there is a true non-zero effect, but the estimated effect size will differ due to variability between datasets, and in some cases will be sufficiently small that the null hypothesis is not rejected, even though the alternative hypothesis is true (Type II error).</p><p id="Par23">4) <bold>Repeat the simulation process a large number of times</bold>: The proportion of simulated datasets for which the effect size is statistically significant provides a simulation-based estimate of the power. Other summaries, such as the bias or variability in the effect estimate. can also be calculated. The larger the number of simulations, the more precise these estimates are. For example, 10,000 simulations will be sufficient to estimate power to within two decimal places.</p><p id="Par24">We used mixed effect models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A</xref> for technical details) with a continuous normally-distributed outcome for MVPA for both data generating and analysis models, which are a flexible choice for analysis of cluster-based designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Fixed effect terms were the overall mean MVPA at baseline, the intervention effect and a term that describes trend over time. Random effect terms separated the total variation in the outcome into four components: between-school variation, school-time variation (repeated measures on the same school), within-individual variation (repeated pupils; only included for a closed or open cohort study) and residual random error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While this paper does not consider class-level variation separately, additional terms can be added if necessary.

</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection/Stepped wedge evaluation</title><p id="Par30">In general, keeping the administrative burden on schools to a minimum was important for primary school staff. They found the proposed data collection procedures (recruiting pupils and organising the accelerometer distribution and collection) to be low burden to the school (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 1), and so the proposals for data collection at multiple time points was considered feasible and acceptable. Across school staff it was expressed that data collection at three timepoints within a year would be acceptable with four as a maximum, but that any more would become burdensome for schools Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 2). School staff expressed that they would prefer to know specific days for data collection as far in advance as possible, whilst some schools mentioned that they would prefer a term&#x02019;s notice or 6 weeks as the minimum, in order to resolve any timetabling issues and avoid any cross-over with the half-term holidays (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 3). Furthermore, school staff suggested avoiding data collection at certain times in the school year: the end of terms, particularly in December, which are often off timetable; September, as a period of change, and assessment times e.g. June for the Year 4 National Multiplication Assessment and the Year 6 Standardised Assessment Tests (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 4).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention delivery</title><p id="Par31">School staff understood that due to the parameters of the stepped wedge design they would have limited notice and no flexibility as to when their school would receive their intervention. However, staff found this acceptable as they are accustomed to rigid timetabling (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 5). School staff expressed a preference for a term lead-in as a minimum to implement the new interventions, depending on the specific components, as anything less could put strain on the school (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 6). Some timetabling, such as plans for staff training on INSET days (days where schools are closed to pupils for staff training) are scheduled up to a year in advance., although this varied across schools. Some intervention components, such as extracurricular activities, are more flexible, as they are planned on a term-by-term basis, whilst organising external provision can be introduced within a two-week time period (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 7). Finally, staff expressed a concern of the impact of seasonality on delivering the intervention and in turn the data collected. For example, heavy rain often leads to children remaining inside for &#x02018;wet play&#x02019; days with some facilities and spaces such as fields out of bounds for a time (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, point 8).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study 2: methods</title><p id="Par32">Study 2 was a simulation study to choose an appropriate stepped wedge configuration that met the school constraints identified in Study 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

We then restricted to a total of three measurements across the year, plus one at baseline, a data collection burden reported as acceptable to schools. This resulted in five sequences, with interventions implemented during Terms 1&#x02013;5. We further required that intervention measurements immediately followed the implementation period (designs which tend to have higher power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]), and that there were no more than two measurements in consecutive terms (lower burden to schools).

In an incomplete design, the measurement and non-measurement periods for each sequence are time-specific, and so may be impacted by seasonal trends in the outcome. To explore this, we ran simulations firstly with no time effect, and then again using a seasonal trend that varied by 4&#x000a0;min average MVPA between winter and summer (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">B</xref>, Figure <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) using a cyclic cubic spline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] based on a previous study in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

These were individually assessed with respect to the considerations in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, by considering the total number of schools needing data collection per term from a logistical perspective, the number of schools needing data collection at pressured times of the year (e.g. assessments in June), and the number of consecutive measurements to minimise the number of times schools would have measurements in two consecutive terms.

We simulated data for different scenarios designed to (a) explore the impact of an open cohort on the power; (b) to reflect uncertainty in the school correlation parameters (ICC and CAC); and (c) to produce different combinations of plausible intervention effects and numbers of schools to determine the number of schools required to detect a specific intervention effect.</p><p id="Par46">To explore the impact of an open cohort, we assumed a &#x02018;closed population&#x02019; scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], that is, repeated sampling from a fixed population of eligible pupils. We considered eligible populations of size 30 and 60 (corresponding approximately to one and two classes per year group). The open cohort scheme was characterised by an overall study recruitment rate (percentage of eligible pupils participating at any time), and the retention rate (percentage of pupils participating at one measurement period who also participate in a second measurement period). The latter is sometimes characterised in terms of the attrition or &#x02018;churn&#x02019; rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], where churn&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 - retention. This scheme will result in relatively stable cluster sizes across time. We further fixed the recruitment and retention rates to be equal, and chose values to result in a range of participating pupils at each point between 33% and 83% as follows:</p><p id="Par47">

We generated 50,000 simulations per scenario (to allow for additional Monte Carlo error in sampling the open cohort) and estimated power for 15 and 20 schools (with equal number of schools allocated to each sequence). Finally, for comparison we calculated the power for an equivalent CRCT of follow-up outcome adjusted for baseline, with baseline-adjusted ICC values of 0.06 and 0.08 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Study 3: results</title><p id="Par52">We calculated the power for intervention effects of 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min difference in weekday MVPA, under a range of scenarios for the chosen configuration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> &#x00026; Appendix <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">B</xref>, Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Power was higher for more schools and when there were more pupils measured at each measurement point, with the latter depending on both the overall recruitment rate and the retention rate. For 15 schools, this design would have power of 80% or higher to detect a 7&#x000a0;min difference in MVPA for an eligible year group size of 30 pupils per school and at least 50% of pupils per school at each measurement period, or a 6&#x000a0;min difference for year group sizes of 60 eligible pupils. For 20 schools, we would be able to detect a 6&#x000a0;min difference for a 30pupil year group per school, or 5&#x000a0;min for a 60-pupil year group, provided there were at least an average of 50% of eligible pupils measured per school at each measurement period.

A CRCT designed to detect 6&#x000a0;min difference in MVPA with 20 pupils at each time would require 42 schools (84 measurements in total), compared to 15&#x02013;16 schools (60&#x02013;64 measurements in total) for the final stepped wedge design.</p><p id="Par53">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par54">This paper has explored practical considerations which need to be considered in designing a stepped wedge trial of school-based physical activity interventions, and how those considerations affect the choice of stepped wedge configuration and the resulting power. While simpler stepped wedge designs may be difficult to implement in practice, we found that considering more flexible alternatives such as incomplete designs made stepped wedge trials more feasible. While there were losses in statistical power between complete and incomplete designs, with careful choice in the configuration to ensure a mix of control and intervention measurements at any given time, these losses were minimised. For example, the final configuration chosen here had power only slightly lower than the equivalent complete design (92% compared to 95%). This slight reduction in power was offset by a number of benefits: substantially fewer schools were required than in the similarly powered CRCT, it involved approximately 75% fewer measurements, and these were spaced out over the study duration. The latter is appealing to schools as well as being logistically easier, especially in the presence of seasonality when CRCT measurements in all schools need to be taken close in time. The estimate of 42 schools required for a similarly-powered CRCT is based on a robust ICC estimate from multiple pooled datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which is higher than typically used for power calculations. As a result, many published studies use fewer schools, but may be underpowered, especially as CRCTs are more sensitive to mis-specification of the ICC than stepped wedge designs. This all suggests that if done well, the stepped wedge trial has the potential to be a viable design for evaluating physical activity interventions in schools, although it still needs to be tested in practice. For the specific example considered here, detecting a minimum difference of 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;min in weekday MVPA (comparable with children&#x02019;s physical activity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]), should be achievable under a range of realistic scenarios.</p><p id="Par55">Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> lists the key considerations for designing a stepped wedge trial in practice. Qualitative data showed that schools were generally supportive of the design and willing to support recruitment and repeated data collection, but researchers accommodating school structures and timetabling was perceived as essential. The complexity of the stepped wedge design means that these issues need to be considered earlier in the process than for CRCTs, before the design is finalised. While this paper has focused on schools, the same applies to other settings; the specific features and constraints of the setting need to be understood and built in at the design stage. Incomplete (and similar designs such as hybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], staircase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], or dog-leg designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]), offer the flexibility to adapt to practical settings, and the variation observed in power between the different configurations suggests that within those constraints, careful choice of design can improve statistical power still further. For example, the spacing of measurements in incomplete designs was key to identifying more powerful designs and it was important to have a mixture of both control and intervention measurements across multiple measurement periods. This results in a concentration of measurements around the intervention implementation, balanced with &#x02018;hot-spots&#x02019; in the corners of the design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">

</p><p id="Par57">This paper has focused on the design for an evaluation of an intervention aimed at a single year group, where the eligible population within a school is small and constrained by class sizes. Evaluations of multiple year groups will have larger total eligible populations, but the between-class variation will also be larger and ideally should be included in the model, and so within-class sample sizes will similarly be an issue, especially to ensure representativeness across the age range. Therefore, we propose that recruitment strategies should focus on an open cohort design to get the benefit of both overall participant numbers and repeated measurements, a balance between cross sectional and closed cohort criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The simulations in this paper suggest that when the eligible population is relatively small (30&#x02013;60), power is primarily driven by overall numbers participating at each measurement point, with 20&#x02013;25 pupils per school giving similar power for year group sizes of both 30 and 60, even though fewer will be repeated measurements in the latter. Increasing either the recruitment rate or the retention rate will increase power, and thus the higher the overall recruitment rate, the lower the retention rate needed for the same power. Thus increased overall participation can potentially mitigate lower power if retention rates decline over time, as well as maintaining overall representativeness. This suggests that strategies should initially focus on increasing the overall study recruitment rate to 60&#x02013;70% and then focus on retaining pupils.</p><p id="Par58">We found that seasonal trends in the outcome measure had substantial impact on bias in the intervention effect estimate for the incomplete designs considered here, which highlights the importance of modelling seasonal patterns appropriately when they are present. In particular, we saw both under and over-estimation, between &#x02212;&#x02009;13% and +&#x02009;8%; in the latter case, power will be artificially high, and so both bias and precision need to be considered when simulating designs which include time effects. Time is typically treated as a nuisance factor in stepped wedge designs, with a greater focus on estimating how intervention effects change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], rather than on background trends. A previous simulation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that focused on secular rather than seasonal patterns, recommended using discrete time effects when there is no a priori information about time trends. However, in this case, children&#x02019;s physical activity is known to be seasonal in many countries, including the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and so we modelled a continuous nonlinear time effect. Configurations that performed well, with both low bias (&#x0003c;&#x02009;5%) and high precision, were those that were able to separate seasonality from intervention effects, and so had good overall coverage across the study duration (ability to estimate the overall trend) plus a good mix of intervention and control measurements in each measurement period (ability to estimate the intervention effect). While this suggests that seasonality may be less of a concern if the anticipated intervention effect is orders of magnitude higher than the seasonal variation, further work in this area is needed. Guidance on the design and analysis of stepped wedge trials when seasonal and/or secular trends are present would support the use of this study design in a wider range of settings.</p><p id="Par59">While the final design presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> is specific to our planned study, the process and many of our findings are generalisable to a wide range of contexts, including other primary and secondary school settings outside the UK. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> gives some guidance on the importance of different issues under different circumstances. For example, a common theme throughout this paper is the impact of seasonal trends, which is particularly important when the difference in children&#x02019;s physical activity between the highest and lowest points is of a similar order of magnitude to meaningful intervention effects (4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). In England, secular time trends are much smaller (approximately 2&#x000a0;min per year for primary school-aged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]), but in other situations, larger time trends will impact on the study design in a similar way to seasonality. It is always important that a time effect is included in the analysis of stepped wedge trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], but the specific form and considerations such as coverage and control-intervention balance will be of less importance when any time effects are less pronounced. Other factors that affect generalisability are the length of measurement and implementation periods and pupil numbers. We have used a measurement period of 6 weeks corresponding to a typical UK school term, but in other countries it may be necessary to divide longer school term structures into smaller periods to ensure a sufficient number of steps. Implementation periods will depend on the nature of the intervention, and either may not be necessary at all, potentially simplifying the design and increasing power, or be longer and thus require a longer total study duration. Finally, the importance of repeated pupil measurements and the recruitment strategies proposed above are driven by class sizes in UK primary schools, but where available pupil numbers are larger, such as in secondary schools, repeated measures will be less important and strategies should concentrate on overall recruitment rather than retention.</p><p id="Par60">General patterns in power observed here, in terms of the impact of number of pupils, repeat pupils, correlations and variation in cluster size, are broadly consistent with sample size formulae that consider elements in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], suggesting that these elements may act relatively independently of the design configuration. This suggests a hybrid strategy using existing formulae to compare and shortlist potential designs followed by simulation for fine-tuning to specific constraints. We suggest a three-step approach similar to that described in this paper. First identify any setting-specific constraints, such as implementation periods, and determine the number of steps possible. Secondly, focus on feasible configurations with good time coverage and control-intervention balance and use standard formulae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and similar tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] to compare relative power and choose a final configuration. Finally, explore specific power/sample size for the chosen configuration, either using standard formulae if appropriate or simulation if necessary. Due to the complexity of these designs and the number of inter-dependent features, we suggest erring on the conservative side in determining the final sample size.</p><p id="Par61">One strength of this paper is that it directly addresses practical rather than just statistical considerations and thus helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The flexibility of the simulation approach allows us to focus on very specific scenarios and combinations of circumstances that are not typically covered in the standard literature, especially where these interact either with each other or with the design (e.g. via time). However, there are a number of limitations to this approach. Firstly, it requires the use of specially written code, and running multiple simulations can be time intensive, although savings can be made by exploiting the parallelisation inherent within the code. We have also provided the code used to run these simulations to support wider use of this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Secondly, as it requires full specification of the data generating model it is easy to inadvertently build in unacknowledged or overly specific assumptions that may limit the results. It is therefore important to explore a range of parameter values and scenarios and to treat estimates of power as a guide rather than exact, and to err on the side of caution where there is uncertainty. Finally, the results presented here are specific to a one-year study of accelerometer-measured weekday MVPA in English primary schools; other studies will need to apply the general process to their specific circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par62">Stepped wedge trials are a viable design for evaluating school-based physical activity interventions. Incomplete designs, where not all schools are measured at each point, offer the flexibility to work around practical constraints such as school terms, but it is important to involve schools early on before the design is fixed. Designs with measurements spread across the full study duration and a good mix of control and intervention measurements at each measurement period have higher power, and can reduce bias when outcomes such as physical activity exhibit seasonality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
