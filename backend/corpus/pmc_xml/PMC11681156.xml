We evaluated the effectiveness of HIVST in Cameroon using several distribution models and investigated the predictors of HIV seropositivity among self-testers. The study was conducted from 2021 to 2022 in three regions in Cameroon. HIVST kits were distributed according to 5 distribution models: antenatal, postnatal, maternal and child clinics (ANC/PNC/MCH); partners of PLHIV; workplace; community and HIV-testing services (HTS). Overall, 42,687 people received oral HIVST kits, among whom 15.6% were HIV first-testers. Approximately 85% reported on the test outcome; 2.3% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;825) were reactive, and 75.8% came for test confirmation. After the confirmation test, a concordance of 85% was found with the national algorithm. Overall, the HIV seroprevalence was 1.5% [95% CI: 1.4&#x02013;1.6]; ANC/PNC/MCHC: 1.9%, partners of PLHIV: 6.9%, workplace: 0.5%, community: 0.1% and HTS: 7.0%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001. The positivity rate among first-testers was 1.2%. Youths&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25 years had a lower seroprevalence (0.4%) than older people (2.6% and 2.7% for those aged 25&#x02013;39 and those aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;40 years, respectively), <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001. Seropositivity was negatively associated with secondary distribution, workplace model, community model and age&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25 years. On the other hand, partners of PLHIV model, HTS model, female sex and first-time-testers were positively associated with seropositivity. In Cameroon, oral HIVST is an effective approach for identifying undiagnosed PLHIV, especially when using ANC/PNC/MCHC, partners of PLHIV and HTS distribution models. However, to ensure the successful scale-up of HIVST in Cameroon, guidelines should be revised to fine-tune the target populations for HIVST and optimize the use of resources.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Oral HIV-self testing</kwd><kwd>Effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Distribution models</kwd><kwd>Seropositivity</kwd><kwd>Linkage to ART</kwd><kwd>Cameroon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>HIV infections</kwd><kwd>Health policy</kwd><kwd>Laboratory techniques and procedures</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Approximately four decades after its first discovery in 1983, HIV/AIDS remains a major global public health problem. It is worth noting that tremendous advances have been made in combating HIV/AIDS in recent years; however, the recent UNAIDS 2022 HIV/AIDS update report reveals that the global response to HIV/AIDS is now &#x0201c;in danger&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The report also highlights the fact that new HIV infections have increased since 2015 in 38 countries worldwide. The populations most affected are young people aged 15&#x02013;24, women, girls, and key populations and their partners, who account for up to 70% of these new infections. In Cameroon, according to the results of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS-IV 2018)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the prevalence of HIV in the general population (15&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years) is estimated to be 2.7%, and the highest incidence is observed among adolescent girls. Moreover, among key populations, HIV prevalence was 20.6% and 24.3% among men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSWs).</p><p id="Par3">Regarding screening, in Cameroon, as in other countries, certain populations are not easily reached by the usual screening services because of access, stigmatization and criminalization of men who sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers, among the others. This situation was recently exacerbated by the considerable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has considerably influenced the deployment of prevention, screening, and treatment strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, thus increasing the HIV testing gap in Cameroon. To reach the global target for HIV testing in the country, it is therefore imperative to implement new and innovative strategies such as HIV self-testing (HIVST), which has already been proven effective elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">HIV self-testing is a process whereby people collect their own sample (oral fluid or blood), perform their HIV rapid diagnostic test in a private setting, either alone or with a trusted person, and interpret the result. Studies have shown that HIVST can be comparable or even more cost-effective than standard HIV testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, especially when implemented by the community. Moreover, although efforts are still needed to improve adherence to testing procedures, the acceptability of HIV treatment by most target populations, such as sex workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, MSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, young people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, is an asset for its implementation. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies conducted in Africa has also shown that HIVST could contribute to increasing ART uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and generally, policy makers seem to favor its adoption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Many therefore believe that HIVST would be the key to achieving testing targets in Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently, this strategy is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, even if HIVST is an innovative strategy for HIV testing, it faces several challenges in Africa. The most important of these are cultural diversity, inadequate health financing and the integration of HIVST into standard health care services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, challenges exist in confirmatory testing and in measuring linkage to care and prevention services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, Cameroon has adopted a framework for the implementation of HIVST, which targets, among others, key populations and their partners, partners of PLHIV, young women (from 18&#x000a0;years old) in vulnerable situations, partners of HIV&#x02009;+&#x02009;pregnant women and men in vulnerable situations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Given its very recent implementation, data are lacking for efficiently evaluating the overall strategy. To address these challenges, together with other projects under the coordination of the WHO, the Self-Testing Africa Initiative (STAR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.psi.org/project/star/">https://www.psi.org/project/star/</ext-link>) was put in place to accelerate global access and scale-up of HIV self-testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. STAR supports countries in achieving their global 95&#x02013;95&#x02013;95 targets and HIV prevention goals and in creating an enabling environment for the introduction and integration of HIVST based on evidence from several countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. STAR includes the design, implementation and evaluation of a variety of models for the delivery of HIVST and promotes the development of appropriate regulatory and policy environments for HIVST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The STAR Cameroon project aimed to expand the impact of the STAR initiative to increase access to HIVST to remove barriers to the development of the HIV self-testing market. It is important to note that there are only limited studies on HIVST in Cameroon and central Africa in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of HIV self-testing in Cameroon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Self-test kit distribution and population characteristics</title><p id="Par6">In the STAR project, a total of 42,687 HIV-ST kits were distributed according to the different distribution models as follows: 10,153 (23.8%) for ANC/MCHC/PNC, 5178 (12.1%) for partners of PLHIV, 10,719 (25.1%) for the workplace, 16,470 (38.6%) for the community and 177 (0.4%) for HTS. Concerning the feedback on the testing outcome, 84.9% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;36,230) reported back about the test use. According to the distribution models, the rates of feedback on test use were as follows: ANC/MCHC/PNC (76.4%), PLHIV partner (89.7%), workplace (68.3%), community (99.3%) and HTS (84.9%).

Although previous studies have demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of HIVST in some populations in Cameroon and in similar settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, more studies are needed to refine the strategy and the models used. The STAR Cameroon project was therefore implemented to ensure the successful scaling up of this new approach, which could be vital for achieving the first 95% of UNAIDS targets by 2025[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another important point in the successful implementation of HIVST in countries where access to HIV services seems limited for hard-to-reach populations is enabling the environment and creating demand, especially in multicultural contexts such as Cameroon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In this study, a good number of HISVST kits were successfully distributed, with approximately 85% of individuals providing feedback on the test outcomes. This high performance is justified by the fact that, in the course of the project, there was a close follow-up after picking up the test kits, especially in the community model. To gain from the advantages offered by HIVST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, addressing cultural diversity and increasing efforts in the uptake and acceptability of HIV self-testing services in routine practice are of paramount importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Overall, reactive oral HIVST represented only 2.3% (lower than the national HIV prevalence, which is 2.7%), which seems lower than that reported in other studies. This can be explained by the fact that, in general, other studies focused on populations with much higher HIV risk, such as MSM and female sex workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Of note, in the case of this study, more than 50% of the 42,687 kits were distributed through community and workplace models, which represented a low positivity rate (0.6% and 1.2%, respectively). Interestingly, only a few invalid tests were observed, compared to up to 15% in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; suggested that most of them did not experience major difficulties in performing the test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Most of the invalid tests (84.2%) were observed in the community distribution model. The people most targeted by this model are youths (during social and sports events), and up to 86% of the invalids were reported among those&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;years of age. This suggests that even though a preference for HIVST was previously shown among youth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, this model needs to be adjusted; the environment must be suitable, and tests must be performed in private settings. Another aspect that should not be considered is the continuous improvement of rapid diagnostic tests for self-testing, particularly to make sample collection easier and to simplify instructions for use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Although some studies found greater uptake and frequency of HIV testing associated with HIVST than with standard HTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, challenges remain in confirming the tests using the national algorithm. In this study, only approximately 67% of people with reactive or invalid results were confirmed. This proportion was especially worrisome among those who had an invalid test result. Our results demonstrate that the model of partners of PLHIV shows great promise, while test confirmation in the community model is low (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A study in Kenya reported that linkage to confirmatory tests was 50% among partners of pregnant and postpartum women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Other studies reported that men in particular struggle to follow up with confirmatory tests because of the social perceptions of masculine roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Stakeholders in the implementation of HIVST must therefore set up an efficient system to limit the number of people lost to follow-up after the first test. Additional studies are also required to deepen the understanding of why this happens. For example, the integration of verification technologies might be needed in real time, and patients might need to be connected to appropriate post-HIVST services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">The agreement between the oral HIVST kits and the national algorithm was approximately 85% for the reactive tests (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The two factors that were independently associated with agreement were the distribution model and age of the participants. In particular, there were approximately 7 times greater odds of having concordant results for partners of PLHIV than for those in the ANC/PNC/MCHC model. Notably, the concordance rate in the community model was only 50%, while 100% concordance was observed in the HTS model. This observation suggests that, in the Cameroonian setting, among the models under consideration in this study, the partners of the PLHIV has the greatest potential. Overall, sensitivity was less than that reported in a randomized implementation trial in Uganda (90%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Even though the study concluded that unsupervised HIVST is feasible in rural Africa and may be noninferior to provider supervised HIVST, we believe that using supervised testing might significantly improve the performance observed in some models in our study. On the other hand, a systematic review revealed that the agreement between trained health care workers and self-testers ranges from 85.4 to 100%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, HIVST seems to be reliable and can be used to accurately perform rapid HIV diagnostic tests. However, particular attention should be given to improving the performance among youths and in some models.</p><p id="Par24">Concerning seroprevalence, according to our study, the prevalence of HIV in the population of self-testers was only 1.5% (in contrast to 2.7% for the national prevalence), with less than 1% in the workplace and community models. In view of the scale-up of HIVST, especially the use of community and workplace models, it is imperative to adjust the strategy. Although the distribution models did not target key populations for which the prevalence is generally high according to HIVST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, the prevalence rates of partners of the PLHIV and HTS models were high, at 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). A study among adult populations in Kenya reported an HIV prevalence of 14.6% among self-testers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which is much greater than our results. This difference is probably attributed to differences in sample size, population characteristics and country epidemiological profiles. The increased seroprevalence among partners of PLHIV might demonstrate an increase in self-reported partner HIV testing when HIVST is available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Other studies have suggested, for example, that distributing HIV-positive women HIVST kits to their male partners is feasible and safe and that providers who have challenges reaching male partners with testing could consider HIVST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The regression analysis showed that the models of partners of PLHIV and HTS, the female sex, and those who had never been tested before were positively and independently associated with being HIV positive (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Beyond testing, generally, the proportion of people linked to ART following HIVST is comparable to that of standard facility-based HTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, studies have advocated the importance of developing effective approaches to maximize linkage to care among those testing positive through HIVST, especially among men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The entire process, including the use of test kits, confirmation tests and linkages to the ART, should be addressed by using accurate and appropriate measurement strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">The findings of this study support the usefulness of the HIVST in the Cameroonian context. It should be noted that several barriers that impedes its implementation must be addressed. Similarly, to other African settings, Cameroon has a high cultural diversity. Given that the self-testing strategy is also designed to reach those with low access to HIV testing (e.g., people in remote areas), efforts should be done to alleviate cultural barriers, including the provision of services and testing instructions in local languages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, the health system should take advantage of the ongoing task shifting process from medical to non-medical trained persons and the HIV differentiated service delivery, to integrate and make HIVST strategy sustainable. If these challenges, together with the financing gaps are resolved, HIVST would potentially contribute to reducing the testing gaps and help to track unidentified PLHIV.</p><p id="Par26">This study has several limitations. First, in the analysis, the data collected through ANC, MCH and PNC could not be analyzed separately, because the data collection tool did not initially individuate each of these points of entry. Second, the project did not collect data on some key risk behavior and sociodemographic factors that could have enriched this work. In fact, the availability of data on sociodemographic characteristics such as education level, income, and sexual behaviour among the others could have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the use of HIVST. More research is needed to overcome these limitations, characterize the best HIVST delivery models, and to ensure linkage to- and success of- ART.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par27">In Cameroon, evidence from the STAR Initiative showed that oral HIV self-testing is an effective approach for identifying undiagnosed PLHIV, with a good feedback rate on test kit use (85%), a moderate test confirmation rate (67%) and good concordance between self-testers and trained health practitioners (85%). This approach was able to detect several HIV-infected individuals, especially using ANC/PNC/MCHC, partners of PLHIV and HTS distribution models. However, to ensure the successful scale-up of HIVST in Cameroon, guidelines should be revised to fine-tune the target populations, especially in community and workplace distribution models, to optimize the use of limited resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study area and population</title><p id="Par28">This study was conducted in Cameroon, a culturally diverse country in Central Africa with a population of approximately 27 800 000 inhabitants. Cameroon is divided into ten regions, but the STAR project was conducted in three regions: the littoral (economic capital), centre (political capital), and southern regions. A total of 96 health facilities were involved in the project. Regarding the companies that were included, those in the Littoral region, which has a large workforce, were mainly targeted. The target population of the STAR Cameroon project included partners of pregnant women living with HIV, partners of PLHIV, young people (18&#x02013;24&#x000a0;years) in vulnerable situations and employees of large companies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Type of study</title><p id="Par29">We conducted a cross-sectional and analytic study. The study was conducted from April 2021 to August 2022 in the three regions selected for the implementation of the project.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Distribution types and models</title><p id="Par30">HIV test kits were distributed in two different ways: directly to the people involved (primary distribution) or through a third party (secondary distribution). The secondary distribution was especially used in the context of index case testing and screening of vulnerable/high risk individuals (PLHIV and person at high risk of HIV collect the test for their partner(s)). As such, this method was especially used in the health facility-based methods (ANC/MCHC/PNC, PLHIV and HTS). Three main distribution models were used: community-based distribution (implemented between October 2021 and December 2021), workplace distribution (implemented between July 2021 and April 2022), and health facility-based distribution (implemented between April 2021 and April 2022). Concerning the community-based distribution model, four modes of distribution were used: targeted community distribution, hotspot distribution, door-to-door distribution, and community-led distribution. The health facility-based distribution included ANC/MCHC/PNC (antenatal clinic, maternal and child health clinic and postnatal clinic), partners of PLHIV receiving antiretroviral treatment (excluding HIV&#x02009;+&#x02009;pregnant women), and distribution at voluntary counseling and testing sites. Finally, workplace distribution was determined through the hygiene and health committees of the companies, which first received appropriate training. Concerning the workplace model, test kits were proposed to workers at their workplace by trained personnel. Concerning the health facility-based model, HIV self-test kits were proposed to PLHIV at the treatment centers and to people in other entry points such as antenatal clinic. The distribution models were selected to reach some of the specific target populations of the national HIVST framework. The community model aimed at reaching vulnerable women in hotspots and youths, the workplace model to reach men and women, and the health facility-based model to reach partners of PLHIV and people at risk of HIV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample types and screening algorithm</title><p id="Par31">The test kit used for HIVST was Oraquick HIV-1/2 (OraSure Technologies Inc., Thailand). Regarding the type of sample, only oral fluid was used by the HIV self-testers. Instructions on how to perform and interpret the test were given to all self-testers. In the case of a reactive or invalid result, a confirmatory test was performed in a health facility following the national HIV testing algorithm. The national HIV screening algorithm in Cameroon includes the first test Determine HIV-1/2 (Abbott diagnostics, USA) and the second test HIV-1/2 colloidal gold (Oraquick HIV-1/2 [OraSure Technologies Inc., Thailand], Hexagon HIV-1/2 [Human Biochemica, Germany] or KHB HIV-1/2 [Shanghai Kehua Bioengineering Co., Ltd, China]). The confirmatory tests were carried out by trained health care workers at the participating health facilities using a serial testing algorithm and were exclusively performed using blood samples (whole blood, plasma or serum).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Interpretation of the tests</title><p id="Par32">The tests were interpreted following the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions as follows:</p><p id="Par33">(i) The test was considered &#x0201c;invalid&#x0201d; when the &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; band was absent, regardless of the presence of a band in the &#x0201c;test&#x0201d; area.

Data compilation and analysis were performed via DHIS2 by the Cameroon Association for Social Marketing (ACMS). The first sheets of the compiled HIVST register were systematically removed after each campaign, and a second sheet was used to complete the follow-up data, which was later sent to the quality assurance officer in charge of entering these data into the DHIS2 database. To ensure quality, all the data were reviewed and validated during meetings.

The data are summarized as number and proportions in the tables. The categorical variables of interest were compared among the groups using the Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, as appropriate. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors independently associated with the dependent variables of interest among self-testers.

HIV self-testing is one of the testing strategies that was included in the national strategic plan for the fight against HIV/AIDS in Cameroon. To operationalize this strategy, a national framework for the implementation of HIV self-testing was adopted by the Ministry of Public Health. The STAR project in Cameroon helped the country operationalize the use of self-testing among the target populations described in the national framework of HIV self-testing. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants included in this study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (FMBS) of the University of Yaound&#x000e9; 1 (Reference No. 0024/UY1/FMSB/VDRC/CSD) on September 13, 2021. However, all the required administrative authorizations at both the national (Central Technical Group of the National AIDS Control Committee) and regional levels (Regional delegation for public health and Regional Technical Group&#x02014;National AIDS Control Committee) were obtained. However, given that personal data were collected, confidentiality was maintained by using only codes to identify participants. In fact, all the information was entered into the DHIS2 system, which is a national information system in which only authorized persons have access.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conference presentation</title><p id="Par39">The results of this manuscript were in part presented as a poster (Abstract No 928) at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections 2023 in Seattle, Washington, on February 19 to 22, 2023.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the Ministry of Public Health, especially the National AIDS Control Committee (NACC), the Association Camerounaise Pour Le Marketing Social (ACMS) and the companies that participated in the study for providing human resources and technical support in the implementation phase.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>A.C.Z.K.B., S.C.B., H.C.H., M.J.E., R.A.A., Y.B, A.R.D.D., A.Soc., F.N.M., G.T., A.M.S. and L.C.E. conceived the study.
