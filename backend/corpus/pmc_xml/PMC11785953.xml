CTC-ITB-01 is a CTC cell line derived from a patient with metastatic estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) positive breast cancer two months before the death of the patient. After a LC-MC/MS based proteomics analysis of CTC-ITB-01, we found extraordinary high levels of the poorly characterized protein SUSD2 (sushi domain-containing protein 2) in CTC-ITB-01. Expression of SUSD2 on subsets of CTCs was validated on clinical blood samples of patients with metastatic breast cancer. SUSD2-positive CTCs could be captured specifically by a MACS-based approach. We overexpressed SUSD2 in the poorly-metastatic cell line MCF-7. This resulted in upregulation of ER-alpha, the tumor progression protein GRP78 (78-kDa glucose-regulated protein) and downregulation of the tumor suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmed cell death protein 4). We observed downregulation of SUSD2 and PDCD4 after hypoxia and simulation of re-oxygenation in the blood in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468, while in CTC-ITB-01 SUSD2 levels remained unchanged, and only PDCD4 was downregulated under hypoxia. In conclusion, we show, for the first time, that SUSD2 is expressed in CTCs and appears to affect key proteins in tumor progression and survival.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-87122-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SUSD2</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Circulating tumor cells</kwd><kwd>Estrogen receptor positive</kwd><kwd>Metastasis</kwd><kwd>PDCD4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;tsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) (5411)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Around 60-70% of the primary breast tumors are estrogen receptor positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite a good prognosis of more than 99% 5-year breast cancer-specific survival, estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; (ER-&#x003b1;) positive breast cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death in women due to its high frequency and constant risk of distant recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Estrogen receptor positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be detected in the blood more than ten years after mastectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Approximately 10% of the ER-&#x003b1; positive breast cancers even with T1, node-negative and low-grade show a recurrence during years 5 to 20 and endocrine resistance inevitably occurs in ER-&#x003b1; positive metastatic breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">These findings rise the question by which means such cells are able to survive at secondary sites or become tolerant to therapeutic approaches. On cellular level, one possibility is the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or HER2. In such cases, the downstream activation of growth factor-driven pathways like the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway can activate the ER-mediated transcription in the absence of estradiol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. With regard to the tumor cell population as a whole, clonal evolution may provide a driving force for the evolvement of well-adapted cells in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This implies the selection of viable CTC clones from heterogeneous CTC pool for survival at secondary sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">From that point, CTCs are not only an attractive source to explore the mechanism of the dissemination process, but they have also prognostic value in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Practically, the analysis of CTCs may provide insights into the current status of the tumor cell genotypes and phenotypes without disturbing intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, only 1&#x02013;10 CTCs are generally present in 10&#x000a0;ml blood of patients with early or non-progressive metastatic breast cancer, which limits the spectrum of analytical methods, and therefore the biological insights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">We have recently established a cell line from CTC of a patient with metastatic estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, partially resistant to endocrine therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The patient first received paclitaxel, followed by letrozole/denosumab and tamoxifen/denosumab. This CTC cell line &#x02013; CTC-ITB-01 &#x02013; remained ER-&#x003b1; positive in cell culture and the copy number alteration profile resembled to CTCs from the patient at the time of blood draw. CTC-ITB-01 was isolated 2 years and 3 months after diagnosis of breast cancer with metastases in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen and liver. About at the time point of the isolation of CTC-ITB-01, metastases in the vagina were detected, and 2 months later the patient died. Therefore, CTC-ITB-01 offers the possibility to gain unique insights into the biology of CTCs from a very late stage of the disease.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we report the proteome analysis of CTC-ITB-01 by mass spectrometry, quantifying 7954 different proteins and using MCF-7 as a reference cell line. We found extraordinarily high levels of the protein sushi domain-containing protein 2 (SUSD2) in CTC-ITB-01. SUSD2 is a single-pass type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain of 757 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Even though few is known about its function, SUSD2 has been implicated in breast cancer before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. On a breast cancer tissue microarray, 82% of the samples were positive for SUSD2, including 41 of 47 estrogen receptor positive samples. While artificial SUSD2 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 had no effect to proliferation or anchorage-dependent growth, SUSD2 increased invasion by almost 7-fold. After injecting SUSD2 overexpressing 66CL4 cells into mice, an accelerated tumor formation and decreased survival of the mice compared with the control experiment was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Here we explored the proteome of CTC-ITB-01 to gain deeper insights into the biology of late-stage ER-&#x003b1; positive tumor cells. We found that SUSD2 overexpression leads to downregulation of programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) and to upregulation of 78&#x000a0;kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). Since SUSD2 is a type I transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain, this allowed the establishment of tools for the specific detection and isolation of SUSD2 positive CTCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par10">All uncropped X-ray film images are available in Supplementary Information.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p id="Par11">The cell lines were cultured in a humidified environment at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

Of those, samples of 23 metastatic patients were positive for at least one CTC in 7.5&#x000a0;ml blood (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E), and from five patients, samples were analyzed at two different time points (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The samples from these five patients were from patients with metastatic breast cancer, thus in a stage where the disease progresses fast. Repeated analysis of the same patients offered the possibility to find changes in the proportion of SUSD2 positive CTCs compared with the number of all intact CTCs. In our small group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) the proportion of SUSD2 positive CTCs compared with all intact CTCs remained constant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.533 for a difference; Student&#x000b4;s paired two-sided <italic>t</italic>-Test), suggesting that a SUSD2 positive CTC phenotype is continuously spread during metastasis.</p><p id="Par59">Seven of the 17 hormone receptor positive cases and two of the five triple negative cases contained at least one SUSD2 positive CTC. The one HER2 positive case was negative for SUSD2 positive CTCs. Hence, 39% of the 23 CTC positive cases or 21% of all 43 analyzed cases contained SUSD2 positive CTCs.</p><p id="Par60">The CellSearch approach is a valuable tool for screening of patient samples. However, the signal intensity for SUSD2 was lower by CellSearch compared with direct immunofluorescent staining (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Therefore, we tried to establish alternative detection approaches with higher signal intensities of the target proteins in CTCs. The large extracellular domains of SUSD2 offers the possibility of CTC catching from the blood by MACS using their extracellular domain for antibody binding. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were negative for SUSD2 by Western Blot (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S9</xref>), which is an important prerequisite for CTC isolation by MACS (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S10</xref>A). Quality testing of the MACS by spiking 50 cells into the blood (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S10</xref>B) yielded a recovery rate of 70.7% for CTC-ITB-01 (positive control) and 3.3% for T47D (negative control). The SUSD2-MACS was applied to blood samples of eight patients with metastatic breast cancer. Three samples contained no CTCs, two samples contained only SUSD2-negative CTCs, and in three samples a total of 46 SUSD2-positive CTCs were detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F).</p><p id="Par61">Since modulation of SUSD2 levels in cell lines resulted in downregulation of PDCD4, we searched The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> for clinic-pathological data of PDCD4 in breast cancer. The highest PDCD4 levels were present in Luminal A primary breast cancers, whereas basal breast cancers displayed the lowest PDCD4 levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Moreover, PDCD4 levels decreased with increased staging (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B) and with metastasis (M0 vs. M1, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C).

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par63">CTC-ITB-01 offers the exceptional possibility to gain insights into the proteome of CTCs from very late stage breast cancer. While usual CTC approaches detect just one (or few) proteins in a number of patients (usually without quantification), the proteome analysis of CTC-ITB-01 reported here provides the quantification of almost 8,000 proteins. MCF-7 is available world-wide and its cultivation is unproblematic, so that every researcher can use our quantitative SILAC data using MCF-7 as an in-house reference. If the relative protein expression value for a given protein is determined in MCF-7 in any laboratory world-wide, one can calculate the corresponding expression value in CTC-ITB-01 using the SILAC fold change we deposited in the publicly accessible database. Apart from targeted protein analyses, it is possible to compare the entire proteomic data set we deposited using a tool we have developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The inherent limitation of this approach is having analyzed the CTC population of only one patient, which required the presented validation on clinical samples from additional patients.</p><p id="Par64">Even though previous research has clarified some aspects about SUSD2 in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, it remained unclear if SUSD2 positive cells can be released into in the blood stream. Here, we found that 39% of CTC positive cases contained SUSD2-positive CTCs. Whether these SUSD2-positive cells represent a more aggressive subset of CTCs with metastasis-initiating capacities remains subject of future investigations.</p><p id="Par65">Moreover, the large extracellular domain of SUSD2 was suitable for the specific enrichment of SUSD2 positive CTC by MACS. This approach allows now in future studies the characterization of SUSD2-positive CTCs by molecular genetic approaches. The present observation that SUSD2 expression remained unchanged in our hypoxia/re-oxygenation experiments suggests that SUSD2 might be a stable CTC marker reflecting the expression in the tumor tissue(s).</p><p id="Par66">In a general image, it appeared that the originating tumor cells of CTC-ITB-01 were at least temporarily confronted with adverse microenvironmental conditions, which also had an effect on SUSD2. The maturation of SUSD2 results in a heterodimer comprising two interconnected polypeptide chains of SUSD2, which is transported to the cell surface and interacts there with galectin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The exact mode of interaction is not clear; probably SUSD2 is either a chaperone for galectin-1 or it sequesters galectin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. If located on the cell surface, galectin-1 can introduce T cell apoptosis, so that SUSD2 contributes to the evasion of tumor cells from targeting by the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par67">We have found very high levels of SUSD2 in CTC-ITB-01, which principally enables this cell line to use galectin-1 for escape from immune surveillance. However, the endogenous galectin-1 synthesis is very low, so that CTC-ITB-01 is dependent on external galectin-1 sources. Since CTC-ITB-01 was derived from CTCs of the blood circuit, either the surrounding tissue where CTC-ITB-01 has resided before dissemination or the blood itself are potential sources where it can obtain external galectin-1. In healthy individuals, a galectin-1 serum concentration of 8.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3 ng/ml was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, which might be one source for galectin-1 of CTC-ITB-01. Since the expression of PD-L1 is very low in CTC-ITB-01, the SUSD2/galectin-1 complex might be an alternative for the escape from immune recognition.</p><p id="Par68">Under such circumstances, CTC-ITB-01 is strongly dependent on a continuous expression of SUSD2, even under adverse microenvironmental conditions. While MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 strongly downregulate SUSD2 under hypoxic conditions, SUSD2 levels remained constant in CTC-ITB-01. This points towards the acquisition of regulatory changes in CTC-ITB-01 to maintain high levels of SUSD2 under hypoxia for survival. It appears to be unlikely that CTC-ITB-01 has acquired these regulatory changes during its passage through the blood, since the half-life of CTCs in the blood is with 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> by far too short. Moreover, such an optimization process is more efficient when phenotypic advantages occur, which requires the presence of galectin-1 in the near microenvironment. At the time of blood sampling, the breast cancer patient from which CTC-ITB-01 was derived, had metastases in the lymph nodes, bones, spleen, liver and vagina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Among those, galectin-1 mRNA is detectable in considerable amounts in the spleen and the liver of healthy persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In the normal spleen, oxygen concentrations of approx. 1&#x02013;6%, and in the normal liver oxygen concentrations of 1&#x02013;12% are detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, which might contain starting conditions for a metastasis that is confronted with low oxygen concentrations during outgrowth. Hence, both organs might be considered as the originating tissue, which harbored the metastasis where tumor cells changed the SUSD2 regulation towards stable SUSD2 expression under hypoxia. Later on some of the cells disseminated into the blood and became the ancestors of CTC-ITB-01. This assumption is supported by analyses of copy number alterations where samples of CTC-ITB-01 DNA cluster separately to the original primary tumors and the vaginal metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> so that these tissues are unlikely originating sites.</p><p id="Par69">The maturation of SUSD2 results in a heterodimer comprising two interconnected polypeptide chains of SUSD2, which is transported to the cell surface and interacts there with galectin-1.</p><p id="Par70">Subsequently, we performed functional in vitro studies to assess the role of SUSD2. Remarkably, PDCD4 appeared as prominent target of SUSD2 with a dual role depending on the cellular background. PDCD4 inhibits the initiation of the protein translation by binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4&#x000a0;A (eIF4A) thereby linking the mTOR pathway with the control of the protein synthesis machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In tumor cells, PDCD4 inhibits the neoplastic transformation, thus PDCD4 is regarded as a tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Clinically, low levels of PDCD4 are associated with poor prognosis in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par71">In our experiments, PDCD4 was downregulated after SUSD2 overexpression (MCF-7), SUSD2 downregulation by siRNA (CTC-ITB-01) and also by hypoxia (CTC-ITB-01, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468). Albeit a triple negative cell line, MDA-MB-468 is positive for the processed 55-kDa SUSD2, suggesting that these effects can be also relevant beyond the ER-&#x003b1; positive subtype. The observed relation between SUSD2 and PDCD4 might be due to different underlying mechanisms disturbing cellular homeostasis.</p><p id="Par72">In that context, decrease of PDCD4 levels enables the synthesis of proteins by the cap-independent translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Second, alteration of the SUSD2 levels leads to perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis as seen by the induction of the endoplasmic stress sensor GRP78 in OE1 and OE2, as well in the SUSD2 kd cells of CTC-ITB-01. A contribution of PDCD4 to an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with the activation of GRP78 appears to be reasonable, since these programs frequently overlap with the mTOR pathway, for example under hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par73">Since we could not find a previous report about the presence of PDCD4 in CTCs, we confirmed PDCD4 in CTCs of breast cancer patients in our work. It turned out that the distribution of PDCD4 in CTCs displayed a considerable intra-patient heterogeneity. The detection of PDCD4 low expressing CTCs may be due to the downregulation of PDCD4 in hypoxic areas of tumor cell colonies, followed by release of such CTCs into the blood. In the ground state, the PDCD4 expression is 4.2 fold higher in CTC-ITB-01 than in MCF-7, and under hypoxia the PDCD4 level decreased to about 30% in MCF-7. That would make a range of factor 14 from normoxic CTC-ITB-01 to hypoxic MCF-7. If a patient contains cancer cells like MCF-7 and CTC-ITB-01 at different sites, which are subjected to hypoxia to varying degrees, then these conditions may explain the variability of the PDCD4 levels in CTCs of the patients.</p><p id="Par74">The exact molecular mechanism how SUSD2 affects PDCD4 levels remains to be investigated. In colorectal cancer, PDCD4 inhibits SIN1 (MAPKAP1, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A) translation, to reduce cell invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. SIN1 is a critical component of mTORC2, and inhibition of SIN1 translation by PDCD4 leads to inactivation of AKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We observed a downregulation of pAKT (S473) in OE1 and OE2, but this change did not reach statistical significance due to large deviations in the biological replicates.</p><p id="Par75">Another interesting protein affected by overexpression of SUSD2 was GRP78, a chaperone resident in the endoplasmic reticulum that supports the proper folding of nascent proteins and belongs to the cytoprotective program of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Previously, we found that GRP78 supports the survival of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow of breast cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the function of re-establishing cellular homeostasis, GRP78 exhibits anti-apoptotic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> or mediates resistance to chemotherapy, including to anti-estrogen resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. These findings might suit to our finding of downregulation of RCN1 after the overexpression of SUSD2 in MCF-7. Few is known about the role of RCN1 in cancer, yet downregulation of RCN1 has been implicated in the suppression of apoptosis after activation of the UPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par76">After SUSD2 overexpression in MCF-7, we observed a twin band for ER-&#x003b1; in OE1 and OE2. Several mRNA splice variants of ER-&#x003b1; have been described varying in the molecular mass of the synthesized protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, of which the variant ER-&#x003b1;&#x003b4;E3 (62.3&#x000a0;kDa) is only 4.3&#x000a0;kDa smaller than the wild type ER-&#x003b1; (66.6&#x000a0;kDa), which suits best to our findings in OE1 and OE2. ER-&#x003b1;&#x003b4;E3 is unable to bind to the DNA due to partial loss of the DNA binding domain, but the ligand-binding domain is functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. ER-&#x003b1;&#x003b4;E3 is a naturally form of ER-&#x003b1;, and the loss of ER-&#x003b1;&#x003b4;E3 in breast cancer may lead to uncontrolled estrogen stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Artificial overexpression of ER-&#x003b1;&#x003b4;E3 in MCF-7 yielded in a dominant negative ER-&#x003b1; phenotype with diminished tumorigenic attributes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. This reduced ability to respond to 17&#x003b2;-estradiol was also visible in our work in OE2 by negligible induction of progesterone receptor A/B and 5.6-fold weaker induction of BCL2 than in the control cells. BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic protein and has been linked to the ER-&#x003b1; positive breast cancer subtype and was associated with favorable outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Since in patients CTCs with higher BCL2 levels correlated with better outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, SUSD2 mediated attenuation of BCL2 might complement the pro-survival effect of GRP78 in CTC under therapy conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
