Hospital visits can be stressful when scheduled for therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, leading to anxiety and behavioural escalation in an unfamiliar environment. Negative past experiences can trigger anxiety and trauma for the child, their family and staff when presenting to such a setting (<xref rid="bibr11-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bibr20-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Nelson &#x00026; Amplo 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bibr27-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Schieve et al 2012</xref>).

In addition, anxious staff may be reluctant to provide care (<xref rid="bibr11-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bibr12-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Johnson &#x00026; Rodriguez 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bibr15-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Liddle et al 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bibr26-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Pisula &#x00026; Por&#x00119;bowicz-D&#x000f6;rsmann 2017</xref>).

While standard paediatric planning processes and care are sufficient for typically developing children, there is a need for additional considerations for those neurodiverse children in health care environments (<xref rid="bibr2-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Benich et al 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bibr16-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Lindberg et al 2012</xref>). There is a paucity of research exploring the influence of specialised adaptive care plans (ACPs) on the unique needs of children with developmental disabilities in perioperative hospital settings (<xref rid="bibr13-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et al 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bibr15-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Liddle et al 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bibr16-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Lindberg et al 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Quiet pathway (Sydney, Australia) is a dedicated perioperative pathway provided by the Department of Anaesthesia at (The Children&#x02019;s Hospital at Westmead), a major paediatric teaching hospital in (Sydney, Australia). It is designed to provide an adapted care pathway to facilitate successful procedural outcomes and improve patient experience, safety and quality of care for children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions who have had difficulties accessing standard care.</p><p>Patients are identified by health practitioners and pre-anaesthetic clinic coordinators, during bookings, planning processes or direct disclosure by families. An electronic request for admission is completed by the referring health practitioner, identifying the need for the pathway. The pre-anaesthetic clinic coordinator is informed by email of referred patients.</p><p>After the initial notification, the triage anaesthetist reviews the child&#x02019;s available documentation regarding previous health encounters with clinicians and clinical services involved in the patient&#x02019;s care. Subsequently, the anaesthetist consults the referring clinician and the child&#x02019;s parent to obtain relevant information about the child: pre-existing conditions; key behavioural issues either impacting or triggered by the interaction; information about non-pharmacological approaches that are supportive for the patient and previous experiences with sedatives or behaviour-modifying medications.</p><p>A vital component of perioperative care is flexibility in processes. Minimising fasting time, starting pre-medication prior to admission and arranging admission close to the procedure or via streamlined pathways can facilitate an optimal waiting environment (<xref rid="bibr14-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Kersten et al 2023</xref>, <xref rid="bibr22-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al 2022</xref>). Before admission, the triage anaesthetist provides a brief summary and notification to the procedural anaesthetist and other staff members who are to be involved in the child&#x02019;s care such as the Day Stay Unit, anaesthesia or theatre staff and preadmission clinic staff. If a child is susceptible to distress in a hospital environment, expedited discharge from the recovery ward is considered with a plan to be followed up in the community by the nursing staff or paediatrician and by phone call from the anaesthesia department post discharge.</p><sec id="section6-17504589241253487"><title>Aims of the study</title><p>This pilot study aims to elicit the experiences of parents of children with neurodevelopmental conditions through their participation in the adaptive perioperative pathway to identify barriers and facilitators to improve the ongoing development of this service.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-17504589241253487"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section8-17504589241253487"><title>Setting and recruitment of participants</title><p>This study was conducted in the Anaesthesia Department at the (Sydney, Australia).

After two weeks, a follow-up phone call was made to the potential participants who had not returned the survey. The surveys were re-sent in April 2021 to parents reporting non-receipt. The survey was designed as a short ten-minute questionnaire, comprising 20 questions, a combination of questions being scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale and free-text responses. Parent demographic information and details of their child&#x02019;s anaesthetic procedure were accessed from the Anaesthesia Department medical records. As a prompt, details of their child&#x02019;s specific admission were provided on each individual survey to help the parent recall the particular perioperative admission for their child.</p><p>For more information, please see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/17504589241253487" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material 1</ext-link>.</p><p>Each parent was deidentified by assigning a unique study code number with the identifying list only known to the primary investigator.

Demographic information and key aspects of the hospitalisation experience were extracted, for example preadmission, admission, overall experience, hospital staff interaction with the children and previous health experiences. This showed that parent and child experience had improved with the introduction of the new pathway. We then went on to interview the families in more depth to better explore their reasons for change in care.</p></sec><sec id="section17-17504589241253487"><title>Interview data</title><p>The interviews were initially evaluated and coded separately by the primary investigator and the co-investigator. The primary investigator is a paediatric trainee with experience in general and developmental paediatrics. The co-investigator is a developmental paediatrician with experience in intellectual or developmental disability and mixed methods research. Investigator bias was addressed through a bracketing exercise where the investigators independently and reflexively took notes on how their interactions with patients and families in their clinical roles would influence their interpretation of the data. Investigator reflections were discussed highlighting any issues and ways to mitigate any bias (<xref rid="bibr29-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Tufford &#x00026; Newman 2012</xref>). These codes were discussed for consensus and thematic analyses derived from these discussions with the research team. The qualitative analysis of the interviews was conducted by using an abductive approach using the Framework Method (<xref rid="bibr3-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Bultas 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr7-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Gale et al 2013</xref>).</p><p>The Framework Method involves organising data into codes and categories. This method helps to identify similarities and differences in qualitative data, and subsequently focuses on association between different parts of data, looking for outcomes in the form of central identified themes. This framework structures and generates succinct data optimising development of themes from service feedback data.</p></sec><sec id="section18-17504589241253487"><title>Community involvement</title><p>This project was based on feedback from parents of children with autism though they were not actively involved in the design, implementation or evaluation of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section19-17504589241253487"><title>Results</title><sec id="section20-17504589241253487"><title>Survey results</title><p>A total of 67 surveys were posted to the potential participants (parents of children who were triaged through the perioperative pathway from July 2019 to December 2020).

Perioperative preparations could have avoided the situation according to the parent, underscoring their concern about the current admission.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Just, previously, it was just very challenging like, when I was saying when you come in and you&#x02019;re trying to sign paperwork but your child is going absolutely crazy. Because sensory wise it&#x02019;s just all too much for him. And then, like when we went through if you&#x02019;re waiting sort of a long time for those pre op meds, he would be very agitated and you did start sort of, because he&#x02019;s hungry as well from fasting. He would start going through everyone&#x02019;s bag</italic>. (Participant 14: p23)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Another parent reported similarly where lack of timely administration of premeds led to the child&#x02019;s behavioural escalation leading to the need for restraint.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">As I said that the nursing staff, even though they&#x02019;re wonderful didn&#x02019;t anticipate, .&#x02004;.&#x02004;. we were warning them that the waiting time wasn&#x02019;t going to end very well. He was still made to wait, .&#x02004;.&#x02004;. they still want me to fill out all the forms, prior .&#x02004;.&#x02004;. going in to have the procedure. Also, we had given him some valium beforehand, but he was too escalated for it to take effect .&#x02004;.&#x02004;. and he became quite distraught and violent.</italic> (Participant 16: p27)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Some parents shared previous negative experiences from lack of planning resulting in prolonged waits and fasting times causing agitation in their child.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">It&#x02019;s hard to manage them being hungry but it&#x02019;s also hard to manage a 14-year-old who can&#x02019;t understand why he&#x02019;s not allowed to eat.</italic> (Participant 19: p29)</p><p><italic toggle="yes">With that experience fresh in our minds, we experienced trepidation and anxiety in the lead up to the visit for the MRI.</italic> (Participant 3: p3)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>One parent reported a lack of adequate information transfer between different hospital teams, resulting in the postponement of a long-awaited procedure.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">I can remember something we&#x02019;ve been booked in for the scan and he was nil by mouth and we were waiting and waiting and it got to two o&#x02019;clock, and the theatre staff has said sorry. The MRI receptionist had said, we can&#x02019;t do him today because we haven&#x02019;t got clearance that he doesn&#x02019;t have plate, metal in his head, clips. I said, but he doesn&#x02019;t have clips and she said yes, but we don&#x02019;t have a letter from treating hospital. We&#x02019;ve waited 10 months for this procedure.</italic> (Participant 19: p37)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Another parent thought the hospital environment was unsuitable for her child reporting noise crowding and a long waiting time negatively impacting the child&#x02019;s cooperation. A less than ideal compromise on managing at home had to be made.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">You just can&#x02019;t make a child like that, do what they don&#x02019;t want to do. So, yeah, it helped that we have managed him from home and we focused on the one big thing that he had to do rather than all the other things he had to be subjected to.</italic> (Participant 10: p43)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="section28-17504589241253487"><title>Reasonable adjustments improve the child and parent&#x02019;s hospital journey</title><p>The most consistent theme was that parents appreciated the preadmission preparation.</p><p>Premeds were successfully administered in some cases enabling the child to be transferred to theatres with little resistance. As their child moved from one place to another, none of the parents experienced long wait times. The plan included having the correct number of staff who knew the child and collaborated with the parent to ensure care was delivered efficiently, and a clear postoperative plan was provided at time of discharge.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Everyone seemed to know who he was and what the issues were before we got there, which was awesome. So, I didn&#x02019;t have to explain it, in front of him.</italic> (Participant 9: p36)</p><p><italic toggle="yes">So, it&#x02019;s a much better streamlined process, and less traumatic for him and for us, and it wasn&#x02019;t only preoperatively, it was postoperatively as well.</italic> (Participant 9: p25)</p><p><italic toggle="yes">The anesthetists came and seen him the night before and got a good history on what he&#x02019;s like and then, that made everything, the next day run a lot smoother.

</p></sec><sec id="section29-17504589241253487"><title>Things that helped: Communication, convenience and collaboration</title><p>Parents felt perioperative communication with staff addressed their concerns. They felt supported and valued being included in the planning discussion for their child&#x02019;s procedure.</p><p>Parents appreciated the perioperative pathway arrangement making it extremely convenient scheduling all of their child&#x02019;s appointments and procedures under a single anaesthesia administration in collaboration with the multiple teams.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">I think what was really key to the whole success of the day was the fact that all the teams were available at the same time for the procedure. So, it was kind of very opportunistic, to get that. So he needed a few things looked at; so he needed his teeth and his eyes and his ENT looked at and all of that was done at the same time which is great. That saves him having a series of general anaesthetics and a series of admissions and it also means that we&#x02019;ve got a better collaboration between the teams.</italic> (Participant 19: p21) <italic toggle="yes">.&#x02004;.&#x02004;.</italic> and (change)</p><p><italic toggle="yes">So, I think that communication between the anaesthetic department and the parent is a very good approach.</italic> (Participant 2: p16)</p><p><italic toggle="yes">So we went straight into a room where there was like the chair bed kind of thing, and then he went from there pretty much straight away, so he was not lingering around there waiting around and then straight into the room into the operation.</italic> (Participant 9: p27)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="section30-17504589241253487"><title>Parent&#x02019;s satisfaction and relief for a more positive experience</title><p>Parents appreciated the teamwork and professionalism exhibited by staff noting excellent interaction and communication with their child, and their child being kept comfortable while receiving postoperative care. All parents expressed full support and confidence in the perioperative pathway services.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">It&#x02019;s because he is light sensitive, it&#x02019;s a very bright atmosphere and he does find that quite difficult, so he&#x02019;ll quite often want the blankets, all over his head .&#x02004;.&#x02004;. and I found this time, I was in there, the nurses were very understanding of that. Like previously there was sort of like, no J, we need to have the blankets down, we need to watch you we need to observe you. But this sort of like, this time around they were a lot more understanding.</italic> (Participant 14: p129) <italic toggle="yes">.&#x02004;.&#x02004;.</italic> and</p><p><italic toggle="yes">On the day itself, it would not have been possible to have received better medical treatment or care or to have had a better outcome. Everything went as planned without any complications and that is due entirely to the hospital staff. I simply cannot commend them highly enough we are very grateful that they removed so much of the stress from the whole experience.</italic> (Participant 2: p8)</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Absolutely. I wish all the hospitals have had this sort of facility.</italic> (Participant 16: p25)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="section31-17504589241253487"><title>Barriers to overcome</title><p>Although the parents acknowledge the added efforts of staff supporting their child or young person, a small number of parents reported ongoing glitches with perioperative services. This included staff rushing interactions with their child, pressured by time constraints. Parents felt better management was needed to help their child to feel more comfortable and at ease.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">We have had problems, a few times with the way she was spoken to. And there was one time that she was told to hurry up to take the mask because the doctor had an emergency to attend to. So, there has been situations like that. But overall, I can&#x02019;t, I really can&#x02019;t fault them.</italic> (Participant 2: p21)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="section32-17504589241253487"><title>Areas to improve</title><p>Although the perioperative pathway was widely supported and appreciated by participating parents, some recommendations for improvement were made. These included addressing noise in the main waiting area to allay anxiety or behavioural escalation in children sensitive to noise or crowds.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">It&#x02019;s a very noisy area with the children coming out from their procedures, and you&#x02019;re sitting there with a child who&#x02019;s going into a procedure, who has sensory issues, and the bright lights and their noises can usually keep them still quite anxious, even though they&#x02019;re on Lorazepam.</italic> (Participant 2: p10)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The parents stated preference for a separate, quiet waiting area to avoid potential stress and anxiety from being in a crowded place like a hospital.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Yes. I think the only thing is the discharge procedure, if there can be a quiet pathway for discharge as well. I think that could be. I don&#x02019;t know how hard that would be to organize, probably near impossible with the hospital system these days, but I think the quiet pathway in and out would be fabulous.</italic> (Participant 16: p57)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Some parents emphasised the importance of having a disability liaison officer or nurse to assist communication between family and the teams to facilitate smooth hospital encounters.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">What makes the whole process about coming to hospital easier is having a good relationship and a communicated relationship with the senior nurse specialist, representing the department that you&#x02019;re dealing with. Not only can they liaise with you and the doctor any concerns prior to admission. They can help set up any follow up appointments and if we are coming down for a scheduled appointment and we have other things going on, they help liaise things, to the best of their ability, so it&#x02019;s not overwhelming for the child.</italic> (Participant 2: p70)</p><p><italic toggle="yes">But certainly, some kind of hospital community interface or some kind of, whether it&#x02019;s a liaison officer or Disability Liaison Officer, that can coordinate with the team would be incredible.</italic> (Participant 19: p31)</p></disp-quote>

This initiative was to address the gaps between the need and the scarcity of locally available individualised perioperative services. This study provides insight into the experiences of parents who received these services for their child, often previously challenged by access barriers and staff workforce not equipped to meet their needs.</p><p>In this study, most of these children have had multiple past admissions to different hospitals that have led to fears anticipating their current admission. We found the majority of parents reported positive experiences and improved care, strongly recommending the continuation of this service.

However, benefits from the perioperative experience pathway may also benefit vulnerable groups as well warranting further research in this area.</p><p>Corresponding health care staff were not interviewed to obtain feedback on their experiences and how the services could be improved in this iteration. Future evaluations will include staff, patient and stakeholder perspectives to improve triangulation of the data obtained.</p><p>Recall time of the event encountered was potentially lengthy. It may have contributed to the limited response from parents.</p><p>The relatively low response participation rates are acknowledged. However, previous research has highlighted and reflected the busyness of such parents caring for children with complex disabilities (<xref rid="bibr4-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Cantero-Garlito et al 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bibr21-17504589241253487" ref-type="bibr">Ngo et al 2012</xref>).

Parents found that improving communication, convenience and greater collaboration between themselves and staff made for a highly effective adaptive care pathway that allows children with neurodevelopmental conditions and behaviours that challenge to receive customised care, reduce multiple anaesthetic procedures, improve the patient experience and provide safe and high-quality care. The potential for such initiatives to be translated into other settings, or included in staff training and systems improvement strategies, should be further explored in future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section36-17504589241253487" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-17504589241253487" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487 &#x02013; Supplemental material for Perioperative pathways for children with neurodevelopmental conditions and behaviours that challenge: An evaluation of parent experiences for service improvement</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-docx-1-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487.docx"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487 for Perioperative pathways for children with neurodevelopmental conditions and behaviours that challenge: An evaluation of parent experiences for service improvement by Natalie Ong, Hema Ahuja, Jonathan de Lima, Gail Tomsic, Pankaj Garg, Natalie Silove, Bobbi Henao Urrego and Andrew Weatherall in Journal of Perioperative Practice</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="suppl2-17504589241253487" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>sj-docx-2-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487 &#x02013; Supplemental material for Perioperative pathways for children with neurodevelopmental conditions and behaviours that challenge: An evaluation of parent experiences for service improvement</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-docx-2-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487.docx"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-2-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487 for Perioperative pathways for children with neurodevelopmental conditions and behaviours that challenge: An evaluation of parent experiences for service improvement by Natalie Ong, Hema Ahuja, Jonathan de Lima, Gail Tomsic, Pankaj Garg, Natalie Silove, Bobbi Henao Urrego and Andrew Weatherall in Journal of Perioperative Practice</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="suppl3-17504589241253487" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>sj-docx-3-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487 &#x02013; Supplemental material for Perioperative pathways for children with neurodevelopmental conditions and behaviours that challenge: An evaluation of parent experiences for service improvement</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-docx-3-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487.docx"/><p>sj-docx-3-ppj-10.1177_17504589241253487 for Perioperative pathways for children with neurodevelopmental conditions and behaviours that challenge: An evaluation of parent experiences for service improvement by Natalie Ong, Hema Ahuja, Jonathan de Lima, Gail Tomsic, Pankaj Garg, Natalie Silove, Bobbi Henao Urrego and Andrew Weatherall in Journal of Perioperative Practice</p><permissions><license license-type="creative-commons" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ext-link>) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage">https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage</ext-link>).</license-p></license></permissions></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Data availability statement:</bold> The authors will provide data on request.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Natalie Ong <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_17504589241253487-img1.jpg"/>
