Our review showed that since 1978, the date of the first birth using in vitro fertilization technology (IVF), more than 10 million children are conceived by ART.&#x000a0;Our research revealed 441 meta-analysis. After a comprehensive analysis of abstracts, only four meta-analysis were selected. Chronologically from 2019 to 2023, the first studies showed that the risk of intellectual disability and autism spectrum diseases (ASD) were higher in intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) children compared to conventional IVF children. The differences in the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children born after frozen and fresh embryo transfers were not significant. Analysis of potential cofounder effects such as multiple and preterm birth having a significant correlation with neurodevelopmental disorders suggested that ART is unlikely to cause negative impacts on children&#x02019;s neurodevelopment. The findings of the most recent meta-analysis showed that the use of ART did not associate with the risk of ASD,</p></sec><sec id="sec8672"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Given the multitude of factors modulating ART, from the indication and parental background to the type of used technique and approach, the results of the studies that investigated the association between ART and neurodevelopmental outcomes remain yet contradictory.</p></sec><sec id="sec8673"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
