To address this challenge, identifying novel therapeutic target combinations is critical for improving metastatic breast cancer treatment. This study investigates the mechanism by which asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) regulates breast cancer metastasis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a potential interaction between AEP and CD74, which was subsequently confirmed through co&#x02010;immunoprecipitation (co&#x02010;IP) experiments. Further investigations demonstrated that AEP activates ERK pathway phosphorylation via CD74 regulation, thereby enhancing epithelial&#x02010;mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression and promoting breast cancer cell migration. Compared to controls, dual inhibition of AEP and CD74 effectively reduced EMT markers and the migratory capacity of cancer cells in&#x000a0;vitro. Subsequent in&#x000a0;vivo experiments showed that this combinatorial strategy significantly suppressed breast cancer lung metastasis in mice without observable toxicity. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which AEP promotes metastasis via CD74 regulation, while validating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of dual AEP/CD74 targeting. This study provides a novel conceptual framework and potential therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="jcmm70616-kwd-0001">asparagine endopeptidase</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70616-kwd-0002">breast cancer</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70616-kwd-0003">CD74</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70616-kwd-0004">lung metastasis</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70616-kwd-0005">macrophage migration inhibitory factor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities

It is characterised by high metastasis and poor prognosis. When breast cancer metastasises, the overall survival period is reduced to 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;years, with a 5&#x02010;year survival rate of only 27% [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This greatly impacts patient prognosis. The most common distal metastasis sites of breast cancer primarily involve bone, lung, brain, and liver. Approximately 21%&#x02013;36% of breast cancer patients experience lung metastasis, with 36.9% of them having triple&#x02010;negative breast cancer [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The metastasis process in breast cancer typically involves several steps. First, tumour cells undergo epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquiring a mesenchymal phenotype [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This enhances their ability to migrate, invade, and degrade the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Subsequently, they detach from the primary tumour, infiltrate the surrounding tissue, and penetrate the tissue base to invade blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. Through the circulatory system, they spread to distant organs, interact with cells in those organs, and form micro metastatic foci, ultimately colonising the distant organs [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During this process, breast cancer cell EMT progression is modulated by key signalling pathways including AKT, ERK, and STAT3. These pathways converge to regulate transcription factors such as Twist1, SLUG, Snail, ZEB1, and ZEB2, ultimately governing the expression and transcriptional activity of EMT&#x02010;associated proteins [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cysteine cathepsins comprise a family of proteases that have been widely implicated in the invasion and progression of primary breast tumours. Legumain (LGMN), also known as asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), is a lysosomal cysteine endoprotease originally identified in the seeds of legumes [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is the only mammalian enzyme that cleaves C&#x02010;terminally to asparagine residues [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. AEP is overexpressed on the cell surface and in cytoplasmic vesicles of solid tumours and is associated with the development, invasion, and metastasis stages in several cancers [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], including breast [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], prostate, colorectal [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and gastric carcinomas. Mechanistically, AEP exerts pro&#x02010;metastatic effects in tumour cells primarily through its interaction with AKT and ERK pathways&#x02014;critical pathways driving tumour progression. Furthermore, AEP facilitates metastasis by dual mechanisms: mediating extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and remodelling the tumour microenvironment (TME) [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous studies have confirmed that AEP is a potential prognostic factor in breast cancer and that its expression significantly correlates with a shortened lifespan in patients, suggesting that AEP may play an important role in breast cancer invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We have identified a novel AEP inhibitor that effectively inhibits legumain enzyme activity in both in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo studies [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, targeted AEP inhibitors combined with chemotherapy drugs can significantly reduce the occurrence of bone metastasis in breast cancer and prolong the survival period of mice, by regulating EMT&#x02010;related genes and osteoclasts. Previous research has achieved promising results in the treatment of bone metastasis in breast cancer through the regulation of AEP expression [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, studies have also found that epirubicin, when used as a combination chemotherapy drug, has certain toxic effects in mouse models, including weight loss and poor survival status. Therefore, finding a new target inhibitor to replace chemotherapy drugs has become a new approach to prevent and treat breast cancer metastasis.</p><p>Research on the MHC&#x02010;II complex revealed that AEP proteolytically processes the invariant chain CD74 during antigen presentation, thereby impairing MHC&#x02010;II&#x02010;mediated antigen presentation [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This finding definitively established CD74 as a canonical substrate of AEP. Clinically, elevated CD74 expression in malignancies exhibits a strong correlation with adverse clinical outcomes, driving growing research interest in its oncogenic functions across tumorigenesis and progression. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a well&#x02010;defined, multi&#x02010;potent pro&#x02010;inflammatory mediator that plays an important role in both the innate and adaptive immune systems [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As an important receptor of MIF, CD74 initiates a cascade reaction of continuous ERK1/2 MAPK activation upon MIF activation [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. MIF is associated with cancer occurrence and serves as a link between chronic inflammation and cancer [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. MIF levels are significantly elevated in many tumours and promote cell proliferation in prostate tumours, breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, and glioma [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some studies have found that MIF from breast cancer patients' breast tissue has an anti&#x02010;inflammatory effect and can play a cancer&#x02010;promoting role in the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue, leading to a poor prognosis for patients [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The role of MIF/CD74 in lung metastasis of breast cancer and whether the combination of MIF inhibitors and AEP inhibitors is safer and more effective than the chemotherapy drug combination regimen used in previous studies (AEP inhibitors + epirubicin) are still unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="jcmm70616-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jcmm70616-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell Lines and Mice</title><p>HEK293T (RRID:CVCL_0063), mice breast cancer cell line (4&#x02009;T1.2 (ATCC; CRL&#x02010;3406), 4&#x02009;T1 (ATCC; CRL&#x02010;2539)) and human breast cancer cell line (MDA&#x02010;MB&#x02010;231 (ATCC; CRM&#x02010;HTB&#x02010;26), MCF&#x02010;7 (ATCC; HTB&#x02010;22)) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

</title><p>To search for proteins that interact with AEP, this study utilised the String database (<ext-link xlink:href="http://cn.stringdb.org" ext-link-type="uri">cn.stringdb.org</ext-link>). The search results indicated a stronger interaction between AEP and CD74. CD74, as an invariant chain of the MHC&#x02010;II complex, has been shown to be cleavable by AEP. Subsequently, the protein&#x02013;protein interaction prediction tool PPA Pred (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.iitm.ac.in" ext-link-type="uri">www.iitm.ac.in</ext-link>) was used to predict the interaction between AEP and the CD74 protein (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The prediction results revealed a predicted binding free energy (Delta G) of &#x02212;11.32&#x02009;kcal/mol and a predicted dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.99&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>&#x02009;M.

(A) Bioinformatics analysis to find AEP&#x02010;interacting proteins; CD74, also known as the invariant chain (Ii), serves as the invariant chain of the MHC class II complex. Structurally, CD74 is a single&#x02010;pass type II transmembrane protein composed of an intracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular domain. The extracellular domain primarily includes a trimerization region and an MHC class II&#x02010;binding region (CLIP region, spanning amino acids 81&#x02010;104). AEP recognises and cleaves specific asparagine (Asn) residues within the Ii chain, notably Asn155 located in its luminal domain adjacent to the CLIP region. The cleavage by AEP initiates the stepwise degradation of Ii, thereby regulating the maturation and antigen presentation capacity of MHC class II molecules. Consequently, CD74 is proposed as a putative substrate of AEP.

Compared with the control group, it shows that the expression level of AEP is inhibited by BIC&#x02010;113. Corresponding to a decrease in CD74 expression level, the phosphorylation level of AKT and NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B decreases, the expression level of E&#x02010;cadherin increases, and the expression of N&#x02010;cadherin and MMP&#x02010;2 decreases (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). This indicates that BIC&#x02010;113 inhibition of AEP reduces the phosphorylation level of AKT and NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B, as well as the level of EMT. In the AEP overexpressing MCF&#x02010;7 cell line, it was observed that upregulation of AEP expression increases the expression of CD74 and activates the phosphorylation of the AKT, ERK, and NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B pathways (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). This leads to a decrease in the expression of E&#x02010;cadherin and an increase in the expression of N&#x02010;cadherin and MMP&#x02010;2 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>), indicating the promotion of the EMT process.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jcmm70616-fig-0003"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>AEP enhances the level of epithelial mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells by regulating CD74.

After the administration of siCD74, the expression levels of p&#x02010;ERK were reversed, but the expression levels of p&#x02010;AKT and p&#x02010;NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B did not show significant changes. Meanwhile, the expression of E&#x02010;cadherin was upregulated, while the expression of N&#x02010;cadherin and MMP&#x02010;2 was reduced (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These results suggest that knocking down CD74 can inhibit the EMT process caused by higher levels of AEP, and this action is achieved through the influence on p&#x02010;ERK. Therefore, AEP can activate the phosphorylation of the AKT, ERK, and NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B pathways to promote the EMT process, while CD74 can be regulated by AEP, affecting the EMT process by activating the phosphorylation of the ERK pathway.</p></sec><sec id="jcmm70616-sec-0015"><label>3.4</label><title>Exogenous <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">AEP</styled-content> Enhances the Epithelial&#x02010;Mesenchymal Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells</title><p>AEP, as a protease, not only plays a shearing and processing role in tumour cells, enhancing their ability to metastasize and invade, but it is also often excreted into the tumour microenvironment by exosomes of tumour cells to promote metastasis and invasion. To verify whether exogenous AEP affects the EMT level of breast cancer cells, we designed a cell co&#x02010;culture model based on the transwell chamber (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>), using 293&#x02009;T WT cells and 293&#x02009;T shAEP cells to co&#x02010;culture with MCF&#x02010;7 cells.

In addition, we employed 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ISO&#x02010;1 and 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M BIC&#x02010;113 as a combo group.

These findings suggest that the combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 can reduce the migration ability of breast cancer cells more effectively than inhibiting either AEP or CD74 alone. After treatment with BIC&#x02010;113 or ISO&#x02010;1, breast cancer cells showed a decrease in the expression of EMT&#x02010;related proteins (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). However, the reduction in EMT levels was more significant in the combo group compared to the two individual drugs. It is important to note that BIC&#x02010;113 primarily inhibited the expression of p&#x02010;AKT and p&#x02010;NF&#x02010;&#x003ba;B, but had no significant inhibitory effect on p&#x02010;ERK.

In the combo group, the expression of all three phosphorylated proteins was inhibited, indicating that the combination of BIC&#x02010;113 and ISO&#x02010;1 can effectively lower the EMT level of breast cancer cells compared to each drug alone.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jcmm70616-fig-0005"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 can reduce the migration ability of breast cancer cells and the level of epithelial mesenchymal transformation.

This suggests that the combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 can effectively overcome lung metastasis of breast cancer and improve the prognosis of mice. HE staining was used to observe breast cancer metastasis in lung tissue. The control group mice showed obvious solid breast cancer metastasis in the lung tissue, while the BIC&#x02010;113 or ISO&#x02010;1 group showed relatively reduced metastasis. The Combo group showed no obvious lung metastasis in the lung tissue (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). After BIC&#x02010;113 administration, the expression of AEP in the metastatic focus of breast cancer in the lung tissue of mice was weaker than that in the control group. The expression of AEP in the ISO&#x02010;1 group was not reduced, and the expression of AEP in the Combo group was also less (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6F</xref> upper line).

HE staining of the Combo group showed no significant damage to myocardial cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> heart). As for the spleen, the three treatment regimens did not cause splenomegaly (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref> spleen), and HE staining in the Combo group showed no significant damage to the spleen tissue, indicating that none of the three treatment regimens caused severe inflammation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> spleen). In terms of the kidneys, the control group, BIC&#x02010;113 monotherapy group, and ISO&#x02010;1 monotherapy group had significantly reduced kidney size compared to the Combo group (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref> kidney). However, HE staining of the Combo group showed no significant atrophy or enlargement of the glomeruli, and their morphology appeared normal (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> kidney). The difference in heart and kidney weight between the other three groups and the Combo group may be related to tumour&#x02010;induced weight loss in mice. These results indicate that the combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 does not cause significant visceral toxicity and is safe.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jcmm70616-fig-0007"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p>Combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 without significant visceral toxicity.

Currently, the selection of targeted drugs for metastasis is mainly based on different types of breast cancer, and there has been progress in innovative therapies such as immunotherapy for resisting breast cancer metastasis [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, there is great hope for developing innovative therapies for breast cancer metastasis. AEP, as a member of the C13 family of lysosomal cysteine proteases, plays a role in protein splicing and processing in organisms. It is highly expressed during tumour development and has involvement in tumour&#x02010;related physiological and biochemical reactions [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The development of AEP&#x02010;targeted therapeutics has been actively pursued due to its multifaceted roles in oncogenesis and disease progression. Despite compelling preclinical evidence of AEP's involvement in tumorigenic pathways, no AEP&#x02010;specific inhibitors have progressed to clinical trials. This translational gap may stem from the incomplete suppression of metastasis and invasive phenotypes through AEP monotherapy, underscoring the limitations of single&#x02010;target strategies [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To address this, future investigations should prioritise combinatorial approaches integrating AEP inhibitors with complementary agents, or exploit AEP's tumour&#x02010;selective overexpression for precision medicine applications. Notably, innovative drug design paradigms, such as AEP&#x02010;directed antibody&#x02010;drug conjugates (ADCs) or protease&#x02010;activated delivery systems, have shown preclinical promise. For example, paclitaxel&#x02010;based AEP&#x02010;targeting drug conjugates exhibit potent anti&#x02010;proliferative effects in colorectal (HCT116) and breast cancer (MCF&#x02010;7) models, with demonstrated efficacy in suppressing pulmonary metastasis and tumour recurrence in&#x000a0;vivo [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In parallel, CD74 has emerged as a dual&#x02010;modality target influencing both tumour biology and immune regulation. Current therapeutic strategies encompass: (1) MIF/CD74 small&#x02010;molecule inhibitors, (2) monoclonal antibodies against MIF/CD74 axis components, (3) siRNA&#x02010;mediated silencing, and (4) functional disruptors of CD74 signalling. While CD74&#x02010;specific inhibitors remain elusive, multiple MIF&#x02010;targeted agents have entered clinical evaluation. The isoquinoline derivative ISO&#x02010;1 exemplifies this category, demonstrating dual anti&#x02010;neoplastic and immunomodulatory properties through competitive MIF binding, effectively suppressing CD74&#x02010;mediated signalling, reducing pro&#x02010;inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF, IFN&#x02010;&#x003b3;, IL&#x02010;4, IL&#x02010;17), and inhibiting glioma proliferation [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These mechanistic insights provide a rationale for exploring synergistic combinations of AEP inhibitors with MIF/CD74 pathway modulators, a strategy that may enhance therapeutic efficacy while mitigating compensatory resistance mechanisms.</p><p>CD74, also known as the invariant chain (Ii), serves as the invariant chain of the MHC class II complex and functions as a receptor for the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). First identified in the 1970s through co&#x02010;immunoprecipitation with the MHC class II complex, CD74 is an evolutionarily highly conserved type II transmembrane glycoprotein [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. AEP initiates the stepwise degradation of Ii by recognising and cleaving critical asparagine (Asn) residues within the Ii chain. AEP predominantly cleaves at Asn76 and Asn155, with Asn155 located in the luminal domain of Ii adjacent to the CLIP region (amino acids 81&#x02013;104). This proteolytic activity by AEP represents the initial step in Ii chain degradation, enabling subsequent proteases (e.g., cathepsins S/L) to further process the CLIP region. By cleaving the Ii chain, AEP facilitates the liberation of the antigen&#x02010;binding groove of MHC class II molecules, thereby allowing their engagement with exogenous antigenic peptides and regulating the maturation and antigen presentation capacity of MHC class II molecules. This regulatory mechanism is particularly critical in professional antigen&#x02010;presenting cells (APCs), including B lymphocytes and dendritic cells [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This study investigated the impact of AEP on the metastasis of breast cancer cells. Protein interaction analysis revealed a potential relationship between AEP and CD74 in influencing the EMT process of breast cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation confirmed the association between AEP and CD74, further demonstrating that AEP activates the phosphorylation of the ERK pathway through CD74. This activation improves the migration ability and EMT level of breast cancer cells. Additionally, exogenous AEP was found to enhance the EMT level of breast cancer cells. CD74, known as an invariant chain of the MHC&#x02010;II complex and a receptor for MIF, is frequently associated with high expression and poor prognosis during tumour development [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. CD74 primarily promotes tumour progression through its signalling function, making it a potential tumour marker or targeted drug target [<xref rid="jcmm70616-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Due to the absence of targeted inhibitors for CD74, the MIF inhibitor ISO&#x02010;1 was chosen to inhibit CD74 function by occupying the binding domain of MIF. This inhibition prevents the binding between MIF and CD74, effectively inhibiting CD74 function. Based on the discovery that AEP influences the metastatic and invasive ability of breast cancer cells through CD74 and previous findings that AEP alone does not completely inhibit bone metastasis, this study proposes the hypothesis that the combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 can significantly inhibit breast cancer metastasis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jcmm70616-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Subsequent in&#x000a0;vitro experiments, including transwell migration and Western Blot experiments, demonstrated that the combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 reduces the migration ability and EMT level of breast cancer cells. In a breast cancer lung metastasis model, it was observed that the combined scheme successfully resists lung metastasis, improves the prognosis of mice, and does not display obvious toxicity. Breast cancer metastasis mechanisms have witnessed significant therapeutic advancements, with emerging agents demonstrating targeted efficacy across distinct molecular pathways. CXCR4 antagonists (e.g., plerixafor) modulate tumour microenvironment (TME) dynamics by disrupting the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemotactic axis, thereby impeding metastatic niche colonisation through interference with tumour cell tropism. TGF&#x02010;&#x003b2; signalling inhibitors such as galunisertib exert dual anti&#x02010;metastatic effects by suppressing both epithelial&#x02010;mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) and pre&#x02010;metastatic niche maturation. Immune checkpoint blockade strategies, exemplified by pembrolizumab in PD&#x02010;L1+ triple&#x02010;negative breast carcinoma (TNBC), have redefined therapeutic paradigms through robust inhibition of distant metastatic dissemination. Notably, AEP&#x02010;targeted therapeutics and CD74/MIF axis inhibitors present mechanistically distinct intervention points. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated AEP inhibition confers specific protection against osteolytic metastasis initiation and progression, a finding of particular clinical relevance given the propensity of breast malignancies for skeletal colonisation. This unique mechanistic profile positions these agents as viable second&#x02010;line alternatives for patients exhibiting primary resistance to conventional targeted therapies. Therefore, combination therapy utilising AEP&#x02010;targeted inhibitors and CD74/MIF pathway inhibitors may provide comprehensive inhibition of distant organ metastasis in breast cancer, potentially emerging as a promising clinical strategy for future therapeutic development.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jcmm70616-fig-0008"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of mechanism of action and pathway illustrations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCMM-29-e70616-g007" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-15"/></fig><p>To sum up, this study found that inhibiting AEP can resist bone metastasis of breast cancer. Furthermore, AEP was found to enhance the metastatic and invasive ability of breast cancer cells through CD74 regulation. Lastly, the combined inhibition of AEP and CD74 was proven to safely and effectively combat lung metastasis of breast cancer, providing novel insights for clinical treatment. This study clarifies the molecular mechanism of AEP promoting breast cancer metastasis by regulating CD74, explores the therapeutic effect and safety of AEP and CD74 combined inhibition on breast cancer metastasis, and provides new targets and ideas for breast cancer metastasis treatment.</p></sec><sec id="jcmm70616-sec-0025"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
