Viral lncRNAs can have a variety of functions, some of which are necessary for viral production and the modulation of host processes during infection. HCMV produces four lncRNAs, Beta2.7 (RNA2.7), RNA4.9, RNA5.0 and RNA1.2. While there has been research on these viral lncRNAs, many of their functions remain uncharacterized. To determine the function of RNA1.2, we explored its requirement during lytic infection by generating viral mutants containing either a full or partial deletion of the RNA1.2 locus. Within permissive fibroblasts, the RNA1.2 deletion mutants showed no defects in viral DNA synthesis, transcript expression, protein production, or generation of viral progeny. Further investigation to identify potential cellular and viral protein binding partners of RNA1.2 was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A significant number of cellular proteins were identified and associated with RNA1.2. Specifically those associated with the innate immune response, mitochondrial processes, and cell cycle regulation. While RNA1.2 is dispensable for lytic replication, these findings suggest it may play a pivotal role in modulating the host response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HCMV</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>lytic replication</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source> National Institute of General Medical Sciences</funding-source><award-id>GM103440</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>UNR VPRI startup funds partially supported this work.

Introduction</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are ubiquitous worldwide. It is estimated that the seroprevalence of HCMV ranges from 45&#x02013;100%, with low- and middle-income communities experiencing the highest rates of infection [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While healthy individuals experience primarily asymptomatic infection, HCMV causes severe disease in immunocompromised and at-risk populations. Some examples of those who experience severe or life-threatening complications are transplant recipients, newborn infants, and HIV/AIDS patients [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, there is no approved vaccine for HCMV, and long-term use of some HCMV antivirals such as ganciclovir (GCV), valganciclovir (VGV), maribavir (MBV) or phosphonomethanoic acid (foscarnet), can lead to resistance or potential toxicity with continual use [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>As a member of the herpesviridae family, HCMV establishes a lifelong infection in human hosts following initial infection. The primary site of latency for HCMV occurs in bone marrow cells of the myeloid lineage [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During this phase, HCMV DNA persists without producing progeny virions, although specific viral transcripts remain detectable [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Upon reactivation, the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells triggers lytic replication, producing new viral progeny. During the productive lytic phase, viral gene expression occurs in a precise temporal cascade, encompassing immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L) genes.</p><p>HCMV has the largest genome amongst all known human herpesviruses. The linear dsDNA genome consists of ~236 kb and has approximately 180 genes [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most of these genes are protein-coding, but there are four highly abundant non-coding transcripts [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous transcriptome analysis during a lytic HCMV infection identified that 65.1% of viral polyadenylated transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). lncRNAs are characterized as &#x0003e;200 nucleotides (nts) in length and have no apparent protein-coding potential [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The four identified HCMV lncRNas are RNA1.2, RNA2.7, RNA4.9, and RNA5.0, which are named according to the approximate length of their RNA molecules (kb) [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The expression of the lncRNAs at high levels, requiring finite resources, suggests that these transcripts play a role and are major regulators in viral replication and host biological processes during infection [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Investigation of the functional roles of viral lncRNAs has expanded in recent years. Once hypothesized as &#x0201c;dark matter&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;junk&#x0201d; nucleic acid, these lncRNAs have proven to play an integral part in biological processes [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The functions of lncRNAs can vary widely, but in general, they can serve as guides to recruit proteins to specific DNA sequences, act as decoys to titrate proteins within specific areas of the cell, form scaffolds to assemble multi-protein complexes, and interact directly with RNA or DNA to regulate translation or RNA processing. ncRNAs have been detected in many different viruses, including other herpesviruses such as Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) Polyadenylated Nuclear transcript (PAN) RNA, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) Latency associated transcript (LAT), and have functional capabilities that can increase viral replication efficiency and modulate innate antiviral response mechanisms [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Of the four HCMV lncRNAs, RNA2.7 is the most abundant at over 46.8% of all viral polyadenylated transcripts [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. RNA2.7 is an early transcript (also referred to as Beta2.7 because of its expression kinetics) from promoter response to immediate-early protein 1 and 2 (IE1 and IE2) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There is also evidence that RNA2.7 is expressed during latency [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. RNA2.7 modulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis by interacting with host factors such as DNA replication factor 1 (Cdt1), cell division cycle gene 6 (Cdc6), and the mitochondrial complex I [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The interaction between RNA2.7 and the GRIM-19 subunit of mitochondrial complex I has been shown to protect infected cells from apoptosis by maintaining ATP production from the mitochondria [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This has led to studies on the therapeutic potential of RNA2.7 in the absence of infection for ischemia and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recent studies have also pointed to RNA2.7 function in upregulating cellular gene expression involved in cell motility and facilitating virus cell-to-cell spread [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Approximately 10.1% of the viral polyadenylated transcripts are RNA4.9 [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. RNA4.9 is localized to the host nuclear compartment and may be involved in initiating viral origin replication [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. HCMV viral DNA replication begins at a single origin, the origin of lytic DNA replication (<italic toggle="yes">ori</italic>Lyt). After RNA4.9 is transcribed, it forms an R-loop and becomes embedded within the <italic toggle="yes">ori</italic>Lyt region, creating an RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid structure [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The RNA stem&#x02013;loop structure, formed at the 5&#x02032; end of RNA4.9, is recognized by the proposed origin binding protein (OBP) UL84 for initiation of viral DNA replication [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Disruption of the RNA4.9 promoter leads to a decrease in the single-stranded DNA binding protein (ssDBP) UL57, the transcription of which originates upstream from <italic toggle="yes">ori</italic>Lyt [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. RNA4.9 has also been proposed to play a role during latency to facilitate the repression of the major immediate-early promoter (MIEP) by recruiting the polycomb repression complex for chromatin remodeling [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Among the HCMV viral lncRNAs, RNA5.0 and RNA1.2 remain the least characterized. RNA5.0 is a stable intron and was shown to be dispensable for replication in fibroblasts but may play a role in viral pathogenesis; in a murine model of infection with MCMV, the homologue of RNA5.0 (RNA7.2) was shown to be required for viral persistence [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The differences in the results between HCMV RNA5.0 in a cell culture model and MCMV RNA7.2 in the murine infection model highlight the limitations of in vitro systems, which cannot recapitulate the infection dynamics of a whole organism.</p><p>RNA1.2 accounts for 7.9% of the polyadenylated viral transcripts [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The characterization of RNA1.2 remains limited, but studies in HCMV strain Merlin identified that it modulates host innate immune responses by blocking NF-&#x003ba;B activation and preventing the release of IL-6 [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This study generated and characterized two different RNA1.2 viral mutants using the Merlin bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, one lacking most of the RNA1.2 gene locus and the other a deletion of only the TATA sequence within the promoter. In a fibroblast infection model, neither RNA1.2 mutants had significant viral growth defects and showed minimal differences in viral gene expression compared to wild-type viruses. Interestingly, differential expression analysis identified significant regulation differences in 76 cellular genes, both at the RNA and protein level, in the RNA1.2 mutant viruses. The most highly upregulated was Tumor Protein p63-Regulated Gene 1-Like protein (TPRG1L), one of the known functions of which is to increase the expression of IL-6 through NF-&#x003ba;B activation. An increase in the expression of chemokines MCP-1 and CXCL1 in the mutants lacking RNA1.2 was further demonstrated.</p><p>A recent report explored the expression and function of HCMV lncRNA during latency and lytic reactivation using strain Toledo in Kasumi-3 and fibroblast infection models [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS), selecting for polyadenylated transcripts, the authors found that RNA1.2 accounted for ~17% of poly-A viral transcripts during latency, reactivation, and lytic infection. Interestingly, using an RNA1.2 deletion virus in the Toledo BAC, they reported a significant decrease in cell-free virus particles in the supernatant compared to WT in permissive fibroblasts [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Using the same virus in a Kasumi-3 model of infection, they suggest RNA1.2 may play a role in maintaining the latent viral DNA reservoir and is required for productive reactivation. They assessed the epitranscriptome, finding no splicing junctions within RNA1.2, and noted that differential RNA modification sites between latency and other infection states (reactivation and lytic) were more frequent in viral lncRNAs, including RNA1.2, which indicates post-transcriptional regulation through RNA modifications. Finally, they used RNA antisense purification coupled with mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to identify proteins interacting with RNA1.2, which included viral proteins IRS1, UL35, UL47, cellular proteins associated with the ER-Golgi network (MYO1B, MYO6, and SEC23IP), proteins involved in antiviral response, and cellular m6A readers IGF2BP3 and YTHDF2.</p><p>The prior studies characterizing RNA1.2 utilized the HCMV strains Merlin and Toledo. Notably, RNA1.2 has been reported to exhibit minimal variability between strains, underscoring its conserved nature across different viral lineages [<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, there are some differences in the conclusions regarding the requirement of RNA1.2 for productive replication [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To better understand the potential role of RNA1.2, we generated RNA1.2 mutants in HCMV strain TB40E and assessed viral DNA synthesis, RNA and protein expression, and production of infectious virions. In our studies, RNA1.2 was determined to be dispensable for lytic replication in permissive human fibroblasts. To further address the potential functional role of RNA1.2, we used proteomics to identify cellular and viral proteins that interact with RNA1.2. For these experiments, RNA1.2 was in vitro transcribed using biotinylated UTP and the labeled RNA was incubated with either infected or non-infected cell lysate, followed by LC-MS to identify protein interactions. We report numerous viral and cellular proteins associated with RNA1.2, and there interactions suggest that its function may be to modify the host cell environment rather than directly participating in viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00149"><title>2.

Half and complete deletions of RNA1.2 were removed by BAC recombineering methods via homologous recombination. For &#x00394;1.2 half mutants, gBlocks (IDT) were designed to contain a kanamycin cassette with homologous arms that flank the middle of the RNA1.2 gene and the 3&#x02032; end to generate the &#x00394;1.2 half mutant (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the &#x00394;1.2 mutant, the gBlock contained a kanamycin cassette with homologous arms flanking regions that overlap the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end of the RNA1.2, resulting in a complete gene deletion (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The homologous recombination step to replace the RNA1.2 gene sequence with kanamycin was performed in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> (GS1783) that harbored TB40E WT BAC DNA.

From the overnight culture, a fraction of the grown cells was cultured in 12.5 mL LB with chloramphenicol and grown at 32 &#x000b0;C with shaking until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.5&#x02013;0.6. The bacterial cells were then immediately incubated in a 42 &#x000b0;C water bath for 15 min to induce the expression of the recombination enzymes. The cells were then cooled in an ice bath and pelleted at 4000 rpm at 4 &#x000b0;C for 10 min. The bacteria pellet was washed with H<sub>2</sub>O and pelleted. After this first wash, a second wash was performed. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20&#x02013;30 s at 4 &#x000b0;C. These washes were repeated twice with a final resuspension in 100 &#x003bc;L of water for immediate use. Importantly, all washes were performed with ice-cold H<sub>2</sub>O.

Bacteria was recovered in 1 mL of warmed LB and incubated for 1.5 h at 32 &#x000b0;C while shaking. The cells were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 min, followed by removing supernatant.

Plates were incubated overnight at 32 &#x000b0;C. Bacterial colonies were grown as liquid cultures in LB with chloramphenicol and kanamycin overnight. Bacteria were pelleted, and DNA was isolated using alkaline lysis and phenol-chloroform extraction.</p><p>The Kan cassette was removed by growing bacteria harboring mutant BAC DNA in the presence of arabinose to induce the Isce enzyme. First, 0.5 mL of mutant BAC DNA containing the kanamycin cassette was grown overnight in 10 mL LB and chloramphenicol. A 2 mL fraction of the culture was then grown in 2 mL of LB with 2% L-arabinose for a final medium concentration of 1% L-arabinose. The cultures were then incubated at 32 &#x000b0;C for 1 h followed by 42 &#x000b0;C for 20 min to induce expression of the recombination enzymes.

Construction and Characterization of RNA1.2 Mutants</title><p>To determine if RNA1.2 is required for lytic replication, RNA1.2 mutants were generated in HCMV strain TB40E by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering methods. Two different mutants were constructed to disrupt RNA1.2, one containing a complete removal of RNA1.2 (&#x00394;RNA1.2) while the other was a half deletion from approximately the middle to the 3&#x02032; end of the gene (&#x00394;RNA1.2 half) (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). The seamless removal of either the full or partial RNA1.2 locus was generated via homologous recombination and confirmed by whole genome sequencing and alignment to the wild-type (WT) genome (TB40E) (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). No other off-target mutations or deletions were found when aligned to the WT DNA sequence. Stocks of WT, &#x00394;RNA1.2, and &#x00394;RNA1.2 half virus were made by transfecting the BAC DNA into permissive human fibroblasts (HF) along with a pp71 expression plasmid. The initial transfected cells and lysate were collected and used to seed larger flasks of HF cells to propagate the viruses further. Viral stocks used for the experiments were purified by centrifugation, and viral titers were calculated from plaque assays of stock serial dilutions on HF cells. Note that while we performed whole genome sequencing on the viral BAC DNA to confirm the targeted mutations of RNA1.2 and no other genomic changes, we did not perform whole genome sequencing on the viral stocks after transfection and passage in fibroblasts. To mitigate potential lab-adapted mutations, we limited the number of passages, but there could have been unrecognized genomic changes that were acquired during the process of transfection and passage in fibroblasts.</p><p>A mutant that only contained a partial removal of RNA1.2 was created for two reasons. First, we assumed that if the whole deletion resulted in an altered phenotype, a half deletion would aid in determining if there is a specific functional domain within the 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; region. Additionally, we were interested in keeping the 5&#x02032; region intact because potential splice donor or acceptor sites for leftward transcripts and small ORFs have been reported within the 5&#x02032; region of RNA1.2 [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ribosomal profiling with mass spectrometry has suggested potential small polycistronic ORFs within the 5&#x02032; region of RNA1.2, although these potential ORFs were noted to have low translation efficiency [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Following infection, total RNA was harvested at 4 hpi, 24 hpi, 48 hpi, and 72 hpi, treated with DNAse and used to generate cDNA for qPCR. Fold enrichment of viral transcripts was calculated in the RNA1.2 mutants compared to WT during infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Representative temporal classes of transcripts were measured; this included IE2 (immediate-early), UL54 (early), and UL86 (late). These viral transcripts and other viral lncRNAs tested, RNA4.9 and &#x003b2;2.7, showed no significant differences in transcript production. RNA1.2 expression was the only transcript that showed a significant difference between WT and the RNA1.2 mutants.</p><p>We next investigated viral protein expression in TB40E WT, &#x00394;RNA1.2 half, and &#x00394;RNA1.2. Mock and infected cell lysate were harvested after 24 hpi and 72 hpi and analyzed by Western blot (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). At 24 hpi we assessed the immediate early proteins IE1 and IE2 and found comparable levels between WT and the &#x00394;RNA1.2 mutants. For the 72 hpi samples, the viral processivity factor UL44 (early) and tegument pp65 (late) proteins also showed similar expression between WT and the RNA1.2 mutants. Western blots were re-probed for Histone H3 as a loading control and showed comparable levels of proteins across all samples.</p><p>As protein production did not seem to be altered in the absence of RNA1.2, we next assessed the localization of key viral proteins by immunofluorescent imaging (IFA) (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). HF cells were infected with TB40E WT, &#x00394;RNA1.2 half, and &#x00394;RNA1.2 for 72 h and then IFA was performed using antibodies specific to IE2, UL44, UL57, and UL84. IE2 expression is distributed throughout the host cell nucleus among all infections, similar to what has been previously reported. UL44 is known to concentrate with viral replication compartments and was found in these areas in WT and the RNA1.2 mutants. The viral encoded single-stranded binding protein, UL57, showed punctate formations and concentrated within the viral replication compartments. Lastly, the multifunctional protein UL84 was detected throughout the host nucleus for all samples.

To further investigate the potential functional role of RNA1.2 during infection, we sought to identify viral and cellular protein binding partners that interact with RNA1.2. Our approach was to use a biotinylated RNA1.2 as bait, incubated in mock and infected cell lysate, and streptavidin beads to capture the RNA&#x02013;protein complexes (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>To generate biotinylated RNA, the RNA1.2 gene was cloned into the pGEM 7Zf(-) plasmid and used as a template for in vitro transcription with the T7 promoter.

By including a mix of native and biotin-modified UTP molecules, the structure of the RNA1.2 molecule is expected to be minimally affected.

A modified Northern blot was performed by incubating the electrophoresed samples with streptavidin-800 to visualize the biotinylated RNA, as shown in the bottom panel, to confirm the incorporation of biotin-16-UTP, and it was also noted that there was very minimal degradation of the RNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-17-00149"><title>3.5.

Since cellular RNA binding proteins were most enriched, a separate pie chart is displayed to further categorize them into functional groups (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>A more detailed representation of proteins enriched with RNA1.2 is represented as heat maps (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Of the total 213 proteins that showed more than three-fold enrichment from the biotinylated RNA1.2 compared to the non-biotinylated control, only five viral proteins were considered to be significantly enriched (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, most of the detected viral proteins are responsible for antagonizing the immune response and play a role in cell cycle control. Besides its classical role as a processivity factor, UL44 is reported to suppress transcription of antiviral genes, TRS1 inhibits autophagy, UL25 interferes with interferon-induced defense mechanisms, and tegument protein pp65 is involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Many cellular RNA binding proteins were identified, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), RNA helicases, and RNA processing, and while it is likely that many of these are non-specific RNA&#x02013;protein interactions, there is also a potential for RNA1.2 to regulate their activity during infection. A subset of cellular proteins that are particularly interesting are those associated with the innate immune response, mitochondrial processes, and cell cycle and regulation. Taken together, these findings indicate that RNA1.2 could modulate cellular functions, and this supports previous reports about the function of RNA1.2 with respect to regulating innate immune response [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>To further test some of the proteins identified in the LC-MS results, RNA immunoprecipitations (RNA-IP) were performed, and the enrichment of RNA1.2 was measured by qPCR. For this assay, lysate of TB40E infected cells (72 hpi) was incubated with antibodies specific to either H2A, RECQ1, UL44, or IgG control, and complexes were immunoprecipitated using protein G magnetic beads. RNA interacting with these proteins was isolated, and qPCR was performed to measure RNA1.2 and GAPDH transcripts (<xref rid="viruses-17-00149-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). The percent input (% input) and standard deviation for RNA1.2 and GAPDH were calculated from three replicates for each RNA-IP. H2A, RECQ1, and UL44 showed significant enrichment of RNA1.2 compared to GAPDH, which validates the results from the RNA1.2 proteomic analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-17-00149"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>lncRNAs have proven to be key regulatory elements in viral and cellular biological processes. Investigation of these molecules has prompted a revolution in disease treatments and RNA-based therapeutics. As more studies emerge, these lncRNAs are shown to be significant in many diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancers [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Next-generation treatments using therapies to either modulate lncRNA expression or to functionalize these non-coding transcripts for controlling DNA and protein expression are emerging [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, in herpesvirus infections, lncRNAs are the most abundant transcripts produced [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This raises the question of whether viral lncRNAs are potential therapeutic targets for viral disease treatment.</p><p>For HCMV, the characterization of RNA1.2, RNA2.7, RNA4.9, and RNA5.0 has been at the center of research as the importance of lncRNAs has emerged. Our study determined that there were no viral defects of TB40E RNA1.2 mutants during a lytic infection by investigating the expression of viral genes and proteins and, ultimately, infectious virus production. We evaluated changes in viral transcript production between WT and RNA1.2 mutants. We analyzed protein production and localization of viral IE, E, and L proteins. There were no significant defects in the production of any viral products. The viral growth curve analyses showed that viral infectious output was unaltered without RNA1.2.</p><p>Prior to our current study, there was a report using RNA1.2 mutants made in the HCMV Merlin strain with deletions to part of the RNA1.2 locus or the TATA promoter element [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Their data determined that the RNA1.2 mutants had minimal changes in viral transcript expression by performing transcriptome sequencing, and they also found no change in viral replication or virion production and release in fibroblast cell culture. Interestingly, a more recent study using RNA1.2 deletion mutants in strain Toledo found RNA1.2 required for lytic replication and noted a two- to ten-fold reduction in the amount of virus produced, consistent with the lower relative amount of viral proteins [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our study, we focused on characterizing an RNA1.2 mutant with either the whole RNA1.2 locus removed or the 3&#x02032;-half. Future studies using deletions within the 5&#x02032;-half or small nucleic acid changes within RNA1.2 will help define specific functional domains of RNA1.2.</p><p>Since protein binding partners for lncRNAs can often play a role in their function, we sought to identify protein binding partners of RNA1.2. We used biotinylated RNA1.2 as bait to capture proteins in mock-infected and infected cell lysate. This allowed us to identify any proteins and complexes associated with RNA1.2. It is interesting to note that the few viral proteins that we identified, UL44, TRS1, UL25, UL112, and pp65, were not the same viral proteins identified by Lee et al., who reported IRS1, UL35, and UL47 [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This could be due to the difference in the approach to isolating the RNA&#x02013;protein complexes in which we used an RNA-IP method. The Lee et al. study used a modified RNA antisense purification coupled with mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Prior studies performed by Lau B. et al. suggest that RNA1.2 plays a significant role in evading the host immune response [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Their results suggested that RNA1.2 modulates the host immune response by interfering with NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent cytokine and chemokine release. This was intriguing, since our proteomic studies revealed a subset of innate immune defense protein enriched with RNA1.2 in infected cells. Interacting with immune regulators would also explain why RNA1.2 is highly expressed but does not display a defect in cell culture replication. The most enriched immune proteins interacting with RNA1.2 detected were MX1 and MX2 (MXA and MXB). MX proteins are ubiquitous in vertebrates and have very broad antiviral activity. The expression of <italic toggle="yes">mx</italic> genes is stimulated by interferon signaling, which explains their increased expression during HCMV infection [<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Their mechanism has been significantly described for RNA viruses and more recently for herpesviruses [<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Studies have shown that upon infection in HSV-1 and KSHV herpesviruses, MXB can inhibit viral DNA uncoating and entry from the capsid [<xref rid="B46-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, one potential role of RNA1.2 is to inhibit the function of these immune-response proteins by binding and physically inhibiting the mechanistic actions of MXA and MXB.</p><p>Another interesting subset of proteins we identified were those associated with mitochondrial processes. RNA2.7 has been previously reported to interact with GRIM19 of mitochondrial complex-1 to modulate cellular metabolism and mediate the host apoptotic pathway [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We did not specifically detect GRIM19 in our results, but we did find interaction with a protein associated with the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme complex. HADHB, the b-subunit of this complex, was the most significantly enriched form of the identified mitochondrial proteins. This protein is involved in the &#x003b2;-oxidation pathway of fatty acids [<xref rid="B47-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In support of our findings, a previous report identified manipulation of this pathway during HCMV infection to enhance viral infectivity [<xref rid="B48-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is known that during HCMV infection, the host mitochondria become morphologically and functionally altered [<xref rid="B49-viruses-17-00149" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Upon infection, mitochondria undergo a hyperactive state where there is increased fission, glycolysis, respiration, and production of stress markers. RNA1.2 likely has a function in manipulating mitochondria to augment infection.</p><p>Many other cellular proteins were identified in the proteomic analysis, but these binding interactions may not all have a purpose or function. It is likely that a multitude of these cellular proteins we detected broadly bind to RNA1.2 because it is an RNA molecule. Further studies examining the specific interactions of these cellular proteins binding with RNA1.2 will be integral for gaining insights into host&#x02013;viral interactions. It is important to mention that this study only revealed the comprehensive discovery of protein-binding partners and does not discuss the potential of RNA1.2 binding to other RNA molecules or genomic DNA. Experiments identifying the association of RNA1.2 with the viral or cellular nucleic acids can reveal novel viral&#x02013;host interactions. This further amplifies the complexity of lncRNAs during viral infection and emphasizes the importance of understanding their functions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Mick Hitchcock, Nevada Proteomics Center (RRID: SCR_017761) at the University of Nevada, Reno, for preparing and analyzing proteomic samples.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
