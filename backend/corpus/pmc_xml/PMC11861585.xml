The male patient reported concomitant symptoms of frequent and painful urination. CT scans show abnormal enhancements. After a cystoscopy examination, both patients are diagnosed with malignant urethral tumors. Surgical resections and additional pathological examinations support the diagnosis of CCAU (palliative resection for case 1 and transurethral resection for case 2). Case 1 undergone progression 6 months after initial treatment with transurethral resection and chemotherapy with a 15-month overall survival. In contrast, the prognosis of case 2 remained uneventful 10 months after surgery without recurrence. After presenting our cases, we launched a literature review that included 23 articles and 33 cases of CCAU to summarize the characteristics of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Primary clear cell adenocarcinoma of the urethra is a rare malignant urethral tumor with controversial histological origins. Primary symptoms include hematuria and changes in voiding habits. Middle-aged and elderly females are more susceptible to primary clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the urethra. Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate primary clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the urethra from other urethral tumors due to similar clinical features. However, imaging tools such as CT, MRI, and cystoscopy are adjunctive in confirming diagnoses. Even though surgical resection is the primary treatment to relieve clinical symptoms, prevent recurrence, and confirm diagnosis, no standard surgical protocol is available. The therapeutic effect of postoperative adjuvant therapies remains unclear. Future investigations on CCAU are necessary to advance clinical knowledge and to provide treatment guidance.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>urethral carcinoma</kwd><kwd>primary clear cell adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>case report</kwd><kwd>literature review</kwd><kwd>surgical treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="3303"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-in-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Genitourinary Oncology</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary clear cell adenocarcinoma of the lower urinary tract is a rare type of malignant genitourinary tumor that can be found in both the bladder and urethra.

Transurethral resection of the urethral tumor was performed in September 2023 after the pathology result returned as malignant. Due to the presence of pelvic and inguinal lymph node metastasis, chemotherapy (Cisplatin and Gemcitabine) was given after surgery. However, chemotherapy had to be stopped due to myelosuppression 3 months later. Significant response was observed from the CT images before and after chemotherapy but partial remission was not achieved (<xref rid="SF1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

The entire length of the urethra, about 6.5cm, was removed. After dissecting along the long axis of the urethra, a cauliflower-like mass approximately 1.5*1.2 cm, with a grayish-white cut surface, was found invading the muscularis propria. The resected tissue was then sent to the pathology department. A final pathology diagnosis of T2NxM1 clear cell carcinoma was made with negative surgical margins (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">

The patient declined adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy and chose active surveillance instead. The patient was discharged on the fourth day after surgery and received regular postoperative follow-up. 6 months after surgery (12 months after primary treatment), the tumor locally recurred, presenting as a spherical mass growing outward from the bladder fistula site. Multiple distal metastases of the liver portal lymph nodes, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were identified a month later.

He also has a past surgical history of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for prostatic hyperplasia two years ago, with a pathology diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. Given the unusual pathology, the patient underwent cystoscopy to rule out other histological sources. No obvious abnormality was found except for patchy mucosal redness near the bladder neck. Regular surveillance was maintained after the TURP surgery. The patient&#x02019;s physical examination was regular. There were no abnormal laboratory values except for the routine urine test, in which the white blood cell counts were slightly elevated, indicating a potential urinary tract infection. Infection is controlled with intravenous levofloxacin (0.5g, qd) for six days. CT and MRI examinations were conducted for radiological diagnosis (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">

Considering the potential risk of local and distal recurrence, a further surgical protocol, including radical prostatectomy, total urethrectomy, and cystostomy, was recommended to the patient. After discussion and consideration, the patient refused to receive further surgery due to the poor quality of postoperative survival. Suggestions of regular active surveillance were also rejected.

Swartz et&#x000a0;al. reported that primary clear cell adenocarcinoma of the urethra (CCAU) accounts for 16.8% of urethral cancer, similar to the percentage of CCA of the bladder in bladder cancer (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition to the rare incidence, it also has an atypical growth location, which is usually located in the urethral diverticulum and periurethral tissue, leading to difficulties in differential diagnosis not only between CCA and transitional-cell cancer but also urethral tumors and tumors of other organs nearby, such as bladder and vagina. Few reports on this disease result in an insufficient understanding of the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Several theories of the origin of CCAU have been proposed, such as the origin of paraurethral glands (Skene&#x02019;s gland) or urothelial metaplasia, without a reached consensus (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Some literature reviews have been published to summarize the disease&#x02019;s clinical features, pathological manifestations, or genetic characteristics (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, drawbacks still exist because most reviews were limited to female patients. Articles in these reviews were also relatively incomplete due to the publication dates. To supplement previous reviews and thoroughly summarize the symptoms and characteristics of this disease, we launched a systemic review by searching articles on this disease written in English and available on Pubmed databases. As a result, 26 literature reports were published from 1973 to 2024, in which 33 cases of CCAU were reported. Detailed characteristics of reported cases are present in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

According to our literature search, the ages of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CCAU range from 36 to 71 years old, with a majority in their 60s and an average age of 55.5 (36-40: 4/33, 12.1%; 41-50: 6/33, 18.2%; 51-60: 12/33, 36.4%; 61-71:11/33, 33.3%). There is a significant difference in incidence between genders. Most reported cases happened in females (28/33, 84.5%) and only 5 male patients were diagnosed (5/33, 15.5%). In addition to the primary growing location of the urethra, 7 cases were reported to invade the trigone and neck of the bladder (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>To understand the impact of CCAU on patients&#x02019; survival time, we conducted a preliminary survival analysis on 33 previously reported cases. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of each case were extracted and summarized from their respective reports, as shown in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1</bold>
</xref>. Overall, post-treatment progressions and deaths were observed in 33.3% and 30.4% of the reported CCAU patients respectively (8 progression events out of 24 cases/7 deaths out of 23 cases) with a median overall survival time of 40 months. We found a significant difference in PFS and OS between non-metastatic and metastatic patients preoperatively (P &#x0003c;0.01). Subgroup analysis based on the metastatic status was further conducted. The prognosis is generally better for cases without preoperative metastasis, with both median PFS and OS not reached. For preoperatively metastatic cases, the prognosis is relatively poor with a median PFS of 12 months and a median OS of 28 months. The Kaplan - Meier plots of these two survival endpoints were presented in <xref rid="SF7" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;7</bold>
</xref>. It should be noted that due to the short follow-up time in most reported cases and the rarity of the disease, the results of our survival analysis should be interpreted with caution, as the prognosis for non-metastatic cases may be overestimated.</p><p>No specific symptoms were identified that are unique to CCAU, whose symptoms are analogous to those observed in other types of urethral carcinoma (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1</bold>
</xref>). The main symptoms are hematuria (16/33, 48.5%), urinary habit changes (10/33, 30.3%), and urinary retention (8/33, 24.2%). Other symptoms were also reported in a small portion of patients, such as urinary tract infection (5/33, 15.2%), vaginal bleeding/menometrorrhagia (3/33, 9.1%), and pain (3/33, 9.1%). In addition, Whitworth et&#x000a0;al. reported a case diagnosed incidentally during a routine physical examination without any symptoms (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). So, it is difficult to make a preliminary diagnosis only based on the symptoms due to the diversity. CT and MRI images can provide radiological evidence for its diagnosis and guide further treatment (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It appears as a round or oval mass of soft-tissue density around the urethra on the CT image, with enhancement visible on the enhancement scan. Invasions may also be observed in some cases into surrounding tissues, such as the bladder and vagina. In a review of the MRI manifestation of CCA in the urethra, four differences were concluded between the characteristics of CCA and non-clear cell adenocarcinoma (NCCA) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>): 1) CCA is often associated with urethra diverticulum. 2) CCA has a lower height-to-width ratio compared with NCCA. 3) More frequent septation can be seen in the tumor. 4) More normal urethra could be preserved compared with NCCA. Due to the rarity of the disease, more cases should be reported to make a more comprehensive conclusion. In our two cases, the height-to-width ratios were slightly larger. According to the literature review, nearly half of the cases were reported without a urethra diverticulum. Tumors affecting the whole urethra were also reported due to their large size (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Cystoscopy was an option for a more precise diagnosis, in which papillary or flatted mass could be seen. However, the cystoscopy results could be normal in rare cases (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), highlighting the importance of pathological examination after either transurethral resection or puncture biopsy. In case of pathological features, CCAU is morphologically similar to clear cell carcinoma of the female reproductive tract. The 2004 edition of the World Health Organization Classification of urethral tumors classified it as glandular tumors, and the most recent 2022 editionclassifies it as Mullerian tumors under a new chapter. The primary CCAU often presents a papillary&#x03001; tubular cystic&#x03001;solid hybrid structure with a clear&#x03001; eosinophilic&#x03001; boot-spike cell hybrid. In terms of immunohistochemistry, CK7 (11/14, 78.6%) and PAX (5/14, 35.7%) were commonly expressed. HNF-1&#x003b2;, NapsinA, CA125, and AMACR were also expressed, while urinary tract markers GATA-3 and P63 were rarely expressed (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Detailed immunohistochemistry features of 33 reported cases were presented in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1</bold>
</xref>. HNF-1&#x003b2;, expressed in CCAU with a much higher positive rate compared with urothelial carcinoma, is often overexpressed in ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma. Thus this marker helps diagnose such disease but is not more helpful in determining the source (primary CCAU or female reproductive tract clear cell adenocarcinoma metastasis). The distinction between primary and secondary cases depends on clinical history and radiological evaluation, as they are not distinguishable at the immunohistochemical level.</p><p>Due to its high malignancy and invasiveness, surgical resection is the primary treatment strategy, which can remove the existing tumor, release the obstructive symptoms, and aid with pathological sampling. Still, there is no standard protocol for the surgery (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Regardless of subtypes, local resection suits low-grade urethral malignant tumors (cT1-T2) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Some patients were reported to receive treatment of transurethral resection with a resectoscope (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Case 2 in our report also only underwent transurethral resection, and he has had an uneventful prognosis until now. However, Dimarco et&#x000a0;al. published a review on the prognosis of malignant urethral cancer after different surgical methods (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In that article, partial urethrectomy was related to poor prognosis and high recurrence rate compared with radical urethrectomy. Thus, anterior pelvic exenteration for females and cystoprostatectomy for males are good options to reduce the recurrence risk and prolong the survival, especially for patients without detected metastasis, most of whom have a good prognosis. According to our literature review, nearly all the patients (26/32, 81.3%) received radical surgery as the primary treatment or after recurrences of partial resection, chemotherapy and radiological therapy. The necessity of lymph node dissection depends on the presence of lymph node metastasis.</p><p>For CCAU with lymphatic or distal metastasis, surgical resection of tumors and involved metastatic lymph nodes remains the treatment option for most patients (10/12, 83.3%). The therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy alone, used as the main treatment without surgery, is unreliable. As reported in two previous cases and our case 1, patients may exhibit poor response or be forced to discontinue medication due to serious adverse events, resulting in missed surgical opportunity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy alone is uncertain, they were reported to be applied as potential supplementary treatments. Rane et&#x000a0;al. reported a female patient who underwent two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and no recurrence was observed during subsequent surveillance (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Some cases were also treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy postoperatively, most of which experienced recurrence or died of CCAU within 1-3 years after surgery (10/14, 71.4%). It is worth noting that patients with unsatisfactory pathological results or radiological manifestations are more likely to receive adjuvant treatments, which results in a high mortality rate and an inaccurate reflection of therapeutic effect. Due to the limited number of reported cases related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as the lack of large-scale retrospective studies, the adjuvant role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in treatments of CCAU needs further reporting and verification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the urethra is an extremely rare malignant tumor without specific symptoms and radiologic manifestations, which causes difficulty in the differential diagnosis with other types of urethral tumors. MRI and cystoscope may shed light on the diagnosis, which ultimately depends on the pathology. Considering the likelihood of high malignancy, surgery is the primary treatment option for most patients, while no standard&#x000a0;surgical protocol has been proposed until now. The therapeutic&#x000a0;effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy remains to be determined&#x000a0;due to insufficient supporting data from published&#x000a0;case-control&#x000a0;studies. Case reports and large-scale retrospective&#x000a0;studies&#x000a0;are&#x000a0;required in the future to enhance the comprehension&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;this&#x000a0;disease and facilitate the development of optimal treatment strategies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Abbreviations</title><fn fn-type="abbr" id="abbrev1"><p>CCAU, Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma of the Urethra; CCA, Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma; PFS, Progression-Free Survival; OS, Overall Survival; NCCA, Non-Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
