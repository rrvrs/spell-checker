Despite aggressive medical therapies, achieving weight loss in these patients remains challenging, especially in patients after durable ventricular assist device (LVAD). More intense weight loss interventions such as bariatric and metabolic surgery and endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) can lead to meaningful weight reduction, enabling previously ineligible individuals to become transplant candidates. A 51-year-old gentleman with end-stage heart and kidney failure status-post HeartMate 3 LVAD (Abbott, Chicago, IL) and Class II obesity (BMI 36.5&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), was deemed ineligible for heart transplant due to high BMI (&#x02265;35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Despite lifestyle modification, he was unable to lose weight, and BMI increased to 40.8&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> over the next 10 months. A multi-disciplinary discussion was held to discuss possible weight loss options, and after careful consideration, bariatric surgery was not deemed safe. The decision was made to proceed with EBTs, and an intragastric balloon (IGB) was successfully placed as a bridge to heart transplant. The IGB was removed at the six-month period per standard of care, and the patient had lost 16.5&#x02005;Kg, achieving a 12.4% Total Body Weight Loss with a BMI of 35.3&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The patient underwent successful heart and kidney transplant and is now two months post-transplant. His BMI 2-months post-transplant is 37&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This case highlights the feasibility and efficacy of EBT therapy with IGB placement as an alternative to bariatric surgery for patients with LVAD placement and significant comorbidities who need to lose clinically significant weight to be deemed eligible for heart transplant.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>LVAD</kwd><kwd>heartMate 3</kwd><kwd>Heart transplant</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>intragastric balloon</kwd><kwd>endoscopic bariatric therapies</kwd><kwd>heart failure</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="14"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-at-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Heart Failure and Transplantation</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1a"><title>Highlights</title><p>

With every 1&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in Body Mass Index (BMI), the risk of heart failure (HF) increases by 5% in men and 7% in women (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Among HF patients that require heart transplantation (HT), obesity is known to increase the post-transplant risk of rejection, infections, kidney dysfunction, graft vasculopathy and all-cause mortality (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As per the 2024 ISHLT guidelines for the for the Evaluation and Care of Cardiac Transplant Candidates, a BMI of &#x0003c;35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> is preferred to reduce wait times and increase survival rates, hence, most heart transplant centers have a strict BMI cut-off at &#x02264;35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Candidates for HT often present with severe hemodynamic instability and must achieve rapid weight reduction to meet transplant eligibility criteria. Weight loss is particularly challenging in patients with HF due to impaired exercise tolerance and volume overload. Bariatric surgeries and endoscopic therapies have reported successful weight loss reduction, thereby allowing otherwise ineligible individuals to achieve heart transplant candidacy. Moreover, these procedures have also demonstrated an increase in life expectancy compared to patients managed with only medical weight loss therapies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Considering such favorable outcomes, bariatric surgeries have gained momentum among transplant candidates.</p><p>Patients with end-stage HF are often bridged with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices to support cardiac function. Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), the most used MCS devices, have become an integral part of HF therapy either as a bridge to HT or as destination therapy. Patients with LVAD pose additional risks to surgical procedures, predominantly due to long-term anticoagulation therapy and hemodynamic shifts caused by the device and anesthesia. Infection, bleeding (most commonly gastrointestinal bleeding), stroke, thrombosis, thromboembolism, and risks of anesthesia are the most prevalent peri-operative complications encountered. Up to 42.5% of patients undergoing surgical procedures while on LVAD support require transfusion due to bleeding and still have a 56.5% mortality rate (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) are nonsurgical, less invasive weight loss interventions that result in clinically significant weight loss and improvement in comorbidities. Intragastric Balloon (IGB) is a space-occupying device that is endoscopically placed in the gastric body that lead to early satiety and delayed gastric emptying, resulting in lower total caloric intake and weight loss (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As an endoscopic procedure, it may present lower risk profile than patients undergoing invasive bariatric surgery particularly in the context of anticoagulation and device management in patients with an LVAD (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>We present the case of a 51-year-old gentleman with advanced HF status post LVAD placement and a BMI of 40.8&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> who was not able to achieve weight reduction with exercise, fluid management, and semaglutide injections (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). He underwent successful IGB therapy with clinically meaningful weight loss as a bridge to transplant.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 51-year-old gentleman was transferred to our facility with profound cardiogenic shock (LVEF &#x0003c;15%) due to biventricular failure secondary to nonischemic cardiomyopathy managed previously with multiple MCS devices including Impella CP, Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and Impella 5.5. History is also significant chronic kidney disease stage 4 treated with peritoneal dialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy, hypertension, biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, diabetes mellitus, and obesity (BMI 36.5&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>The patient was ineligible for heart transplant candidacy due to high BMI (criteria &#x02265;35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and the decision was made to support the patient with HeartMate 3 (Abbott, Chicago, IL) (HM3) LVAD with hopes of optimization of his weight and volume status to achieve future transplant eligibility. The patient's weight loss was challenging despite lifestyle modification with regular exercise, vigilance on volume status, and implementation of anti-obesity pharmacotherapy with semaglutide weekly injections. Over the next 10 months, the patient's BMI continued to rise reaching as high as 40.8&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Given his cardiac disease and frail status, he was not deemed a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery. A multidisciplinary discussion was held, and the decision was made to proceed with IGB therapy in combination with lifestyle modification as a means to lose significant weight.</p><p>At the time of pre-operative evaluation, the LVAD showed adequate function, with a speed 5,700&#x02005;RPM, flow rate 5.7&#x02005;L/min, power 4.6 watts, pulsatility index of 3.2, and a mean arterial pressure of 81&#x02005;mmHg. He was taking warfarin 4&#x02005;mg daily and aspirin 81&#x02005;mg daily with an INR 1.8. The patient was admitted prior to the endoscopic intervention with the IGB to undergo IV heparin bridging. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) was continued with amiodarone 200&#x02005;mg OD, spironolactone 25&#x02005;mg OD, empagliflozin 10&#x02005;mg OD, and hydralazine 50&#x02005;mg TID with volume status controlled via dialysis.</p><p>IGB placement was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) using a standard adult gastroscope and following standard protocol for placement of the device. Heparin (12&#x02005;U/kg/hr) infusion was stopped 5&#x02005;hours prior to the procedure and resumed the following day post IGB placement. After undergoing upper endoscopy, the IGB, preloaded on a catheter in the deflated state, was introduced through the mouth and situated in the gastric body under endoscopic guidance. The IGB (ORBERA, Apollo Endosurgery, TX, USA) was instilled with 550&#x02005;ml of a solution of saline and methylene blue and was deployed in the stomach (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Perioperative measures were implemented to reduce post-procedure nausea and vomiting as well as mucosal injury from the balloon, following an established institution-directed pharmacotherapy protocol. LVAD function and hemodynamics remained stable throughout the procedure. He remained hospitalized for 2 days to reinitiate warfarin 4&#x02005;m BD and allow his INR to return to the therapeutic range of 2&#x02013;3 and had no concern for post operative bleeding.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Endoscopic placement and removal of intragastric balloon.

At the time of IGB removal the patient's BMI was 35.3&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

At 2 months post-transplant, he remains stable with delayed renal graft function and no signs of rejection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>There is robust evidence supporting the association between obesity and HF, however, weight management is an evolving challenge, particularly as new mechanical circulatory devices reshape the management of HF. LVAD serves as a bridge to transplant in many patients while waiting for a suitable donor match. However, LVAD support is associated with an increase in appetite, limited exercise tolerance and reduced metabolism, all leading to weight gain (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, patients with obesity supported by LVAD demonstrate an increased risk of right HF and acute kidney injury (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Achieving weight loss in LVAD patients is essential for hemodynamic optimization and improved outcomes, however, it is particularly challenging in this population due to decreased baseline exercise tolerance and device associated discomfort.</p><sec id="s3a"><label>3.1</label><title>Current weight management options for patients with LVAD</title><p>Lifestyle modification with diet and exercise, anti-obesity pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery have served as the main standard of interventions for patients with LVADs requiring weight loss. Studies focusing on exercise regimen and dietary modifications such as calorie restriction, intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets reveal modest improvements or mixed results (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This may be attributed to poor exercise tolerance and underlying cardiac metabolic derangement. The key barriers to conservative weight management therapies in HF patients are compliance and sustainability.</p><p>Lifestyle modification alone may result in mild to modest at most, weight loss. However, it is not sustainable long-term. The summit trial and other studies using GLP1 analogs have demonstrated a 12%&#x02013;21% weight loss in HFpEF patients (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Additionally, GLP1 mediated weight loss is also associated with a lower morbidity and functional improvements in 6MWT and quality of life (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, these medications are costly and remain a challenge for insurance coverage.</p><p>Bariatric surgery remains as one of the most effective weight loss interventions, showing benefit across all spectrums of patient populations, including those with HF. A metanalysis of bariatric procedures conducted on LVAD patients that included 14 studies and 29 patients, with 83% laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 17% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass showed a BMI reduction from 45.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6 to 31.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;19.3&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 47% of these patients were successfully transplanted (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, these results were not without risks: 39.3% patients had adverse events within 30 days including GI bleeding, infections and staple line leakage (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Bariatric surgeries in this patient population present heightened risk due to the interplay of factors including risks associated with anesthesia, anticoagulation, and procedural risks. Furthermore, bariatric surgery may not be deemed safe in certain patients with HF, and patients may not desire such invasive weight loss interventions.</p><p>In this context, EBTs are nonsurgical, less invasive and effective weight loss interventions that significantly gained momentum and popularity due to their effectiveness and safety profile. EBTs are traditionally categorized as space occupying, gastric remodeling, or small bowel focused interventions. One type of space occupying therapy with an intragastric balloon, entails use of a space occupying device and is performed with a brief endoscopic procedure. IGB therapy has shown excellent weight loss in the general population as well as in patients with HF. A case series of 2 patients reported a 10&#x02013;14.4% TWL reducing BMI to &#x02264;35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> over the 6-month therapy period to achieve transplant eligibility and eventually a successful HT. Successful IGB therapy in patients awaiting liver transplant has been reported, however, there are limited case reports and no large-scale studies reporting the use of IGB therapy for weight loss in patients with advanced HF with existing LVAD as a bridge to transplant eligibility (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><label>3.2</label><title>Transplant eligibility</title><p>The current UNOS guidelines advise against HT for patients with pre-transplant BMI &#x02265;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> due to difficulty finding suitable donors resulting in prolonged waitlist times and increased post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Weight loss is particularly difficult in patients with end-stage HF and existing LVADs due to functional limitations and volume overload despite aggressive diet control. This is exemplified by our patient, who adhered strictly to his diet and exercise regimen and used semaglutide for 6 months without significant weight loss. TWL of 12.4% achieved by our LVAD patient align closely with the average TWL of 12.2% reported for IGB use in the general population (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><label>3.3</label><title>Perioperative anticoagulation strategy</title><p>The use of aspirin and warfarin to prevent pump thrombosis in LVAD patients requires careful consideration due to the associated increased risk of intraoperative bleeding (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). While bariatric surgeries such as sleeve gastroplasty/gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric band, or biliopancreatic diversion yield greater total weight loss (&#x0003e;50% TWL), these invasive procedures pose increased intraoperative risk of bleeding in patients with LVADs taking anticoagulants. Hence, IGBs may be preferred due to lower bleeding risks associated with endoscopic procedures for which anticoagulation is not an absolute contraindication (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). After multidisciplinary consultation, our patient was admitted to discontinue warfarin and undergo heparin bridging 2 days before the procedure. Post-IGB placement, we restarted systemic anticoagulant therapy following a standard protocol. Monitoring with aPTT or anti-Xa was implemented to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation while overlapping with oral vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) until target INR of 2&#x02013;3 was reached. Continuous infusion of systemic anticoagulation was stopped when INR was above 1.8. Monitoring for bleeding and thrombosis was performed before patient discharge with daily CBC and lactate dehydrogenase.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><label>3.4</label><title>Intraoperative LVAD management</title><p>It is considered safe to administer general anesthesia in LVAD patients provided adequate care is taken to monitor hemodynamic shifts as LVAD function is sensitive to preload and afterload changes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Inadequate volume optimization can decrease preload leading to inadequate LV filling, while the anesthetic agent may induce vasodilation, resulting in decreased afterload and increased LV offloading. Both factors can lead to LV collapse and may require speed reduction, fluids, or vasopressin. RV failure may lead to a similar outcome and may be indirectly observed as a decrease in CVP and hypotension despite medical therapies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Additionally, intraoperative patient position should be considered to prevent a mechanical kink in the outflow graft, accidental disconnection, or preload changes. A multidisciplinary team of individuals experienced in managing LVAD complications should be present during and after the procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>EBTs such as IGB therapy are nonsurgical and less invasive weight loss interventions that may provide a safe and effective alternative for patients with LVAD therapy who are not qualified or deemed fit for bariatric surgery. Given that this particular patient population requires anticoagulation and inotrope support, the low invasiveness of IGB placement and removal enhances its appeal as a weight loss option in this group of limited patients.
