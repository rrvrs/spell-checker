Moreover, pulmonary atelectasis symptoms can vary from a mild increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO&#x02082;) and hypoxemia to type one respiratory failure [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Equally important, the causes might be increased pulmonary secretion, high mucus viscosity, airway obstruction weak cough reflex and decreased diaphragmatic ability [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Atelectasis is often caused by sputum obstructing airways. Cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis mucus include high levels of extracellular DNA from degenerating leucocytes and epithelial debris [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lung secretions become more viscous and stickier with DNA. CF airway opening with rhDNase (recombinant human DNase) is reported to be successful [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. DNase may also work in atelectasis-related illnesses since bronchial secretions and mucus plugs contain a lot of DNA [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>There are mainly two types of atelectasis: obstructive and non-obstructive. Atelectasis is caused by airway obstructions such as neoplasms or mucus plugs, preventing air from reaching alveoli and triggering collapse [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Non-obstructive atelectasis can result from external forces like pleural effusion, pneumothorax, positive pressure accumulation, or increased alveolar surface tension, particularly in acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. One type of atelectasis is lobar, when a lung lobe collapses completely, while the other is linear, where the collapse is button-like along the diaphragm [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In rounded atelectasis, a rounded mass with thickened pleura is found in chronic pleural effusion and disorders such as asbestos exposure [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Knowledge of such types and their causes is crucial for treatment and detection, especially before and after surgeries when atelectasis is common [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>To address this problem, multiple solutions were invented, and one among them is dornase alpha (Pulmozyme), which is a recombinant human DNase. DNase, an enzyme produced in minute amounts in salivary glands and pancreas, reduces sputum viscosity by breaking down extracellular DNA strands. Dornase alpha, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved recombinant human DNase, aids cystic fibrosis patients by reducing secretion viscosity and improving lung function [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The use of dornase alfa in non-cystic fibrosis patients may relieve atelectasis and secretions. Patients with critical illness or chronic lung diseases have higher DNA levels in their sputum, leading to increased viscosity. Increased sputum viscosity can cause mucus blockage, resulting in lung collapse or atelectasis. It is being used highly in non-cystic fibrosis mechanically ventilated patients with pulmonary atelectasis in nebulization form [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, dornase alpha can be considered as an alternative therapy when standard therapy fails with the addition of a clearance maneuver via manual resuscitator [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and guided by the Modified Radiological Assisted Score (MRAS) [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].&#x000a0;For instance, Meireles&#x000a0;et al. (2021) found dornase alpha to be significantly associated with improvement in oxygenation as well as radiological findings among patients with lung injury related to ventilators [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, Daiya&#x000a0;and Sierra (2023) found no association and improvement in the function of the respiratory system, but a reduction in length of hospital stay was observed following dornase alpha dosage among non-cystic fibrosis pediatric patients, indicating its limited efficacy [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, a more robust study with a large sample size is needed to determine the efficacy of dornase alpha in non-cystic fibrosis pediatric patients.</p><p>The rationale for this study is that there is a scarcity of evidence on nebulization of dornase alpha through an artificial airway in mechanically ventilated non-cystic fibrosis pediatric patients with persistent pulmonary atelectasis. The study aimed to explore the efficacy of dornase alpha nebulization on persistent atelectasis in non-cystic fibrosis patients with and without an artificial airway. Moreover, the study also compared the cost-effectiveness and length of ICU stay between the two treatment modalities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design</p><p>This was a retrospective study, and it was conducted on all pediatric patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of King Fahad Medical City. It was a single center-based study.</p><p>Study setting and duration</p><p>The study was carried out on pediatric patients in PICU between February 2020 and October 2023.</p><p>Recruitment of study participants</p><p>The eligibility criteria for the patients enrolled in the current study were non-cystic fibrosis pediatric patients with or without respiratory support and persistent pulmonary atelectasis from February 16, 2020 until October 10, 2023.&#x000a0;The patients were recruited from the electronic database of King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) through the EPIC research module system after applying the proposed criteria.</p><p>Inclusion Criteria</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: pediatric patients who had pulmonary atelectasis for more than 48 hours; patients who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units; and patients who received dornase alpha treatment for atelectasis.</p><p>Exclusion Criteria</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: cystic fibrosis (CF) patients; a patient who is not admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit;&#x000a0;patient with non-persistent pulmonary atelectasis (less than 48 hours); and patients with missing or incomplete data.</p><p>Data collection procedures and tools</p><p>The data was collected from the electronic database of KFMC through the EPIC research module system. In this study, the authors monitored patients who had lung collapse during their stay in the PICU for more than 48 hours and underwent treatment with dornase alpha via nebulization. However, all patients were treated with Ventolin 2.5 mg as a standard therapy to bronchodilate and facilitate secretion removal. Also, other treatment modalities were adopted, such as manual positive pressure ventilation and chest physiotherapy.&#x000a0;Moreover, additional therapies targeting atelectasis, like Ventolin, Atrovent, 3% hypertonic saline, and acetylcysteine, were also employed.&#x000a0;Active diagnosis, chronic diagnosis and disease background were documented as per the PICU daily rounds note. The data was divided into two groups between pediatric patients who were treated with dornase alpha and other treatments other than dornase alpha (non-dornase alpha group). All the data mentioned were separately collected and added for both groups. Moreover, airway status, endotracheal size and level, and respiratory support (mechanical ventilator, high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation) were monitored along with the parameters of the ventilator (e.g., a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO&#x02082;), dynamic compliance, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)), and changes were recorded within the time window of the atelectasis. Patient ICU length of stay in days, 28-day outcome, and other physiological parameters like central venous pressure and SpO&#x02082;/FiO&#x02082; ratio were documented to determine the cost-effectiveness of the treatment.</p><p>The electronic chest radiographs were taken, and an atelectasis assessment was conducted via the Modified Radiological Assisted Score (MRAS), which is measured as follows: each lobe (including the lingula) is scored 0-3 (0=normal, 1=plate or minor infiltrate, 2=moderate atelectasis, 3=total atelectasis). The scores of the six lobes are then summed to give an 18-point score (0-18). The dynamic compliance was determined, such as the score of 0.00-1.00 (severe), 1.01-2.50 (moderate), 2.51-5.00 (mild), 5.01-10.00 (normal), and 10.01 or above (increased compliance).</p><p>The outcome measures of the study were improvement in atelectasis determined by MRAS before treatment, MRAS&#x000a0;after treatment, and more specifically, the mean change in MRAS between both the groups. Moreover, the lung collapse resolution was computed using pre- and post-treatment MRAS scores.&#x000a0;If the post-treatment MRAS score reduction is more than 50%, it was labeled as a complete resolution; for MRAS score changes around 50%, it was taken as a partial resolution, and other patients with MRAS score changes of 1 or 2 or less than 50% improvement in MRAS score were labeled as no resolution. The collapse resolution outcome is cross-tabulated with PEEP change to determine that the increase in PEEP score played a role in the resolution of lung collapse.&#x000a0;The cost-effectiveness was also determined using measures such as length of hospital stay and 28-day outcomes. The lesser the stay and transfer from ICU facilities to ward, home, and discharge would be considered as cost-effective or vice versa.&#x000a0;The data was carefully handled by the involved authors to ensure transparency and validity. The data was double-checked and entered in a main data analysis to determine the efficacy of dornase alpha.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>The data was collected in an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) sheet. The statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics version 28 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The continuous variables such as&#x000a0;age (days), collapse duration (days), mean central venous pressure (CVP) value, mean change MRAS, FiO&#x02082;, mean PEEP value, PEEP change, and duration of dornase dose (days), were represented as mean+SD. The categorical variables, such as gender, life status, airway status, endotracheal tube (ETT) level, affected lung lobes, dynamic lung compliance, types of respiratory support, types of atelectasis collapse, background history of patients, outcomes at the 28th day, and medications list (control group) were represented as frequency and percentage.&#x000a0;The t-test was applied to compare MRAS scores (pre-treatment and post-treatment) between the two groups separately. The independent t-test was applied between both the groups to determine the efficacy of dornase alpha against mean MRAS change. The effect size was also determined using Cohen&#x02019;s d statistics at a 95% confidence interval. Moreover, the impact of dornase alpha on physiological and respiratory parameters, such as secretion amount and color (before and after), was also determined using the chi-square test. Hence, the chi-square was also used to determine the cost-effectiveness by cross-tabbing both groups with length of hospital stay and 28th-day outcomes, lung lobe affected (category groups), dynamic compliance, and mean change in MRAS score.</p><p>Efforts to reduce bias</p><p>Owing to the retrospective study design, propensity score analysis was performed to adjust the baseline characteristics among two treatment cohorts. Propensity score analysis was applied to reduce selection bias and indication bias due to study design. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed taking MRAS improvement as the dependent variable and age, gender, airway status, PEEP changes, dynamic lung compliance, CVP changes, the ratio of FiO&#x02082; by SpO&#x02082;, and types of atelectasis collapse and collapse duration to determine the role of potential confounders in the improvement of MRAS. A p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was taken to determine the statistical significance.</p><p>Ethical considerations</p><p>The&#x000a0;study was carried out after taking approval from King Fahad Medical City (IRB-Registration Number with KACST, KSA: H-01-R-012, OHRP/NIH, USA: IRB00010471, Federal Wide Assurance NIH, USA: FVVA00018774). The anonymity and confidentiality of the patient&#x02019;s data were assured. The data was handled only for analysis and research purposes for the benefit of patients. The data of the patients were de-identified before using it in research.&#x000a0;The authors tried their best to meet the&#x000a0;Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines while reporting the findings of this cross-sectional study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 275 patients participated in the study (dornase group=132, non-dornase group=143).

MRAS score changes averaged 5.59+2.60, suggesting a considerable change (p=0.052). Dornase alpha was given to pediatric patients for a mean of 5.58 days. The gender distribution is equal, with the patient population made up of 146 (53.6%) male infants and 129 (46.4%) female infants. The majority of the 205 patients (74.54%) survived after treatment in both the groups. Dornase and non-dornase groups were tested for efficacy, and the dornase group (n=132) had a mean MRAS score change of 6.08+2.69, while the non-dornase group (n=143) had a MRAS score change of 5.14+2.4. The dornase group had a larger mean change than the non-dornase group with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 2.568, point estimation of 0.364 (95% CI: 0.126 to 0.603)), indicating a significant difference between groups (p=0.03). Dornase treatment affected physiological and respiratory parameters significantly, with improved secretion and color nearing normal physiology (p&#x0003c;0.05). Patient hospital stays and discharges differed significantly between the two groups. Notably, more patients in the non-dornase group showed better outcomes after 28 days (p&#x0003c;0.001), and the length of ICU stay was considerably shorter for pediatric patients in the non-dornase alpha group&#x000a0;than those in the dornase group, potentially decreasing the care costs (p=0.007).</p><p>Owing to the retrospective study design, multivariate regression analysis was performed after propensity score analysis of patients treated with dornase and not with dornase to reduce selection and indication bias. The multivariate analysis results suggested that dornase alpha does not independently improve MRAS scores in patients with persistent atelectasis, adjusting for potential confounders. Outcome data available show that gender, as well as the degree of atelectasis collapse, may play a marginal role. Clinical and demographic variables did not show other significant associations with MRAS improvement (p&#x0003e;0.05). The implication of these findings reinforces the necessity of further research, possibly with prospective study designs, to validate the role of dornase alpha and to reduce the probability of potential residual biases.</p><p>Dornase alpha showed statistical significance in improving MRAS and respiratory function with a moderate effect (Cohen's d = 0.364 (95% CI: 0.126 to 0.603)) with a p-value equal to 0.03 among pediatric non-cystic fibrosis patients suffering from persistent atelectasis. The results are consistent with the study of Meireles et al. (2021) [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The authors found in their case reports of two cases that a one-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl showed significant improvement while treated with dornase alpha. The authors also found similar improvement in radiological findings and respiratory parameters, for example, change in secretion color and amount and change in MRAS score after treatment (p&#x0003c;0.05) [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, &#x000d6;zyaz&#x00131;c&#x00131; et al. (2022) also observed significant clinical efficacy and improvement in respiratory function with a resolution of atelectasis in a 12-day-old male infant when treated with dornase alpha. The infant was admitted after one day of heart surgery due to a complaint of atelectasis; the treatment was successful with dornase alpha [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Llaque-Quiroz&#x000a0;et al. (2023), in their retrospective cross-sectional study, compared the efficacy of dornase alpha with fibro-bronchoscopy among children suffering from congenital heart disease. The authors found both treatments as statistically significant and effective in reducing atelectasis assessment scores with reporting of similar side effects among both treatment options. However, the authors also claimed that dornase is considered a suitable alternative therapeutic option against more invasive procedures [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The results are aligned with the findings of this present study. If critically analyzed, most of the evidence is based on less robust research designs such as case reports and retrospective observational studies. Therefore, more robust study designs are recommended in future research to validate the findings. However, the results of this research were based on the effect size estimation of Cohen's d-test to determine the consistency and validity of the results. Cohen's d value of 2.568 with a statistically significant p-value (p&#x0003c;0.05) showed there is consistency and validity of results, which ensured the authenticity of the study, but a more robust randomized controlled trial is needed get either a large effect size or poised contrasting point to challenge the evidence.</p><p>On the contrary, the existing literature also posed contrasting points of view on the aspect of clinical efficacy of dornase alpha in non-cystic fibrosis pediatric patients with atelectasis. Daiya&#x000a0;and Sierra (2023), in their single-center retrospective study, found no statistically significant association of dornase alpha in improving respiratory parameters, observing no significant change in respiratory parameters such as FiO&#x02082; or oxygenation indexes [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The results are a complete contrast to what we observed in our single-center retrospective study at King Fahad Medical City among pediatric patients. While critically evaluating and comparing both studies, there are some questions that need to be considered because Daiya et al. (2023) compare these outcomes only after 24 hours of dornase administration, but this study considers these outcome parameters for up to 28 days after the administration of dornase alpha, indicating more authenticity in the results. The contrasting results can be addressed only by prospective cohort studies with sufficient follow-up of outcomes. Therefore, future researchers are encouraged to focus on this critical point of discussion.</p><p>In a literature review, Thornby&#x000a0;et al. (2014) found in their review, which included eight clinical trials and 12 case reports between 1946 and 2014 from Medline/PubMed, that the synthesized evidence showed that dornase alpha is a viable and labeled treatment option for treating non-cystic fibrosis pediatric patients with pulmonary atelectasis after the failure of conventional therapy. The review indicated dornase alpha as a viable and effective therapeutic option&#x000a0;when conventional therapeutics failed due to limited post-conventional therapy options available&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This point raises the discussion of whether it is only used after conventional treatment failure or can be used as a choice of treatment. This study did not answer this point, but the authors of the current study compared both treatments and found statistically significant and better effects in dornase-treated groups. However, this is a retrospective research design, which may not be sufficient to decide on the choice of treatment. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial is needed to determine the choice of treatment option, considering both treatment options as equally comparable and ensuring balanced baseline characteristics among both groups.</p><p>In this current study, the length of ICU stays and discharges differed significantly. Notably, more patients in the non-dornase group showed better outcomes after 28 days (p&#x0003c;0.001), and the length of ICU stay was considerably shorter for pediatric patients in the non-dornase alpha group than in the dornase group, potentially decreasing care costs (p=0.007). Similarly, Vettleson&#x000a0;et al. (2023) applied dornase alpha in pediatric bronchitis patients and found that these patients spend more time on ventilation and extended PICU time as compared to standard treatment group patients [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Porter et al. (2024), in a randomized controlled trial, compared dornase alpha with the best available care group (conventional treatment). They found no significant difference between the length of ICU stay and time on oxygenation between both groups (p&#x0003e;0.05) [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These results showed that dornase alpha may be beneficial, but their results on reducing length of ICU stays, oxygenation time, and overall cost-effectiveness are still inconclusive. But the overall impact is that non-dornase alpha treatment options are more cost-effective as compared to dornase alpha treatment. The results show conflicting evidence. Future studies are recommended to explore more cost-related factors to determine the exact cost of the treatment options and more research is also needed on determining the cost of dornase alpha for non-cystic fibrosis pediatric patients with pulmonary fibrosis because current literature is mostly presented in context to the COVID-19 or systemic inflammation-related conditions.</p><p>The study is retrospective in design, which may inherently involve selection or information bias&#x000a0;although data is double-checked and handled with care to avoid misinformation that may&#x000a0;induce publication bias. The standardized tests and techniques were used in the data collection and analysis. The modified radiological assessment score was used to determine the treatment effectiveness, which is trustworthy and standardized. The respiratory and physiological parameters were also considered in the analysis to observe further improvement in respiratory function after dornase alpha treatment. Some of the data is also missing, which may induce results reporting bias, but the data was excluded to prevent information bias.</p><p>The current literature is mainly based on retrospective observational and case reports; there is a need for a more robust randomized controlled trial to determine a large effect size to validate the findings.&#x000a0;Moreover, prospective cohort or randomized controlled trial studies with sufficient follow-up of outcomes are also needed to get a comprehensively long-term, at least 28-day outcome data for dornase and conventional treatments, which is one of the strengths of this study. The randomized controlled trial also helps to determine the choice of treatment option while considering both treatment options as equally parallel or comparable, ensuring baseline characteristics balance among both the groups to consider either of the treatments as a treatment of choice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dornase alpha did not independently increase MRAS scores in pediatric patients with persistent atelectasis, controlling for selection, indication bias, and confounding variables. The observed differences in MRAS improvement in the initial analysis were most likely due to baseline differences between the dornase and non-dornase groups. Male infants had twice the chances of increasing MRAS scores than female infants, suggesting marginally significant predictors. MRAS improvement was not significantly affected by age, airway status, duration of collapse, central venous pressure mean trends, PEEP changes, or dynamic compliance; they did not predict MRAS improvement. These results highlight the need for studies to reduce selection bias and confounding to achieve valid results. Dornase alpha may be a promising clinical treatment option due to its moderate effect size; however, its cost is&#x000a0;higher than conventional therapy. But without a controlled, balanced, prospective longitudinal study, it is difficult to evaluate the efficacy or cost implications of dornase alpha in resolving persistent atelectasis in pediatric patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
