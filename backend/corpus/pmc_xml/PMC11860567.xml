Analyses have shown that CIT is present in processed foods in significantly lower concentrations than in unprocessed materials. Modified forms of CIT arising during food processing may provide an explanation for the discrepancy. This study deals with the thermal stability of CIT and the formation of reaction products of CIT with carbohydrates, followed by toxicological evaluations using cell culture models. HPLC-HRMS degradation curves of CIT heated in different matrix model systems were recorded, and the formation of decarboxycitrinin (DCIT), the main degradation product, was quantified. Additionally, chemical structures of reaction products of CIT with carbohydrates were tentatively identified using MS/MS spectra and stable isotope labelling. Subsequently, the degradation of CIT during biscuit baking was studied, and carbohydrate-bound forms of CIT were detected after enzymatic starch digestion. The formation of DCIT could explain the majority of CIT degradation, but, depending on the process, covalent binding to carbohydrates can also be highly relevant. Cytotoxicity of DCIT in IHKE-cells was found to be lower compared to CIT, while the toxicity as well as the intestinal metabolism of carbohydrate-bound CIT was not evaluated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>citrinin</kwd><kwd>mycotoxin</kwd><kwd>food</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd><kwd>matrix binding</kwd><kwd>modified mycotoxin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</funding-source><award-id>HU 730/14-1</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, HU 730/14-1.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Key Contribution"><title>Key Contribution</title><p>The thermal stability of citrinin (CIT) and the formation of reaction products of CIT with carbohydrates has been investigated in factorial design-based baking experiments.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-toxins-17-00086"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The mycotoxin citrinin (CIT, <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) is primarily found in cereals and other plant-based products such as spices, beans, fruit, nuts, or olives [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2017, occurrence data was largely extended by a comprehensive study in which more than 1000 food samples were analyzed for CIT. One result of this study was that cereals, and cereal products in particular, were contaminated with CIT [<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cereal products, especially baked goods, are important staple foods worldwide [<xref rid="B7-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Due to their consumption quantities, cereal products also have the greatest impact as a source of mycotoxins when comparing different foods, making them a key factor in CIT exposure [<xref rid="B8-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>CIT exists in two tautomeric forms, with a 3:2 equilibrium between the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>- and <italic toggle="yes">o</italic>-tautomers in the solid state at room temperature (<xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B9-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. CIT is produced by different genera of <italic toggle="yes">Penicillium</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Monascus</italic>, and is of toxic relevance primarily due to its nephrotoxicity, which has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro [<xref rid="B11-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Cereal manufacturing can include different types of physical or chemical processing such as sorting, sieving, washing, steeping, milling, and alkaline or heat treatment. Each step can affect the mycotoxin concentration in the final product. Processing steps that apply thermal energy or chemical treatment may also have an impact on the chemical structure of the toxin, leading to chemical modification of the toxin itself or its reaction with food constituents to generate matrix-bound forms [<xref rid="B8-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In a broad-based study on the occurrence of CIT in food, it was observed that the CIT concentrations in processed cereal products (1.0&#x02013;5.7 &#x003bc;g/kg, mean value of all samples above the limit of quantification: 2.2 &#x003bc;g/kg) were, on average, tenfold lower than in unprocessed cereal products (1.1&#x02013;155 &#x003bc;g/kg, mean value of all samples above the limit of quantification: 20.9 &#x003bc;g/kg) [<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This large discrepancy cannot be fully explained by CIT removal due to physical processes but suggests that chemical modifications of CIT occur during manufacturing, leading to various forms of modified CIT that cannot be detected using conventional analytical methods.</p><p>Modified forms of mycotoxins pose a fundamental problem in the analysis of mycotoxins, as they can contribute to the underestimation of mycotoxins in food and feed [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The terminology related to modified mycotoxins has not been consistent in the past, with synonyms such as masked, conjugated, hidden, or bound forms not being used systematically [<xref rid="B14-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B24-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This article will adopt the common definition of modified mycotoxins according to Rychlik et al. [<xref rid="B14-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is also used by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [<xref rid="B26-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A distinction is made between chemically modified mycotoxins, which can arise in thermal and non-thermal food processing, and matrix-associated mycotoxins, where a distinction is made between covalently and non-covalently bound forms [<xref rid="B14-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>There are examples of chemically modified mycotoxins that can be either more or less toxic than the parent compound. However, matrix-associated, covalently bound mycotoxins pose a particular problem. When bound to macromolecules, these compounds lose their direct bioavailability. However, the parent mycotoxin or small molecule derivatives thereof may be released during enzymatic digestion in the intestinal system, as was shown for the glucosidically bound T-2 and HT-2 toxins [<xref rid="B27-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. From an analytical point of view, matrix-associated mycotoxins are also challenging, as they must first be liberated by chemical or enzymatic treatment before analysis [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B22-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B28-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In cereal products, reactions of mycotoxins with carbohydrates generating matrix-associated mycotoxins are particularly important, as the proportion of carbohydrates is manyfold higher than that of proteins. Examples of such reactions are the formation of carbohydrate esters of fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> and ochratoxin A via their free carboxylic acid functional group. In the case of fumonisin B<sub>1</sub>, the possible matrix binding through esterification was demonstrated in model experiments. In the case of ochratoxin A, this was also observed during coffee roasting in addition to model experiments [<xref rid="B30-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Binding of fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> to glucose via the amino group of the toxin is also possible [<xref rid="B32-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, matrix-associated forms covalently bound to carbohydrates of T-2 toxin have been detected in both model experiments and baked biscuits. Unlike in the case of fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> and ochratoxin A, however, binding to carbohydrates does not occur via a carboxyl or amine group since the T-2 toxin lacks these functional groups. Instead, binding happens via addition to the double bond, which also irreversibly alters the chemical structure of the toxin [<xref rid="B33-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, oligoglycosides of deoxynivalenol have been described for cereal-based products [<xref rid="B35-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, covalently bound forms of mycotoxins can be formed via reactions with the thiol, amine, or hydroxy groups of proteins [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Due to the structural similarity between CIT and OTA (both molecules possess a carboxyl group), reactions with hydroxy groups of carbohydrates and, thus, the formation of matrix-bound forms are also conceivable for CIT.</p><p>Studies investigating the degradation of CIT are limited and, so far, solely performed with the pure compound. Model experiments heating CIT in solution at different pH values and temperatures showed the formation of dimerization products (dicitrinin A&#x02013;D) and degradation products such as CIT H1, CIT H2, phenol A, phenol A acid, and decarboxycitrinin (DCIT). Studies on the cytotoxicity of these compounds revealed that CIT H1 exhibited higher cytotoxicity in HeLa cells than CIT, while CIT H2 was less cytotoxic. Dicitrinin A was described as moderately active in the NS-1 cytotoxicity assay [<xref rid="B38-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, most of the degradation products described above were only observed in model experiments without other food constituents as matrix. In 2012, the EFSA stated that there is insufficient data available on the occurrence of CIT in food and feed and that the possibility of matrix-associated CIT caused by food or feed processing has not yet been investigated [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, we could, for the first time, show that CIT reacts with amino compounds, such as gluten, during thermal processing, confirming that this mycotoxin can react with macromolecules [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The aim of this study was to investigate whether citrinin can also react with carbohydrates. Starting from experiments with model compounds, we studied the formation of starch-bound CIT and monitored its formation during biscuit baking as thermal food processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-17-00086"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-17-00086"><title>2.1. Reactions of CIT with Different Carbohydrates</title><p>Different matrix model compounds were used to investigate reactions between CIT and carbohydrates. Thereby, methyl-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside was used as a model compound for starch since the anomeric C-atom is protected, whereas all other hydroxy groups are available for potential reactions with CIT comparable with starch. Reducing sugars were represented by &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose, while non-reducing sugars and disaccharides were represented by <sc>d</sc>-sucrose. In a control experiment, CIT was heated under the same conditions without the addition of a model compound. Additionally, the matrix model compounds were heated without CIT to rule out potential interferences with formed reaction products of CIT. Detectable signals from the heated pure model compounds eluted within the first two minutes, confirming that interferences could be excluded.</p><p>Pure, water-free CIT is stable at temperatures up to 120 &#x000b0;C, as shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.

This also results in the formation of several degradation products, including DCIT, phenol A acid, dicitrinin A, dicitrinin C, citrinin H1, and two structurally unknown degradation products with mass-to-charge ratios (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic>) of <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 395.1856 ([M+H]<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 425.1960 ([M+H]<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), which are present in relatively high amounts based on signal intensity [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The addition of model compounds also strongly affects the CIT stability, resulting in a faster degradation of CIT compared to the control (<xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>A direct comparison of HPLC-HRMS data for heated pure CIT and CIT heated together with &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose is shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and revealed the formation of new peaks at a retention time window between 4.5&#x02013;5.7 min in the presence of the reducing sugar.

The CH<sub>2</sub>O loss is a characteristic feature of glucose and other sugars [<xref rid="B41-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and is identified as the X-fragment according to the Domon&#x02212;Costello nomenclature [<xref rid="B41-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B44-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The fragment ion <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 259.1314 also originates from the sugar fragmentation, as confirmed by the <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose experiments. The fragment ion <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 219.1001 results from the cleavage of a large part of the sugar (-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). This is further confirmed by the experiment with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose, where all five cleaved C-atoms were isotope-labeled, resulting in <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 220.1036 with only one <sup>13</sup>C remaining. It is assumed that the cleavage occurs at C-6 of the sugar in an analogous way, as described in [<xref rid="B42-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 207.1003 fragment corresponds to a CIT fragment in which the entire sugar moiety has been cleaved off (-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).

Additionally, the experiment with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose showed that all <sup>13</sup>C-labeled atoms are cleaved off. This sugar cleavage is also described as a typical fragmentation reaction [<xref rid="B41-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In summary, the product ion spectra of <bold>B</bold> thus show the CIT fragment (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 207.1015), along with the neutral loss of &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose minus two water molecules (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and characteristic glucose fragmentations [<xref rid="B41-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The recorded product ion spectra of <bold>A</bold> (<xref rid="app1-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="app">Figure S2, Supplementary Information</xref>) are comparable to those of <bold>B</bold>, showing the CIT fragment (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 207.1013) and the same characteristic sugar fragmentations. No differences in the fragment spectra could be observed between the different isobaric peaks of <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>.</p><p>Structurally, CIT is related to ochratoxin A: Both mycotoxins are aromatic polyketides and possess a reactive carboxylic acid group. As already described previously [<xref rid="B31-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the carboxylic acid group of ochratoxin A can react with the hydroxy groups of &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (preferably with the primary hydroxy group at C-6 of &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose) to form the corresponding esters. Accordingly, a reaction between CIT and &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose would theoretically result in a reaction product with the mass of 412.1364 Da for C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>10</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 413.1442 ([M+H]<sup>+</sup>) or <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 435.1262 ([M+Na]<sup>+</sup>) in positive ionization mode. However, this could not be observed or detected only in traces (the maximum peak area for <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 435.1262 was 2.0E+04 counts, and [M+H]<sup>+</sup> was not observed at all after a 10 min heating time at 160 &#x000b0;C). Instead, as described above, mainly <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 351.1445 ([M+H]<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) (reaction products <bold>B</bold>) was visible, with a maximum peak area of 2.4E+06 counts. When comparing the sum formulas of the theoretically expected reaction product (C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>10</sub>) and the observed reaction products (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), it is clear that a loss of CO<sub>2</sub> and a further loss of water must have taken place during the reaction. The verification experiments with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-labeled CIT and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-labeled &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose, along with the observed reaction products, showed that a loss of CO<sub>2</sub> could not have resulted from the &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose itself. Furthermore, none of the three labeled <sup>13</sup>C-atoms of the CIT depicted in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> were cleaved off. The most likely explanation is that the carboxyl group of the CIT was cleaved off, but at the same time, this group would be involved in an ester-forming reaction with one of the hydroxy groups of &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose.</p><p>Indeed, we propose that the ester formation is the first step of the reaction of CIT with &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose, leading to the formation of a &#x003b2;-keto ester. This process results in a strong positive partial charge of C-6 of the &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose molecule. The next step presumably involves cyclization and the elimination of CO<sub>2</sub> from the molecule. The elimination of another water molecule to form <bold>B</bold> can occur either from the CIT or through the loss of a hydroxy group from the sugar, with the latter seeming more likely. Reaction products <bold>A</bold> are compounds in which only CO<sub>2</sub> is eliminated after ester formation, without the additional loss of a water molecule compared to <bold>B</bold>. The formation of different isomers of <bold>A</bold> (and <bold>B</bold>) can arise from the reaction of different hydroxy groups of the sugar with CIT during the ester formation, with the primary OH-group at C-6 probably being the most favored (structure in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the loss of different OH-groups in the reaction step leading to <bold>B</bold> can result in an even higher number of isomers. Therefore, the postulated reaction pathway in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> illustrates only one possible example, in which CIT reacts with the primary hydroxy group at C-6 of the &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose. Unfortunately, structural elucidation of the resulting reaction products by NMR and confirmation of the postulated reaction pathways was not possible due to low yields and the complexity of the resulting reaction products.</p><p>When CIT is heated with <sc>d</sc>-sucrose, <bold>B</bold> in particular is detectable, similar to the experiment with &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose. In addition, small amounts of <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 513.1976 ([M+H]<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) are formed. The reaction pathway is presumed to be identical to the reaction pathway shown above (<xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The fact that mainly <bold>B</bold> is detected indicates that a glucose molecule is either already split off during heating or that the reaction products <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 513.1976 are unstable in the ESI source. Additional confirmation of the reaction between CIT and &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-sucrose was again obtained by repeating the experiments with stable isotope-labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-CIT, and, as in the case for &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose, the reaction was confirmed.</p><p>Methyl-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside was used as a model compound for starch. It is notable that the CIT degradation with the addition of this model compound was overall stronger than for the other model compounds investigated (see <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, reaction products could not be identified with the HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF method used, or only in traces. For this reason, CIT was heated again with starch itself instead of the model compound. Since the direct detection of reaction products from CIT and macromolecules is not possible due to the high molecular weight, the first goal was to develop a method in which monomer or oligomer subunits of the macromolecule bound to the mycotoxin can be detected. For this purpose, the samples were enzymatically treated with &#x003b1;-amylase. The experiments were carried out in triplicate and, as a control, starch was heated without the addition of CIT and then enzymatically digested as well. Possible reaction products were identified using a software-based approach via MetaboScape (Bruker), similar to the approach described in Br&#x000fc;ckner et al. [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>As a first step, the data was processed using an intensity threshold of 10.000 cps for MS<sup>1</sup>

After applying the filter criteria, five of these features remained as possible reaction products of CIT with starch (<xref rid="toxins-17-00086-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Three features were already known from the heating experiments with &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose and <sc>d</sc>-sucrose: two isomers of C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 369.1548/ 369.1546, retention time of 4.95 min and 5.16 min, reaction products <bold>A</bold>), as well as <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 351.1440 (<bold>B</bold>). The remaining two features showed <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 531.2080 ([M+H]<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>13</sub>) and <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 693.2749 ([M+H]<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>44</sub>O<sub>18</sub>), which correspond to CIT bound to a di- and trisaccharide, respectively. In these cases, the starch was most probably not completely digested to the glucose monomer, so that CIT is bound, for instance, to an &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-maltose (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 531.2080) or &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-maltotriose (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 693.2749). Both products were formed by the loss of one CO<sub>2</sub> and one H<sub>2</sub>O-molecule, as described for <bold>A</bold>. In contrast to the model experiments with &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose and <sc>d</sc>-sucrose, the intensities of the observed reaction products <bold>B</bold> were lower than for <bold>A</bold>.

Reactions and Degradation of CIT in Starch-Rich Baking Products</title><p>The model experiments showed that CIT can react with sugars as well as larger macromolecules such as starch. Thus, the next step was to investigate the reactions of CIT under food-processing conditions such as baking. To exclude any chemical changes in the mycotoxin due to fermentation or the effect of baking powder, a simple non-yeast biscuit recipe, based on Kuchenbuch et al., was used to investigate the degradation of CIT under realistic food processing conditions [<xref rid="B34-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Initially, dough C had a water content of 25%, with a residual moisture content of 19% after low-temperature baking and 22% after high-temperature baking. For the high-temperature conditions, the core temperature reached 100 &#x000b0;C after 6.8 min, slightly earlier than under low-temperature conditions, where 13.1 min were needed to reach 100 &#x000b0;C. However, the core temperature of 100 &#x000b0;C was maintained for 6.9 min under low-temperature conditions, which is more than twice as long as under high-temperature conditions (3.2 min). The samples were analyzed both for extractable and starch-bound forms of CIT using two different procedures (discussed below under <xref rid="sec2dot3-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="sec">Section 2.3</xref> and <xref rid="sec2dot4-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="sec">Section 2.4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-17-00086"><title>2.3.

The determined levels of CIT and DCIT, reported as CIT equivalents and normalized to the dry mass of the biscuit, are depicted in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="app1-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="app">Figure S3 (Supplementary Information)</xref>.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the low-temperature conditions resulted in slightly higher CIT-degradation rates, with residual CIT levels ranging from 68 to 86% in the baked doughs A&#x02013;F.

Matrix Binding of CIT During Biscuit-Making</title><p>To identify starch-bound CIT that may be present in biscuits due to thermal processing, the starch was enzymatically digested. Only the samples from the low-temperature conditions were subjected to starch digestion, as these exhibited higher overall degradation rates. To improve the yield of the enzymatic hydrolysis, the samples were treated with amyloglucosidase from <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus niger</italic> to hydrolyze exo-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-(1-4)- and branch point &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-(1-6)-linkages after &#x003b1;-amylase digestion [<xref rid="B45-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Unfortunately, quantification of the reaction products was not possible due to missing analytical standards. To provide a point of reference, the calibration for CIT was used for comparison, although it is assumed that the ionization and fragmentation efficiency for <bold>A</bold> is lower. It was confirmed that <bold>A</bold> was formed during biscuit-baking.

Based on the recorded signal intensities, the amount of matrix-associated CIT detected in the baked biscuits seems to be lower compared to the DCIT formed and the CIT recovered after baking. Differences in the amount of matrix-associated CIT formed during biscuit-making are minimal for all doughs tested. For the biscuit doughs A, B, C, and E, it can be assumed that a large part of the CIT spiked before baking was recovered in the form of DCIT, CIT covalently bound to starch (<bold>A</bold>), or unaltered CIT. In dough D (which used &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose), a similar amount of CIT was degraded compared to the doughs A, B, C, and E, but less DCIT was formed. This resulted in a gap compared to the spiked CIT, with approximately 82 &#x000b5;g of the spiked CIT missing.</p><p>Similarly, in dough F (which used whole grain wheat flour), where CIT degradation was highest, the amount of CIT covalently bound to starch was not higher than in the other biscuits, and thus cannot explain the large gap to the previously spiked CIT (around 182 &#x000b5;g CIT are missing).</p><p>As we have recently shown, amino compounds are further reaction partners for CIT during thermal processes [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

A similar approach to the previously described model experiment was used, in which CIT was heated together with gluten. The protein fraction of the biscuit samples was enzymatically hydrolyzed using pronase (from <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces griseus</italic>) to allow subsequent detection of the reaction products by mass spectrometry [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To improve the enzymatic digestion of the proteins, as much of the starch as possible should be removed in advance. For this purpose, the samples were first incubated with &#x003b1;-amylase and the supernatant including the soluble sugars was removed. The proteins were then digested using pronase and the samples were checked for the recently published reaction products of CIT and gluten using HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF.</p><p>However, none of the features recently described could be detected in any of the representatively selected baking samples. In addition, the theoretically expected reaction product of CIT and lysine could also not be observed.</p><p>Given that there might still be other unknown reaction products, the extracts of the enzymatically digested biscuit samples were also analyzed using an untargeted approach, similar to that used for the extractable CIT reaction products, using an HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF instrument. However, no further degradation products could be detected in these samples, leaving DCIT as the most abundant CIT reaction product.

[<xref rid="B48-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This is in contrast to data published shortly afterwards, in which none of the isolated substances from model experiments (including DCIT) had significant antimicrobial activity (no further details are given about the microorganism tested) [<xref rid="B40-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In contrast to CIT, no data has yet been published on the cytotoxicity of DCIT. However, since the main target of CIT is the kidney [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], IHKE-cells were selected as complementary cell culture model. CIT and DCIT were applied to the cells in concentrations ranging from 500 nM to 100 &#x003bc;M.</p><p>The data shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> illustrate that, overall, the cell viability of IHKE-cells was lower for CIT compared to DCIT across all tested concentrations. However, from a concentration of 2 &#x000b5;M, a significant decrease in cell viability (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) was also observed for DCIT. Therefore, it can be concluded that DCIT formed during thermal processing is less cytotoxic compared to CIT, but it is not entirely detoxified. When comparing 100 &#x000b5;M DCIT (69 &#x000b1; 10%) and 20 &#x000b5;M CIT (70 &#x000b1; 10%), similarly significant effects on cellular viability were observed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-toxins-17-00086"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Knowledge about the CIT degradation during food or feed processing is limited and the occurrence of modified forms of CIT has not yet been adequately studied [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As we have recently shown, CIT is able to react with various amino compounds under food processing conditions, leading to protein-bound forms of CIT [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To extend these studies, we investigated the reactions of CIT with different carbohydrates during thermal food processing, using, in the first step, different matrix model compounds representing different carbohydrates. The suitability of these model compounds to mimic food constituents was demonstrated in previous studies that investigated the thermal degradation of the mycotoxins fumonisin B<sub>1</sub>, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, ochratoxin A, T-2, and HT-2 toxin in food (see [<xref rid="B30-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and literature cited there).</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that CIT is a reactive mycotoxin that begins to degrade under comparatively mild thermal processing conditions, starting at 100 &#x000b0;C. The observed higher degradation rate in the presence of water during heating is in good agreement with findings from the literature [<xref rid="B49-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, thermal degradation is more pronounced in the presence of food matrices. The results from the matrix model experiments provide clear evidence that, in addition to amino compounds (e.g., proteins), sugars and other carbohydrates such as starch are also possible reaction partners for CIT during thermal food processing. MS/MS spectra and stable isotope labelling experiments were used to further characterize the formed reaction products <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>, which are assumed to be products of the decarboxylation of a &#x003b2;-keto ester. In the literature, the decarboxylation of &#x003b2;-keto acids is described upon heating, which supports the hypothesis that these products arise from such a reaction [<xref rid="B50-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The formation of numerous isomers can be attributed to the five hydroxy groups of glucose, each of which could act as potential reaction partner for CIT. A similar phenomenon has also been observed in the reactions of T-2 toxin with carbohydrates [<xref rid="B33-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The further loss of different hydroxy groups (leading to reaction products <bold>B</bold>) results in an even greater number of potentially formed isomers. However, due to low yields and the complexity of the mixture of reaction products, further structural elucidation, for example, by NMR analysis, was not possible.</p><p>In a next step, to verify the results of the model reactions of CIT with carbohydrates under realistic food processing conditions, we performed baking experiments commonly used in the food industry. Since the proportion of starch is usually significantly higher than the amount of protein in cereal and cereal products [<xref rid="B51-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], i.e., foods that are often contaminated with CIT, a reaction of CIT with carbohydrates seems most likely.</p><p>Two different baking conditions, representative of typical industrial baking processes [<xref rid="B34-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], were compared. These conditions varied in baking time and temperature but were intended to produce a similar baking result (i.e., a similar degree of browning). A higher degradation of CIT was observed when longer baking times at lower temperatures were used.</p><p>Overall, between 68&#x02013;97% of the added CIT could be detected in the samples after biscuit-baking, demonstrating that CIT partly reacts during this process. The largest effects on CIT degradation were observed when baking biscuits from a whole grain wheat flour dough (dough F). However, the specific effect of whole grain wheat flour on the thermal degradation of CIT can only be speculated. Compared to wheat flour types 405 or 550, whole grain wheat flour is characterized by a slightly higher protein content (1.5% higher), a slightly higher fat content (1.1% higher), a higher proportion of dietary fiber (7.6% higher), and a slightly higher proportion of minerals (1.1% higher) [<xref rid="B51-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For amino compounds such as proteins, we have already shown recently that they have an influence on the degradation of CIT [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The available cellulose and phenolic macromolecules may also react with CIT in a manner similar to starch. Minerals (especially heavy metals such as iron, copper, or cobalt) can be involved in oxidation processes and act as reaction catalysts in (thermal) food processes [<xref rid="B52-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This could provide plausible explanation for the lowest CIT recovery observed in dough F.</p><p>The formation of DCIT seems to explain the majority of CIT degradation, with starch-bound CIT (reaction products <bold>A</bold>) potentially playing a decisive role depending on the process conditions and ingredients used. In this context, it has to be mentioned that no standards for the quantification of <bold>A</bold> were available, and thus, the levels shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> are for orientational purposes only. Depending on the efficiency of the enzymatic release of the reaction products from the starch matrix and, even more important, the ionizability of the reaction products in the mass spectrometer, the quantities formed may be significantly higher. For dough F, the identified starch-bound CIT could not explain the smaller proportion of recovered CIT compared to all other doughs examined. In fact, the amount of CIT covalently bound to starch formed in this dough is the lowest compared to all other doughs. One possible explanation might be the presence of additional cellulose and other dietary fiber, which may react with CIT in a manner similar to starch. In addition, the relevance of matrix-bound CIT to pectin in apples has already been discussed [<xref rid="B55-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Reaction products <bold>B</bold> could not be analyzed in the baked biscuits. Since the CIT concentrations used in the baking experiments were lower than in the previously conducted model experiments, the total amount of reaction products <bold>A</bold> formed during the baking experiments was also considerably lower. It is assumed that small amounts of reaction products <bold>B</bold> may have been formed, but these amounts were below the detection limit.</p><p>Protein-bound forms of CIT were not detected in any of the doughs. On the one hand, it is conceivable that the amount of CIT covalently bound to proteins is low due to the rather low protein content in the baked goods, making it undetectable with the QTOF detector used, which has comparably low sensitivity. In addition, it must also be emphasized that the recently presented reaction products of CIT with gluten were derived from a model experiment in which gluten was selected as a representative main component of the protein fraction in wheat [<xref rid="B56-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and the features identified there do not necessarily represent other proteins. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that reaction products of CIT with other amino compounds were formed. However, these could not be detected in the baked goods due to the absence of a reference list. Moreover, the influence of potential matrix interferences remains unknown.</p><p>Overall, it should be noted that CIT degradation in the biscuit-baking experiments was rather low under all conditions investigated. Kuchenbuch et al. observed higher degradation rates for T-2 and HT-2 toxin, but it is important to emphasize that significantly harsher baking conditions were used (200 &#x000b0;C for 30 min/ 230 &#x000b0;C for 20 min) [<xref rid="B34-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the biscuit-baking experiments conducted in this study showed that the ingredients, the moisture level, and the baking time and temperature strongly influence the stability of CIT. Higher degradation rates might occur in other products, particularly those baked under harsher conditions. Additionally, the detected analytes demonstrate that starch-bound forms of CIT can be formed during commonly applied baking processes. In addition to the already confirmed reactions of CIT with amino compounds such as proteins during heating [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the reactions of CIT with carbohydrates, as presented here, may offer further insight into why processed starch-rich foods generally contain less CIT than unprocessed ones.</p><p>Based on the assigned chemical structures, these covalently bound forms may be at least partially released to their bioavailable form, particularly during digestion, and thus regain toxicological relevance. In the case of CIT covalently bound to starch, however, it is important to note that the covalent binding has very likely resulted in a chemical change (<xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), leading most probably to different toxicological properties compared to unmodified CIT.</p><p>Our data also indicate that model experiments involving the heating of only pure CIT are not suitable for accurately predicting the degradation products that can actually arise during thermal food processing [<xref rid="B38-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Kitabatake et al. [<xref rid="B49-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] investigated the degradation of CIT under dry, semi-moist, and moist conditions in model experiments, where pure CIT was heated both with and without water but without any food matrix. Degradation products formed were later identified as CIT H1 and CIT H2 [<xref rid="B38-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Other degradation products, such as the dimers dicitrinin A&#x02013;D or DCIT, have been identified in model experiments where pure CIT was heated in methanol [<xref rid="B40-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, under realistic food processing conditions and in the presence of a food matrix, we could not identify any of the degradation products described in literature, except for DCIT. Dimerization and other CIT-CIT couplings reported in these studies are very unlikely under typical food processing conditions due to the strong dilution with other food constituents.</p><p>Cytotoxicity of DCIT in IHKE-cells was found to be lower compared to CIT, but there is no evidence for complete detoxification. As DCIT is the main low molecular weight degradation product of CIT under realistic food processing conditions, it is recommended to quantify DCIT in processed food samples in addition to CIT. The toxicity, as well as intestinal metabolism, of carbohydrate-bound CIT could not be evaluated due to the relatively small amounts formed. However, the release of matrix-bound forms of CIT during intestinal metabolism, as well as the toxicity of the released forms of CIT, should be analyzed in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-toxins-17-00086"><title>4.

To investigate the influence of water on the thermal degradation of pure CIT, the samples were also heated with and without the addition of water (0; 5; 50 &#x000b5;L water). Experiments heating CIT with model compounds were carried out in duplicate; those heating with pure CIT were in triplicate.</p><p>To confirm the formation of reaction products of CIT with reducing and non-reducing sugars, 10 &#x000b5;L of a <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-CIT stock solution (1 mg/mL in methanol) (0.04 &#x000b5;mol) and 10 &#x000b5;L of the model substance stock solution (0.5 &#x000b5;mol &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose; 0.3 &#x000b5;mol <sc>d</sc>-sucrose; 0.5 &#x000b5;mol methyl-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside) were pipetted into brown glass vials, and the solvent was removed as described above.

The samples were shaken for 30 min at 350 rpm on a GFL type 3006 laboratory shaker (GFL, Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Labortechnik mbH, Burgwedel, Germany) to completely dissolve all degradation products formed. The samples were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF.</p><p>Furthermore, 100 mg starch was weighed into a 10 mL screw-cap glass centrifuge tube and 100 &#x000b5;L water, and 200 &#x000b5;L of the CIT-stock solution (0.8 &#x000b5;mol) was added, followed by gentle manual shaking for 1 min. After evaporation of the solvents from the uncapped tube overnight, the open vessel was heated for 60 min at 140 &#x000b0;C, allowing solvent residues and volatile reaction products to evaporate. As a control group, the experiment was repeated without the addition of CIT (blank samples). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. To be able to detect reaction products of CIT with starch by HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF, a digestion of the starch had to be carried out first. For this purpose, 2 mL of water and 100 &#x000b5;L heat-stable &#x003b1;-amylase from <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus</italic> sp. were added to the heated residue and shaken intensively for 30 s.

Biscuit Baking</title><p>A simple biscuit recipe according to Kuchenbuch et al. [<xref rid="B34-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was chosen to investigate the degradation of CIT during baking. The moisture content, the type of sugar, and the type of wheat flour used were varied.</p><p>To prepare the biscuit dough, flour, sugar, and melted coconut fat were combined and kneaded for 3 min (MUM4405/05, Robert Bosch Hausger&#x000e4;te GmbH, M&#x000fc;nchen). Tap water was added, and the dough was kneaded again for 5 min. The exact quantities for preparing the doughs are summarized in <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Two doughs were produced for each dough type A&#x02013;F. One dough was spiked with CIT, while the other dough served as a control (blank dough). Spiking was made by adding 434.7 &#x000b5;L of the CIT stock solution to the tap water before mixing, resulting in a spiking level of 1000 &#x000b5;g CIT/kg flour (776.2&#x02013;782.5 &#x000b5;g CIT/kg dry mass dough, <xref rid="toxins-17-00086-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). In the case of the blank dough, the corresponding amount of ACN was added.</p><p>Two 50 g portions of the dough were shaped into discs, each with a diameter of 75 mm and a height of 10 mm, using a special mold. Subsequently, biscuits were baked on a silicon mat in an oven with circulating air (UT 6060, Heraeus, Hanau, Germany). The temperature inside the biscuit during the baking process was monitored using a temperature data logger (EL-USB-TC-LCD, Lascar Electronics, Whiteparish, United Kingdom). Two different baking conditions were investigated: low- (180 &#x000b0;C, 20 min) and high-temperature conditions (220 &#x000b0;C, 10 min). Both baking processes were repeated three times for each dough.</p><p>After baking, the biscuits were allowed to cool to room temperature and the inner part of each biscuit was cut out by a stainless-steel ring with a 52 mm inner diameter. This step was performed to remove the inhomogeneously browned areas at the edges, ensuring better comparability of the samples. The obtained inner part of the biscuit was ground (M20, IKA-Werke, Staufen, Germany) and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C until analysis. All CIT concentration were normalized to the dry mass. For this purpose, the water content of the used flours, as well as the water content of the biscuits after baking, was determined.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-toxins-17-00086"><title>4.6. Sample Preparation</title><p>The method used for sample preparation is a modified method based on the official method for CIT determination in food [<xref rid="B60-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In general, 2 &#x000b1; 0.05 g sample were weighed into a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube and extracted with 10 mL of ACN acidified with 1% acetic acid and 10 mL of an extraction solution consisting of H<sub>2</sub>O acidified with 1% acetic acid and 1.6% HCl (37%) and a sodium chloride additive of 100 g/L. The samples were shaken for 1 h at 350 rpm (GFL type 3006, Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Labortechnik mbH). To induce phase separation, 4 g magnesium sulphate and 1.5 g sodium chloride were added and shaken for 30 sec.

The QC consisted of a blend of extruded samples spiked with CIT before extrusion. As the QC has a starch-rich matrix, it could also be used as a representative quality control for the sample preparation of the biscuit samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-toxins-17-00086"><title>4.7. HPLC-MS/MS</title><p>Sample extracts were analyzed using an HPLC-MS/MS system consisting of a PAL HTC-xt autosampler (CTC analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland), an Agilent Infinity 1260 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) in combination with an Ion Drive<sup>TM</sup> Turbo V Source (SCIEX, Darmstadt, Germany), and a QTRAP 6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (SCIEX). The 1260 HPLC consisted of a G4225A 1260 HiP Degasser, a G1312B 1260 Bin Pump, a G1316A 1260 thermostatted column compartment (TCC), a G1367E 1260 HiP ALS, and a G1330B 1290 Thermostat. The mass spectrometer was operated in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) detection mode with positive electrospray ionization (ESI), a cycle time of 800 ms, and retention time windows typically ranging from 60&#x02013;210 s (with one case extending to 780 s).</p><p>A Nucleodur C18 Gravity-SB column (100 &#x000d7; 2 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m, Macherey-Nagel, D&#x000fc;ren, Germany) equipped with a guard column with the same material (2.0 &#x000d7; 4 mm), in combination with ACN + 1% formic acid as solvent A and H<sub>2</sub>O + 1% formic acid as solvent B, was used for chromatographic separation. The linear gradient was programmed as follows: 0 min 20% A, 0.1 min 20% A, 8 min 100% A, 10 min 100% A, 10.1 min 20% A, 13 min 20% A. The flow rate was set to 0.45 mL/min, and the injection volume was 20 &#x003bc;L. The temperature of the column oven was set to 40 &#x000b0;C and the autosampler temperature to 4 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>The optimization of the source parameters (ion spray voltage, curtain gas, temperature, ion source gas 1 and 2) was performed by injecting a CIT-spiked extrusion-cooked sample extract several times and varying each source parameter individually (ionization voltage in 500 V steps from 2000&#x02013;5000 V; curtain gas in 5 psi steps from 20&#x02013;45 psi; temperature in 50 &#x000b0;C steps from 300&#x02013;700 &#x000b0;C; ion source gas 1 and 2 in 5 psi steps from 45&#x02013;70 psi). The optimal source parameters were determined by maximizing the intensity of the quantifier ion for CIT.

In addition to isolated standards such as DCIT and <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>3</bold>, which could be used directly for tuning the collision energy (CE), declustering potential (DP), and cell exit potential (CXP), MRM-transitions of further degradation products should be integrated into the method for screening purposes. MRM-transitions for these were determined based on HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF data from pure CIT samples of the model experiments, which helped identify additional potentially relevant degradation products, as well as degradation products already known from the literature, namely, for example: phenol A acid (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 241.1084), dicitrinin A (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 381.1721), dicitrinin C (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 393.1722), and citrinin H1 (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 427.1779) [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Identified fragments of the product ion spectra could be used to determine MRM transitions. Furthermore, one sample from the model experiments (25 &#x000b5;g pure CIT heated for 10 min at 160 &#x000b0;C with the addition of 50 &#x000b5;L water), which contained a mix of different degradation products, was also used for tuning.</p><p>Recovery rates were determined for CIT, as well as DCIT and <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>3</bold>, by spiking a certain amount of analyte to a blank sample before sample preparation. Quantification was performed using an external calibration and internal standard (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-labeled CIT). For the biscuit matrix, the recovery rate ranged between 95 and 112%. Limit of detection (LOD) was defined as a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3 (CIT: 1.1 &#x000b5;g/kg; DCIT: 2.6 &#x000b5;g/kg; <bold>1</bold>: 1.1 &#x000b5;g/kg; <bold>2</bold>: 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg, <bold>3</bold>: 3.2 &#x000b5;g/kg) and limit of quantification (LOQ), defined as S/N of 10 (CIT: 4.4 &#x000b5;g/kg; DCIT: 8.6 &#x000b5;g/kg; <bold>1</bold>: 2.1 &#x000b5;g/kg; <bold>2</bold>: 2.0 &#x000b5;g/kg, <bold>3</bold>: 10.8 &#x000b5;g/kg).</p><p>Sample extracts analyzed for matrix-associated forms of CIT bound to starch were prepared as described under &#x0201c;Sample preparation for the screening of matrix-associated CIT covalently bound to starch&#x0201d;.
