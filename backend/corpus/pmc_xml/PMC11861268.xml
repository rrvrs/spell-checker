The protein comprises three domains. At the N-terminus is a macro domain, biochemically characterised to bind both RNA and ADP-ribose and to possess ADP-ribosyl hydrolase activity&#x02014;an enzymatic activity that removes ADP-ribose from mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins. As ADP-ribosylation is important in the signalling pathway, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, we sought to determine whether the macro domain might perturb NF-&#x003ba;B signalling. We first showed that CHIKV infection did not induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation and could not block exogenous activation of the pathway via TNF&#x003b1;, although TNF&#x003b1; treatment did result in a modest reduction in virus titre. In contrast, ectopic expression of nsP3 was able to inhibit both basal and TNF&#x003b1;-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and this was dependent on the macro domain, as a mutation previously shown to disrupt ADP-ribose binding and hydrolase activity (D10A) eliminated the ability to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activation. The macro domain D10A mutant also resulted in a dramatic reduction in virus infectivity, consistent with the notion that the ability of the macro domain to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activation plays a role in the virus lifecycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chikungunya virus</kwd><kwd>nsP3</kwd><kwd>macro domain</kwd><kwd>ADP-ribose</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) White Rose PhD programme in Mechanistic Biology</funding-source><award-id>BB/F01614X/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Medical Research Council award</funding-source><award-id>MR/S001026/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Wellcome Investigator Award</funding-source><award-id>096670</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>G.C.R. was a PhD student funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) White Rose PhD programme in Mechanistic Biology (grant number BB/F01614X/1), and was subsequently supported as a post-doctoral researcher by a Medical Research Council award to M.H.

Introduction</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus of the <italic toggle="yes">Togaviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is increasingly becoming a threat to global health. First discovered in Tanzania in 1952, CHIKV is now classified into four distinct genotypes and has spread from Africa to Asia, Europe, and the Americas [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CHIKV is transmitted by mosquitos and was previously geographically limited to the distribution of the <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, which favours tropical climates. However, mutations in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins, detected in 2004, have enabled spread by the <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito, which is more widely disseminated around the globe [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Infection with CHIKV causes Chikungunya fever, characterised by high fever, rash, and joint pain which can be debilitating and, in up to 50% of cases, can persist for many years after infection [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CHIKV infection induces a highly inflammatory state, inducing tissue damage [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, individuals who have been infected with CHIKV are significantly predisposed to arthritis later in life [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In healthy adults, CHIKV is rarely fatal, although the risk of death is high in infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The CHIKV genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded (ss) RNA, with a 5&#x02032; cap, a poly-A tail, and containing two open reading frames (ORFs) [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The first ORF encodes for the four non-structural proteins, nsP1-4, which are directly translated from the genomic RNA [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The second ORF encodes for the structural proteins and is translated from a sub-genomic RNA, which is generated from a negative sense template following genome replication [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The functions of nsP1, 2, and 4 have been well defined: nsP1 displays both capping and decapping activities [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and forms a dodecameric ring at the entrance to the membrane-bound spherules where RNA replication takes place [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. NTPase, helicase, and protease activities are provided by nsP2, the latter being responsible for the processing of the non-structural polyprotein [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. NsP4 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite numerous studies, the role of nsP3 remains to be unambiguously defined. In addition to a role during genome RNA replication and the interactions with a range of viral and cellular proteins, it is likely to play multiple roles in the CHIKV lifecycle [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. NsP3 comprises three domains: at the N-terminus is the macro domain, followed by the alphavirus unique domain (AUD), and the hyper-variable domain (HVD) (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S1a</xref>). The macro domain is found in the proteins of bacteria, eucaryotes, archaea, and positive-sense RNA viruses [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This domain has been shown to interact with, and hydrolyse, ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins. Although it has been shown that macro domains of different species can differ greatly in their affinity for ADP-ribose and enzymatic activity, the CHIKV macro domain has been demonstrated to both bind ADP-ribose [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S1b</xref>) and possess hydrolase activity [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been shown that these two properties of the CHIKV macro domain are essential for virus replication in cell culture [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, it was also demonstrated that the nsP3 macro domain reverses the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) of nsP2 by ARTD10 (a mono-ADP-ribosylating enzyme, also known as PARP10) [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. MARylation of nsP2 by this IFN-stimulated enzyme has been shown to be anti-viral, as it restricts nsP2 proteolytic activity, resulting in impaired viral polyprotein processing. The AUD is a less well understood domain, found to be essential for RNA replication but has also been implicated in virus assembly [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The HVD varies greatly in both sequence and size between the alphaviruses and has been more widely studied [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This intrinsically disordered and unstructured domain is highly phosphorylated [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and facilitates the majority of known protein interactions with nsP3 [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Substitution of phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in the CHIKV nsP3 HVD resulted in reduced replication and infectivity.</p><p>Although CHIKV has been shown to induce a robust interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, which is crucial for an appropriate immune response and for survival in infected mice [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], there has been little characterisation of the other innate immunity pathways in response to CHIKV infection. In particular, the interplay between CHIKV infection and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway remains largely uncharacterised. One study proposed that CHIKV infection suppressed activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by increasing the expression of the micro-RNA miR-146a, which in turn downregulated the expression of the upstream modulators TRAF6, IRAK1, and IRAK2 [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that various CHIKV proteins, particularly nsP2, have inhibitory effects on MDA5 and RIG-I, both of which are dsRNA sensors that can activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to CHIKV, other alphaviruses have been demonstrated to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) has been shown to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B, predominantly via nsP2 expression [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) has also been shown to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, and that IKK&#x003b2; enhances viral replication [<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] via phosphorylation of VEEV nsP3, which is required for negative-strand RNA synthesis [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In differentiated neuronal cells, Sindbis virus (SINV) infection induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation and, similarly to VEEV, IKK&#x003b2; was shown to enhance SINV replication [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, ADP-ribosylation has been implicated in the NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway, specifically in the formation of the central IKK complex [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ADP-ribosylation of NEMO (NF-&#x003ba;B essential modulator, also referred to as IKK-&#x003b3;) by ARTD10 inhibits poly-K63 ubiquitination of the protein, blocking the formation of an active IKK complex and concomitantly preventing activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. More recently, ARTD10 (also referred to as PARP-10) has also been implicated in CHIKV replication, as it can ADP-ribosylate nsP2, inhibiting its proteolytic activity, resulting in reduced viral replication, a process reversable by nsP3-mediated ADP-hydrolysis. We therefore hypothesised that the CHIKV nsP3 macro domain may be able to perturb NF-&#x003ba;B signalling, as a result of its ability to either bind or hydrolyse ADP-ribose. Here, we demonstrate that CHIKV infection does not activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and is unable to suppress exogenous activation of the pathway via TNF&#x003b1; treatment. However, in contrast, we further demonstrate that ectopic expression of nsP3 is able to inhibit both basal and exogenously stimulated activity of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, showing that this is likely mediated via the ADP-ribose binding and the hydrolase activities of the N-terminal macro domain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00191"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-viruses-17-00191"><title>3.1. CHIKV Infection Does Not Activate the NF-&#x003ba;B Pathway</title><p>The NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is activated as part of the innate response to viral infection, leading to the expression of antiviral genes, and is frequently targeted for viral immune evasion [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Given the importance of this pathway, it is surprising that the interplay between CHIKV infection and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is poorly understood, and we sought to address this gap in our knowledge.</p><p>We first examined the effect of CHIKV infection on the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway using a reporter plasmid containing firefly luciferase (F-luc) under the control of an NF-&#x003ba;B-sensitive promoter, with a second plasmid, as a transfection control, containing renilla luciferase (R-luc) under the control of the constitutive thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. We chose to use A549 (human lung carcinoma) cells for this analysis, as they can be efficiently infected with CHIKV [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>), are known to be immune-competent [<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and respond well to exogenous (e.g., TNF&#x003b1;) activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>). Following transfection, cells were incubated for 16 h, then either infected with CHIKV (MOI = 5) or treated with TNF-&#x003b1; (50 ng/mL). NF-&#x003ba;B activation was determined by normalising the Fluc values to Rluc. As shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a, CHIKV infected cells showed no increase in NF-&#x003ba;B activation up to 8 h post infection, behaviour which was indistinguishable from that of the negative control (mock-infected in the absence of TNF-&#x003b1;). In contrast, cells treated with TNF&#x003b1; demonstrated a constant increase in NF-&#x003ba;B activation over the time course.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B activation involves nuclear translocation of the p50-p65 heterodimer (also referred to as p105). A549 cells, either treated with TNF&#x003b1; or infected with CHIKV, were analysed by immunofluorescence using antibodies to p65 to assess NF-&#x003ba;B activation and nsP3 to detect CHIKV infection at either 8 or 24 h post treatment (hpt) or infection (hpi). <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b shows that CHIKV-infected cells exhibited a cytoplasmic localisation of p65 at both 8 and 24 hpi, consistent with the lack of NF-&#x003ba;B activation following CHIKV infection. CHIKV infection was confirmed by the presence of nsP3-positive cells at 24 hpi, however, nsP3 was not detectable at 8 hpi. As expected, TNF&#x003b1; treatment resulted in translocation of a proportion of p65 into the nucleus of cells at 8 hpt, with some protein retained in the cytoplasm. TNF&#x003b1;-mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B was transient, as by 24 hpt, p65 was predominantly cytoplasmic, similar to the results for the mock-treated cells. This timescale is consistent with a reduced luciferase signal in TNF&#x003b1;-induced cells by 24 hpt compared to 6 hpt (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S3a</xref>). These data collectively demonstrate that CHIKV infection does not result in activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway.</p><p>We proceeded to ask whether exogenous activation of the pathway would have an effect on CHIKV virus production. Treatment of infected A549 cells with TNF&#x003b1; resulted in a modest and non-significant two-fold reduction in virus production, as determined by plaque assay titration of virus released into the culture supernatant (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We conclude that exogenous activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway by TNF-&#x003b1; does not significantly inhibit the CHIKV lifecycle and production of progeny virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-17-00191"><title>3.2. CHIKV Infection Does Not Inhibit Exogenous Activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B Pathway</title><p>We proceeded to investigate whether CHIKV infection had any effect on exogenous activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. To test this, A549 cells were transfected with the NF-&#x003ba;B reporter plasmid and infected with CHIKV at 16 h post-transfection. Immediately after infection, cells were treated with TNF&#x003b1;, and cell lysates were harvested over a 24 h time period. We performed this experiment at two different TNF&#x003b1; concentrations (12.5 and 50 ng/mL) to control for any potential masking of an inhibitory effect at the higher concentration used in previous assays (12.5 ng/mL was the lowest concentration that stimulated luciferase reporter expression, <xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S3b</xref>). This analysis revealed that CHIKV infection was not able to inhibit the exogenous activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by TNF&#x003b1; (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). To confirm this result, cells were analysed by immunofluorescence for nsP3 and p65. As shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b, CHIKV infection did not block the nuclear translocation of p65 at 8 h following TNF&#x003b1; treatment. Similar to the results shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, by 24 hpt, the stimulatory effect of TNF&#x003b1; treatment had ceased, and the majority of p65 was cytoplasmic. CHIKV infection was confirmed by the presence of nsP3-positive cells at 24 hpi. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CHIKV infection is unable to suppress exogenous activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway by TNF&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-17-00191"><title>3.3. Ectopic Expression of nsP3 in the Absence of Other CHIKV Proteins Inhibits the NF-&#x003ba;B Pathway</title><p>We originally hypothesised that by virtue of its ADP-ribosyl-binding and hydrolase activities, the CHIKV nsP3 macro domain might be able to modulate NF-&#x003ba;B activation. The observation that CHIKV infection did not activate NF-&#x003ba;B suggested that the virus possessed a mechanism to block endogenous activation of the pathway following infection. However, it was conceivable that any subtle and perhaps transient effect of the macro domain might be obscured by the rapid replication and subsequent cytotoxicity of virus infection. To formally determine whether the macro domain could function to modulate NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we assessed whether any effect could be observed when nsP3 was expressed in the absence of other viral proteins. To do this, a C-terminally FLAG-tagged nsP3 expression construct was generated (nsP3-F). As a positive control, we utilised N-terminally FLAG-tagged vaccinia B14 (F-B14). B14 is a potent and well characterised inhibitor of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, it binds IKK&#x003b2; and blocks formation of an active IKK complex [<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Cells were transfected with NF-&#x003ba;B reporter plasmids, together with either expression constructs for nsP3-F, F-B14 or GFP, with or empty vector plasmid, and incubated for 16 h, prior to treatment with TNF&#x003b1; for an additional 6 h. As shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a, both nsP3 and B14 exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on NF-&#x003ba;B activity, both basal levels and the levels of NF-&#x003ba;B exogenously activated via TNF&#x003b1;. The expression of GFP exerted no significant effect on NF-&#x003ba;B activation. The expression of nsP3, B14 was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b), and GFP expression was confirmed by IF (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c).</p><p>To confirm these findings, we again performed immunofluorescence to determine the subcellular localisation of the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B. As demonstrated in <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a, TNF&#x003b1; treatment resulted in nuclear translocation of p65 in cells transfected with empty vector or GFP. Conversely, p65 was excluded from the nucleus in cells expressing nsP3-F, indicating that nsP3 was inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B and therefore, the activation of the pathway.</p><p>To further determine at which stage in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway nsP3 may be acting, we performed a Western blot analysis for phosphorylated-p105, which is mediated rapidly by the IKK complex after the pathway is stimulated (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b, in the mock (pcDNA3.1 empty-vector transfected) cells, phospho-p105 is detectable as early as 5 min post treatment, persisting for approximately 15 min and declining thereafter. In the GFP-expressing cells, there is a slight delay in phospho-p105 detection, compared to that for the empty-vector control, by about 5 min. This is similar to the results for the nsP3-F expressing cells. In cells expressing vaccinia B14, a protein known to inhibit the IKK complex, phospho-p105 is weakly detectable at 15&#x02013;30 min post-treatment. This is as expected, as B14 directly inhibits the IKK complex via an interaction with IKK&#x003b2;. Collectively, these data imply that nsP3-F is not blocking IKK activation but inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65/p105 to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-17-00191"><title>3.4. The nsP3 Macro Domain Contributes to Inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B Activation</title><p>To assess whether the macro domain was involved with the nsP3-mediated inhibition of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, we compared the nsP3 mutant D10A which has been previously shown to be critical for ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>c). Mutant and wt sP3-F expression constructs, control F-B14 and GFP constructs, or empty vector plasmid were transfected with NF-&#x003ba;B reporter plasmids into A549 cells, as described above. As shown by <xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a, the nsP3-D10A mutant had no significant effect on NF-&#x003ba;B activation, indistinguishable from the results for the negative controls, implying that the inhibition of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is mediated by the macro domain. The expression levels for wt and mutant nsP3, as well as for the B14 control, were confirmed by Western blotting (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>b).</p><p>To attempt to correlate the ability of the macro domain to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activation with its role in the virus lifecycle, we evaluated the phenotype of the D10A mutant in the context of infectious CHIKV. We tested the replication of the mutant in four cell types: A549, Huh7 (human hepatoma cells), U4.4, and C6/36 (both <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic>). As a negative control, we included an inactivating mutant in the nsP4 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (GAA) for each cell type. In both mammalian cell lines (A549 and Huh7), the D10A mutant was unable to produce virus (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>a). Similarly, the D10A mutant was unable to replicate in the <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> cell line U4.4 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>b). Intriguingly, in the C6/36 cells (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>b), which lack a functional RNAi response due to a frameshift mutation in the Dcr2 gene [<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], D10A, which was completely defective in all other cell lines, was able to produce infectious virus, suggestive of an additional role of the macro-domain in counteracting the insect antiviral response.</p><p>Taken collectively, the mutant nsP3 data suggest that the macro domain not only plays a role in counteracting the mammalian NF-&#x003ba;B pathway but also has a potential role in subverting the insect anti-viral response. However, we should note that the dramatic phenotype of the D10A mutant in both mammalian and insect cells is consistent with the additional roles of the nsp3 macrodomain in virus replication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-17-00191"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B is involved in the host cell defence against virus infection, and its activity is induced via a variety of canonical and non-canonical pathways [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], in particular, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in the innate immune detection of virus components. Virus infection is a well-characterised inducer of NF-&#x003ba;B activity, and most viruses have evolved mechanisms of inhibiting this activation to evade this response, a good example is vaccinia virus, which expresses no less than nine different proteins that antagonise the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref rid="B43-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we sought to investigate the effect of CHIKV infection on NF-&#x003ba;B activity. We observed that CHIKV infection could neither induce the pathway nor inhibit activation via the canonical pathway as a response to the external stimulus provided by TNF&#x003b1; treatment. We reasoned that the lack of NF-&#x003ba;B activation during infection was consistent with the hypothesis that CHIKV was able to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activation, but that this block could be overcome by exogenous stimulation (e.g., by TNF&#x003b1;&#x02013;<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). A likely mediator of this effect was the macro domain of nsP3, and indeed, the ectopic expression of nsP3 alongside mutant D10A, which had previously been characterised to be unable to bind or hydrolyse ADP-ribose [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], revealed that this was indeed the case. The lack of NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition demonstrated by the D10A mutant suggests that the ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis properties of nsP3 are responsible for this effect, however, further research is required to precisely determine the mechanism of inhibition. It is also formally possible that other domains of nsP3 play a role in the regulation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, and further mutagenesis should be undertaken to investigate this possibility.</p><p>At this stage in our investigation, we do not know at which point nsP3 is antagonising the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. The phosphorylation of p105 is mediated by an active IKK complex, thus, one attractive hypothesis is that the nsP3 macro domain is perturbing the ADP-ribosylation of NEMO, a key component of the IKK complex. Consistent with this, a cellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, ARTD10 (PARP10), inhibits TNF&#x003b1; mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation by interfering with the poly-K63 ubiquitinylation of NEMO [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Indeed, both NEMO and ARTD10 were shown to be in vitro substrates for the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of the nsP3 macro domain [<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and were efficiently de-mono-ADP-ribosylated (deMARylated). In this study, however, we show that ectopically expressed nsP3 inhibited the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway but not at the stage of IKK complex formation (<xref rid="viruses-17-00191-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b). A recent study showed that the nsP3 macro domain antagonises the ADP-ribosylation of nsP2 by ARTD10 [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], indicating that there may be multiple targets of ADP-ribosylation-mediated regulation in innate anti-viral pathways for nsP3 to counteract. Although we have been unable to biochemically demonstrate an interaction between nsP3 and either NEMO or ARTD10, we did observe partial co-localisation of nsP3 with ARTD10 during the late stages of CHIKV infection (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that nsP3 is able to interfere with ARTD10 function in infected cells. Therefore, we propose that the nsP3 macro domain directly interacts with one or more ADP-ribosylated proteins involved in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. However, given the previous observation that miR-146a is also involved in the regulation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway by CHIKV, we believe it is highly likely that CHIKV, like many other viruses, possesses multiple mechanisms to control this key signalling pathway.</p><p>Interestingly, components of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway have been shown to be pro-viral factors for other alphaviruses. Contrary to our findings for CHIKV, SAV, VEEV, and SINV have all been shown to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00191" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although in this study, we show CHIKV nsP3 to be an inhibitor of the NF-kB pathway, it would be prudent to investigate whether any NF-&#x003ba;B-pathway proteins are pro-viral for CHIKV, particularly as we demonstrated that the pathway is inhibited at a stage following IKK-complex activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-17-00191"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>To conclude, we show here that one of the roles of the CHIKV nsP3 macro domain is to contribute to the regulation of a critical antiviral factor, the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B. This observation leads to a number of key questions for future research, e.g., is this function conserved in other viral macro domains? What are the other targets for the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of these domains? And indeed, why is the macro domain only present in a small subset of positive-strand RNA viruses? What is clear is that we have only just begun to understand the role of this domain in the lifecycle of these viruses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Andres Merits (University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia) for providing the CHIKV replicon and infectious virus constructs, the anti-nsP3 antibody, and helpful advice.
