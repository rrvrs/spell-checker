1. Introduction</title><p>Mandibular nerve block is one of the most frequently used techniques in dental clinics. It numbs the mandibular teeth and surrounding structures.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The method&#x02019;s success rate largely depends on the clinician&#x02019;s knowledge of the mandibular foramen (MF) location, the point at which the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) enters the mandible, where the anesthetic solution is administered.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> However, individual anatomical variations can occur at the foramen.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Due to these variations, the failure rate of mandibular nerve block has been reported to range from 20% to 25%.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> As a result, precise localization of the IAN before delivering the anesthetic solution is crucial to ensure a successful nerve block.</p><p>Localization of the IAN is typically performed indirectly by identifying the MF in traditional 2-dimensional (2D) images.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Panoramic radiographs is commonly used for this purpose.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, panoramic radiographs have certain limitations that may lead to inaccurate MF localization.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Therefore, alternative imaging and visualization techniques have frequently been explored.</p><p>A peripheral nerve block is used to control pain when standard oral pain medications such as opioids fail to alleviate discomfort.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, this technique can reduce both the pain and side effects of general anesthesia, including nausea and respiratory depression, which may occur postoperatively.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> This procedure involves injecting a local anesthetic with a fine needle near the primary nerve, supplying the area from which the pain emanates.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> A guidance device, such as a fluoroscope or ultrasound (US), is essential for directing the needle to the target area.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>Recently, US imaging has been explored in dentistry for various applications including nerve visualization.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Several studies have reported that real-time ultrasound-guided imaging offers optimal localization of the IAN, thus facilitating profound mandibular nerve block.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> However, only a few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided mandibular nerve block in pain management.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Therefore, this systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided peripheral mandibular nerve block in pain management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>
2. Methods</title><p>This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO International Registry for Systematic Reviews (ID number: CRD42024484922). As this study was a systematic review of previously published literature, ethical approval and informed consent were not required.</p><sec><title>2.1. Literature search strategy</title><p>A comprehensive and systematic search of English literature was conducted using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar electronic databases. The search terms used were as follows: (((((Ultrasound-guided) OR (US-guided)) OR (Ultrasound-guidance)) OR (Ultrasound imaging)) OR (US guidance)) AND (mandibular nerve block) OR (IAN canal) AND (pain control). Reference lists were consulted for further identification of relevant articles. In this study, the terms mandibular nerve and IAN were used interchangeably, as they refer to blocks of the same nerve. The inclusion criteria for the articles were as follows: they must be original peer-reviewed articles, they must involve adult human participants, and they must report success in terms of the absence of pain. Given the novelty of this topic, several studies have been conducted, including case reports and clinical trials. The search was conducted at the Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University and included studies published up to September 2024.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Process of data collection</title><p>Two authors independently reviewed the selected studies and resolved all disagreements through consensus and discussion. The process of selecting studies was conducted in multiple stages, as illustrated in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

3.6 Pain effectiveness measurements</title><p>All studies included either VAS or NRS to assess the effectiveness of pain control. Other metrics employed in the included studies to evaluate the analgesic effect of the ultrasound-guided (USG) mandibular nerve block included morphine consumption, duration of pain-free periods, and necessity for rescue analgesics. In 3 studies, maximum mouth opening was measured to gauge pain relief.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Additionally, QoR was recorded in a study conducted by Oiwa et al. All tools were implemented at specific intervals, either before or after nerve block.</p></sec><sec><title>3.7. Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the effectiveness of pain control. Two studies compared traditional mandibular nerve block with USG IAN block (IANB).<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Jain et al used the VAS score to compare pain reduction between the 2 techniques following unilateral mandibular fracture surgery. They found a statistically significant difference in the VAS scores for both techniques when comparing the scores before and after the blocks (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003c;.001). Pain was reduced after IANB with or without US guidance. However, they reported block failures (n = 6) in the traditional group and no block failures (n = 0) in the USG group.</p><p>Martinus et al used the VAS score to compare the pain levels following third molar extraction surgery between the 2 methods. The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in VAS scores between the study and control groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003c;.001) during IANB. It was less painful to apply IANB with US guidance than it was without US guidance. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference in the VAS scores between the 2 groups when the pain level was measured at the time of administration of rescue analgesic medication 24 hours post-surgery (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .597).</p><p>Conversely, Venkatraman et al compared the effectiveness of USG IANB for pain reduction both before and after mandibular fracture surgery. They found a statistically significant difference in the VAS scores between group A (those who used USG IANB after surgery) and group B (those who used USG IANB before surgery), from 8 to 20 hours postoperatively. The <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values were &#x0003c;.02, and &#x0003c;.03, respectively, indicating significant results, given that the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value threshold was set at &#x0003c;.05. The study found a postoperative reduction in pain scores.</p><p>Postoperative morphine consumption was recorded in 2 studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Venkatraman et al reported significant reductions in morphine consumption when an USG mandibular block was applied post-surgery (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001). Additionally, Esquerre et al discovered that USG mandibular nerve block lowered the cumulative oral morphine equivalent (OME) consumption on both the first and second postoperative days (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .023, = .40, respectively). The <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value was set at &#x0003c;.05.</p><p>Other assessed measures for pain control included the necessity for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the period until the demand for rescue analgesia. Martinus et al reported a decrease in the quantity of NSAIDs required after third molar extraction surgery (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .038). In 2 separate studies by Venkatraman et al and Martinus et al, the amount of time before requesting rescue analgesics was noted. Both studies reported a significantly extended period before a request for rescue analgesics (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003c;.001, respectively).</p><p>Venkatraman et al evaluated various parameters associated with the use of an USG mandibular block before and after unilateral mandibular fracture surgery. These parameters included intraoperative fentanyl consumption and heart rate during the initial 30 minutes. They found statistically significant reductions in intraoperative fentanyl consumption when USG mandibular block was administered before surgery. In addition, the heart rate was considerably lower, and the time until a request for rescue analgesia was significantly prolonged when USG was performed preoperatively (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Oiwa et al, along with Esquerre et al, employed the NRS to evaluate postoperative pain control from the first to seventh days and on the first and second days, respectively. Significant differences between the first and seventh postoperative days have been reported by Oiwa et al Conversely, Esquerre et al did not observe any differences between the first and second postoperative days. Furthermore, Oiwa et al analyzed pain control using QoR tools. They observed significant differences in QoR scores between the first and seventh postoperative days.</p><p>Kojima et al and Kojima and Sendo conducted 2 studies using USG IANB to alleviate trismus and acute pain due to severe TMD. In both studies, assessments such as the VAS score and maximum mouth opening were evaluated before and after the procedure to determine the effectiveness of USG. The findings of these studies suggest that the application of USG IANB reduces pain levels and enhances mouth opening in patients. To evaluate trismus relief, Kojima and Sendo used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). They observed a significant enhancement in the HAD scores (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Esquerre et al also evaluated the correlation between preoperative anxiety (measured by the Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale) and postoperative pain, as reflected in the NRS and OME consumption on the second day after surgery. The results revealed a positive relationship between these 2 parameters.

Risk of bias in individual studies</title><p>This systematic review utilized the ROB-2 Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> to assess the risk bias in 3 randomized clinical trials. Five domains were used to evaluate the risk of bias: bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to deviations from the intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in the measurement of the outcome, and bias in the selection of the reported result. Each study was rated as having a low, some concerns, or a high risk of bias based on the overall assessment. Jain et al and Esquerre et al demonstrated a low risk of bias across all domains. However, Venkatraman et al reported a high risk of bias in the domain of bias owing to deviations from the intended intervention (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the risk of bias in a non-randomized prospective controlled study was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health tool (NIH).<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Clarity of objectives, methodological quality, validity of outcome measures, and control for confounding were ascertained through 14 questions. The study was categorized as good, fair, or poor, based on a comprehensive assessment. Martinus et al reported an overall rating of &#x0201c;fair&#x0201d; quality.&#x02019; This classification was attributed to the non-randomization of group allocation, absence of matching between the control and study groups, lack of blinding in the assessment of outcomes, and absence of statistical adjustment for potential confounders (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p>Case reports and case series were evaluated using CARE.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Thirteen domains were used to assess the completeness of the clinical case reports.

5. Discussion</title><p>Nerve block procedures, specifically those of the IAN, are frequently performed in dental clinics to manage pain prior to dental procedures.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Conventional nerve block techniques may be associated with adverse effects such as failure to attain anesthesia and nerve injury.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Recently, ultrasound-guided imaging has become increasingly prevalent in dentistry, especially in locating nerves prior to nerve block procedures.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> As a result, this systematic review aimed to examine the literature to assess the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided nerve blocks of the mandibular nerve in pain management.</p><p>This review included 7 studies, all of which confirmed that the use of USG IANB resulted in reduced pain in patients, irrespective of whether USG nerve block was administered before or after dental procedures for pain control. The dental procedures examined in these studies, such as mandibular fracture fixation surgery, were commonly associated with high levels of pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> The findings of this systematic review were consistent with those of another review that investigated the use of USG nerve blocks in the oral and maxillofacial regions.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> They also concluded that USG IANB was an effective analgesic.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>Three of the included studies also observed a significant improvement in mouth opening with USG IANB compared with the conventional nerve block technique.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, Venkatraman et al and Esquerre et al found that patients who received USG IANB required less morphine. In addition, Martinus et al noted a reduction in the number of NSAIDs required after a third molar extraction surgery. In 2 studies by Martinus et al and Venkatraman et al, patients experienced an elongated postoperative interval between requests for rescue analgesics.</p><p>Venkatraman et al also discovered that patients who underwent USG IANB experienced better control over their heart rate. The other findings examined in their study pertained to common complications often experienced after surgery under general anesthesia.</p><p>The 2021 study by Kojima and Sendo also collected HAD scores. This scale, which consists of 14 questions, was designed to assess mental health.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, these scores decreased after the use of USG nerve block to alleviate severe trismus caused by TMD.</p><p>In a study conducted by Martinus et al, the level of pain was assessed twice using VAS scores. Initially, the performance of the IANB was examined. Then, it was evaluated 24 hours after the third molar extraction surgery, particularly when the patients took the rescue analgesic. At the first assessment, the results echo those of other studies included in our analysis. However, the second review revealed no discernible differences between the control and the study groups. This disparity in results, notably at the second assessment, might stem from differences in the methodologies adopted for the outcome measurement. Martinus et al gauged the success of pain reduction using the VAS score only when patients required rescue analgesics. These methods were not congruent with those employed in other investigations that utilized VAS scores for all participants. Furthermore, patients were requested to self-report their pain levels 24 hours post-surgery. According to the NIH assessment tool, this self-reporting could be a potential source of bias influencing the study findings.</p><p>The risk of bias for the 3 clinical trial studies included in this review was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Studies by Jain et al and Esquerre et al demonstrated a low risk of bias in all domains, indicating that our findings may be more robust and reliable than those of other studies.</p><p>Determining whether to perform a USG-imaging nerve block before or after surgery is a crucial part of the treatment planning. The 5 studies that were compared indeed reached the same conclusions. However, 4 studies used the USG IANB technique before surgery, whereas only one used it afterward. These studies concluded that using the USG technique to block the mandibular nerve before surgery not only reduced postoperative pain but also decreased morphine and intraoperative fentanyl consumption, prolonged the time before rescue analgesia was required postoperatively, and enabled better control of intraoperative heart rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Although the Oiwa et al study had similar results as the previously mentioned studies, the results were not directly comparable due to the lack of a control group and the fact that only 6 patients were included.</p><p>There are 2 aspects tied to the clinical procedure of ultrasound-guided (USG) nerve block: the placement of the ultrasound probe and the plane of needle insertion in relation to the ultrasound probe. USG IANB can be performed either extraorally or intraorally.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> In all included studies, the extraoral approach was employed. This method was chosen mainly to enable the direct injection of anesthetic drugs into the pterygomandibular space.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Moreover, some studies have provided detailed locations for extraoral probe placement. In the Kojima and Sendo studies, for example, the probe was set caudal to the zygomatic arch, whereas it was placed below and parallel to the zygomatic arch in both the Venkatraman et al and Oiwa et al studies. Interestingly, Jain et al used 2 US probes in their study: a linear probe placed above the mandible, and a cardiac probe positioned below the zygoma and anterior to the mandibular condyle. The needle insertion plane can be introduced either in-plane (parallel) or out of plane (perpendicular) to the probe. All included studies, except for Jain et al, used the perpendicular method of needle insertion owing to the use of 2 US probes, resulting in a needle insertion that was parallel to the cardiac probe but perpendicular to the linear probe.</p><p>Data on the type and volume of anesthetic drugs were not consistent across the 7 studies. On 1 hand, studies by Kojima and Sendo, Venkatraman et al, Martinus et al, Esquerre et al, and Kojima et al used the same anesthetic, ropivacaine, but with variable drug concentrations and volumes &#x02013; specifically, 0.375%, 0.5%, 0.75%, with volumes ranging from 2.5&#x02009;mL to 10&#x02009;mL, respectively. In contrast, Jain et al used bupivacaine (3&#x02009;ml of 0.5%), while Oiwa et al used 5&#x02009;mL of 0.375% levobupivacaine. Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the details of the anesthetic drugs used in each study.</p><p>Given the burgeoning practice of USG IANB, some limitations were observed in this systematic review. These issues primarily revolve around the methodological aspects of the studies involved. For instance, the study designs ranged from simple case reports to randomized controlled trials. However, these randomized controlled trials, as noted in the literature, had limited sample sizes. This review was restricted to the USG nerve block of the mandibular nerve, but the reasons for using the nerve block varied broadly, from procedures such as third molar extraction to extremely painful procedures such as post-trauma jaw manipulation. Notable differences were observed in the types of US machines used and their respective probe tip frequencies. In summary, although we attempted to maintain consistent outcome measures (pain), the methods used for assessing pain varied across individual studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this systematic review demonstrate that USG IANB can effectively manage pain in adult patients undergoing certain surgical procedures, such as third molar extractions, or suffering from chronic pain conditions, such as those associated with TMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the use of ChatGPT (OpenAI) to assist in drafting 2 figures (Figs. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) related to the NIH and CARE risk of bias tools.
