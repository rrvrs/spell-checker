Aim of the study was to analyze disease burden and healthcare utilization in different stages of the disease in children with late infantile and juvenile MLD in Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Out of a nationwide total cohort study (TC) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;83), we undertook telephone interviews in a representative follow-up cohort (FC) defined by advanced disease stages (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19). The FC allowed detailed long-term data of the disease in addition to cross-sectional data of the TC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Nearly all patients showed spasticity, truncal hypotonia and dysphagia, and about half of the patients developed epilepsy. Most children required special education; none finished regular school. Analysis of the FC showed that neuronal intestinal burden was extensive, including obstipation (57%), micturition problems (47%), and tube feeding (63%). Gallbladder polyposis was seen in 52%. General well-being did not strongly correlate with motor function, whereas pain was associated with reduced well-being. Baclofen, Omeprazole, Vigabatrin and Polyethyleneglycol were the most frequently used drugs. Patients took up to 15 different drugs daily. Altogether, 127 hospitalisations (485 treatment days) were registered in the FC (median age 9&#x000a0;years, median one inpatient stay per patient per year). Diagnostic procedures were main reasons for hospitalization (29 hospitalizations, 128 treatment days), and accounted for the main burden for families (68%). The median use of 15 different devices (maximum 29) throughout life illustrated a high burden of the disease. During disease course, there was a change from more &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; devices (e.g., walker) to more &#x0201c;passive&#x0201d; devices (e.g., form seat). Physical therapy was the most relevant therapy in advanced disease stages (100%), while occupational therapy or speech therapy primarily were used in early disease stages. State welfare benefits, home- and palliative care were used broadly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Diagnostic and treatment routine pathways and sociomedical support in MLD require extensive resources. We provide detailed cross-sectional and long-term data of MLD-associated disease burden in different stages of disease. This data may serve as a reference when analyzing disease- and healthcare burden also after gene-/stem cell-therapy.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13023-025-03637-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Metachromatic leukodystrophy</kwd><kwd>Neurodegenerative disease</kwd><kwd>Disease burden</kwd><kwd>Healthcare utilization</kwd><kwd>Diagnostic pathway</kwd><kwd>Sociomedical aspects</kwd><kwd>Caregivers&#x02019; interviews</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100024091</institution-id><institution>Orchard Therapeutics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;tsklinikum T&#x000fc;bingen (8868)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Institut National de la Sant&#x000e9; et de la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale (INSERM) 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par21">Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an orphan genetic, neurodegenerative, and life-shortening disease due to pathogenic variants in the <italic>ARSA</italic> gene<italic>.</italic> Deficiency of the encoded enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) leads to increased storage of sulfatides in different tissues and causes widespread demyelination of the central and peripheral nerve system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

The &#x0201c;period of diagnosis&#x0201d; was indicated by 68% of the families (FC) as the &#x0201c;most burdensome period of the disease&#x0201d;, which is remarkable in that the period of the "final stage", which is known to be very stressful, was practically not indicated as such. Diagnostic procedures included measurement of enzyme activity (ARSA) and sulfatide storage in urine, as well as molecular genetic testing and cMRI.

Other procedures, in part quite invasive, such as NCV or lumbar puncture, or poorly specific such as EEG, played a minor role. In fact, they are not essential for the diagnosis of MLD. In order to streamline diagnostic procedures in leukodystrophies, more invasive and poorly specific investigation tools could be omitted in the future.</p><p id="Par62">In a former study, we could show, that time to diagnosis proved to be &#x0201c;long and distressing&#x0201d; (rating scale for parents: 9.3/10 scoring points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

But two-thirds of the patients required regular mucus suction and over a quarter of patients had additional oxygen need, consistent with what is reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Respiratory failure has been described in late stages of LI MLD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Additional oxygen demand and abnormal vital parameters most likely mark a final stage of the disease.</p><p id="Par65">Interestingly, deterioration or loss of motor function did not strongly correlate with reported reduced <bold>general condition</bold>. Further, absence of pain was more relevant in terms of overall satisfaction than motor ability was. Pain became less with disease progression in more than half of the patients (FC), but in another quarter of patients, it was reported as more severe with disease duration. Less pain might be due to use of analgesics, and/or receding neuropathic pain with increasing severity of neuropathy, but it is a limitation of this study that the exact causes of pain and its dynamics were not investigated in more detail. In our experience, pain must be considered as major burden of the disease. Pain is reported in the literature with variable frequency dependent on the stage and form of MLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. So, management of MLD must focus on detecting the sources of pain and sufficient (analgetic) treatment. This concerns disease aspects such as obstipation, bowel obstruction, neuronal bladder dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, toothache, spasticity, joint dislocation, or bone fracture due to osteopenia, but also pain due to adverse drug effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par66"><bold>Drug</bold> use and burden due to medication were observed to increase with advancing disease stage<bold>.</bold> In general, spasmolytics and gastrointestinal drugs were the most frequently used drugs, followed by analgesics and sedatives. (<italic>Note</italic><italic>: </italic><italic>Vigabatrin was classified as a spasmolytic since it was used because of its antispastic and not its antiepileptic effects)</italic>. Van Haren et al. list Amitryptiline, Baclofen, Diazepam and Gabapentin (alphabetical listing) as &#x0201c;common symptomatic medication&#x0201d; against pain and spasticity in leukodystrophy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This corresponds to our findings with the exception of Amitryptiline, which played no relevant role.</p><p id="Par67">Concerning spasticity, intrathecal baclofen in MLD has been shown to be a&#x0201d;feasible therapy to improve daily care and comfort&#x0201d;, and authors underline that it should be considered early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">The high prevalence of gastrointestinal drugs in this study reflects the burden caused by neuropathic gastrointestinal problems discussed above. This is in line with what is reported and recommended in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], e.g. increased hydration, stool softener and laxatives (e. g. Polyethylene glycol) and the use of Omeprazole as an effective drug against gastroesophageal reflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A recent large study of a caregiver assessment in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD) indicates the importance of these drugs, as 60% of the patients took vitamins and supplements, and 45% medication against constipation, which both were more frequent than antispastic drugs (39%) or anticonvulsants (14%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In contrast, authors of a caregiver survey of MLD in the UK/Ireland report muscle relaxants, pain medication and anti-secretion medication as more frequent (each 88%) than gastrointestinal drugs (63%) in ten LI patients, which could be an effect of the smaller group and younger age (median 5.6&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">Anticonvulsants belonged in our cohort to less frequently used drugs, as epilepsy, known as a late-onset symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], occurred in about half of patients only. Of note, however, if epilepsy was manifest, more than one anticonvulsant was needed, indicating that epilepsy could be difficult to treat. In our FC, Clobazam, Levetiracetam and Phenobarbital were the most frequently used anticonvulsants, while Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine, and Valproic were less used. This is in contrast with what was mentioned in another survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Authors recommend the use of drugs &#x0201c;capable of concomitantly treating seizures along with other comorbid symptoms to avoid polypharmacy&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our cohort, this was true for Vigabatrin or Gabapentin, for example. The minor role of Botulinum-toxin injections and its relatively poor effect in this study may be due to advanced structural limb contractures in most patients. Some authors propose focal Botulinum toxin to improve hygiene (M. adductor) or ambulation (M. gastrocnemius) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. But, there is a recent report on the risk of inducing overall weakness as adverse drug effect in a LI child after gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We think it is worth discussing the early use of botulinum toxin with the primary aim of pain prevention, reducing spasms, or improving manageability.</p><p id="Par70">The burden of <bold>hospitalization</bold> is expressed by number and duration of inpatient stays as well as number of outpatient visits. Our data show on average about one inpatient stay per patient per year, which is similar to results of a recent survey on 98 patients with Krabbe disease over a period of seven years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For MLD, two hospitalizations in the previous year (median) were reported in 31 MLD patients of an international survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and 3 hospitalizations respectively for 8 LI MLD patients from UK/Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Duration of inpatient stays on average was about one week (excluding rehabilitation stays), similar to what has been reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Costs for the healthcare system concerning inpatient care of leukodystrophy patients in comparison to other care forms have been described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par71">The observation that the most common reason for an inpatient stay is related to the diagnosis was quite unexpected, since the patient group described here (FC) was diagnosed within the last 10&#x000a0;years. One could have expected that easier access to genetic diagnostics and the broader knowledge of MLD, which has received some attention in recent years, would significantly shorten the time to diagnosis. Although the aim remains to counsel families in detail, it also remains a goal to shorten inpatient stays for diagnosis.</p><p id="Par72">A survey of Krabbe patients found that epilepsy treatment was among the most common reasons for hospital admission (along with failure to feed or thrive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is in contrast to our data in MLD, in which hospital admissions due to epilepsy treatment were less common.</p><p id="Par73">Number of annual outpatient hospital visits in our cohort (range up to 5) corresponds well to what was shown for 5 German MLD patients taking part in an international study, while there were much higher numbers of median outpatient visits in the previous 12&#x000a0;months for other countries (for example in the median 43 for France (range 2&#x02013;200) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] or 12 (range up to 40) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and 18 (range up to 100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] for the UK. The lower numbers for outpatient appointments in the German cohort may be related to the fact that in Germany this only refers to visits at the doctor&#x02019;s (no therapist contacts or contacts with the palliative care team). Bonkowsky et al. described the important role of the local pediatrician in managing the case, mediating between parents and specialists, and in preventing complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In Germany, this may be the task of a social pediatric center (&#x0201c;SPZ&#x0201d;), while local pediatricians rather are responsible for vaccinations and treatment of infections as shown in our study. Some authors recommend that medical visits in leukodystrophy patients should be &#x0201c;scheduled at last every 6&#x000a0;months&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;reassess and reprioritize care needs&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. But others point out that frequent doctor contacts are stressful for parents and have an impact on the quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">The wide use of <bold>devices</bold> in our cohorts during the patients` disease, also illustrates the high burden of this disease. While in patients with genetically determined leukoencephalopathy, a &#x0201c;lower health-related quality of life&#x0201d; was shown in children &#x0201c;using a wheelchair&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], the general &#x0201c;benefit from orthotics and mobility equipment&#x0201d; has been underlined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In order to assist mobility, the use of devices such as orthoses, gait trainers, walkers, lifts, and standing frames in leukodystrophy patients is recommended in a revised consensus statement on care of leukodystrophy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Consistent with the progressive nature of the disease course in MLD, some assistive devices are useful early in the disease course (e.g., walking frames), but no are longer used when disease progresses and will be replaced by others. Accordingly, we could show in both our cohorts that during the disease course there was a change from more &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; devices (such as orthoses, walker, walking trainer, active wheelchair, Motomed<sup>R</sup>, talker, etc.) to more &#x0201c;passive&#x0201d; devices. Passive devices included standing frames, toilet carts, lifts, and any ridable (mobile) seats, cushions for positioning the whole body in a prone or supine position, care beds, as well as devices supporting vital function (cough-assist, oxygen, suction). With regard to the rapid progression of MLD, also in later onset forms, once independent walking is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we emphasize the need to &#x0201c;plan ahead&#x0201d; when providing assistive devices. We also could show that the absolute number of devices used decreases in the late stage of the disease, when the patients could no longer use certain aids at all (such as devices for mobility or devices for verticalization such as sitting or standing). There seems to be a &#x0201c;maximum&#x0201d; of devices needed before the final stage of the disease. In a recent study on 100 patients with PMD, authors similarly describe the use of devices getting less frequent over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Such detailed data on medical aids during disease course in MLD as in the study presented here have not yet been reported in the literature. As the burden of assistive devices reflects the burden of disease in general, a reduced number of medical aids, and also the use of more &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; devices, might in future be a measure for patients&#x02019; benefit from therapy. This is illustrated in a recent report of a 6-year-old girl with LI MLD after gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] when comparing her use of only single active medical aids with the amount of devices used by the untreated children in our study.</p><p id="Par76"><bold>Supportive therapies</bold> like occupational, physical and speech therapy are recommended for leukodystrophy patients in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Effects are described for example for spasticity management, prevention of scoliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], or to preserve motor skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Physiotherapists play a role in assessing &#x0201c;sensorimotor function, eating and swallowing&#x0201d; and help to ameliorate mobilization and also suggest and check aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, therapists may assess daily activities in post-treatment outcome studies, for example by physical activity scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Physiotherapy was the most commonly applied therapy in general in this study. It can be regarded as the most important therapy right from the beginning for patients with motor onset and for all patients in advanced stages of MLD. In contrast, in a study on PMD patients, authors report on physical exercise in only 77% of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Occupational therapy, early intervention and speech-therapy were less reported after the period of regression. With regard to the time resources of therapy, the therapy-related burden on families becomes clear.</p><p id="Par77">There was the need for <bold>special education</bold> in patients of this study in advanced disease stage 3. The learning environment in the FC was characterized by the need for a support staff in kindergarten/school, special bus transport, the change from regular to special education, or even the dropping-out of any educational system. None of the follow-up patients finished regular school. This fits to what is reported by Thomas et al. for the UK/Ireland (10 LI and 3 EJ MLD patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is consensus that in progressive disorders, school environment has to be carefully &#x0201c;reassessed and adjusted to the child&#x02019;s evolving needs&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Detailed description about learning environment in patients with MLD or other leukodystrophies in literature is scarce.</p><p id="Par78">As special education consumes significant public resources, it is worth noting that even day-to-day care for children in special-needs institutions did not prevent parents from quitting their jobs, because their work was no longer compatible with caring for the severely affected child.</p><p id="Par79">Patients of the FC required broad <bold>sociomedical support</bold> with all relevant items for severe disability on the ID card. They also received the highest level of care and the highest financial support in the healthcare system. Parents addressed the need of a full-time caregiver, as described in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Daily home-nursing and weekly palliative care were considered as the most helpful support from the parents&#x02019; point of view. There was a tendency that families with older children sought support from volunteers, neighborhood, and friends, while families with younger children were supported by family members. Nursery hours were comparable (on average slightly below) to what was reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For some families, some relevant costs of care and equipment were not covered by the healthcare system. Even more impact had the financial loss due to extended parental leave or because parents had to quit their jobs to care for their sick child. Other authors also described a degradation in employment status because of a child&#x02019;s illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. (This point becomes particularly relevant when the situation persists over a long period of time or when caring for a child of a late-onset MLD form in an advanced disease stage.)</p><p id="Par80">Only a quarter of the affected children in the FC &#x0201c;actively&#x0201d; participated in <bold>family life</bold> (e. g. were fed on family meals), but most children retained a "passive" participation (e. g., were present at family meals, but were fed afterwards), and only a few did no longer participate in family life (e. g. were fed independently of family meals or activity by nursing staff). Children in an advanced disease stage could no longer communicate verbally, but communicated in a non-verbal manner through pointing, facial expressions or gestures, or even "indirectly" via pain expression or with vegetative reactions. The difference between complete absence of communication and the preserved ability to communicate &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; has been shown to be critical for quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Only half of the children had social contacts beyond family life and school, for example with neighbors or friends. In other studies, parents and other family members also reported limitations in their social activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Nearly 75% of families indicated &#x0201c;fear of the future&#x0201d; as most burdensome, while the items &#x0201c;seeing the child suffer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;daily workload&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;nursing&#x0201d; played a minor role. These data reflect the burden of the disease from an individual perspective of parents and families, beyond what is described for healthcare utilization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par81">Diagnostic procedures and routine therapeutic pathways in MLD as well as sociomedical support require intensive healthcare resources. Our data illustrate the extent of hospitalization, home/palliative-care, and socio-medical support in children with late infantile and juvenile MLD in Germany. We also give detailed insight into MLD-related drugs, devices, supportive therapies, and learning environment. These data describe the high burden of MLD for patients and their families and will help to analyze families&#x02019; needs.
