Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved for use in prevention of episodic migraines. Erenumab (AMG334), fremanezumab (TEV48125), and galcanezumab (LY2951742) are monthly subcutaneous injections, while eptinezumab (ALD403) provides an intravenous infusion option. This review aims to examine the clinical evidence for the safety and efficacy of CGRP-targeted mAbs in the prevention of episodic migraines with a focus on recent studies (2023&#x02013;2024).</p></sec><sec><title>Recent Findings</title><p id="Par2">Long-term studies reveal ongoing safety and efficacy in recent literature for all 4 monoclonal antibodies. These investigations have built evidence for earlier access to CGRP treatment as they increase quality of life and reduce monthly migraine days while being better tolerated than non-specific migraine preventative therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p id="Par3">These studies support the recent 2024 AHS consensus statement recommending CGRP monoclonal antibodies be considered as first-line preventive treatment in episodic migraine.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists</kwd><kwd>Episodic migraine</kwd><kwd>Erenumab</kwd><kwd>Fremanezumab</kwd><kwd>Galcanezumab</kwd><kwd>Eptinezumab</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">According to Burch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the prevalence and impact of migraine in the United States affects almost 20% of the population and is female predominant. Attacks can cause severely disabling head pain generally characterized by light/sound sensitivity and/or nausea and can be accompanied by visual, sensorimotor, vestibular, and language symptoms. The headache characteristically lasts at least 4 hours and up to 3 days without treatment, with longer duration headaches being characterized as status migrainosus. Disability has historically been defined by scoring questionnaires, for example, the Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire (MIDAS) with a score of 11 or more as the threshold of significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and the Headache Test (HIT-6) with a score of &#x0003e;&#x02009;50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">While migraine non-specific therapies offered relief in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a new drug target was identified when animal research identified neurogenic inflammation and abnormal trigeminovascular activation as key mechanisms in migraine. The CGRP peptide was identified as a potential culprit, recognized as the most &#x0200b;&#x0200b;abundant neuropeptide in human trigeminal ganglia found in up to half of those neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It was found to play a central role in downstream vasodilatory changes and peripheral and central sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Two primary therapeutic approaches have since emerged: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small-molecule antagonists (-gepants).</p><p id="Par6">Literature up to 2022 has diligently summarized CGRP-mABs in this use case including the American Headache Society Society Consensus Statement 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and Guidelines by the European Headache Federation reviewed 15 studies in episodic migraines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are also multiple review papers on this topic including one published in 2021 out of India looking at CGRP mAbs in episodic migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and another larger scale review from Cohen et.al in 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] which commented on mAbs and small molecules in both episodic migraines and chronic migraines. In 2024, CGRP-targeted migraine therapies are now a mainstay in modern-day migraine prevention and in this review, we will further specifically focus on the evidence for episodic migraine (&#x0003c;&#x02009;15 days per month). Specifically, we intend to provide an update with tables showing episodic migraine studies with a focus on the primary endpoint of monthly migraine days (MMD) when possible, and then discuss a few specific trials, particularly more recent data that supports updates to recent guidelines (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

This study, HER-MES, had 777 participants and observed for erenumab effect compared with the current standard of care topiramate therapy. Agent selection was important as topiramate is one of the most commonly chosen first-line preventative drugs. Erenumab gave 55% of patients&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50 reductions in monthly migraine days versus only 31% in the topiramate group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

It showed a sustained one year benefit of using erenumab compared to non-specific oral migraine preventative medications in 621 patients. This was the first multicenter randomized control trial to practically compare an anti-CGRP mAb vs. traditional oral therapies in patients who had failed 1&#x02013;2 preventative agents. The results established evidence for the earlier use of CGRP therapies to avoid chronification of migraine. APPRAISE showed 56% of patients treated with erenumab reduced monthly migraine days by over half, while in non-specific medications, only 16% achieved this reduction. In addition, patients&#x02019; subjective reports that erenumab was more efficacious was aligned with high PGIC (patient global impression of change) scales&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5 at one year tallying 76% in the CGRP group vs. lower scores of 18% in the non-specific treatment group. Beyond establishing efficacy, this study showed ongoing adherence to erenumab after 1 year with only 2.2% requiring a medication switch vs.the non-specific group at 34.6%. Discontinuation rates with erenumab were also favorable with 2.9% electing to stop treatment due to adverse events versus 23.3% from the non-specific medications group. Ultimately, no new safety risks were identified in the erenumab group compared to prior literature. Erenumab showed sustained long-term benefit starting early at 4 weeks and continuing through the 12 month time period. This data demonstrates additional findings that support for erenumab to be offered earlier in a patient&#x02019;s treatment course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The LIBERTY Study observed efficacy and safety for the use of erenumab in episodic migraine, in 2024, an update to this was published after in which 168 participants could enter the open label extension phase (OLEP) to receive 140mg erenumab once monthly for 3 years with &#x02265;&#x02009;50% reduction in monthly migraine days, change from baseline, and tolerability/safety as the primary metrics. For the continuous erenumab group, 35/117 were &#x02265;&#x02009;50% responders after 12 weeks of double blind treatment around 3/4th of that group had continued response of &#x02265;&#x02009;50% reduction in monthly migraine days at least half of OLEP, which put the overall sustained benefit number at 26/117. However, for those who had enough time to benefit from erenumab in the initial 12 week treatment, when kept on erenumab, 20.7% converted to having&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50% reduction in monthly migraine days showing if given more time on the medication, this improved to 43/117 response rate. For those who had been placebo treated then switched to ereneumab, but not responded by the 12 weeks time point, ongoing therapy converted 40.5% of participants into responders in the OLEP visits. Therefore, from the start of the study to the end of the total participants the mean (SD) MMD change from baseline over 3 years was &#x02212;&#x02009;4.4 [3.9] days at week 168. The safety events and adverse drug effect profile was similar to earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">At present, there are no migraine-specific preventive therapies approved for children or adolescents with migraine, but erenumab is under active investigation for use in the pediatric population ages 9&#x02013;17. Hershey et al., conducted a phase 1 randomized open-label multiple-dose study in children and adolescents published in February 2024. They did an analysis of treatment-emergent events, vital signs, ECG, clinical labs, neurologic assessments, and pharmacokinetic concentrations of the drug. Although this was a small study with 53 participants, the pharmacokinetics and safety of erenumab in pediatric patients was consistent with adults allowing for weight differences. While efficacy was not evaluated in this study, an exploratory endpoint of PedMIDAS total score (modified pediatric migraine disability assessment) did show erenumab reduced migraine disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], suggesting erenumab may be safe and effective for use in the pediatric population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Galcanezumab</title><p id="Par13">Galcanezumab has been shown in many studies to be both safe and effective since 2022, this has been demonstrated in multiple international populations highlighting its potential impact on migraine disability world-wide. In 2022, Kim et al, published a population-based study in South Korean patients as a post-hoc analysis of the EVOLVE-2 phase 3 trial of galcanezumab. Specifically, 98 participants in the intent-to-treat population were compared to placebo with low and high-dose galcanezumab. In a 6 month period, only the higher 240mg dose of galcanezumab resulted in a significant reduction from baseline in mean number of monthly migraine days, however, in the all-patients population, both doses were effective. Acute medication use was also evaluated and showed both doses resulted in a significantly higher reduction from baseline with acute medication use compared to placebo, which was consistent with the all-patient&#x02019;s population. Finally, for patient-reported outcomes, galcanezumab low dose treatment resulted in an increase from baseline mean MSQ RF-R score compared to placebo. Interestingly, the higher dose was not significantly different from placebo; however, in the all-patient group both doses were effective. In terms of MIDAs and PGI-Scores scores in the Korean population, neither dose made a significant difference which again was contrary to the all-patients group in which both doses significantly reduced scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

Finally, eptinezumab is being examined in the context of refractory migraine cases and will look at the induction properties of PACAP-38.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>American Headache Society Consensus Statement Update</title><p id="Par25">Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are clearly an effective tool for the treatment of migraine based on the breadth of studies showing their utility. Since the initial 2021 American Headache Society (AHS) consensus statement, typically CGRP agents have been used in adult patients who failed to tolerate or respond to at least 2 migraine non-specific medications. Clinical trials, including phases II and III, have consistently shown that CGRP mAbs are both effective and well-tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As more research accumulates, the most pressing current question facing providers, insurers and patients are in regards to access and whether sooner access is warranted.
</p><p id="Par26">More recent studies that have evaluated the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies as a class have also yielded some notable findings supporting earlier access. A more recent 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, and erenumab, showed that when compared to placebo, there was statistically significant differences decreasing numbers of patients with medication overuse or medication overuse headache when using triptans or multiple drugs, albeit, not simple analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Roblee et. al looked at RCTs of CGRP mAbs, topiramate and divalproex in a meta-analysis, to evaluate the evidence for stepped care, which is the current setup for most insurance plans, requiring multiple preventive trials before CGRP mAbs may be used. The study found that there is high certainty that the mAbs are more effective than placebo, as are topiramate and divalproex, but that these oral anti-epileptic options are less tolerated and supporting first line preventive access to CGRP mAbs for patients, as they are likely just as effective, with better side effect profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Finally, a 2024 prospective study with the largest to date study population of 5818 patients showed that over half of patients treated with CGRP mAbs had a 50% or more reduction in monthly headache days. Notably, it also showed that unilateral pain, less monthly migraine days and lower disability at baseline was more likely to predict a better treatment response and thus suggests that earlier access to this treatment option would increase chance of success, treating patients before migraines become more highly disabling and frequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">As a result of the ongoing accumulation of data, the AHS updated their 2024 consensus statement to now recommend that monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor, including erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, or eptinezumab, should be considered as first-line options in patients with episodic migraine with or without aura (4&#x02013;14 MMDs) based upon ICHD-3 criteria with at least moderate disability (MIDAS score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;11 or HIT-6 score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. How insurance plans may adjust in the future is yet to be determined, but for patients suffering from migraine, easier access to effective, well-tolerated medications for migraine prevention would be welcomed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>This paper was written together with both authors working on the main manuscript and portions of the tables.
