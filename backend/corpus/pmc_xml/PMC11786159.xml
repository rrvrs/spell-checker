She noticed rhinorrhea from her left nostril. One month earlier, she had visited a local doctor because she had a headache and fever, and she was treated with antibiotics. However, the rhinorrhea persisted, and a CSF leak was suspected. A lumbar puncture was performed, and there were no findings suggestive of meningitis.</p><p id="para0008">Head CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to identify the site of the CSF leak. CT revealed that bilateral cribriform plates were unclear, and a soft tissue density protruded from the cribriform plate in both olfactory fissures, with left-sided predominance. There was an air-fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus; therefore, left-sided CSF leakage was suspected. MRI showed hyperintensity on coronal T2-weighted images (T2WI) in the left olfactory fissure, and a fluid component was suspected. Three-dimensional (3D) MR cisternography showed a high signal intensity in the right olfactory fissure, continuous with the subarachnoid space, and an unclear fluid signal in the left olfactory fissure. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images (Gd-T1WI) showed meningoceles protruding from the cribriform plate in both olfactory fissures. MRI was performed approximately 3 h after CT, and the amount of fluid in the left sphenoid sinus increased over this short period of time, a finding that was thought to reflect persistent leakage (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A).<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1A</label><caption><p><bold>CT (</bold>a) Oblique coronal plane aligned perpendicular to the base of the skull.

A soft tissue density protruded from the cribriform plate in both olfactory fissures with left-sided predominance, which may have indicated the site of leakage (a-d).

She had persistent nasal discharge, and CSF leakage had been suspected for 4 years. Because she did not request further investigation, she had not received treatment. Head CT and MRI were performed subsequently, when the patient requested detailed examination and treatment. Head CT revealed a soft tissue density in the left olfactory fissure continuous with the left cribriform plate, and there was an air-fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus. Head MRI showed high signal intensity in the left olfactory fissure on coronal T2WI, suggesting a fluid component. 3D-MR cisternography also showed a fluid signal in the left olfactory fissure, but its continuity with the arachnoid space was unclear (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A).<fig id="fig0002"><label>Fig. 2A</label><caption><p><bold>CT</bold>.

CSF leakage requires the presence of bone defects and meningeal defects, and HRCT mainly evaluates bone defects [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>].</p><p id="para0013">According to a recent meta-analysis, the sensitivity of HRCT for nasal discharge caused by CSF leakage is 75.5 %, and the specificity is approximately 85 % [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Additionally, HRCT has the advantage of being non-invasive and relatively inexpensive, and is quickly and easily accessible compared with MRI [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is easy to identify a large bone defect with HRCT, but it is difficult to find bone defects that measure &#x0003c; 2 mm [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in cases of CSF leakage from the cribriform plate, the bone defect may be small, and the only finding may be a local soft tissue density in the olfactory fissure, or a meningocele [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, it is not uncommon to see thinning or separation of bones at the base of the skull [<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish between bone defects indicative of active leakage from thinning or separation of bones without pathological significance [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="para0014">MRI is useful for evaluating the content of soft tissue density lesions seen on CT [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In other words, if it can be confirmed that the CSF intensity continues outside the skull on T2WI, there is a possibility of CSF leakage. It is also important to evaluate whether a meningocele is accompanied by brain herniation [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to conventional 2-dimensional T2WI, there are also reports that 3D-MR cisternography is useful to depict the continuity of the CSF intensity from the subarachnoid space to the extracranial space [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, 3D-MR cisternography can cause false-positive or false-negative results due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts; therefore, this imaging technique should be used as a complement to conventional 2-dimensional T2WI [<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The reported sensitivity of MRI is 89 %, which can be increased to 96 % when combined with CT because these imaging techniques can complement each other [<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="para0015">An air-fluid level in the sinuses near the fistula can be seen with both CT and MRI, which can indirectly suggest the presence of CSF leakage. However, it should be noted that the sinus area often has fluid accumulation due to inflammatory changes [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="para0016">CT cisternography, intrathecal Gd-enhanced MR cisternography, and radionuclide cisternography are invasive tests in which contrast agents and radionuclides are administered into the subarachnoid space. With CT cisternography and intrathecal Gd-enhanced MR cisternography, it is possible to identify fistulas where contrast medium leaks from the subarachnoid space. The reported sensitivity of CT cisternography is 85 %-92 % for active leaks and 40 % for inactive leaks [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The reported sensitivity of Gd-enhanced MR cisternography is 87 %-100 % for active leaks and 70 % for inactive leaks [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and some studies report that Gd-enhanced MR cisternography is superior to CT cisternography [<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, although the safety of administering Gd contrast agents into the subarachnoid space has been suggested, this procedure has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although radionuclide cisternography can be used to assess the presence or absence of leakage, it is difficult to identify fistulas with this method owing to resolution issues [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The reported sensitivity of radionuclide cisternography is 28 %-76 % [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="para0017">In Case 1, tiny bone defects were suspected in bilateral cribriform plates, and there were soft tissue densities in both olfactory fissures on CT. Although 3D-MR cisternography showed continuous CSF intensity from the subarachnoid space to the right olfactory fissure, the CSF intensity was unclear on the left side. The indistinct CSF signals on 3D-MR cisternography were thought to be due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts because coronal T2WI revealed high signals in the left olfactory fissure. Because the fluid accumulation in the sphenoid sinus was localized to the left side, we were able to diagnose CSF leakage from the left olfactory fissure. Furthermore, Gd-T1WI performed to evaluate intracranial infections showed the meninges falling through the fistula, which may be a direct finding associated with a fistula [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this case, although abnormalities in bilateral cribriform plates were suspected on imaging, the presence of the clinical symptom of left-sided nasal discharge and the indirect finding of fluid accumulation in the left sphenoid sinus enabled the diagnosis of active CSF leakage from the left cribriform plate.</p><p id="para0018">In Case 2, although the fistula was tiny, we suspected a fistula because a bone defect and soft tissue density attached to the left cribriform plate were visible with CT. We suspected the presence of the fistula because the soft tissue density in the left olfactory fissure on CT showed CSF signals on MRI although 3D-MR cisternography could not visualize continuity between the CSF signals and the subarachnoid space. We also identified an air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus on the affected side and changes in the amount of liquid in a relatively short period, which we consider an indirect finding suggesting active CSF leakage. We detected fluid accumulation in the sphenoid sinus on the affected side, which indirectly supported CSF leakage.</p><p id="para0019">In conclusion, fistulas leading to CSF leakage from the cribriform plate may be small, making diagnosis difficult. Accurate radiological diagnosis can be made by combining multiple findings on CT and MRI. Additionally, informing the surgeon of the fistula site before surgery can contribute to treatment.</p><sec id="sec0006"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="para0020">This study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0007"><title>Patient consent</title><p id="para0021">Written informed consents were obtained from the patients for publication of their anonymized information in this article.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zapalac</surname><given-names>J.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Marple</surname><given-names>B.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwade</surname><given-names>N.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Skull base cerebrospinal fluid fistulas: a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm</article-title><source>Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg</source><volume>126</volume><issue>6</issue><year>2002</year><fpage>669</fpage><lpage>676</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12087336</pub-id>
