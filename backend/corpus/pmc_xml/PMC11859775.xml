To that end, phenyl 4-(2-oxo-3-alkylimidazolidin-1-yl)benzenesulfonates (PAIB-SOs) were recently prepared to fulfill some of the unmet needs with classic chemotherapeutics. PAIB-SOs are prodrugs bioactivated into potent antimitotics by the cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), which is a frequent enzyme in resistant BC cells, but mostly missing in normal cells. Our screening program studies of PAIB-SO chemolibraries selected three prototypical PAIB-SOs as antimitotic prodrugs amenable for studies using BC animal models. <bold>Methods</bold>: Healthy female CD1<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> IGS mice were treated with three prototypical PAIB-SOs, namely CEU-835, -934, and -938, for the determination of their toxicity and half-lives.

Moreover, the half-life of CEU-835, -934, and -938 administered intravenously in healthy CD1<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> IGS female mice were 8.1, 23.2, and 21.5 h, respectively.

Introduction</title><p>Breast cancers (BCs) are a major public health issue, despite significant progress in recent decades. They are the most common female cancers diagnosed, and the second cause of death from cancer among women worldwide [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. BCs are a group of mammary gland diseases, notably characterized by abnormal cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and defective apoptosis signaling, which may induce metastasis at later stages [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Current therapies for BCs include tumor resection, mastectomy, radiation, immunotherapy, and various chemotherapies [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The latter include molecules such as the classic hormone therapy with tamoxifen and the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel. Unfortunately, the currently available anticancer armamentarium is unable to cure all forms of BC. As chemoresistance and metastasis emerge, more potent drugs exhibiting collaterally more side effects become required [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the development of medicines precisely targeting these aggressive BC cells also exhibiting reduced deleterious effects in patients is vital [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The use of rationally designed cytotoxic prodrugs provides a compelling approach to target cancer tumors without harming normal cells. Prodrugs are molecules exhibiting no or only modest pharmacological activities that are bioactivated either by enzymes and/or an appropriate chemical environment (e.g., acidic environment and hypoxia) [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The prodrug bioactivation into active metabolites by cancer cells reduces systemic side effects of antineoplastics, allowing higher doses of the drug to be administered safely. In this context, the detoxifying enzyme named cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) has been confirmed as overexpressed in several cancers such as lung [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], digestive tract [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and breast cancers [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CYP1A1 is modestly or unexpressed in healthy tissues such as lungs [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], digestive tract [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and normal breast tissues [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], fostering the design of prodrugs based on the oxidative activity of that enzyme to kill selectively BC cells. To that end, (2S)-2,6-diamino-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-[4-(5-fluoro-2-benzothiazolyl)-2-methylphenyl]hexanamide dihydrochloride (Phortress, <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00233-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and (2S)-2,6-diamino-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-[4-(5-amino-6,8-difluoro-7-methyl-4-oxochroman-2-yl)-2-fluorophenyl]hexanamide dimethanesulfonate (AFP464, <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00233-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were prepared.

The mechanism of bioconversion of PAIB-SOs into PIB-SOs by CYP1A1 was confirmed, notably by a competition assay using known CYP1A1 inhibitors, their antiproliferative activity against cells transfected to overexpress CYP1A1, their apparent substrate affinity for CYP1A1, and their in vitro bioactivation in the presence of human CYP1A1 Supersomes&#x02122; [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It involves a C-hydroxylation mechanism on the alkyl side chain on the carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen atom of the imidazolidin-2-one moiety of PAIB-SOs, followed by a spontaneous <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-dealkylation of the carbinolamine-like intermediates [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast to Phortress and AFP464, PAIB-SOs show antimicrotubule activity instead of alkylating activity [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

These key differences between their mechanism of action and their impact on CYP1A1 expression suggest that PAIB-SOs may also exhibit a completely different toxicity profile or pattern on normal tissues and organs than Phortress and AFP464. PAIB-SO derivatives exhibit in vitro antiproliferative activities in the nanomolar range. Likewise, the known antimitotics used to treat BCs block the cell cycle progression in the G2/M phase, inhibit the tubulin polymerization, and disrupt the microtubule dynamics, ultimately leading to cell death through apoptosis [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Unfortunately, it showed a short retention time in mice (&#x02264;6 h), as well as a limited retention time in tumoral tissues (&#x0003c;6 h).

All of the animals were injected intravenously in the caudal vein biweekly (twice a week) for three weeks with a volume of 4 mL/kg for PAIB-SOs, vehicle or NaCl 0.9%. The NaCl 0.9% group was used to evaluate the effect of intravenous administration and animal handling, while the vehicle group was used to evaluate the effect of excipients. Each dose injected for CEU-835, -934, and -938 were 10, 15.6, and 3.6 mg/kg, respectively, corresponding to the maximum solubility of PAIB-SOs in the vehicle. The adverse effects were recorded for a 6 h period after each administration including abnormal movements, breathing, coordination, dermatitis, eye color, hydration, hyperactivity, inflammation, injuries, repetitive behavior, self-grooming activities, and skin color. The cumulative adverse effects were recorded before the end of the protocol, one week following the last administration, including all of the side effects listed above and the presence of masses, weight loss, and possible signs of pain. At the end of the protocol, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and they underwent a terminal cardiac puncture. Blood samples from three mice for each condition were preserved for evaluation of the total blood count. Then, still under anesthesia, the animals were euthanatized by decapitation, and a necropsy, as well as a macroscopic visual analysis of the liver, kidneys, and lungs were performed to assess the presence of necrosis and hemorrhages. Briefly, the thoracic cavity was opened and fixed over the animal&#x02019;s head. The excess skin covering the peritoneum was resected for better visualization of the peritoneal cavity. The general appearance of the organs was evaluated macroscopically for the detection of necrotic tissue, hemorrhages, and other abnormalities in both the thoracic and the peritoneal cavities. Subsequently, the lungs, kidneys, and liver were analyzed ex vivo. The macroscopic analysis of organs was performed, including color, form, size, and presence or absence of necrotic tissues. Images of organs were recorded and then validated by the animal facilities coordinator. Blood was analyzed in triplicate for a total blood count by the Hematological service platform of Centre de Recherche du CHU de Qu&#x000e9;bec-Universit&#x000e9; Laval.

In summary, with the exception of CEU-835 for the percentage of eosinophil cells, the multi-intravenous administrations of PAIB-SOs showed no statistically significant difference for all the analyzed parameters of hematological total blood count profiles as compared to control groups. Thus, it was concluded that no major apparent health issues were associated with the acute and subacute systemic administrations of CEU-835, -934, and -938.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-pharmaceutics-17-00233"><title>3.3. The Microscopical Observation of Liver, Kidneys and Lungs of Healthy Mice Treated with CEU-835, -934 and -938 Show Normal Histological Morphology</title><p>Histological analyses of dissected tissues were performed to detect microscopic anomalies or potential signs of toxicity derived from multi-intravenous administrations of CEU-835, -934, and -938 (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00233-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained liver sections from mice treated with 0.9% NaCl showed normal hepatic architecture, including well-defined blood vessels (red arrows), hepatocytes with abundant cytoplasm, and binucleated hepatocytes that are characteristic of this cell type. Liver sections from mice treated with either the vehicle, CEU-835, -934, or -938 were normal in appearance and similar to those treated with 0.9% NaCl. The analyzed kidney sections from CD1<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> IGS female mice treated with 0.9% NaCl exhibit normal structural organization including a uniform distribution of glomeruli (blue arrows) and renal tubulointerstitium (green arrows), as well as normal cellular density. No difference in kidney tissue was observed between the groups treated with vehicle, CEU-835, -934, or -938 with that receiving 0.9% NaCl. Finally, stained lung sections from mice treated with 0.9% NaCl show normal distribution and density of parenchyma (light blue arrows), intact bronchoalveolar structures (black arrows) along with blood vessels with typical morphology (red arrows), and do not exhibit abnormal cellular infiltration. These results were also observed in treated groups when treated with either the vehicle, CEU-835, -934, or -938. Altogether, these results show that PAIB-SOs do not induce microscopic or pathological abnormalities in hepatic, renal, and pulmonary tissues.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-pharmaceutics-17-00233"><title>3.4. CEU-835, -934, and -938 Have Systemic Half-Lives Ranging from 8.1 to 23.2 h</title><p>We then studied the systemic half-life of PAIB-SOs CEU-835, -934, or -938 following their single intravenous administration on healthy CD1<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> IGS female mice. Our results show that CEU-835 exhibited the fastest systemic decay of the three molecules tested with a half-life of 8.1 &#x000b1; 1.7 h. CEU-934 and -938 have comparable systemic decays, with half-lives of 23.2 &#x000b1; 4.4 and 21.5 &#x000b1; 1.7 h, respectively. Together, these results suggest that CEU-835, -934, and -938 systemic decays showing half-lives in mice over 8 h is significantly higher than CEU-818, and is favorable for further antitumor studies in mice at the dosage studied in the innocuity studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-pharmaceutics-17-00233"><title>3.5. CEU-835, -934, and -938 Delayed or Decreased Tumor Growth of MCF7 BC Xenografted in Mice</title><p>As shown in our previous studies [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], PAIB-SOs exhibited antimitotic activity in several malignant BC cells that express CYP1A1 including MCF7. Therefore, the antitumoral activity of CEU-835, -934, and -938 was assessed using the murine MCF7 xenograft tumor model, which has been widely used for the assessment of drug antitumor activity for several decades [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the course of the experiments, the three PAIB-SOs significantly reduced or arrested the growth of the tumors as compared to the saline or vehicle control groups (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00233-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). At the end of the experiment, CEU-934 and -938 decreased the initial tumor volume by 25 and 29%, respectively, while CEU-835 limited tumor growth to 51% (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00233-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, saline and the vehicle groups show a similar increase in tumor growth at the endpoint of 357 and 338%, respectively. Finally, the paclitaxel used as a positive control showed a decrease in tumor volume by 50% as compared to the initial tumor volume, which is not statistically different from CEU-835, -934, and -938.</p><p>Moreover, mice showed no significant weight variations throughout the experiment, as well as no significant weight and weight percentage variations between the groups at the end of the experiment (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00233-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Although no significant weight changes were observed in the paclitaxel group, the injection site was irritated, tender, and red for approximatively 24 h after the administration. Furthermore, the first administration of paclitaxel induced soft tissue damage on the mice tails, as well as a vesicant effect and impaired walking for several minutes. None of these side effects were observed for the other experimental groups. Altogether, these results showed that CEU-835, -934, and -938 have potent BC tumor growth inhibition properties, evidencing that their systemic administrations have no major impact on animal weight.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-pharmaceutics-17-00233"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>BCs remain major health issues, despite the commercialization in recent years of new drugs including many targeted therapies. Therefore, there is still a high demand for novel therapeutic strategies for treating unresponsive BC patients. To that end, PAIB-SOs were developed to offer a new treatment alternative to BCs that respond poorly to current therapies or that develop chemoresistance. Moreover, PAIB-SOs are designed to reduce the side effects often found with classic antimitotics by targeting BC cells that express CYP1A1 limiting undesired outcomes in healthy CYP1A1-deficient cells and tissues.</p><p>In a previous screening program, a PAIB-SO referred to as CEU-818 was selected as the most potent [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, its biodistribution and its excretion profiles in healthy OF1 female mice and in female nude mice bearing an MCF7 tumor using <sup>14</sup>C-labeled molecule show a short retention time in mice (&#x02264;6 h) and a limited retention time in the tumor (&#x0003c;6 h) [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, our studies of the concentration&#x02013;response relationship using different time periods evidenced that the antiproliferative activity of PAIB-SOs is concentration and time-dependent, and requires a contact time with BC cells between 24 and 36 h to achieve a significant cytocidal activity [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, to circumvent the suboptimal half-life of CEU-818 in mice that could limit its clinical development, we investigated the effect of the homologation of the alkyl side chain on the free nitrogen atom of the 2-imidazolidone moiety of PAIB-SOs. Our study showed that PAIB-SOs bearing an <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>-hexyl or an <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>-octyl groups were generally inactive at their maximum solubility in our vehicle, while PAIB-SOs bearing an <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>-pentyl group maintained an antiproliferative activity in the nanomolar range and a high selectivity ratio (1&#x02013;3 logs) towards CYP1A1-expressing BC cells. Moreover, our study using mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes evidenced that the hepatic stability of PAIB-SOs is side chain length-dependent; the longer the side chain, the higher the metabolic stability. In addition, pentyl-bearing PAIB-SOs exhibited important antitumor activity on HT-1080 cells stably transfected with CYP1A1 and grafted onto the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM assay) of developing chick embryos and very low toxicity to chick embryos [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, we selected pentyl-bearing PAIB-SOs CEU-835, -934, and -938 for further preclinical studies based on (1) their promising half-lives in mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes, (2) their ability to not generate antimitotic metabolites in presence of hepatic enzymes, (3) their potent antiproliferative activity, (4) their selectivity towards BC cells, and (5) their solubility in the vehicles developed by our research group for intravenous administration. These encouraging properties prompted us to assess the safety profiles, half-life, and the antitumoral activity of selected pentyl-bearing PAIB-SOs on healthy and pathologic mouse models. First, we evidenced in this study that CEU-835, -934, and -938 can be administered safely in healthy mice without systemic and locoregional side effects. No distress behavior, and no abnormalities of thoracic and abdomen organs, nor major changes in blood count quantification, were detected following their repeated systemic administrations. Moreover, the blood count quantification is similar to the controls, and is considered normal according to sources that describe the correlation between total blood count abnormalities and diseases of health conditions in our murine models [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, a slight eosinophilia was detected after CEU-835 administration. Nevertheless, none of the other parameters of the total blood count were altered in the CEU-835 group. Consequently, these results strongly suggest that this eosinophilia is not attributable to a specific immune reaction, to an infection, nor to any other clinical condition, as the animals did not show any other signs of side effects. In addition, the analyses of red blood cells and all their derivatives were found similar to the control groups, suggesting that the systemic administrations of selected pentyl-bearing PAIB-SOs do not cause dehydration, anemia, polycythemia abnormalities, and poikilocytosis defects. Additionally, no coagulation or bleeding problems were detected, since the platelet count and mean platelet volume were similar to the control groups. Finally, the histological analyses of the liver, kidneys, and lungs do not indicate any macroscopic abnormalities or toxicity associated with the administrations of PAIB-SOs. Based on these studies, we therefore concluded that no major apparent health issues or side effects were associated with the acute and the subacute systemic administrations of CEU-835, -934, and -938.</p><p>The second significant finding of our study is that the half-lives of PAIB-SOs were &#x02265;8 h, which is significantly higher than that previously obtained with CEU-818. This increase in half-life is very supportive toward the design of a classic intravenous administration regimen and in line with our results obtained using mouse liver microsomes. Moreover, the half-lives (8.0&#x02013;23.2 h) and the administered doses (3.6&#x02013;15.6 mg/kg~135&#x02013;400 &#x000b5;M in blood) are in agreement with the concentration and contact time with cancer cells required to achieve significant pharmacological activity. Thirdly, our results clearly show that CEU-835, -934, and -938 significantly delayed or decreased the growth of MCF7 tumors in the CD1-<italic toggle="yes">Foxn1<sup>nu</sup></italic> Nude at a ratio comparable to paclitaxel, which is a gold standard treatment for resistant BCs unresponsive to first-line treatments [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-17-00233" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Of note, we had to reduce the dose and the dosage of paclitaxel planned in the first week due to acute and subacute toxicity. Although further biodistribution and biotransformation analysis must be performed, our results strongly suggest that PAIB-SOs are substantially biodistributed within the MCF7 tumor tissue, and that they are bioactivated directly at the tumor site into their potent antimitotic PIB-SO metabolites.</p><p>Finally, our results are in line with the specific CYP1A1-dependent activation mechanism of PAIB-SOs, restricted to cancer cells expressing CYP1A1, and mostly absent in normal healthy tissues. Altogether, our study demonstrated the successful development of pentyl-bearing PAIB-SOs in mice, as new CYP1A1-dependent prodrugs for BC treatments that efficiently decrease BC tumor growth and show no side effects at their pharmacological concentration.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
