We optimized a U-CUP perfusion-based bioreactor method to culture patient-derived primary and metastatic OC specimens, demonstrating that perfusion better preserves cancer cell viability and proliferation, both when fresh and slow-frozen tissues were used. Perfused cultures maintained key microenvironment components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells. Genetic analysis confirmed the retention in culture of tumor-specific driver mutations. We hence challenged ad hoc generated cisplatin-sensitive and resistant OC cells with cisplatin during growth in U-CUP, validating our system for the testing of drug response. Finally, treatment of slow-frozen OC tissues with carboplatin/paclitaxel revealed different degrees of response to treatment, as indicated by variations in tumor necrosis and number of residual PAX8<sup>+</sup> cells, providing the bases for the prompt evaluation of OC standard chemotherapy efficacy in our ex vivo system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>Translational research</kwd><kwd>Cancer models</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This publication was produced by M.D.L., a researcher under a research contract co-funded by the European Union - PON Research and Innovation 2014-2020, pursuant to art. 24, paragraph 3, letter a), of Law no. 240 of December 30, 2010, as amended, and Ministerial Decree no. 1062 of August 10, 2021.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) project IG 2020</institution></funding-source><award-id>24494</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>171037</award-id><award-id>171037</award-id><award-id>171037</award-id><award-id>171037</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN 2022)</institution></funding-source><award-id>202272LY8W</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) project IG 2019</institution></funding-source><award-id>22921</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a significant public health challenge worldwide, with an estimated 314,000 new cases and 207,000 deaths annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Due to its asymptomatic nature in the early stages, the disease is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, contributing to its high mortality rate. As a result, OC is the eighth most common cancer among women and ranks fifth in cancer-related deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The overall 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed at advanced stages (FIGO III-IV) is between 30&#x02013;40%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Current therapeutic strategies include primary or interval cytoreductive surgery, the latter being preceded by at least 3&#x02013;4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite these efforts, high recurrence rates and resistance to standard treatments like platinum-based compounds and taxane remain major obstacles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The addition of anti-angiogenic inhibitors like Bevacizumab has shown promise in primary treatment, but it is not typically used in maintenance therapy, which currently envisions the administration of PARP inhibitors for patients with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, even with these advances, the development of treatment resistance remains a significant challenge, largely due to the high degree of heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The complex TME, comprising cancer-associated fibroblasts that support tumor growth and immune suppression, tumor-associated macrophages promoting inflammation and immune evasion, endothelial cells facilitating angiogenesis, and immune cells influencing tumor progression, plays a crucial role in fostering therapy resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding the TME is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and overcoming treatment resistance.</p><p id="Par3">Traditional in vitro models, such as 2D cultures and 3D spheroids, are limited in their ability to capture the heterogeneity of the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although co-culture systems may help dissect molecular mechanisms, they require labor-intensive processes and still fall short of replicating patient tumor tissue complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. While patient-derived organoids (PDOs) reflect cancer heterogeneity more effectively, they remain limited in recreating the full complexity of the human TME, particularly the lack of stromal cells and the dynamic perfusion of nutrients and waste, leading to inconsistencies in clinical translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, murine patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) require humanized systems to incorporate immune cell components, making them overly time-consuming and costly for high-throughput drug screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A promising innovation that addresses these limitations is the use of perfusion-based bioreactor technology, which has demonstrated an ability to generate tissue constructs with biological and structural characteristics closely resembling original tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Unlike static culture systems, which have limitations in replicating the dynamic aspects of the TME, perfusion-based models allow for continuous nutrient flow and waste removal, more effectively preserving tissue architecture and the microenvironment ex vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Previous studies from our group have shown the suitability of this technology for tumor engineering purposes, further validating its potential in ovarian cancer modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Building on this previous work, we developed ex vivo cultures of patient-derived OC tissues including tubo-ovarian high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) samples and one low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) sample, using the U-CUP bioreactor. We assessed cancer cell viability and TME integrity under ex vivo culture conditions in both Fresh and biobanked Slow-Frozen (SF) specimens. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of standard chemotherapy (SCT) regimen during culture. We demonstrate for the first time that the U-CUP perfusion-based culture maintains ovarian cancer tissue viability and TME architecture and is, thus, a valuable tool for studying not only standard chemotherapy but also for testing novel pharmacological strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Perfusion enhances ex vivo OC tissue preservation and proliferation with respect to static culture</title><p id="Par6">Perfusion-based systems have improved the culturing of several cancer types, with optimal preservation of cellular composition, matrix, and tissue architecture in breast and glioblastoma, as compared to static cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To explore the feasibility of perfused ex vivo cultures of OC, we optimized the U-CUP bioreactor for patient-derived serous OC specimens. Freshly obtained primary tumors and, notably, omental metastases from 5 different patients (Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) were cultured for 6 days in perfusion (Pd6) and static (Sd6) conditions in parallel, to compare OC tissue viability, histological morphology, and proliferation. For each approach, three to five tissue chunks were cultured and compared to the corresponding freshly collected sample (d0), which also consisted of three to five tissue chunks derived from the same initial patient tissue, following standardized sectioning and randomization procedures.</p><p id="Par7">As an indicator of tumor preservation, we first assessed the percentage of neoplastic cell area in the specimens using haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, defined as the area predominantly occupied by cancer cells, excluding tumor stroma and adjacent normal tissue (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1A</xref>).

We ruled out nuclear phenotypic alterations by measuring the nuclear size of PAX8<sup>+</sup> cells. The analysis revealed comparable nuclear sizes across all conditions, including static and perfused samples, relative to uncultured controls (d0) (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>; Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S7</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Moreover, given that insufficient nutrient and oxygen supply can lead to cell death, more likely to occur during in vitro culturing, we evaluated the extent of coagulative necrosis in the cultured tissues. Our attempt was to validate that bioreactor-driven perfusion may help mitigate this issue by ensuring a more efficient supply of medium to the tissue, thereby improving survival and reducing tumor cell death. At day 6, both perfused and static cultures showed a higher median necrosis compared to Fresh (d0) specimens (d0, median 10%; Pd6 median 25%; Sd6 median 57%) (Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), with evident nuclear changes such as pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis.

To assess tissue preservation, we evaluated HE sections and measured the percentage of neoplastic cell area in 10 Fresh and 13 SF specimens derived from 17 patients (Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Histopathologic appearance, including cellular morphology, nuclear integrity, and tissue organization, were comparable between both culture conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Consistent with our comparison (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), we observed an approximate 40% reduction in median neoplastic cell area with respect to d0 for both Fresh and SF settings (Fresh median 43.3%; SF median 40%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), suggesting that slow-freezing and thawing marginally induce further damage to the viable cancer tissue. No differences in tissue preservation were observed when either primary or metastatic tissues were cultured (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Of note, in a small subset of cases (8.7%), we observed an increase in neoplastic tissue area after 6 days in culture compared to d0. Next, we aimed to define the minimal starting neoplastic cell area within the specimen that may guarantee sufficient viable tissue after 6-day culture to permit informative downstream analyses. Specifically, the neoplastic cell area of SF chunks was evaluated upon thawing (SFd0) and after a 6-day culture in U-CUP (SFd6). Our analysis indicated that to obtain a post-perfusion neoplastic cell area of at least 10%, a value we gauged sufficient for downstream evaluations, a minimum of &#x0223c;30% must be present in the thawed SFd0 specimen to ensure a success rate of approximately 80% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).

Indeed, traditional culture systems often fail to replicate the complexity of the TME, leading to the loss of essential stromal and immune components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The superior preservation of neoplastic cells and tissue architecture in perfusion-based models compared to static 3D cultures further underscores the advantages of this approach, as shown in previous work on other tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">The extracellular matrix and the dynamic in vivo microenvironment are key factors in tissue engineering and cancer research. Lutolf and Hubbell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> demonstrated that bioengineered scaffolds can emulate the extracellular matrix in 3D cultures, influencing cell behavior and function. Similarly, Mendoza-Martinez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> stress the need for advanced 3D models that replicate not only cancer cells but also the diverse cellular and extracellular matrix components that influence tumor progression and drug resistance. By better preserving the original TME the U-CUP bioreactor provides an essential model for studying OC biology and treatment responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Dynamic mechanical forces, such as shear stress, are also critical for maintaining tissue viability and function. Huh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> demonstrated that perfusion-based systems preserve tissue functionality by replicating these forces, which mirrors our findings on the ability of the U-CUP system to maintain cancer cell viability and proliferation. As highlighted by Lopez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, incorporating dynamic mechanical factors is essential for accurately modeling the in vivo behavior of OC cells, potentially enabling better prediction of therapeutic responses. These studies collectively support our approach, underscoring the potential of dynamic culture systems for drug testing and personalized medicine.</p><p id="Par29">The maintenance of cell viability and proliferative capacity in slow-frozen tissues addresses a significant limitation in translational research, where access to fresh tissue is often restricted. While freezing can compromise cellular integrity, our study indicates that slow-freezing followed by perfusion-based culture preserves neoplastic cell viability and growth potential, as demonstrated by key biomarkers such as PAX8 and Ki67<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This is a significant advancement for the creation of tissue biobanks and future therapeutic studies. Interestingly, a few cases exhibited increased neoplastic tissue area after 6 days in culture compared to their corresponding d0 samples. While this may reflect randomization-related heterogeneity, it could also suggest that certain highly proliferative tumor samples maintain their growth potential in ex vivo culture.</p><p id="Par30">Further analysis through &#x003b1;SMA and CD31 staining confirmed that the U-CUP bioreactor not only maintains cellular viability but also preserves key stromal and endothelial components. This is particularly important for studying tumor-stroma interactions, which are known to influence therapeutic response and tumor progression in OC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The ability of the U-CUP system to maintain vascular integrity and immune cell viability, even in slow-frozen tissues, expands its utility for investigating angiogenesis and immune cell infiltration. Given that poor responses to immunotherapy in OC have been largely attributed to tumor heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, the need for more representative and reliable models is cogent in the attempt to identify novel biomarkers and testing new therapies to evaluate their preclinical efficacy. Preserved TME components allow for more accurate drug response studies, which is pivotal in assessing patient-specific reactions to chemotherapy. Our study reveals variability in chemotherapy responses among different patient samples, as observed in the differential reduction of neoplastic cell areas and the proliferative index post-treatment. This variability underscores the heterogeneity of OC and highlights the importance of patient-derived models for personalized therapy testing. As noted by Lopez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the heterogeneity of HGSC and the influence of the microenvironment on drug responses necessitate models that closely mimic in vivo conditions. The patient-derived OC models developed in this study offer the potential to optimize individual therapies by improving our ability to predict treatment responses based on the specific characteristics of each patient&#x02019;s tumor.</p><p id="Par31">Furthermore, the limited success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as avelumab, in OC treatment highlights the need for more accurate ex vivo models. Clinical trials have shown no significant improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival with avelumab in advanced-stage or platinum-resistant OC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Our perfusion-based culture system, as indicated by CD45 staining, suggests that some immune cell populations are preserved, offering a platform for further investigation into immune mechanisms within the TME and their role in therapeutic resistance.</p><p id="Par32">However, the system is not without limitations. The observed necrosis in both fresh and frozen tissues after six days suggests that further optimization of perfusion parameters, such as flow rates or nutrient composition, may be necessary to reduce cell death in tissue cores and extend tissue viability. While slow-freezing preserved most TME elements, subtle morphological changes in pericytes associated with endothelial cells suggest that fresh tissues may still be preferable for angiogenesis-focused studies. Optimizing cryopreservation protocols could improve the preservation of TME integrity, particularly in long-term studies.</p><p id="Par33">Relying on patient-derived material presents challenges for drug screening, primarily due to limited tissue availability. Strategies such as the amplification of patient-derived cells, including PDOs and PDXs, could increase material for testing, though they may introduce phenotypic changes over time due to in vitro culture conditions or host interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Integrating microfluidics into culture systems could reduce the required sample size and enhance assay efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Mendoza-Martinez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> similarly advocate for the development of advanced 3D systems, such as microfluidic and hydrogel-based platforms, to improve the fidelity of in vitro models to in vivo tumor conditions.</p><p id="Par34">This study demonstrates that the U-CUP bioreactor effectively supports the ex vivo culture of OC tissues, preserving both neoplastic cells and essential components of the TME from SF specimens. Our results provide clear evidence that perfusion-based systems outperform static cultures in maintaining tissue architecture and cellular viability, making them highly valuable for studying tumor biology and therapeutic responses. The preservation of TME elements, including stromal and immune cells, further solidifies this model utility in translational research, particularly for personalized medicine and therapy evaluation.</p><p id="Par35">By leveraging frozen tissue samples from biobanks, this approach overcomes significant barriers related to tissue availability, offering a practical solution for retrospective drug screening and preclinical testing. This allows the exploitation of these underutilized resources, enabling perspective and retrospective re-evaluations of samples under different therapeutic regimens. Future studies should focus on optimizing perfusion parameters to reduce necrosis, which is essential for maintaining tissue viability and improving the model accuracy in predicting chemotherapy responses. Expanding the sample size to include patients with neoadjuvant treatments and relapses will further strengthen the predictive power of OC U-CUP cultures.</p><p id="Par36">By aligning with established principles of tissue engineering and dynamic culture systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, the U-CUP bioreactor holds substantial promise for advancing our understanding of tumor biology and developing more personalized therapeutic strategies, offering a valuable tool for both academic research and clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>OC tissue collection and preparation for ex vivo culture</title><p id="Par37">Tumor samples were collected from OC patients who underwent upfront surgery (i.e., without prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy or other treatments) as part of standard clinical care.
