Here, we report the 3-year safety and efficacy of fostamatinib in that study. Data from 33 patients who received at least one dose of fostamatinib were analyzed. A platelet response&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50,000/&#x000b5;L (at two consecutive visits at least 28&#x000a0;days apart while receiving fostamatinib) was achieved in 16 patients (48%). The median total duration of a platelet response&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50,000/&#x000b5;L was 589 (range: 106&#x02013;1003)&#x000a0;days. Gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea, hypertension, and hepatic enzyme elevation, were the most common fostamatinib-related adverse events. Most events occurred within 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. No thromboembolisms, treatment-related infections, or moderate or severe treatment-related bleeding events were observed. In summary, this extension study of a clinical trial found a sustained platelet response without new safety signals during 3-year treatment with fostamatinib.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12185-025-03924-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fostamatinib</kwd><kwd>Phase 3 clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Primary immune thrombocytopenia</kwd><kwd>Spleen tyrosine kinase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016288</institution-id><institution>Kissei</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Japanese Society of Hematology 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction and methods</title><p id="Par2">Fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, is an approved treatment for primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

However, further investigations, such as post-marketing surveillance of patients, including those with a thrombotic risk, are warranted.</p><p id="Par17">This study had several limitations. First, only 33 patients were analyzed. Second, the maximum treatment period was 3 years. A longer study with a larger sample is needed to verify our results. In conclusion, this study of fostamatinib treatment for ITP revealed a platelet response for up to 3 years without new safety signals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12185_2025_3924_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 3688 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to sincerely thank all the patients and staff that took part in the study and all the investigators; Tomoki Ito at Kansai Medical University; Shugo Kowata at Iwate Medical University; Yoshihiro Hatta at Nihon University School of Medicine; Katsumichi Fujimaki at Fujisawa City Hospital; Kensuke Naito at Hamamatsu Medical Center; Shingo Kurahashi at Toyohashi Municipal Hospital; Toshiya Kagoo at National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center; Kazuki Tanimoto at Japanese Red Cross Fukuoka Hospital; Hiroshi Kosugi at Ogaki Municipal Hospital; Michiaki Koike at Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital; Yuki Nakajima at Yokohama City University Medical Center; Ryosuke Ogawa at Japan Community Health Care Organization Kyushu Hospital; Hiroshi Harada at Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital; Akira Hangaishi at National Center for Global Health and Medicine; Kenji Yokoyama at Tokai University Hachioji Hospital; Ryuko Cho at Chibaken Saiseikai Narashino Hospital; Katsunori Kyoda at Kouseiren Takaoka Hospital; Atsuo Okamura at Kakogawa Central City Hospital; Yasutaka Kakinoki at Asahikawa City Hospital; Masaki Yamaguchi at Ishikawa Prefectural Central Hospital; Masahiro Yoshida at Osaka City General Hospital; Makoto Yoshimitsu at Kagoshima University Hospital; Seiichi Shimizu at Tsuchiura Kyodo General Hospital; Sayuri Motomura at Tokyo Metropolitan Tama-Hokubu Medical Center; Toshiro Ito at National Hospital Organization Matsumoto Medical Center; Hirokazu Kashiwagi at Osaka University Hospital; Jun Yamanouchi at Ehime University Hospital; Keita Kirito at University of Yamanashi; Shinya Katsutani at Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital &#x00026; Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital; Akira Yokota at Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital; Yasushi Hiramatsu at Japanese Red Cross Society Himeji Hospital; Takahide Kikuchi at Tokyo Saiseikai Central Hospital; Kohsuke Asagoe at Shiga General Hospital; Naoki Harada at Chihaya Hospital; Yutaka Imamura at Our Lady of the Snow Social Medical Corporation St. Mary&#x02019;s Hospital; and Tomofumi Yano at Okayama Rosai Hospital.
