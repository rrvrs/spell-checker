These issues can significantly impact the outcome of cases, making it essential to understand the attitudes and perceptions of these experts towards mental illness. Despite a high number of individuals with mental illness in prisons, the availability of forensic mental health services is limited. While prior research has shown widespread stigma towards mental illness, there hasn&#x02019;t been a study assessing the attitudes of judges and lawyers.</p></sec><sec id="sec6367"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aims to investigate the stigma related to mental health among Lebanese legal professionals.</p></sec><sec id="sec6368"><title>Methods</title><p>An online questionnaire was sent to judges and lawyers practicing in Lebanon. The survey included a section on demographics and personal data with the following scales: Reported and intended behavior scale (RIBS) which measures mental health stigma&#x02013;related behavior and Perceived devaluation and discrimination scale (PDD) measuring the extent to which a person believes that most people will devalue or discriminate against someone with a mental illness.</p></sec><sec id="sec6369"><title>Results</title><p>
A total of 215 participants, with a mean age of 38.69 and a mean 13.16 years of experience, completed the questionnaire.&#x000a0;Most were female (62.8%) and worked as civil attorneys (47.4%). Only a minority received instruction on mental health or mental health law during training (10.7% and 8.8%). About a quarter believed their education on mental health issues was sufficient (27%). Participants with positive attitudes (RIBS) were more likely to have a family member with a mental illness (p value = .001), feel comfortable handling cases involving mental health (p value = .001), and have lived with someone with a mental illness (p value = .007). Feeling adequately educated about mental health issues was associated with lower perceived stigma (PDDS, p value = .021). No significant associations with stigma scores were found for factors like age, gender, occupation, years of experience, contact with a mental health professional, taking psychotropic medications, disclosing personal mental health issues to friends or co-workers, receiving education on mental illness or mental health law, or working with individuals with mental health issues.</p></sec><sec id="sec6370"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings imply that enhancing mental health education and awareness within the legal profession could be a key strategy to reduce stigma and improve the overall treatment of individuals with mental health issues within the criminal justice system in Lebanon.</p></sec><sec id="sec6371"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
