These fractures often occur in elderly individuals in the osteoporotic bones after a fall at ground level while extending their arm. Furthermore, given&#x000a0;the aging of the general population&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;rising prevalence of decreased bone density among elderly individuals, there is a significant emphasis on developing both nonoperative and surgical strategies for PHF treatment. A majority of these fractures&#x000a0;may be managed conservatively, including the utilization of a sling to immobilize the injured region and subsequent participation in activities to regain functionality [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless,&#x000a0;to achieve favourable functional outcomes, surgical intervention is necessary for fractures that are displaced and unstable. According to studies, these fractures comprise around 12.6% of all fractures in the proximal humerus [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various methods have been documented for treating these fractures including non-surgical realignment, surgical realignment followed by fixation using bone stitches, tension bands, wires placed around the bone, nails inserted into the bone, or plates with special locking mechanisms, as well as the use of artificial joint replacements [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several problems have been documented, including the occurrence of screws and plates being dislodged or loosened, nonunion, avascular necrosis, and the development of rotator cuff impingement syndrome. The selection of the surgical technique mostly relies on the patient's age, their preferred clinical outcomes, and ability to participate in and adhere to the rehabilitation regimen. The goal is to quickly achieve stability and near-perfect anatomical alignment in order to allow for immediate deployment. Nailing has various benefits over plating, including its minimally invasive nature with small skin incisions, less harm to soft tissues, and the ability to accommodate larger implants. Nevertheless, there is a higher probability of malunion and open reduction carries the risk of infection and harm to the soft tissues. Surgeons consider delays in surgical procedures detrimental since it increases the difficulty of accomplishing reduction and may lead to the absorption of cancellous bone. The controversy about the most effective approach to treating proximal humerus fractures continues, despite the progress made in orthopedic surgery procedures. The&#x000a0;Proximal Humerus Internal Locking System (PHILOS) and Proximal Humerus Interlocking Nail (PHN) are widely used techniques for treating proximal humerus fractures; however, comprehensive research comparing their effectiveness remains limited. The objective of this research is to analyse and compare the clinical and functional outcomes of PHILOS and PHN in patients with PHFs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This prospective comparative study was conducted&#x000a0;on 40 patients who were registered in either the emergency department or the outpatient department (OPD) of the Sarojini Naidu Medical College Hospital from October 2022 to March 2024. Prior to their inclusion in this research, written informed consent was obtained from the participants in their native language, and the study received ethical approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Sarojini Naidu Medical College, Agra (SNMC/IEC/2024/264). A sample of 40 patients&#x000a0;who met certain criteria for having proximal humerus fractures were randomly chosen for this study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Out of these patients, 20 had surgery using the PHILOS locking plate, whereas the other 20 underwent surgery using the PHN.

There were no instances of implant deviation, screw penetration, screw backout, impingement, or implant failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Advancements have been made in the treatment of proximal humerus fractures. Although some of the injuries require surgical intervention, the majority can be effectively managed through nonoperative methods. When considering several surgical choices, it is important to identify the procedure that provides better results in terms of the extent of movement, alleviation of pain, occurrence of complications, and general functioning of the shoulder. This comparison provided a framework for clinical decision-making, resulting in the establishment of uniform treatment regimens and improved patient care.</p><p>In our study, we enrolled 20 patients in two groups: PHILOS and PHN. There were 14 male participants (70.0%) and six female participants (30.0%) in the group treated with the PHILOS plate. In the proximal humeral nail (PHN) group, there were 12 male patients (60.0%) and eight female patients (40.0%). The PHILOS group had a mean age of 50.00 years, while the PHN group had an average age of 54.85 years. The PHILOS group had 70% left-side and 30% right-side fractures, while the PHN group had 60% left-side and 40% right-side fractures. PHILOS injuries were 85% due to falls and 15% due to RTA, while PHN injuries were 75% due to falls and 25% due to RTA. Both groups had comparable initial characteristics. Our study showed that the mean operation time was 112.50 &#x000b1;12.93 minutes in the PHILOS group and 75.90&#x000b1;5.70 minutes in the PHN group, which clearly shows that the mean operation time was significantly higher in the PHILOS group compared to the PHN group. According to Edwards et al. (2006), nail fixation is faster than plate fixation. Nail insertion is less invasive and reduces the complexity and time required for surgery [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sharma et al. (2019) believe PHN surgery may take less time than PHILOS plating. This efficiency is due to the less invasive insertion of the nail, which reduces surgical complexity and soft tissue exposure. These data suggest that PHN may improve the surgical efficiency of proximal humeral fracture treatment and patient outcomes [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the mean blood loss was 201.45&#x000b1;8.89 ml in the PHILOS group and 103.00&#x000b1;8.65 ml in the PHN group. Blood loss was significantly higher in the PHILOS group compared to the PHN group. Gnanesh et al. (2020) studied functional outcomes following PHN fixation for displaced proximal humerus fractures. While they did not directly report on blood loss, their findings of successful outcomes with PHN imply potential advantages in terms of surgical efficiency and reduced intraoperative complications, including blood loss [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Li et al. (2018) found in a meta-analysis of 20 studies that locking plates or intramedullary nailings (IMNs) for PHF repair caused the same postoperative problems and consistent scores. In contrast, IMNs reduced blood loss, fracture healing time, operative time and incision length [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Our study showed that the mean constant score was similar before surgery, but the PHN group had a significantly higher score than the PHILOS group at three months, six months and 12 months. The PHILOS and PHN groups also had significantly lower DASH scores from preoperative to 12-month follow-up. Jagiasi et al. (2018) found that PHILOS patients had a mean Constant-Murley score of 61.8, with a significant age difference: 50.53 in those older than 45 years and 72.91 in those younger than 45 years. PHILOS benefits younger patients with higher constant scores [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Vijayvargiya et al (2016) found mean constant scores of 70.9 and 74 for the PHILOS plate, delta-splitting and deltopectoral methods, respectively. This study found that the surgical approach influences the outcomes, but PHILOS provides excellent functional results [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Jhamnani et al. (2023) found a mean constant score of 85.8 at follow-up. This high score shows that the PHILOS method treats PHF well, while PHN achieved better long-term outcomes in our study [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Gradl et al. (2009) note that both treatments work, but our study shows that PHN improves function [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Matziolis et al. (2010) found that Zifko nails were superior to locking plate osteosynthesis for two-part proximal humerus fractures [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our excellent results with PHN align with and support these findings. Von R&#x000fc;den et al. (2014) found comparable functional results, but nailing mobilized faster and had fewer problems [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In our study, the mean DASH score was similar before surgery and at three months, but the PHILOS group had a significantly higher score than the PHN group at six and 12 months. The PHILOS and PHN groups also had significantly lower DASH scores from preoperative to 12-month follow-up. Narayanan et al. (2018) found that patients had an average DASH score of 8.69, indicating satisfactory functional recovery after surgery [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The authors assessed patients' DASH scores and range of motion. These results support Ismail et al. (2012) [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Zu-Bin Zhou et al. (2012) who claim that minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) with locking compression plates improves shoulder range of motion. Zhou et al.'s (2012) range of motion data shows that these techniques improve postoperative shoulder function [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Locking compression plates and minimally invasive MIPPO and&#x000a0;minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) improved shoulder range of motion and DASH scores in patients with proximal humeral fractures, according to studies by Narayanan et al. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Ismail et al. [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Zhou et al. [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and Altman et al. [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]&#x000a0;. These results emphasize the importance of these treatments for patient satisfaction and function. In our study, screw loosening occurred in 0.0% of the PHN group and 10.0% of the PHN group. The prevalence of acromion impingement syndrome was 5.0% in the PHN group and 10.0% in the PHILOS group. There were no superficial infections in the PHN group, while the PHILOS group had a 10.0% rate of superficial infections. There was no aseptic necrosis or malunion/nonunion in either group.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we included only two-part fractures, which may limit the generalizability of the study's results to more complex fracture patterns, thereby restricting its applicability to a broader spectrum of proximal humerus fractures. Secondly, this study focuses solely on functional outcomes and excludes radiological assessments, which could have provided further insights. Radiological evaluation, such as fracture alignment and implant positioning, might have offered a more complete understanding of the efficacy of PHILOS versus proximal humerus nail. Thirdly, this study has a relatively small sample size, which decreases the generalizability of the findings to the broader population and limits the statistical power to detect clinically significant differences between the two treatment methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The rationale for performing this comparison research is explained by the need for evidence-based recommendations that may provide surgeons with valuable information to enhance their decision-making and ultimately enhance patient outcomes. Overall, while having identical age, gender distribution, and injury modalities, the PHN group had superior functional results compared to the PHILOS group. Additionally, the PHN group experienced less blood loss and shorter operating durations. The PHN group had superior progress in both constant and DASH scores during a 12-month period in comparison to the PHILOS group. Studies have shown that while both implant options are effective for treating proximal humerus fractures, PHN is often seen as the superior choice. Although this is a single-centred study, more diverse study with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is needed to validate these findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
