</xref> The Green Endoscopy Initiative was introduced and promoted to measure and assess carbon dioxide emissions in endoscopy&#x02010;related procedures. Disposable duodenoscopes are recommended for infection control, especially for duodenoscopes used in cholangiopancreatography, and can be used in practice. However, recycling through reuse and appropriate waste management are recommended to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It has been reported that 56% of upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies and 23%&#x02212;52% of lower GI endoscopies are performed inappropriately, as the diagnostic rate is not improved by examining indeterminate symptoms, and reduction of unnecessary endoscopies is encouraged using the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle).<xref rid="deo270016-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Although environmental measures are needed to prevent viral spread, recommendations for appropriate case&#x02010;specific gowning techniques could lead to sustainable environmental protection, and cultures of microorganisms and bacteria on gowns before and after endoscopy may provide information on environmental exposure. In order to achieve the SDGs with a focus on green endoscopy, which is attracting increasing attention and being implemented globally, it is necessary to separate medical waste in endoscopy&#x02010;related procedures and implement initiatives that lead to feasible cost&#x02010;effectiveness considering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, we evaluated and examined whether exposure to infection occurs during endoscopy, what kind of bacterial exposure actually occurs, as well as whether the bacteria cause environmental contamination and associated exposure to infection by culturing bacteria attached to PPE used during endoscopy.</p><p>Therefore, with a focus on green endoscopy, this study aimed to conduct a microbiological assessment of gowning techniques during endoscopy to reduce carbon emissions and separate medical waste.</p></sec><sec id="deo270016-sec-0060"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="deo270016-sec-0070"><title>Participants and design</title><p>This single&#x02010;center prospective pilot study included isolation gowns from 25 cases obtained to identify microorganisms after diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy from January to March 2024 at Tokyo Medical University Hospital which has 900 beds in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.

</xref> In this study, we aimed to investigate green endoscopy for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Therefore, we examined the approach to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> by examining what kind of microorganisms are exposed to during endoscopy and detecting bacteria, based on scientific evidence. As a result, no bacteria that could be a source of infection were detected, and thus we detected bacteria produced by oral commensal bacteria and tap water only. This suggests that wearing PPE in selected cases is not necessary, leading to green endoscopy. Although gown contamination was associated with the examination procedure, no potentially hazardous microorganisms were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an actual microbial culture to assess contamination required for gowning techniques to ensure green endoscopy in reducing medical waste in view of the SDGs and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>The new concept, &#x02018;&#x02018;green endoscopy,&#x02019; has recently emerged, as efforts to promote sustainability and reduce carbon emissions at the international level are currently being explored.<xref rid="deo270016-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Although endoscopy is important for early detection and early treatment, it should be performed appropriately for the disease state, and appropriate examinations can be cost&#x02010;effective. We provided scientific evidence that droplets had no impact on environmental contamination, suggesting that gowning techniques with PPE are not always necessary and should be used depending on the case. If isolation gowns do not need to be changed after each examination, the amount of medical waste generated can be greatly reduced, encouraging green endoscopy. However, even though environmental pollution is a global problem, guidance on the impact of medical practice on the environment is not evaluated or provided in the medical field currently, which is a major problem.</p></sec><sec id="deo270016-sec-0170"><title>Prevention of infection exposure due to differences in background factors</title><p>Oral bacteria were detected in 78.1% of the cases. Sedated endoscopy was performed in 16% and 57.1% of the tests where oral and opportunistic bacteria were detected, respectively. There was no difference in bacterial detection between tests. The left arm was closer to the patient's side and thus more susceptible to exposure, suggesting that the 20% of bacteria detected on the back were indigenous to the examiner due to PPE desorption. The bacterial culture showed indigenous bacteria on the left arm of the PPE worn without performing endoscopy. There was no difference in the breakdown of bacteria between opportunistic (55.6%) and oral commensal (44.4%). It is possible that the PPE was removed first without removing the gloves during PPE removal after endoscopy. The procedure of removing the gloves first and then the gown after the examination may have been followed more frequently by residents because they removed the PPE with the gloves on. Thorough infection control measures should be taken regarding the order of PPE removal and putting on to prevent contamination of the surrounding environment. Bacterial exposure did not differ depending on whether the patient was sedated or not and was particularly likely to occur in residents because of the longer examination and exposure time. Based on these results, measures to prevent environmental exposure are necessary, and guidance for residents on environmental measures and infection control through careful hand hygiene should be practiced.</p></sec><sec id="deo270016-sec-0180"><title>Effects of infection transmission on environmental pollution</title><p>The COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic led to a significant increase in the use of PPE during endoscopy in order to prevent the effect of aerosol generation on endoscopy staff and the environment. According to Rizan et&#x000a0;al., the carbon footprint of PPE was 106.478 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e in 6 months during COVID&#x02010;19, indicating the significant environmental impact of PPE and the importance of waste management.<xref rid="deo270016-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> We have reported that COVID&#x02010;19 affects older patients and those suffering from malignant tumors, who are easily infected. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines generally recommend the use of PPE during endoscopy because of the possibility of exposure to unknown viruses or bacteria and report the importance of cleaning endoscopic instruments.<xref rid="deo270016-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> In the present study, exposure to bacteria suggestive of infection was not detected even in patients with a strong vomiting reflex who were considered at high risk of infection, and the endoscopists were not affected by exposure to infection. In cases such as COVID&#x02010;19 and tuberculosis where splash infection is suggested, or in cases where sufficient interviewing is not possible, such as in emergency endoscopy, taking measures to prevent infection using PPE may be necessary. However, in cases where there is no risk of splash infection during endoscopic examinations, PPE may not be necessary. In all cases, endoscopes should be cleaned according to guidelines to prevent infection and infection control measures should be taken on a patient&#x02010;by&#x02010;case basis. Since this is a study with a small number of cases, it is possible that we only considered exposure to a small portion of bacteria. Conducting a study with a large number of cases in consideration of the results of this study to further establish the scientific basis is necessary, including the frequency of using isolation gowns in a consistent method. In the present study,<xref rid="deo270016-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref> it is also considered that microorganisms on gowns have almost zero chance of becoming pathogenic, and it is inferred that by selecting the appropriate cases, it is possible to reduce the impact of environmental contamination to zero without infection control precautions using PPE.</p><p>Preventing exposure to environmental infection through careful hand hygiene at each examination is possible as microorganisms adhering to the gown were identified as commensal or opportunistic bacteria, which are usually not transmitted. As discussed above, wearing isolation gowns is unnecessary in many cases, allowing for environmentally friendly medical care. Therefore, strategies are needed to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in endoscopy and establish standards for not only facilities but also the whole system to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, making endoscopy an environmentally sustainable model and enabling the realization of SDGs.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Although the microbial contamination rate of the isolation gown was examined using the stamp method for assessing the contamination rates, it is possible that the endoscopists' epidermal <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococci</italic> were what was detected, although micro&#x02010;organisms were not frequently detected on the front and back of the isolation gowns. Second, the number of isolation gowns discharged in a day was not calculated; therefore, daily medical waste calculation was not possible. Third, this is a study with a small number of cases and only some bacterial exposures were examined. Conducting a study examining a large number of cases considering the results of this study and further substantiating the scientific evidence, including the frequency of continuous use of isolation gowns, is necessary. Finally, only esophagogastroduodenoscopy was considered and other GI endoscopy procedures were not included, which might limit the generalizability of our findings, and should be assessed in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the bacteria detected in disposable gowns after GI endoscopy were mainly non&#x02010;pathogenic organisms, and changing all PPE might not be essential. We recommend a green endoscopy technique that achieves the SDGs and reduces medical waste.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270016-sec-0200"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>The author Takao Itoi is the editor&#x02010;in&#x02010;chief of Digestive Endoscopy Open, and the other authors declare no conflict of interest for this article.</p></sec><sec id="deo270016-sec-0210"><title>ETHICS STATEMENT</title><p>This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of Tokyo Medical University Hospital between March and May 2024 (registration number: TS2023&#x02010;0695).
