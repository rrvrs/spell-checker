Children and adolescents with CML tend to present with more aggressive features. Because of the substantial shift in CML treatment brought about by the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the last 20 years, adult patients now have about the same life expectancy as the age-matched healthy population.&#x000a0;The study evaluated the clinico-hematological profile of children presenting with CML.

Additionally, inconsistencies in patient follow-up posed a significant challenge in accurately tracking treatment responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study concluded that the presenting features of CML in children and adolescents were similar to those shown in other studies. WBC counts were higher in children and adolescents compared to the adult population. It is also necessary to define the late impacts of lifelong TKI treatment as well as the long-term results of TKI treatment. Due to advancements in the management of adult CML patients over the last 20 years, TKI medication may now be stopped under specific circumstances. Due to the rarity of pediatric CML, more pediatric data collection is required, which can only be accomplished through international cooperation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We extend our gratitude to Zetline Publishers for their medical writing assistance and editorial support in this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
