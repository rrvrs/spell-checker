RNFL thickness was found to be statistically significantly increased in the temporal superior and temporal inferior quadrants in those with internet addiction compared to healthy subjects (p&#x0003c;0.05). In smartphone addiction, RNFL thickness was found to be statistically significantly increased in the temporal inferior quadrant compared to healthy subjects (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the analyses comparing OCT measurements according to sex, it was found that nasal inferior (p&#x0003c;0.01) and global (p&#x0003c;0.05) quadrants in women and central macular thickness (p&#x0003c;0.01) in men were statistically significantly increased.</p><p>The correlation analyses in our study revealed statistically significant positive correlations between internet addiction scale scores (p&#x0003c;0.01) and smartphone addiction scale scores (p&#x0003c;0.01), RNFL temporal superior quadrant thickness (p&#x0003c;0.01); smartphone addiction scale scores and RNFL temporal superior quadrant thickness (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec1570"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Internet and smartphone addiction are seen considerable rates among university students. In OCT measurements, RNFL thickness was found to be increased in various quadrants in patients with addiction. In addition, RNFL thickness was found to be increased in all quadrants in female gender and central macular thickness was found to be increased in male gender. Correlation analysis revealed that internet addiction scale scores, smartphone addiction scale scores, and RNFL temporal superior quadrant thickness were positively correlated. In addition, there was a positive correlation between smartphone addiction scale scores, and RNFL temporal superior quadrant thickness</p></sec><sec id="sec1571"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
