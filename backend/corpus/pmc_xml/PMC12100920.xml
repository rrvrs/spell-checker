Because of that, the prognosis of the disease is dismal, and identification of novel therapeutic approaches is needed. This study investigates the role of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF&#x003b1;) in pancreatic cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Using in silico platforms, it was confirmed that <italic>TGFA</italic>, the gene encoding TGF&#x003b1;, is significantly overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas relative to normal pancreatic tissues. In patient-derived xenografts as well as in pancreatic cancer cell lines, multiple molecular forms of TGF&#x003b1; were identified, including the transmembrane TGF&#x003b1; precursor (proTGF&#x003b1;) and the soluble 6&#x000a0;kDa mature form. Functional assays using RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 demonstrated that <italic>TGFA</italic> knockdown significantly impaired cell proliferation, reinforcing the critical role of TGF&#x003b1; in driving tumor growth. The therapeutic potential of targeting TGF&#x003b1; was evaluated through the development of two monoclonal antibodies (5F1 and 16B10) specific for TGF&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">These antibodies effectively bound to proTGF&#x003b1;-expressing cells, with minimal off-target effects in <italic>TGFA</italic>-knockout cell lines. When conjugated to cytotoxic agents such as MMAF, the resulting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) exhibited potent antiproliferative activity, significantly reducing the viability of TGF&#x003b1;-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that MMAF-loaded ADCs induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, with markers of mitotic disruption evident in treated cells. In vivo, the TGF&#x003b1;-targeting ADCs elicited substantial tumor regression in murine models of pancreatic cancer, whereas the unconjugated antibodies merely stabilized tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These findings highlight TGF&#x003b1; as a promising therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer, supporting further preclinical and clinical development of TGF&#x003b1;-directed ADCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13046-025-03421-8.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>predoctoral contract</institution></funding-source><award-id>EDU/556/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romero-P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>In&#x000e9;s</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Cancer Research Foundation of the Salamanca University (FICUS)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III through a Miguel Servet program</institution></funding-source><award-id>(CPII17/00015) and (PI18/00796).</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montero</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain</institution></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-115605RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pandiella</surname><given-names>Atanasio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III through CIBERONC</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Junta de Castilla y Le&#x000f3;n</institution></funding-source><award-id>CSI146P20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pandiella</surname><given-names>Atanasio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>ALMOM</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>ACMUMA</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>UCCTA</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CRIS Cancer Foundation and the Regional Development Funding Program (FEDER) &#x0201c;A way to make Europe&#x0201d;</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Italian National Cancer Institute &#x02018;Regina Elena&#x02019; 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Pancreatic tumors are one of the most lethal forms of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They represent about 3% of all cancers in the United States, but account for approximately 7% of all cancer-related deaths. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are the most frequent ones, reaching 95% of all exocrine pancreatic neoplasias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Multiple risk factors contribute to pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Age is a major determinant, with risk increasing significantly after the age of 60, while cigarette smoking is considered one of the strongest environmental risk factors. Other factors include chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, obesity, a family history of pancreatic cancer, and certain hereditary genetic mutations, such as those found in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The treatment options for pancreatic cancer depend largely on the stage at which it is diagnosed. Surgery is the only potential curative option, but only 20% of patients are eligible due to late detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For unresectable or metastatic cases, chemotherapy (e.g., FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine) and radiation therapy are the mainstays of treatment. However, the 5-year survival rate remains dismal, at less than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], mainly due to late diagnosis, the aggressive characteristics of the disease, and the poor therapeutic options once the disease has disseminated. Because of this, novel effective therapeutic strategies are needed.</p><p id="Par6">Transforming growth factor &#x003b1; (TGF&#x003b1;) is a 6&#x000a0;kDa protein that belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of polypeptide growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. TGF&#x003b1; is synthesized as a larger transmembrane protein of 18&#x000a0;kDa, termed proTGF&#x003b1;, that undergoes several posttranslational modifications to generate a 17&#x000a0;kDa membrane-bound proTGF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This form may be subjected to proteolytic cleavage by cell surface proteases, generating soluble TGF&#x003b1; and a cell-bound 15&#x000a0;kDa fragment that includes a short stretch of extracellular aminoacids, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. TGF&#x003b1; acts by binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such interaction facilitates receptor oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] which is required to initiate signaling, which includes activation of pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K routes, which promote cellular proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Certain studies have linked increased expression of TGF&#x003b1; to the pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer. Thus, transgenic mice expressing high levels of the protein develop hyperplastic and metaplastic changes of the pancreas, together with an increase in the size of the organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In humans, PDACs have been reported to express high levels of both TGF&#x003b1; and EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Continuous engagement of this signaling loop may contribute to enhancing the proliferative capacity of pancreatic tumor cells, prevent apoptosis, and promote resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, the role of TGF&#x003b1; in pancreatic cancer progression is not only restricted to enhancing cell proliferation but also involves its effect on the tumor microenvironment. TGF&#x003b1; contributes to the desmoplastic reaction (fibrotic tissue formation) observed in pancreatic tumors, which creates a dense stroma that makes the tumor more resistant to therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The fact that TGF&#x003b1; may have a role in the development of pancreatic cancer, together with its structural properties as a membrane-bound protein, opens the possibility of targeting this growth factor with therapeutic purposes. A potential strategy would be the use of antibodies against TGF&#x003b1;, that may not only recognize the soluble factor, but also its membrane-bound form. These antibodies against mature TGF&#x003b1; could neutralize its growth promoting activities, but may also bind transmembrane proTGF&#x003b1;, offering the possibility of using the latter as a potential antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) target.</p><p id="Par9">Antibody-drug conjugates are sophisticated versions of antibodies, formed by three components: a monoclonal antibody against a cell surface protein, a cytotoxic drug, and a linker used to chemically connect the antibody to the cytotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. ADCs bind to the extracellular region of a transmembrane protein and are then internalized to lysosomes, a site in which they undergo proteolytic cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. That process releases the cytotoxic payload that can then be transported to the cytosol to finally reach the cellular target, usually microtubules, DNA or proteins related to DNA stability. Several ADCs have entered the oncology clinic and their use is on the rising, with more than 210 ongoing clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Here, we demonstrate that expression of TGF&#x003b1; facilitates proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, the potential therapeutic value of antibodies and ADCs prepared to recognize both mature TGF&#x003b1; as well as proTGF&#x003b1; has been explored. We show that those ADCs exert potent and specific antitumoral action on human pancreatic cancer cell lines both in vitro and when injected in mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p id="Par11">Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

To parallel the clinical situation, DM1 was coupled to the antibodies through an uncleavable linker, while in the case of DXd and MMAF a cleavable linker was used.

To verify that the payloads were coupled to the antibodies, Western blotting analyses using antibodies raised against DM1, DXd, and a commercial one that recognized MMAF were performed.

This study expands on the understanding of TGF&#x003b1; in pancreatic cancer by analyzing its expression and function in both patient-derived tumors and cell lines. In the latter, loss-of-function studies using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technology demonstrated that the reduction or elimination of <italic>TGFA</italic> significantly inhibited the proliferation of the six pancreatic cancer cell lines tested. Specifically, in the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments, the ablation of <italic>TGFA</italic> led to a profound reduction in cell proliferation, underlining the contribution of TGF&#x003b1; to the growth of these cells. Moreover, reintroduction of TGF&#x003b1; into <italic>TGFA</italic>-knockout cells restored their proliferative potential, further corroborating the centrality of this growth factor in pancreatic cancer progression. The ability to rescue proliferation by reintroducing TGF&#x003b1; also highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, where inhibiting TGF&#x003b1; function could provide a means to stymie pancreatic tumor growth. Furthermore, the membrane-bound properties of proTGF&#x003b1;, together with its internalization capability, could be exploited to direct ADCs to proTGF&#x003b1;-expressing tumors, as demonstrated in this work.</p><p id="Par48">Using multiple in silico tools, it was confirmed that <italic>TGFA</italic> is significantly overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas compared to normal pancreatic tissues. The observed overexpression suggests a potential role of TGF&#x003b1; in pancreatic tumor progression. This conclusion is also supported by genetic studies in mice which demonstrated that overexpression of TGF&#x003b1; may provoke the appearance of tumors in several tissues, including the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The presence of TGF&#x003b1; in pancreatic cancer was not limited to its overexpression. In fact, our study also identified multiple molecular forms of TGF&#x003b1;, including the 17&#x000a0;kDa transmembrane form (proTGF&#x003b1;) and a 15&#x000a0;kDa tail fragment. In addition, a 6&#x000a0;kDa soluble form of TGF&#x003b1;, secreted by pancreatic cancer cell lines, was also detected in the culture media.</p><p id="Par49">The membrane-bound nature of the TGF&#x003b1; precursor opened the possibility of leveraging this molecular characteristic with therapeutic purposes, i.e. by using proTGF&#x003b1; as an ADC target. To explore such possibility, the monoclonal antibodies 5F1 and 16B10 were conjugated to cytotoxic drugs commonly used in clinical ADCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The ADCs, particularly the ones that contained MMAF, demonstrated a significant antiproliferative effect on TGF&#x003b1;-expressing pancreatic cancer cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> values significantly lower than those of the free drug or the unconjugated antibodies. These studies demonstrated that MMAF-loaded ADCs were highly effective in delivering their cytotoxic payload to TGF&#x003b1;-expressing cells, making them promising candidates for further development. The specificity of the ADCs for TGF&#x003b1;-expressing cells was confirmed by their lack of activity in <italic>TGFA</italic>-knockout cells. Moreover, reconstitution of TGF&#x003b1; expression in knockout cells restored sensitivity to the ADCs, further reinforcing the idea that TGF&#x003b1; is a viable target for ADC-based therapies. It is relevant to indicate that all the pancreatic cancer cell lines used in the present study carry <italic>KRAS</italic> codon 12 mutations. The effectiveness of the ADC in this scenario opens the possibility of using the ADC in other tumors expressing oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations. In fact, our preliminary data has shown effectiveness of the ADC in lung cancer cell lines with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations and that express proTGF&#x003b1;.</p><p id="Par50">In vivo studies showed that the unconjugated antibody 16B10 stabilized tumor growth, but the ADC exerted a higher antitumoral effect, inducing tumor regression. Importantly, the treatment with 16B10-MMAF was well tolerated, with minimal weight loss observed in the treated animals. However, one of the limitations of the present study is the fact that the monoclonal antibodies raised against human TGF&#x003b1; failed to recognize the murine form, preventing the accurate evaluation of the on-target potential toxicities derived from the administration of the mAbs or ADCs. While this represents a limitation of our study, it is worth noting that mice deficient for <italic>TGFA</italic> develop to term, and have minor abnormalities in skin appendages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The most severe reported effect was corneal inflammation. Considering this phenotype, it is expected that the on-target toxicity would be tolerable in humans.</p><p id="Par51">The mechanism by which the MMAF-coupled ADCs exerted their antiproliferative effects included internalization and lysosomal targeting. In the latter cellular compartment, the action of acidic proteases is expected to release the cytotoxic payload, ultimately leading to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Cell cycle analysis revealed that treatment with 16B10-MMAF induced G2/M phase arrest, accompanied by the accumulation of mitotic markers such as pHistone H3 and pBubR1, which are indicative of mitotic arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This mitotic disruption was absent in cells lacking TGF&#x003b1;, underscoring the specific mechanism of action of the ADC.</p><p id="Par52">The interaction of TGF&#x003b1; with its cellular receptor may be leveraged to increase the antiproliferative action of the anti-TGF&#x003b1; ADCs. In fact, EGFR expression facilitated the antiproliferative action of the anti-TGF&#x003b1; ADCs. It is possible that soluble TGF&#x003b1; may interact with the EGFR, whose internalization efficiency is high when compared to other ErbB family receptors, and TGF&#x003b1;-EGFR interaction may facilitate the uptake of the anti-TGF&#x003b1; ADCs. This possibility is indicated by the fact that EGFR knockout cells exhibited decreased sensitivity to the ADC treatment. However, in this work we did not explore such possibility in detail, and further work is needed in order to define to which extent part of the antiproliferative action of anti-TGF&#x003b1; ADCs may depend on the TGF&#x003b1;-ADC uptake mediated by the EGFR. Another possibility that may be considered is the fact that TGF&#x003b1; is expected to promote proliferative signaling by the EGFR, and such signaling may be compromised in cells treated with anti-TGF&#x003b1; antibodies.</p><p id="Par53">In addition to the relevance of the studies herewith presented as a potential novel strategy for the therapy of pancreatic cancer, several other more generic concepts can be extracted from the present study. First, it demonstrates the suitability of membrane-anchored growth factors as ADC targets. While these factors may be proteolytically cleaved to release soluble mature polypeptides, the membrane-bound characteristics of their precursors may be exploited to facilitate targeting of the ADC to tumors in which the transmembrane factor is biosynthesized. Second, the growth promoting characteristics of some of these growth factors could potentially be attenuated by the antibodies used against them. Finally, the coexpression of the receptor and the membrane-bound factor may increase the uptake of the ADCs directed to the growth factor, augmenting the antitumoral action of the ADC. From a more generic point of view, these characteristics also open the possibility of targeting membrane-anchored growth factors overexpressed in other neoplasias, expanding the therapeutic armamentarium against those diseases. In the case of the studies herewith reported, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the potent antitumor activity of ADC that target TGF&#x003b1;, providing a strong rationale for further preclinical and clinical investigation of ADCs targeting proTGF&#x003b1; as a therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par54">This study highlights the overexpression and functional significance of TGF&#x003b1; in pancreatic cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target.
