Supervision is an essentail tool in medical training and especially in psychiatry and psychotherapy. It emcopasses two distinct aspects namely: coaching in the workplace aimed at developping competences (pyramid of Miller) and on the other side a safe place to reflect on ones personal development as a professional. This mentoring should be distinguised from the personal training psychotherapy. The mentoring supervisor will take the doctor&#x02019;s pledge as a starting point of professional development. But will also encourage the resident to become aware of elements of transference and counter transference in his/her clinical work, helping to foster empathy &#x0201c;maximal understanding with respect for professional distance. This, not only for the benefit of the patient and his/her security, but also in order to take care of one&#x02019;s own health and developing a sound balance between work and private life.</p><p>Too often supervision is taken for granted once the resident has become a consultant. Along with examples of the techniques and the pitfalls of supervison, the presenters will plea for training and intervision as part of the development of the supervisor!</p></sec><sec id="sec8999"><title>Objectives</title><p>Raise awareness for the competences needed to become a valuable supervisor and the place supervision in its two aspects (coaching and place of reflection) should take in the training of medical doctors and especially psychiatrists</p></sec><sec id="sec9000"><title>Methods</title><p>
