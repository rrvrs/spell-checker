Introduction</title><p>Plants offer a promising approach to the rapid, cost-effective, and scalable production of recombinant proteins. Plants are capable of performing a high level of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are important to maintaining the biological activity and stability of many recombinant proteins [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, they are able to produce complex proteins that are difficult to produce in other systems, such as bacteria or yeasts. Plant viral vectors have emerged as a powerful alternative to the use of transgenic plants for heterologous expression. Unlike transgenic approaches, which often involve time-consuming procedures for stable integration of foreign genes into the plant genome, plant viral vectors can rapidly introduce and express foreign genes in a wide range of plant species. These vectors exploit the natural infection mechanisms of viruses to deliver genes efficiently, resulting in high levels of protein expression within days of inoculation. Additionally, plant viral vectors circumvent issues related to stable integration into the plant genome, thereby reducing concerns over potential off-target effects and genetic instability [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This rapid, high-yield, and flexible approach has made plant viral vectors a valuable tool for research and biotechnological applications, such as the production of vaccines, therapeutic proteins, and other valuable biomolecules [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The genus <italic toggle="yes">Potyvirus</italic> (family <italic toggle="yes">Potyviridae</italic>) is the largest among plant viruses and includes many economically significant pathogens of crop plants. These are filamentous viruses with a (+)ssRNA genome approximately 10 kb in length, which includes a single ORF encoding a precursor polyprotein (<xref rid="viruses-16-01920-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This polyprotein is co- and post-translationally cleaved by three viral proteases into 11 gene products, including the P3N-PIPO protein, which arises from an alternative ORF within the <italic toggle="yes">P3</italic> cistron due to a translational frameshift [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The biotechnological potential of potyviruses is determined by several of their properties. The polyprotein strategy of gene expression ensures the production of the target protein in an equimolar ratio to other viral proteins. Thus, its accumulation rate depends solely on its stability and the intrinsic replication of the virus. By flanking the target protein with specific cleavage sites for the viral protease, it is possible to achieve efficient cleavage from the polyprotein precursor and hence its accumulation in a free form. Introducing additional insertion sites within the genome allows for the co-expression of multiple genes from a single vector simultaneously [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To date, nine insertion sites have been successfully tested and are further discussed in this article (<xref rid="viruses-16-01920-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Due to the filamentous morphology of potyvirus particles, the resulting size of the incorporated genome is not as strictly limited as in viruses with icosahedral symmetry. To date, at least 206 different potyviruses have been identified (according to an ICTV report, 24 October 2024). Given this extraordinary diversity of potyvirus species, potyviruses have a broad host range in which heterologous expression can be induced [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several potyvirus species have been used for this purpose so far. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of particular potyviruses used for heterologous expression in plants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01920"><title>2. Potyvirus-Mediated Expression of Foreign Genes in Plants</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-16-01920"><title>2.1. Tobacco Etch Virus</title><p>Tobacco etch virus (TEV, <italic toggle="yes">Potyvirus nicotianainsculpentis</italic>, based on the ICTV binomial classification) was the first potyvirus used for the expression of a foreign gene. The full-length cDNA clone of TEV was modified by inserting a gene encoding GUS (<italic toggle="yes">uidA</italic>) at the 5&#x02032; end of the HC-Pro gene. The result was the expression of enzymatically active fusion forms of GUS fused with HC-Pro, allowing for histochemical in situ visualization of virus replication in various tobacco tissue types. The modified virus retained its ability to spread systemically, but its accumulation was lower compared to the wild-type TEV, and the infected plants exhibited milder symptoms. The construct was genetically stable over several rapid mechanical passages, but spontaneous deletions in the insert area and adjacent regions of the TEV genome were observed during prolonged cultivation of infected plants [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Subsequent research achieved the expression of free GUS by introducing an additional cleavage site for NIa protease between the sequences encoding GUS and HC-Pro [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These experiments provided the first evidence that potyviruses could serve as vectors for the expression of free polypeptides in planta. Attention was also given to elucidating the probable mechanism of spontaneous deletion mutations. Similarly to related RNA virus taxa, potyviruses are presumed to involve non-homologous recombination, which occurs due to template switching after the dissociation of the transcriptase complex from the original template strand during synthesis (the so-called copy choice mechanism). Non-homologous recombination can occur between two genetically distinct regions, leading to the emergence of deletion genotypes with subsequent selection of viable or advantageous variants [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Based on previous experiments, the pTEV-NH vector was prepared. It includes an additional site for NIa-Pro, as well as a polylinker and a hexahistidine tag for N-terminal fusion with the target protein [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The resulting vector was used to characterize selected proteins of Beet yellows virus (BYV), p20, HSP70h, L-Pro, and CP via infection of <italic toggle="yes">Nicotiana tabacum</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. The individual closterovirus proteins showed varying impacts on the course of infection, virus accumulation, and symptom manifestation. In the case of spontaneous insert deletions, adjacent parts of HC-Pro were also removed, but not P1, indicating the essential role of this gene during viral infection. Analysis of the model of <italic toggle="yes">N. tabacum</italic> protoplasts transfected with the constructs did not show an impact of the inserted genes on TEV genome replication or encapsidation at the cell level. Thus, the influence on plant infection likely occurred at the level of systemic virus&#x02013;host interaction, e.g., by affecting plant defense mechanisms or systemic virus spread [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In the following years, the binary plasmid pGTEV was prepared, consisting of the complete TEV genome flanked by the 35S promoter from Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and CaMV terminator, cloned into a binary vector derived from plasmid pCLEAN-G181. This allowed for efficient infection of host plants via agroinfiltration [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. pGTEV was used for the construction of the defective vector pGTEV&#x00394;NIb, where the cistron encoding NIb was replaced with the corresponding expression cassette (<xref rid="viruses-16-01920-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), with NIb being complemented in trans via transgenesis or co-infection with a compatible NIb-expressing potato virus X-based vector (PVX-NIb). Partial deconstruction of the TEV genome enabled not only individual expression but also simultaneous co-expression of three labeled reporter fluorescent proteins, FLAG-mCherry, HA-Venus, and c-Myc-mTagBFP, flanked by cleavage sites for NIa-Pro protease. Transgenic <italic toggle="yes">N. tabacum</italic> with constitutive NIb expression and <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> co-infected with PVX-NIb were infected with the constructs. While individual expression of the proteins was successful through both methods of NIb complementation, co-expression in the presence of PVX-NIb could not be achieved. Constructs for individual expression showed genetic stability even after mechanical virus passage, while RT-PCR analysis of the co-expression construct showed the presence of deletion variants. Subsequent experiments with the pGTEV&#x00394;NIb vector focused on its use in manipulating plant metabolism. A construct for co-expression of transcription factors Delila and Rosea1 from <italic toggle="yes">Antirrhinum majus</italic>, responsible for activating anthocyanin biosynthesis, was prepared. Infection of transgenic <italic toggle="yes">N. tabacum</italic> with this construct led to the production of these pigments in symptomatic leaves, resulting in tissue color changes [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Given the successful equimolar co-expression of multiple proteins from a single pGTEV&#x00394;NIb construct, further experiments focused on the possibility of their individual translocation to different cellular compartments. A series of constructs for GFP expression with an insertion site between the 5&#x02032; UTR and P1 cistron (N-terminal position) or between the <italic toggle="yes">NIa-Pro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CP</italic> genes, i.e., in place of the NIb gene (internal position), were prepared. The inserted GFP-encoding gene was also fused at the N-terminus with translocation signals for transportation to chloroplasts, the nucleus, and mitochondria. While GFP translocation to chloroplasts and mitochondria occurred only in the case of its N-terminal insertion, nuclear localization of GFP was successful in both polyprotein positions. This can be attributed to the tertiary structure of the viral polyprotein before cleavage, which, in the case of internal GFP localization, may prevent the interaction of signal sequences with the cell translocation machinery proteins. Amino acid residues from the NIa-Pro cleavage site may also interfere with signal peptide recognition [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Unlike chloroplasts and mitochondria, nuclear translocation allows for transportation of fully folded proteins, occurring through large nuclear pores. It is assumed that the nuclear translocation signal creates surface loops that enable protein recognition even in the folded state [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on these findings, a construct for N-terminal GFP expression with chloroplast translocation and internal mCherry expression with nuclear translocation was prepared. Both proteins were successfully detected in target structures, demonstrating that the pGTEV&#x00394;NIb vector can be used for the co-expression of two different proteins and their transportation to different cell organelles. Western blot analysis of infected tissues also showed a lower accumulation rate of GFP in the case of mitochondrial translocation, suggesting that some signal peptides may negatively affect the final yield. Differences were also noted between the various GFP positions within the viral polyprotein. Constructs with internal GFP localization showed higher genetic stability, while RT-PCR products of a smaller size, indicating GFP cistron deletion, were detected in the case of N-terminal GFP insertion [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The vector pGTEV&#x00394;NIb was further used to express a whole multistep heterologous metabolic pathway in tobacco plants to synthetize lycopene, a health-promoting carotenoid. The pathway involved three genes from the soil bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Pantoea ananatis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">crtE</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">crtB</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">crtI,</italic> encoding enzymes required for lycopene biosynthesis. All three genes were inserted into the pGTEV&#x00394;NIb. Tobacco plants infected with the resultant construct exhibited distinct red spots on their leaves, indicating lycopene accumulation, which was later confirmed through HPLC analysis. Analysis of RNA confirmed successful expression of all three genes in these tissues. Lycopene levels reached approximately 10% of total carotenoid content, equating to around 150 &#x003bc;g per gram of dry weight, demonstrating the potential of this system for the synthesis of bioactive compounds in plants. To further confirm that lycopene production required the complete biosynthetic pathway, three individual clones expressing each biosynthetic enzyme were constructed. Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">crtB</italic> expressing plants exhibited a striking yellow coloration by 10 days post inoculation (dpi). HPLC analysis revealed that the yellow tissues had elevated levels of chloroplastic carotenoids along with a reduction in chlorophyll content. The combination of viral-infection-induced chlorosis and increased carotenoid accumulation likely contributed to the yellow pigmentation. These findings suggested that the <italic toggle="yes">crtB</italic> gene could serve as a visual reporter for tracking viral infection in plants. Indeed, it was successfully used to track viral infection in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. pepo</italic> [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-16-01920"><title>2.2. Plum Pox Virus</title><p>Plum pox virus (PPV, <italic toggle="yes">Potyvirus plumpoxi</italic>) is one of the most significant pathogens of fruit trees in the genus <italic toggle="yes">Prunus</italic>, causing the disease known as sharka. Its natural host range includes several economically important species, such as European plum (<italic toggle="yes">P. domestica</italic>), peach (<italic toggle="yes">P. persica</italic>), sour cherry (<italic toggle="yes">P. cerasus</italic>), cherry plum (<italic toggle="yes">P. cerasifera</italic>), and almond (<italic toggle="yes">P. dulcis</italic>). The experimental host range of PPV includes various herbaceous species across different families, including <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> (as well as other <italic toggle="yes">Nicotiana</italic> species), <italic toggle="yes">Chenopodium foetidum</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">P. sativum</italic>, and opium poppy (<italic toggle="yes">Papaver somniferum</italic>) [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>For heterologous expression purposes, an infectious clone pGPPV was initially modified. This clone consisted of the full-length cDNA of the PPV-D strain (Rankovic isolate) under the control of the T7 bacteriophage promoter [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A cloning site was introduced between the <italic toggle="yes">P1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HC-Pro</italic> genes. The GUS gene, including a recognition site for NIa-Pro, was cloned into the resulting vector. Infection developed in 40&#x02013;50% of inoculated <italic toggle="yes">N. clevelandii</italic> plants (100% for pGPPV) during two independent experiments, and the infected plants did not exhibit any symptoms. Subsequent analysis showed significantly slower but comparable accumulation of the modified virus in later stages of infection compared to the parental pGPPV. The infection kinetics matched the GUS activity in infected leaves. The construct was stable in primarily infected plants even at 52 dpi, but extensive deletions in the insert area were observed after the first mechanical passage of the virus [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In subsequent experiments, an infectious clone pICPPV was prepared from pGPPV. The T7 bacteriophage promoter was replaced by the CaMV 35S promoter, and the nopaline synthase terminator was incorporated. To enhance cloning efficiency, an intron was introduced into the P3 cistron, which exhibited toxicity to <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, leading to faster bacterial growth and higher plasmid DNA yields [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The vector PPV-NK, derived from pICPPV, included an insertion cassette between the <italic toggle="yes">NIb</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CP</italic> genes, consisting of a polylinker and an additional recognition site for NIa protease. Initially, the reporter gene for GFP was cloned into PPV-NK. Infected <italic toggle="yes">N. clevelandii</italic> exhibited symptoms comparable to the wild-type PPV, and immunochemical analysis demonstrated effective cleavage of GFP from the viral polyprotein. Expression of functional GFP in infected leaves was confirmed through fluorescence microscopy even before the onset of infection symptoms. Moreover, the construct was genetically stable for at least 30 dpi, even after mechanical passage. To test the vector&#x02019;s utility for vaccine antigen production in plants, a construct for the expression of the VP60 structural protein of the Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was prepared. In this case, there was no reduction in infectivity or change in infection symptomatology compared to wild-type PPV, and VP60 expression was immunochemically detected in plants at 15 dpi. The presence of truncated forms of VP60 at 21 dpi indicated genetic instability of the construct, with RT-PCR analysis confirming partial deletions of the insert. However, full-length VP60 predominated in most infected plants. The expressed VP60 was administered subcutaneously to rabbits in two doses as a clarified extract from infected leaves combined with an oil adjuvant. Immunization induced a specific antibody response against RHDV, with complete protective efficacy against lethal infection [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Another example is the use of the full-length clone p35PPV-NAT [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], into which cistrons encoding the fluorescent proteins GFP and DsRed were inserted between the <italic toggle="yes">NIb</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CP</italic> genes. The prepared constructs, along with other labeled potyviruses, allowed for monitoring their spatial distribution during single or mixed infection with PVX [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In our laboratory, an infectious clone of the PPV-Rec strain was prepared by gradually replacing the cDNA of PPV in pICPPV [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with homologous regions from the BOR-3 isolate while retaining the intron inserted in the P3 cistron [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. From the resulting clone pICPPV-Rec, the expression vector pAD (referred to as pBOR-VT in the older literature) was derived by reintroducing the cloning linker from pICPPV. To ensure the biological safety of the vector, mutagenesis of the DAG motif in the N-terminal region of CP, essential for aphid transmission of PPV, was performed [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The pAD vector was infectious after the insertion of various foreign genes, and it was genetically stable. Pilot experiments focused on expressing the PB1-F2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic>, but its detection and potential purification from infected plants were limited by its low solubility in planta [<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In subsequent experiments, the cDNA of PPV from the pAD vector was recloned into the binary plasmid pCambia 1304 with a deleted GUS gene, enabling methodologically simpler and more efficient plant transfection through agroinfiltration. The resulting vector, designated as pAD-agro, was subsequently used for the expression of different foreign proteins in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, the susceptibility of several alternative hosts to the experimental agroinfection with pAD-agro was evaluated. Systemic PPV infection was successfully established in domestic plum (<italic toggle="yes">P. domestica</italic>) seedlings and opium poppy (<italic toggle="yes">P. somniferum</italic>) [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Initially, a sequence encoding a small heat-shock protein from the bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Cronobacter sakazakii</italic> (designated sHSPhis) was cloned into the pAD-agro vector, with a hexahistidine tag fused at both ends. The resulting construct, pAD-agro-sHSPhis, was infectious and remained stable even after prolonged cultivation. Accumulation of sHSPhis in plants was observed between 7 and 14 dpi, peaking at 9 dpi. However, low levels of sHSPhis were still detectable at 75 dpi. Interestingly, the detection signal was significantly higher in roots compared to leaves, suggesting greater stability of sHSPhis in root tissues. Both leaves and roots harvested at 9 dpi were used as source material for sHSPhis purification via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). While extraction under native conditions was unsuccessful, the use of 6M guanidinium chloride effectively solubilized sHSPhis from leaves, yielding 24 &#x003bc;g per gram of fresh leaf tissue. Despite higher sHSPhis accumulation in roots, extraction efficiency from this tissue was lower, yielding about 8 &#x003bc;g per gram of fresh root tissue [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Subsequent experiments focused on the expression of the full-length nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as its N- and C-proximal fragments, each approximately half of the size of the full protein. All three constructs systemically infected <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> plants and demonstrated long-term genetic stability. The N-proximal fragment exhibited a high accumulation rate in systemically infected leaves, reaching levels comparable to the PPV coat protein.

To monitor the spread of LMV in susceptible and resistant lettuce cultivars, reporter genes for GFP and GUS were inserted into the cDNA clone of its isolate LMV-E in an N-terminal fusion with HC-Pro. The resulting constructs, LMV-E-GFP and LMV-E-GUS, were used to infect lettuce plants (<italic toggle="yes">Lactuca sativa</italic>), which developed typical mosaic symptoms (with LMV-E-GUS showing a slight delay). However, the symptoms were milder compared to the parental virus and did not include stunting, leaf deformation, or necrotic lesions. Virus accumulation in systemically infected tissues was also reduced. The LMV-E-GFP construct was phenotypically stable for at least six passages based on GFP expression, but long-term (four-month) propagation within an individual host led to the loss of emitted fluorescence.

Targeted mutagenesis was performed in the AG genome by substituting alanine with threonine in the DAG motif of the CP, which is essential for virus transmission by aphids. An insertion cassette for cloning foreign genes in translational in-frame fusion with adjacent cleavage sites for P1 and NIaPro proteases was inserted between the <italic toggle="yes">P1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HC-Pro</italic> genes of the resulting vector. The genes for the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) CP and the watermelon mosaic virus CP were inserted into this modified vector (designated as AGIII).

These results suggested that the position between the <italic toggle="yes">NIb</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CP</italic> genes represents a more suitable area for the insertion of foreign genes. For a closer characterization of virus distribution in plants, reporter genes for GUS and GFP were inserted into AGII.

Infection of cucumber and squash plants with the AGII-IFN construct led to the production of biologically active IFN-&#x003b1;2 in fruits and leaves. The highest activity of IFN-&#x003b1;2 was observed in leaves, while its activity in fruits was two to eight times lower. The expression of IFN-&#x003b1;2 in leaves was dependent on the developmental stage of the leaf, with a decrease in IFN-&#x003b1;2 activity in fully developed leaves despite stable virus accumulation. This decrease can be attributed to a lower replication rate of the virus in mature tissues and a higher turnover of IFN-&#x003b1;2 compared to the stability of AGII virions. The highest level of IFN-&#x003b1;2 activity was much lower than expected based on the concentration of viral CP, likely due to instability or incorrect folding due to excess amino acid residues from cleavage sites flanking the insert [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In subsequent experiments, the <italic toggle="yes">bar</italic> gene encoding phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT), whose expression in plants leads to the development of resistance to glufosinate ammonium-based herbicides, was inserted into the AGII vector.

The PVA genome was first modified by inserting a foreign gene to study the role of the phosphorylation of PVA CP by CK2 kinase during viral infection.

Compared to the wild-type virus, the infected plants exhibited milder symptoms, with comparable or only slightly reduced accumulation of PVA CP. All constructs were genetically stable for at least 14&#x02013;40 days post-infection. Plant infection led to successful expression of GFP as well as enzymatically active S-COMT. The estimated yield of S-COMT after affinity purification was approximately 0.9% of the total leaf protein (TLP) compared to an estimated PVA CP amount of approximately 2% TLP. The meta-methylation and para-methylation activity of plant-expressed S-COMT was 5% and 30% of the value compared to recombinant S-COMT expressed in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, respectively, and the ratio of meta- to para-methylation of the substrate also differed. Differences in S-COMT enzymatic activity may be due to different physiological conditions between hosts for expression, such as pH, ion concentration, or the presence of plant compounds.

Reduced pathogenicity correlated with decreased virus accumulation in systemically infected <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> leaves and <italic toggle="yes">N. tabacum</italic> protoplasts. Epifluorescence microscopy of infected plants and immunochemical analysis confirmed the expression of functional GFP, which, however, was not genetically stable. Deletion variants were detected in the primarily infected plants (18 dpi), and after the second mechanical passage, all tested samples showed the deletion genotype, with their progressive accumulation correlating with increasing infection symptom intensity, similarly to the wild-type virus [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These experiments were followed by attempts to simultaneously co-express three reporter genes from a single viral construct. Genes encoding GFP (G), luciferase (L), and GUS (U) were cloned into regions located between the P1/HC-Pro and the NIb/CP and at the 5&#x02032; end of the P1 cistron, respectively, to prepare a series of constructs with the insertion of one (pG00, p0L0, p00U), two (pGL0, pG0U, p0LU), or all three genes (pGLU).

While <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> infected with the p00U construct showed symptoms comparable to the empty vector and the wild-type virus, constructs p0L0, pG00, and p0LU caused only mild symptomatology.

Subsequently, genes encoding viral suppressors of gene silencing, CMV 2b and TBSV p19, were cloned into pSMV-MCS, whose expression should lead to more severe SMV infection symptoms. Indeed, infected plants developed intense infection symptoms, including stunting and leaf deformation, with virus accumulation comparable to the wild-type SMV.

To prevent virus transmission between plants, a substitution mutation of threonine to alanine in the PTK motif of HC-Pro, essential for its aphid transmission, was also performed. The resulting vector pSMV-Dual was infectious, and biological experiments demonstrated that unlike the parental pSMV-G7H and pSMV-MCS, it is not aphid-transmissible. Subsequently, genes for GFP and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) were inserted into pSMV-Dual. To specifically distinguish the individual proteins based on different subcellular localization, CFP was expressed in fusion with a nuclear localization signal derived from the SV40 T antigen.

Interaction of HC-Pro with two cellular proteins&#x02014;glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and subunit IV of the cytochrome b6/f complex&#x02014;was also identified. These experiments highlight the robust applicability of potyviral vectors not only in biotechnological applications but also in the study of protein&#x02013;protein interactions in planta [<xref rid="B53-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot9-viruses-16-01920"><title>2.9.

For the purposes of heterologous expression, a full-length cDNA clone of its isolate HN39 was used.

Sugarcane Mosaic Virus</title><p>Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV, <italic toggle="yes">Potyvirus sacchari</italic>) is an important pathogen of sugarcane, maize, and other grass species, causing a disease known as sugarcane mosaic. To achieve the expression of foreign proteins in maize, an infectious cDNA clone of SCMV, derived from the MDMV-B isolate, was constructed. The SCMV genome was placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator. The resulting clone was then modified by introducing two different cloning sites, as well as an additional recognition site for NIa protease between the <italic toggle="yes">P1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HC-Pro</italic> genes. Transmissibility of the virus by aphids was prevented by mutagenesis of the DAG motif in the capsid protein, replacing alanine with threonine. Based on the cloning site, resulting vectors were designated pSCMV-CS1 and pSCMV-CS2, respectively. To evaluate its potential for protein expression in maize, the GFP-encoding sequence was cloned into the pSCMV vectors. Two weeks post-inoculation, typical mosaic symptoms were observed on the leaves of infected plants. Using fluorescent microscopy, green fluorescence was detected in symptomatic leaves, which was prominent in lighter green to yellow areas of the leaf. GFP expression was consistent throughout the entire length of the leaf. The intact GFP insert was detected in most samples even after two months of cultivation, although some minor deletions were found in several upper leaf samples. To further evaluate the ability of SCMV to express functional proteins of varying sizes, the genes <italic toggle="yes">uidA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">bar</italic> encoding GUS and PAT were inserted into the pSCMV vectors. All constructs were infectious, and the expression of functional proteins was confirmed. GUS activity was detected throughout the leaves, with no background activity in control plants infected with empty vector. In the case of PAT-expressing plants, resistance to the herbicide Finale<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was observed, and all infected plants survived the treatment. These results demonstrated that the modified SCMV vector can successfully express different biologically active proteins of foreign origin. Moreover, infection with the pSCMV vector was successfully established in the B73 dent corn inbred line, demonstrating that SCMV expression vectors can be effectively used across a wide range of maize genetic backgrounds, making them a versatile tool for maize research [<xref rid="B61-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot11-viruses-16-01920"><title>2.11. Zinnia Mild Mottle Virus</title><p>Zinnia mild mottle virus (ZiMMV) is a recently discovered potyvirus that was found in common zinnia plants (<italic toggle="yes">Zinnia elegans</italic>) displaying mild leaf mottling and flower curling symptoms. A full-length infectious cDNA clone pCB-ZiMMV was used for the expression of several foreign proteins in common zinnia and other <italic toggle="yes">Asteraceae</italic> plants: a fragment of enhanced GFP (eGFP), GUS, FLAG-tagged Cas9 protein, ZeMYB9 transcription factor, and gibberellin-20-oxidase. Heterologous sequences were inserted between <italic toggle="yes">NIb</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CP</italic> cistrons and flanked by NIa-Pro cleavage sites. The eGFP gene fragment was successfully inserted and expressed in common zinnia plants, developing typical symptoms of systemic ZiMMV infection approximately 10 dpi. All infected plants exhibited prominent green fluorescence in both systemic leaves and flowers. The eGFP-encoding sequence remained detectable even after three mechanical passages, confirming the genetic stability of the construct. Similarly, the vector enabled stable systemic expression of GUS in both stem and root tissues. In contrast, the insertion of the 4266 nt long gene encoding Cas9 protein prevented the systemic spread of ZiMMV infection, and the Cas9 expression was restricted to inoculated leaves. Based on these results, authors attempted to use this expression vector as a tool for functional studies in common zinnia by inserting the gene encoding ZeMYB9 transcription factor [<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Overexpression of ZeMYB9 induces a dark red color in flowers and leaves due to the elevated levels of antocyanins [<xref rid="B63-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Plants transfected with this construct indeed exhibited dark red speckles and 10-fold higher antocyanin accumulation compared to mock and wild-type ZiMMV-infected plants, demonstrating the usefulness of this system [<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

Potyviruses as Carriers of Foreign Antigens</title><p>Like many other groups of viruses, potyviruses have been used to prepare chimeric virus particles presenting foreign peptides on their surfaces (<xref rid="viruses-16-01920-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The first vector constructed for the fusion of foreign peptides with potyvirus CP was pGPPV-NATMluI, derived from the infectious clone pGPPV [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which was modified by deleting 45 nt in the region encoding the N-terminus of CP, described in naturally aphid-nontransmissible (NAT) PPV mutants. A unique MluI restriction site was introduced into the deletion site for cloning purposes. A sequence encoding a 15-amino-acid-long epitope from the VP2 protein of canine parvovirus (CPV) was inserted into pGPPV-NATMluI either as a single copy or in a double tandem repeat. Both constructs systemically infected <italic toggle="yes">N. clevelandii</italic> with unchanged symptomatology, and the accumulation and stability of the chimeric virions of both types were comparable to wild-type PPV particles. Immunochemical analysis showed a strong specific reaction with a monoclonal antibody against the corresponding CPV epitope. The immunogenicity of purified chimeras was confirmed in both mouse and rabbit models, including virus-neutralizing activity of sera after immunization [<xref rid="B66-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The lower tolerance of pGPPV-NATMluI to insertions of other peptides led to efforts to identify new potential insertion sites within the N-terminal domain of CP. Using PEPSCAN analysis of PPV CP, fragments reacting with sera from immunized animals were identified, and it was shown that the immunogenicity of foreign fused peptides in vivo was closely related to the inherent immunogenicity of the given PPV CP region, determined by its degree of surface accessibility in the native structure of the virion [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The AGII vector based on ZYMV was also used for epitope presentation. Initially, sequences encoding a hexahistidine tag (AGII-6xhis) and a 16 amino acid peptide from the human c-Myc protein (Myc) were inserted into AGII in an N-terminal translational fusion with CP. Both chimeric viruses were systemically infectious and genetically stable, and their accumulation in cucurbits was comparable to the parental AGII. Immunochemical analysis showed specific reactivity of both chimeras with antibodies against the fused peptides, but the weakened detection signal with the ZYMV CP antibody was observed, likely due to the masking of its antigenic determinants. Successful purification of AGII-6xhis through affinity chromatography under native conditions confirmed the exposure of the fused peptide on the virion surface. CP fusion with Myc was also used to label AGII deletion mutants prepared to identify non-essential parts of the N-terminal domain of ZYMV CP, which are dispensable during systemic infection. It was found that even the removal of 33 amino acids did not lead to a reduction in infectivity or symptoms compared to AGII, and approximately one-third of the infectivity was retained even after the deletion of the entire N-terminal domain of CP (43 amino acids). Unlike Myc, inserting an equally long foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) CP-derived peptide into one of the AGII deletion mutants resulted in the loss of virus infectivity, which was surprisingly restored by N-terminal fusion of this peptide with Myc [<xref rid="B67-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These observations were later clarified by experiments demonstrating a direct dependence of ZYMV infectivity on maintaining the naturally neutral charge of the N-terminal domain of CP. Insertion of a highly basic FMDV peptide increased its charge, which was subsequently neutralized by inserting the negatively charged Myc [<xref rid="B68-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Among the more recent examples of using potyviruses as carriers of foreign antigens is the p35Tunos vector based on TuMV. In this vector, a segment encoding a 20 amino acid peptide derived from the human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was inserted into an N-terminal translational fusion with CP. The resulting construct pVER3 systemically infected <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Brassica juncea</italic>, in which it was genetically stable during two monitored mechanical passages. Purified pVER3 particles specifically reacted with an antibody against the peptide, and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed its presence on the virion surface. Chimeric pVER3 virions were then subjected to in vivo immunogenicity tests. Sera from mice immunized with pVER3 showed significantly higher titers of specific antibodies compared to the group immunized with an equivalent amount of the unfused peptide. When pVER3 particles were used as immobilized antigen in ELISA tests, up to 30-fold higher detection sensitivity was observed based on reactivity with reference serum [<xref rid="B69-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In a follow-up study, a segment encoding a 14 amino acid peptide from the thrombin receptor was inserted into p35Tunos in fusion with TuMV CP. However, unlike pVER3, there was a significant reduction in virus infectivity, and attempts to restore it by modifying the amino acid context of the inserted peptide were unsuccessful [<xref rid="B70-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>The latest example is the production of plant-derived nanoparticles decorated with nanobodies by using ZYMV and TEV-based vectors [<xref rid="B71-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Nanobodies are an interesting alternative to monoclonal antibodies consisting of the variable domain of heavy chain (VHH) antibodies from animals belonging to the family <italic toggle="yes">Camelidae</italic>. With molecular masses of 12&#x02013;15 kDa, nanobodies are the smallest currently known antigen-binding proteins, making them attractive therapeutic molecules [<xref rid="B72-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. To explore the potential of ZYMV as a platform for displaying larger moieties, such as nanobodies, the vector AGII-&#x00394;33 was used. As demonstrated previously by [<xref rid="B67-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], this construct tolerated the replacement of 33 amino-terminal moieties of the CP with heterologous peptides without a significant impact on virus infectivity. The sequence encoding anti-&#x003b1;GFP nanobody was cloned into the AGII-&#x00394;33 to produce fully decorated nanoparticles. To prepare partially decorated nanoparticles, a derivative clone containing a picornavirus splicing domain F2A between the nanobody and the CP was also constructed. Zucchini plants agroinoculated with these recombinant viruses displayed varying symptoms; while the F2A containing construct caused mild symptoms, the clone without an F2A domain produced no visible symptoms. RT-PCR analysis indeed confirmed the presence of the nanobody sequence only in plants infected with F2A-containing virus. These results suggest that the F2A cleavage system allowed for the production of partially decorated viral particles and the stable expression of the nanobody, making ZYMV a promising platform for displaying functional proteins on viral particles. Chimeric virions were purified from zucchini plants, and their structural integrity was verified through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Further analyses confirmed successful GFP binding activity [<xref rid="B71-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, the anti-&#x003b1;GFP-encoding sequence was cloned into the TEV-based vector either with or without a self-cleaving F2A domain. Unlike ZYMV, the foreign sequence was inserted into the TEV genome without deleting any region of the CP coding sequence. Surprisingly, unlike the results with ZYMV, the clone without F2A caused symptoms of systemic infection following agroinoculation of <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> plants. RT-PCR analyses confirmed the anti-&#x003b1;GFP nanobody sequence in viral progenies, and Western blot showed the expression of the fused CP&#x02013;nanobody chimeras. Purification of the chimeric particles showed a decreased yield for recombinant TEV compared to the wild-type virus, but TEM analysis confirmed the presence of typical TEV particles. Further analyses proved the ability of purified particles to bind GFP, confirming that the nanobodies remained functional after virion assembly. These results demonstrated the successful production of functional nanobody-decorated viral nanoparticles using TEV-based recombinant clones [<xref rid="B71-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>The TEV-based vector was further applied for the production of plant-derived nanoparticles decorated with nanobodies recognizing two different regions of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (designated as VHH1 and VHH2, respectively). Initially, the VHH1-encoding cDNA was cloned into the TEV infectious clone to achieve N-terminal fusion with TEV CP. Three additional derivatives of this construct were also created, incorporating different 2A self-cleaving peptides (P2A, E2A, and F2A) exhibiting various cleavage efficiencies to modulate the ratio of decorated (nanobody-fused) versus free CP. The construct without a 2A peptide was fully decorated with nanobodies and maintained infectivity, while the addition of 2A peptides enabled mixed populations of decorated and free CP within the virions. Interestingly, the TEV-VHH2 construct was non-infectious, indicating that the viability of fully decorated VNPs depends on the nanobody itself. However, adding an F2A peptide restored infectivity, resulting in partially decorated particles. The research proceeded to purify VNPs from <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> plants infected with TEV-VHH1 or TEV-VHH2-F2A, verifying the presence of both decorated and free CP. Quantification showed that VHH1-CP and VHH2-F2A-CP accumulated to approximately 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g per gram of fresh tissue, respectively. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the successful decoration of the VNPs, as seen through gold-labeled staining around the VHH-decorated particles, which was absent in the wild-type control. ELISA tests demonstrated that TEV-derived VNPs, decorated with either VHH1 or VHH2, effectively recognized the RBD, confirming the antigen-binding activity of the VNPs. In a pseudovirus neutralization assay, VHH-decorated VNPs displayed dose-dependent neutralization activity against a GFP-expressing pseudotyped virus, with nearly complete inhibition at higher concentrations. TEV-derived VNPs carrying VHH1 showed an IC50 of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/mL. This performance was notably better than a dimeric VHH1 control, suggesting that multivalency on the VNPs enhances neutralizing efficiency [<xref rid="B73-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>In our laboratory, the pAD expression vector was modified for the fusion of foreign peptides with PPV CP by removing the viral protease recognition site. Although the resulting vector pADep (referred to as pBOR-VTep in the older literature) was infectious, inserting most tested foreign sequences led to the loss of virus viability. A successful example of pADep utilization is the preparation of chimeric virions presenting an 18 amino acid peptide derived from IAV HA. However, inserting another HA IAV fragment of the same length resulted in the loss of construct infectivity (Achs and &#x00160;ubr, unpublished results). Previous experiments on ZYMV suggested the role of the overall net charge of the N-terminal domain of the capsid protein in systemic virus infectivity [<xref rid="B68-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Surprisingly, maintaining the naturally negative net charge of the N-terminal domain of PPV CP did not restore the viability of these chimeras, suggesting the role of different factors that determine virus infectivity. Our results show that the very end of CP PPV is not suitable for the insertion of foreign peptides (Achs and &#x00160;ubr, unpublished results). However, internal positions located within the N-terminal domain might be eligible for this purpose, as suggested by previously published results [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>Potyvirus-based expression vectors offer distinct advantages for heterologous protein expression in plants, such as efficient polyprotein expression, flexibility in insertion sites, and a broad host range. These vectors allow for high-yield protein production, with options for either free or fused expression (<xref rid="viruses-16-01920-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), which can be tailored to specific applications. Potyviruses are especially promising for expression in a wide range of plants, including edible crops, providing potential for accessible vaccine delivery or therapeutic protein production. Several studies have demonstrated the versatility of potyvirus-based vectors for the expression of foreign recombinant proteins or the production of chimeric virus particles that present foreign peptides on their surfaces. Such constructs have shown promising results in eliciting immune responses in animal models, highlighting their potential for vaccine development [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B66-viruses-16-01920" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

Ongoing research and modifications to these vectors continue to enhance their efficiency and broaden their applicability, paving the way for innovative solutions in plant biotechnology and beyond.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
