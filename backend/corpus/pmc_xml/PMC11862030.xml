Vaccine-preventable diseases, however, remain a significant burden in Africa, with millions of children remaining unvaccinated. While vaccines play an important role in preventing infectious diseases and saving lives, they are fragile and sensitive to temperature changes. Maintaining their potency from production to the end user is crucial, but complex supply chain issues often lead to stockouts, waste, and inefficiency. Supply chain management of vaccines involves a systematic series of events, from procurement to availability at the last mile (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Sarley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The optimization of vaccine supply chains in Africa is a critical issue that has gained prominence, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The continent faces unique challenges in vaccination efforts, including logistical hurdles, infrastructural deficits, and varying epidemiological landscapes. The World Health Organization has highlighted VPD remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among children in Africa, with disparities in vaccination coverage exacerbating these issues (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Olutuase et al., 2022</xref>). The deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies presents a promising avenue to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of vaccine distribution systems across the continent (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Subharun, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from experience.</p><p>AI can play a transformative role in vaccine supply chain management by improving forecasting, inventory management, and logistics. For instance, studies have shown that AI-driven analytics can optimize inventory levels and reduce stock-outs, thereby ensuring that vaccines are available when and where they are needed (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Iwu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, integrating AI into supply chain processes can facilitate real-time tracking and demand forecasting, which are essential for managing the complexities of vaccine distribution in diverse geographical contexts (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Modgil et al., 2021</xref>). By leveraging predictive analytics and autonomous operations, AI technologies can enhance the resilience of vaccine supply chains, allowing for a more agile response to disruptions, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Despite the potential benefits, implementing AI in vaccine supply chains in Africa is fraught with challenges. Issues such as data quality, infrastructure limitations, and the need for stakeholder engagement must be addressed to fully realize the advantages of AI technologies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kazan&#x000e7;o&#x0011f;lu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Modgil et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the complexity of vaccine supply chains, which includes cold chain requirements and the need for well-trained personnel, necessitates a comprehensive approach that considers both technological and human factors (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Olutuase et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>This paper, a perspective that aims to explore these opportunities and challenges in detail, provides a framework for understanding how AI can be effectively harnessed to optimize vaccine supply chains in Africa. And also examines the current state of vaccine distribution, identifying best practices from countries that have successfully integrated AI technologies, and proposing actionable strategies to enhance supply chain resilience and efficiency.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>1.1 Current state of vaccine distribution in Africa</title><p>The distribution of vaccines in Africa has been a multifaceted challenge, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the global urgency for vaccination, Africa has faced significant hurdles in both the acquisition and distribution of vaccines. Reports indicate that as of early 2021, many African countries had administered fewer than 10 doses of COVID-19 vaccines per 100 people, starkly contrasting with higher rates in regions like the United States and Europe, where vaccination campaigns began much earlier (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Sen-Crowe et al., 2021</xref>). This disparity highlights systemic issues in the supply chain and logistics that have historically plagued vaccine distribution across the continent. Many countries procure vaccines through centralized processes, such as UNICEF&#x02019;s initiatives, which ensure quality vaccines at negotiated prices. Organizations like GAVI also provide financial support to negotiate lower costs for low- and middle-income countries (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Duijzer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Vaccines must be transported under strict cold chain conditions (+2 to +8&#x000b0;C), presenting significant logistical challenges due to inadequate infrastructure and electricity shortages in many regions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>). Solar-powered equipment has been introduced to mitigate these challenges (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aina et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, Nigeria operates a centralized distribution system where vaccines are sent from national stores to zonal cold stores quarterly, and further distributed to local governments monthly.</p><p>Generally, the logistical Challenges Currently Faced in Vaccine Rollout in Africa includes:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1.
