Having a pre-existing mental health condition has been identified as a risk factor for higher reported levels of depression and anxiety during this time (Iasevoli et al., <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Iob et al., <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; O'Connor et al., <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and concerns have been raised that people with existing mental health conditions may be at risk of longer-term effects such as relapse (Holmes et al., <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>In considering why this population has been adversely affected, a number of theories have been proposed including (i) higher concerns about the virus itself, such as COVID-19 related delusional beliefs and health anxieties (Johnson et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>); (ii) a greater propensity to be affected by societal restrictions due to higher baseline risk of loneliness and social isolation (Holmes et al., <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Michalska da Rocha et al., <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Yao et al., <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>); and (iii) disruption to mental health service provision (Tromans et al., <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) as well as reduced availability of informal support networks (Johnson et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However, to date, research into triggers of poorer mental health during the pandemic amongst people with mental health conditions has been predominantly quantitative, focusing on pre-assumed hypotheses. Further, having an existing mental health condition may not always be a precursor to poorer experiences; feelings of resilience and greater acceptance by others have also been reported, alongside the use of coping strategies learnt from the prior self-management of mental health conditions (Sheridan Rains et al., <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). These findings were, however, predominantly taken from media reports and data obtained from organisational websites. There remains a clear research gap for understanding these broader mental health experiences and the management of these experiences during the pandemic from the perspectives of those with lived experience of mental health conditions.</p><p>The aim of this study was to (i) identify the impact of self-isolation, social distancing measures and the pandemic overall on the mental health and well-being of people with mental health conditions, and (ii) identify protective factors and coping strategies that were applied to support positive mental health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" disp-level="1" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This was a qualitative study, based on semi-structured interviews with people with mental health conditions in the United Kingdom. The study took a phenomenological approach, focusing on participants lived experiences of the pandemic and their subjective meanings of the changes brought about by the social distancing restrictions (Langdridge, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>The study was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee, reference number 14895/005.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2001"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Inclusion criteria were adults aged 18+ living in the United Kingdom with a self-reported diagnosis of one or more mental health conditions who were able to speak English for interview purposes. Recruitment occurred via social media, the COVID-19 Social Study website and newsletter, and a mail out from third sector organisations working with people with mental health conditions. Participants were purposively recruited to ensure diversity in gender, age, ethnicity, and mental health diagnosis. Potential participants were emailed a study information sheet and asked to contact the researcher if they had any questions about the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to interviews being arranged. Participants also completed a demographics form.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2002"><title>Data collection</title><p>Interviews followed a topic guide and were conducted by AB (researcher in mental health), AM (research psychologist), LB (sociologist) and HA (postgraduate research and medical student) remotely via video call, or telephone depending on participant access to technology and personal preference.

Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim by an external transcription company. Transcripts were checked for accuracy and anonymised by the lead researcher (AB) before analysis. Data collection continued until theoretical saturation, whereby no further concepts were discussed by interviewees (Braun &#x00026; Clarke, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0002-S2003"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis (Braun &#x00026; Clarke, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Braun et al., <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Transcripts were entered into Nvivo 12 software for analysis (QSR International Pty Ltd. NVivo, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and familiarisation with data was achieved by reading through each transcript before coding commenced. A deductive analytical approach was initially taken with the development of a preliminary coding framework using concepts from the interview questions, including codes related to mental health, social isolation, coping strategies and barriers to engagement in protective activities. This was followed by inductive coding whereby new codes were generated from participant accounts and added to the coding framework. The coding framework was applied to the transcripts using line-by-line coding. Two researchers (AB, AM) independently and systematically coded three (14%) of the transcripts and discussed the generated codes and emerging themes. AB continued coding the data using the revised framework, adding new codes to the framework as more transcripts became available and until no new codes were identified. Codes were then organised into themes corresponding to the research questions. The research team met weekly to review and discuss codes, themes and developing findings and to approve the final results and report.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1" id="S0003"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-two participants were interviewed between May and August 2020.

Feeling isolated at home, reduced access to mental health services and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding imposed restrictions all contributed to a deterioration in mental health. For those with severe mental illnesses this was a particularly difficult time, presenting unique triggers for self-harm and COVID-19 related hallucinations. However, negative psychological experiences were not always sustained beyond the initial lockdown period or indeed uniform across participant accounts; some found this period a time of respite or were able to use previous experiences of adversity to draw upon successful coping strategies. Others experienced less social pressure and felt less socially excluded due to empathy from others. Engagement in hobbies, connecting with loved ones and perceived availability of social support were identified as important protective factors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0008"><title>Factors contributing to deterioration in mental health</title><p>Triggers of poorer mental health identified in our study echo findings from previous research on risk factors for mental illness such as social isolation (Michalska da Rocha et al., <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and findings that people with mental health conditions had a five times higher risk of severe loneliness during the pandemic (Bu et al., <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Our findings highlight how the pandemic exacerbated these triggers and led to increased uncertainty and not feeling in control. Participants acknowledged a conflict between the importance of maintaining social distancing and isolating at home to feel safe, and the adverse consequences of social isolation on their mental health. Detrimental effects on mental health linked to social distancing restrictions could be long lasting and have been observed in previous pandemics up to six-months after the end of quarantine in people with mental health conditions (Jeong et al., <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Other triggers of poorer mental health included disrupted access to mental health services, also identified in a study by Gillard et al, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>. Indeed, a reduction in referrals to mental health services and an increased use of emergency psychiatric services were reported during the pandemic (Mustafa, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Further, whilst prior to the pandemic, the provision of mental health telecare was broadly supported by health professionals as an adjunct to face-to-face care (Langarizadeh et al., <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), participants in our study identified the lack of physical presence of the clinician as problematic.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0009"><title>Coping strategies and protective factors</title><p>In corroboration with previous research (Gillard et al., <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), we found some reports of positive mental health outcomes from the pandemic.

Further, some participants found they were able to adapt and form new routines, engage in meaningful activities and draw upon previous adversity and isolation to actively cope. Our study also found that perceived social support and connecting with family and friends were important buffers against relapse in line with previous research (Wang et al., <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).

Half the sample were, however, unable to work due to illness and many reported being in contact with mental health services. People were interviewed while they were experiencing initial lockdown restrictions and the earlier stages of the pandemic, rather than retrospectively, and the ongoing changes and prolonged uncertainty may have an impact on mental health and coping strategies in ways that have not been captured here.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0011"><title>Implications</title><p>This research highlights that many individuals with existing mental health conditions experienced poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these experiences were nuanced: certain factors appeared to confer psychological support and mitigate worse experiences. Future work should explore the changing needs of people&#x02019;s experiences as the pandemic continues, the longer-term support that people with mental health conditions may need and how best to provide support. Such work may require adaptation and tailoring of existing services and interventions to comply with social distancing restrictions, while remaining acceptable and accessible to those who have struggled with virtual services and support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM6780" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IJMH_A_1952953_SM6780.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM6778" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="IJMH_A_1952953_SM6778.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr Louise Baxter for support with recruitment and interviews and Dr Anna Roberts, Dr Tom May, Jo Dawes and Katey Warren who provided weekly feedback on emerging findings.
