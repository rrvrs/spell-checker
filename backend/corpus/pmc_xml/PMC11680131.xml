Horizontal transmission leads to acute transient infections via the oronasal route, whereas vertical transmission might lead to the birth of immunotolerant, persistently infected animals. In both cases, BVDV exerts an immunosuppressive effect, predisposing infected animals to secondary infections. E<sup>rns</sup>, an immunomodulatory viral protein, is present on the envelope of the virus and is released as a soluble protein. In this form, it is taken up by cells and, with its RNase activity, degrades single- and double-stranded (ds) RNA, thus preventing activation of the host&#x02019;s interferon system. Here, we show that E<sup>rns</sup> of the pestiviruses BVDV and Bungowannah virus effectively inhibit dsRNA-induced IFN synthesis in well-differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at the air&#x02013;liquid interface. This activity was observed independently of the side of entry, apical or basolateral, of the pseudostratified, polarized cell layer. Virus infection was successful from both surfaces but was inefficient, requiring several days of incubation. Virus release was almost exclusively restricted to the apical side. This confirms that primary, well-differentiated respiratory epithelial cells cultured at the air&#x02013;liquid interface are an appropriate model to study viral infection and innate immunotolerance in the bovine respiratory tract. Furthermore, evidence is presented that E<sup>rns</sup> might contribute to the immunosuppressive effect observed after BVDV infections, especially in persistently infected animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pestivirus</kwd><kwd>bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)</kwd><kwd>viral endonuclease</kwd><kwd>innate immune evasion</kwd><kwd>interferon type-I</kwd><kwd>IFN antagonist</kwd><kwd>glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding site</kwd><kwd>viral RNase</kwd><kwd>respiratory epithelium</kwd><kwd>air&#x02013;liquid interface (ALI)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Swiss National Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>310030_172796</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, grant no. 310030_172796 (to M.S.) with support of internal funds of the Institute of Virology and Immunology.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01908"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Pestiviruses are a group of viruses belonging to the family <italic toggle="yes">Flaviviridae</italic>, which also includes important human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus and dengue virus. Originally, the genus <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus</italic> was composed of four species, BVDV-1, BVDV-2, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and border disease virus (BDV). However, the identification of additional species has prompted a reclassification of the genus, first with letters to reflect the varying host tropism (e.g., Pestivirus A for BVDV-1) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and more recently, to the ICTV-mandated binomial [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The original four species, BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, and BDV, are now classified as <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus bovis</italic> (formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus A</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus tauri</italic> (formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus B</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus suis</italic> (formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus C</italic>), and <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus ovis</italic> (formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus D</italic>), respectively. Some of the newly identified pestivirus species are now named as <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus antilocaprae</italic> (pronghorn antelope pestivirus, formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus E</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus australiaense</italic> (Bungowannah virus, formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus F</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus brazilense</italic> (HoBi-like pestivirus, formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus H</italic>), or <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus scrofae</italic> (atypical porcine pestivirus, formerly <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus K</italic>), to name just a few.</p><p>Among the pestiviruses, BVDV, first described in 1946 [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], stands out as a significant pathogen in global cattle populations, causing diverse clinical manifestations such as diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, and reproductive disorders [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These symptoms result in substantial economic losses for the livestock industry worldwide, including reduced productivity, higher veterinary costs, and potential trade restrictions [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. BVDV can cause both transient (TI) and persistent infections (PI). TIs typically occur through the oronasal route, while PIs result from vertical transmission from the dam to the fetus, with affected PI animals born serving as long-term reservoirs [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Genetic mutations or viral recombination in PI-infected animals can lead to a cytopathic biotype, which causes the severe and fatal mucosal disease [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Pestiviruses are enveloped viruses whose genome consists of a single-stranded (ss), positive-sense RNA encoding a single open reading frame comprising four structural proteins (C, E<sup>rns</sup>, E1 and E2) and at least eight non-structural (NS) proteins (N<sup>pro</sup>, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Pestiviruses replicate using a semi-conservative mechanism with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) template to produce plus-strand genomic RNA. This process generates dsRNA intermediates in the cytosol of infected cells [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These dsRNA intermediates, along with highly structured viral genomic ssRNA or fragments thereof from decayed virus particles, can act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that might stimulate the host&#x02019;s pattern recognition receptors, including TLR-3, TLR-7/8, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) to activate the host interferon (IFN) response [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The virus evades the host&#x02019;s innate immune defence by expressing two IFN antagonists: the non-structural protein N<sup>pro</sup> and the structural protein E<sup>rns</sup> [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the latter being the focus of this study. E<sup>rns</sup> is a highly glycosylated protein with a length of around 225 amino acids and an apparent molecular mass of a monomer of approx. 40&#x02013;50 kDa, but it usually appears as disulfide-linked homodimers [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to its role as envelope glycoprotein, it is an endoribonuclease released in the form of an extracellular soluble protein [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It belongs to the RNase T2 family of endonucleases and is active in a broad pH range from about 4&#x02013;7.5 with an optimum around a pH value of 6 ([<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and references therein). In virus-infected cells, the non-structural protein N<sup>pro</sup> inhibits IFN induction by leading to the degradation of the transcription factor IRF-3 [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, the soluble protein E<sup>rns</sup> binds to the cell surface of infected and uninfected cells via its C-terminal GAG-binding domain, is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and degrades ss- and dsRNA via its endonuclease activity before it can engage with TLR-3 and/or TLR-7/8 in endolysosomal compartments [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Horizontal transmission of BVDV mainly occurs through the oronasal route, with the respiratory tract representing an important point of entry that is regularly exposed to microbes, allergens, and particles during inhalation [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Infections with BVDV are reported to cause an immunosuppressive effect [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], especially when co-infected with other bacteria or viruses, e.g., for the latter, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza type-3 virus, influenza D virus (IDV), bovine herpesvirus-1, or bovine coronavirus. Thus, BVDV might contribute to the well-known bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) leading to severe respiratory diseases [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms of immunosuppression that is observed after transient and persistent infection is still a matter of debate but might well include a multitude of factors [<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As soluble E<sup>rns</sup> can be detected in the oronasal secretions of PI animals [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], it might well be envisaged that this viral RNase plays an important role in the immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the activation of the innate and, as a consequence, the adaptive immune system. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the activity of E<sup>rns</sup> as IFN antagonist on differentiated, pseudostratified bovine airway epithelial cells cultured in an air&#x02013;liquid interface (ALI) system that contains ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells. This model system is considered as highly representative of the native airway epithelium [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Here, we show that E<sup>rns</sup> added to the apical and basolateral side of the ALI culture system dose-dependently inhibited dsRNA-induced IFN expression independent of the side of dsRNA application. By contrast, infection of the differentiated airway epithelial cells by various strains of BVDV could be achieved but was not efficient enough to interfere with the IFN response. Finally, the results confirmed along with previous reports that BVDV is largely released only from the apical compartment independent on the side of infection [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and that E<sup>rns</sup> does not require a species-specific receptor for its activity [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] as it was also active on human epithelial cells cultured in an ALI system. Thus, this ALI cell culture system represents an excellent model to study the interaction of pestiviruses with the host&#x02019;s innate immune system and will enable further studies to investigate the oronasal transmission of pestiviruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01908"><title>2.

For this, the cells were incubated for three days after infection, as IDV replication was previously reported to reach maximal replication within 72 h post-infection [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Viruses were diluted in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland), inoculated on the apical and basolateral side, and incubated for 3 h and up to 24 h, respectively, at 37 &#x000b0;C. However, the extension of the incubation time at the basolateral side above 3 h did not provide any difference. On the apical (air-exposed) side, incubation longer than 3 h started to compromise the integrity of the cell layer. Afterwards, the virus inoculum was removed, and the apical or basolateral surface was washed three times with HBSS. The third wash was collected as the 1 h post-infection (hpi) time point. The cells were then maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The viral progeny was harvested at 24 h intervals. For the apical side, 200 &#x003bc;L of HBSS was incubated on the apical surface for 10 min before collection at each specified time point. The apical washes obtained were then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with virus transport medium [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and stored at -80 &#x000b0;C until further analysis. The basolateral medium was also collected at each time point and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C, and replaced by fresh ALI medium at 37 &#x000b0;C. A subset of infected bBAEC cultures was collected after 48 h or 10 days post-infection (dpi) for immunofluorescence analysis.</p><p>The integrity of the barrier function in bBAEC cultures during pestivirus infections was evaluated by monitoring trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) using an EVOM<sup>2</sup> Epithelial Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Friedberg, Germany) [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

To also include a control for the RNA isolation for each supernatant sample, we used the Sendai virus, which provides a control RNA that is protected from RNase degra dation within the virus particle. A specific amount of Sendai virus, sufficient to produce a cycle threshold (Ct) value of approximately 25, was added to each sample before RNA isolation. This allowed us to assess the correct implementation of both, the RNA isolation and the RT-qPCR reaction, for each individual sample [<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. For better visualization, i.e., in order that an increase in the value also represents an increase in the amount of viral RNA, the Ct value obtained was replaced by a value from the calculation &#x02018;45&#x02014;(Ct value of the sample) divided by the slope of the standard curve (3.428)&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-16-01908"><title>2.4.

A clear dose dependence was observed between 2.5 and 25 or 50 &#x000b5;g/mL of Poly IC. Higher concentrations appeared to saturate the level of Mx induction, whereas lower concentration failed to clearly activate the IFN system.

Therefore, we infected bBAEC cultures with various noncytopathogenic strains of BVDV, i.e., Ncp7, Pe515, Suwa, and NADL, and with Bungowannah pestivirus. After 72 h, immunofluorescence staining for IDV was readily observed (not shown) as reported [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], whereas even with several attempts, we could never observe a specific staining for any pestiviral antigen after 3 days of infection (not shown).</p><p>To test for the possibility that infection and replication of BVDV in these cultures is delayed compared to infection with IDV, we prolonged the incubation after infection for up to 5 days post-infection (dpi) and analyzed the synthesis and release of viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR for increased sensitivity.</p><p>After apical infection of the bBAEC cultures, the release of viral RNA was observed starting at 48 to 72 h dpi (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a). However, the release was much more pronounced from the apical side (continuous line) than from the basolateral side (dashed line), with the largest amount of RNA detected on both sides originating from the Pe515 strain. Upon basolateral infection of the bBAEC cultures, the release of viral RNA from the apical side started only at 72 h dpi and occurred to a much smaller extent than after apical infection (continuous line), except for the strain Ncp7 that failed to release viral RNA. By contrast, there was only a steady decrease in the amount of viral RNA detected on the basolateral side (dashed line) after basolateral infection, indicative of a lack of active release of newly synthesized viral RNA (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b). Lysis of the cells after 5 days followed by analysis of the viral RNA indicated that the cultures could indeed be infected from both sides, but that the infection and replication was much more efficient after apical infection compared to infection from the basolateral side (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a,b). In accordance with the lack of release of viral RNA from the strain Ncp7 after basolateral infection, the amount of viral RNA in the cell lysate was only marginally above the detection limit (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b).</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the replication and release of viral RNA from the BVDV strain Ncp7 was just slower than for the other strains, we further extended the incubation time to 9 dpi after infection from the basolateral side (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c). But once again, there was no release of viral RNA for the Ncp7 strain on either side of the bBAEC (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c), whereas viral RNA of the strains NADL, Suwa, and Pe515 could be observed on the apical side starting at 3 to 6 dpi and leveling off at 6 to 7 dpi.

Oronasal transmission between infected and naive animals is the principal way of horizontal infection. E<sup>rns</sup>, in addition to its role as envelope glycoprotein, is released in a soluble form into the same secretions, which is also used diagnostically as a surrogate for viral particles [<xref rid="B58-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. As BVDV is regularly associated with respiratory symptoms summarized as bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), it might be well envisaged that E<sup>rns</sup> plays a role in suppressing the innate immune system in the respiratory tract. Thus, we aimed to investigate the inhibition by E<sup>rns</sup> of the dsRNA-induced activation of the host&#x02019;s IFN response in an in vitro model mimicking the natural situation of the bronchial epithelium by culturing the cells as a pseudostratified, well-differentiated layer cultured in an air&#x02013;liquid interface (ALI) system [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Here, we show that BVDV-E<sup>rns</sup> dose-dependently inhibits Poly IC-induced Mx expression (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), a well-established surrogate marker for the presence of type-I and type-III IFN. It did not depend on the side of application, i.e., E<sup>rns</sup> inhibited the IFN system upon apical and basolateral addition. In addition to BVDV, E<sup>rns</sup> of the only distantly related Bungowannah pestivirus similarly blocked dsRNA-induced Mx expression (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a), confirming that most if not all the pestiviral RNases act as IFN antagonist [<xref rid="B57-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As reported previously [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], the RNase-inactive mutant (E<sup>rns</sup>-H30F) and a mutant lacking the C-terminal GAG-binding site (E<sup>rns</sup>-&#x00394;C) were unable to block innate immune activation (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b). The latter is corroborated by the fact that binding and cell entry of E<sup>rns</sup> does depend rather on unspecific binding by its C-terminally located, positively charged amphipathic helix than on a species-specific receptor, as BVDV-E<sup>rns</sup> was similarly active in human airway epithelial cells cultured at ALI (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d&#x02013;g), as shown previously with human, ovine, caprine, or canine cell lines [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B60-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. On both, hBAEC and bBAEC, a certain ratio of the amount of Poly IC and E<sup>rns</sup> had to be maintained (e.g., a low amount of E<sup>rns</sup> was unable to block the highest concentration of Poly IC), and the efficacy of E<sup>rns</sup> was more pronounced when applied basolaterally (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The latter is probably not based on a higher affinity of E<sup>rns</sup> to the basolateral side but rather to the longer incubation time, as on the apical (air-exposed) side, medium with E<sup>rns</sup> or Poly IC could be added for a maximum of three hours before deterioration of the cell layer occurred. Notably, E<sup>rns</sup> was similarly inhibiting dsRNA-induced Mx expression when added on the opposite side of the cell layer (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), though less efficiently. By definition, a &#x02018;pseudostratified&#x02019; epithelium consists of only one layer, with all cells adhering to the basal membrane. Whether this is the absolute case after differentiation cannot be proven (e.g., compare [<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]). Therefore, we cannot state with certainty that each cell is accessible by E<sup>rns</sup> from both sides, or whether transmission of the E<sup>rns</sup> protein from cell to cell might occur. The latter was not reported to date for the E<sup>rns</sup> protein, but evidence for cell-to-cell transmission of BVDV in cell cultures has been provided [<xref rid="B61-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Nonetheless, this indicates that E<sup>rns</sup> acts intracellularly in an endolysosomal compartment (for review, see [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and references therein). This supports previous observations that complexed dsRNA protected from RNase degradation in suspension in vitro can still be inhibited by intracellular E<sup>rns</sup> [<xref rid="B60-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and that the C-terminal domain appears to be sufficient to determine the intracellular location, as GFP fused to the C-terminal amino acids of E<sup>rns</sup> can be found at the same location as wt E<sup>rns</sup> [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In order to test whether infection of bBAEC with BVDV produced a sufficient amount of E<sup>rns</sup> to block dsRNA-induced IFN expression, we infected the epithelial cell cultures at ALI prior to the addition of Poly IC. However, infection of the bBAEC for 7 days did not yield any reduction in Poly IC-induced Mx expression, independent of whether the cells were infected apically or basolaterally (not shown). Therefore, we characterized the infection of the bBAEC by analyzing the presence of viral RNA by RT-qPCR, of infectious virus by titration, and of infected cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Only after prolonged incubation, we were able to detect viral RNA and infectious virus particles in samples obtained from both sides of the polarized cell layer (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the bBAEC cultured in an ALI system could be infected from both sides, with the infection being somewhat more efficient from the apical side. This is in accordance with [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], where apical infection yielded slightly higher titers in the apical compartment, whereas infection from the basolateral compartment appeared to spread better between the cells in the non-differentiated, polarized cell layer. However, in our differentiated bBAEC culture at the air&#x02013;liquid interface, infectious BVDV was only actively released from the apical side, and not or only barely from the basolateral side, as reported for non-differentiated, polarized primary bovine airway epithelial cells [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. By contrast, viral RNA could be observed on the apical side after apical infection, whereas only input viral RNA could be detected on the apical side for several days upon basolateral infection (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Whether this viral RNA in the absence of infectious virus originates from defective particles or was released from damaged or dying cells is not known. In addition to the variability by the donors of the bBAEC, we observed quite a heterogeneity between the different BVDV strains, with Ncp7 being the least and Pe515 the most efficient strain to infect the cultures. This could be confirmed by infection of the bBAEC for ten days without intermittent sampling to preserve the cell layer followed by analysis of the cell lysates. The amount of viral RNA (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d) and infections virus (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c) detected in the cell lysates was significantly lower for the strain Ncp7, with some replicates even being negative. The cause of these strain differences is currently unknown, but for the strain NCP7, it might be related to a strong adaptation to various cell lines, with an unknown passage history over several decades [<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Immunofluorescence microscopy after 10 days of infection confirmed successful infection of the differentiated bBAEC (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The fact that only a limited number of cells are infected despite a considerable titer of infectious virus observed in the cell lysates indicates that BVDV replicates rather efficiently in the cells targeted. The infection was not different using Bungowannah pestivirus (<xref rid="viruses-16-01908-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>i,j), despite this species being reported to have a rather broad cell and species tropism [<xref rid="B63-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, the precise characterization of the cell tropism was beyond the scope of this study, and this aspect was not investigated in more detail.</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence that the viral RNase E<sup>rns</sup> is able to inhibit the activation of the host&#x02019;s IFN response induced by dsRNA when added on either side (apical and basolateral) of differentiated airway epithelium cultured in an ALI system1 [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. E<sup>rns</sup>&#x02019; activity as IFN antagonist requires its RNase activity and the GAG-binding site in the C-terminal domain. The latter appears to be sufficient to guide E<sup>rns</sup> into an intracellular, endolysosomal compartment, i.e., to the same location as Poly IC, as both can even be added to opposite sides of the polarized cell layer. There, E<sup>rns</sup> degrades viral PAMPs, i.e., highly structured ssRNA and dsRNA, prior to their activation of TLR-3 and TLR-7/8 [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This appears to be the case for most if not all E<sup>rns</sup> proteins from all pestiviruses, as indicated in this study by the viral RNase of BVDV and of Bungowannah virus, and as shown previously in cell lines using a large variety of pestivirus species [<xref rid="B57-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Notably, the specific type of glycosylation of E<sup>rns</sup> appears to be of minor importance for its activity as IFN antagonist, as E<sup>rns</sup> produced in insect, bovine, or human cells exert similar activity [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The importance of E<sup>rns</sup> as IFN antagonist for pestiviruses is further supported by the fact that this viral RNase is present in all viruses within the genus <italic toggle="yes">Pestivirus</italic>, even in the Phocoena pestivirus that is the only currently known pestivirus that lacks the second IFN antagonist, N<sup>pro</sup> [<xref rid="B64-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. As E<sup>rns</sup> can be found on both sides of the respiratory epithelium, e.g., in the blood and saliva, it can be well envisaged that it substantially contributes to the immunosuppressive effect observed after BVDV infections [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], especially in PI animals, where viral antigen was indeed detected in the bronchial epithelium [<xref rid="B65-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and where we found around 50 ng/mL free E<sup>rns</sup> protein in the blood [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The infection of the ALI cells could be achieved from the apical and basolateral side of the cell layer; however, infectious virus was only released from the apical side. Thus, together with the rather inefficient infection of this cell culture model requiring several days for successful infection, the precise way of infection with BVDV by the oronasal route remains to be established. This also shows the limitation of this cell culture model, despite it mimicking many aspects of the respiratory tract, such as the presence of ciliated and other cells, mucus production, and innate immune activation [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], it lacks the presence of immune cells, e.g., macrophages or dendritic cells, that might be involved in oronasal infection with BVDV [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B66-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Nevertheless, infectious virus particles are readily released from the apical side, which might explain the efficient respiratory transmission from infected animals. Nevertheless, primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured at ALI will be an attractive model that can be further expanded to investigate respiratory infections and co-infections [<xref rid="B66-viruses-16-01908" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Special thanks go to Carmela Lussi and Elena de Martin for providing E<sup>rns</sup> proteins, Volker Thiel and Ronald Dijkman for the primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells, Jasmine Portman, Mitra Gultom and Laura Laloli for technical support, Thomas D&#x000e9;moulins for many fruitful discussions, and the cell culture and diagnostic teams at our institute for their constant support.
