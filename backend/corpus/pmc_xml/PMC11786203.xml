Among those who reported developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), studies report changes in the cerebral connectome consistent with neuroinflammation among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rau et al., 2022</xref>) that appears not to return to normal in some patients after recovery (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Coincidentally, while most infected individuals only develop an acute syndrome, 20% of unvaccinated individuals (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2022</xref>) and 10% of vaccinated individuals with breakthrough cases of COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Thaweethai et al., 2023</xref>) develop Post-Acute Sequelae of Coronavirus Disease (PASC) that can persist for years after infection and is strongly associated with the severity of acute disease even in midlife (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lhuillier et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the widespread availability of vaccines, the risk of PASC has not been eradicated (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kahlert et al., 2023</xref>) and PASC is a growing cause of disability globally (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, there remains a need to better understand the significance of neuroimmune reactions in PASC (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Neurological symptoms are common in COVID-19 infections (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Collantes et al., 2021</xref>), and in PASC these can include lingering fatigue, brain fog, or attentional issues that are increasingly being described as neurological-PASC (N-PASC) (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Perez Giraldo et al., 2023</xref>). N-PASC is increasingly thought to be accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and a decline in attention, working memory, and cognitive throughput (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sekendiz, 2024</xref>). Prior work has identified increases in subcortical gliosis in the hippocampus in those with increased depressive symptoms following COVID-19 infection (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Braga et al., 2023</xref>), while other work has reported that changes to fractional anisotropy and isometric organization are evident in the white matter among individuals with N-PASC (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clouston et al., 2024</xref>). Together, these findings have lead researchers to suggest that neuroglial activation might emerge from a cytokine storm that causes glial or macrophagic reactions in the brain (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2024</xref>), though findings supporting this interpretation may be biased because many individuals exhibiting symptoms of N-PASC experienced neurological damage during an acute bout of severe COVID-19.</p><p id="p0045">A seminal study found evidence of subcortical gliosis among individuals reporting increased depressive symptoms following COVID-19 infection (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Braga et al., 2023</xref>), but did not examine variations in neuroinflammation among individuals with one of the most common symptoms of N-PASC &#x02013; Brain Fog. Changes in translocator protein (TSPO) expression result from glial or macrophagic hyperactivity (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) and that cerebral gliosis can therefore be measured using [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA with positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to use [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA to examine the severity and distribution of widespread neuroinflammation in the cortex, white matter, or cerebellum, and to determine if cerebral gliosis was more evident in points of entry or vulnerability including in the hippocampus or in the orbitofrontal and medial frontal cortices in N-PASC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Ethics</title><p id="p0050">The Stony Brook University Institutional Review Board approved this study.

Due to the occupational inclusion criteria this cohort is predominantly male, and most participants are under the age of 70. Additionally, individuals in the cohort have high lifetime employment levels (&#x0003e;99.5%), high educational attainment (&#x0003e;75% have at least some college education), and approximately half were working at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Inclusion/exclusion</title><p id="p0060">To be included in this study, N-PASC participants were required to have a diagnosis of N-PASC that persisted until the scanning appointment. Controls, on the other hand, were all scanned using the same protocol on the same scanner prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. All study participants lacked a history of psychosis, a history of serious head trauma, stroke, or other neurological disorders, serious medical condition such as renal failure and autoimmune disease, a known history of hepatitis C, any contraindication for PET or MRI scanning (e.g., pacemaker, metallic implants, pregnancy, etc.). To participate in the study, individuals also needed to be fluent in English and have the capacity to provide informed consent. To fit into the PET/MRI scanner, participants had a body mass index at the time of scan &#x02264;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Finally, to complete the PET component we excluded individuals currently using cognitively active medications (e.g., methylphenidate, anticholinergic, or antipsychotic medications) and those using anti-anticoagulant or anti-inflammatory medications. Because [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA binds poorly among individuals who have a relatively rare genotype indicating low affinity for TSPO polymorphism, we excluded individuals whose genotyping indicated this affinity (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mizrahi et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>TSPO genotype</italic> was based on the rs6971 polymorphism and was measured using blood samples collected at screening.

Specifically, participants had to report the presence, and describe symptom types and date of onset, for COVID-19 symptoms. Diagnoses were verified using evidence from medical records or reports from valid testing facilities showing a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antibody, or antigen testing.

Motion correction and PET-to-MRI co-registration were done before time activity curves were generated as previously described (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iscan et al., 2017</xref>). To obtain a quantitative measure of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA uptake, two-tissue-compartmental (2&#x000a0;TC) kinetic modeling was performed to quantify the total distribution volume (V<sub>T</sub>) as the outcome measure, as previously validated (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rusjan et al., 2011</xref>). The whole blood to plasma radioactivity ratio data was fit and then used to convert the whole blood automated early arterial sampling measurements to plasma equivalent. These early plasma estimates were then concatenated with the manual arterial plasma draws. To generate the final metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function for the kinetic analysis, metabolite correction was performed using a Hill function to fit the percentage of unmetabolized tracer, and the resulting input function was fit to a straight line to the peak followed by the sum of three exponentials after the peak. The arterial whole blood curve was used to correct activity in the vascular component, assuming that the blood volume is 5% of the total brain volume (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leenders et al., 1990</xref>). To adjust for differences in V<sub>T</sub> across TSPO genotypes, we multiplied the levels in individuals with the medium affinity binding genotype by 1.37 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kreisl et al., 2013</xref>). Each brain was non-linearly registered to MNI space using the T1 MRI and parcellated into volumes of interest using the Columbia Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cba.nyspi.org" id="intref0010">cba.nyspi.org</ext-link>). [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA VT was calculated as described above for each volume. We reported data for gross regions including the cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter, hippocampus, amygdala, and whole cerebellum.

However, since V<sub>T</sub> is a dynamic measure that quantifies the total lifetime distribution volume, we calculated a similar value using dynamic SUV values collected across the timeframes described above, relying on the 10-120-min time-window to calculate DSUV&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.svg"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>&#x0222b;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mi>&#x0221e;</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Sensitivity analyses showed that excluding this individual from further analysis showed no substantively important differences in results, so this individual was retained in all analyses. In this table, we found that the pre-pandemic group had lower BMI and appeared younger than the N-PASC group. The N-PASC group had much higher post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms. However, there were no differences in terms of TSPO genotype, premorbid cognitive ability, or sex. We recorded acute symptoms to help describe the sample, but since no symptoms were associated with any measure of neuroinflammation we did not report these results.

Our study revealed that symptoms indicating N-PASC were associated with substantial increases in glial activation across the cerebrum with focal points in the hippocampus, gray matter, and cerebellum even among essential workers who survived mild to moderate COVID-19 infections that did not require hospitalization. Results from this study add to a growing literature describing neuroinflammation as a central aspect of Neurological PASC (N-PASC). Together with other studies that also support the view that neuroimaging and TSPO imaging in particular can effectively discriminate N-PASC, this study suggests that N-PASC may be verified using neuroimaging-focused biomarkers including [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA distribution volume.</p><p id="p0175">Diagnostic verification for the presence of any syndrome, and N-PASC in particular, is critical to verifying diagnosis and to showing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, the accuracy of biomarkers reported in this study and in other similar studies is increasingly necessary. For example, in the present study the AUC for hippocampal [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA distribution volume adjusted for TSPO genotype was 0.95 [0.85&#x02013;1.00]. Model fit estimates for hippocampal gliosis overall and when relying on cutoffs (shown in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">eTable 1</xref>) revealed that when compared to healthy controls, hippocampal [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA distribution volume was able to identify individuals with N-PASC with sensitivity/specificity/F1 at the estimated cutoff of 0.88/0.93/0.88. If replicated, this degree of accuracy could support the use of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA to positively support a diagnosis of N-PASC.</p><p id="p0180">This work expands upon prior work finding subcortical gliosis in those with increased depressive symptoms following COVID-19 infection (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Braga et al., 2023</xref>). Our results are comparable with that study in evaluating hippocampal gliosis using similar methods including reliance on pre-COVID-19 controls (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Braga et al., 2023</xref>). However, wherein the authors reported that hippocampal [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA binding was increased by 1.51&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>3</sup> (when compared to 7.72, an increase of 19.6%) in those with delirium and headaches after COVID-19 whereas the present study reported an increase of 5.2&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>3</sup> (compared to 6.88&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>3</sup> among pre-pandemic controls, this is an increase of 75.6%) in the cerebellum, and 4.7&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>3</sup> increase in the gray matter (compared to 6.73&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>3</sup> among pre-pandemic controls, this is an increase of 69.1%) among those with brain fog after COVID-19. Our results are also consistent with results reported in a case series (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) using [<sup>18</sup>F]-DPA-714 to measure microglial activation to find a two-fold increase in binding potential (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2022</xref>). While this study does support prior work, this study recruited people with brain fog rather than those with depression, potentially suggesting that the inflammatory pathway is affected by the presence of brain fog. Other differences may include differences in the strain of the disease, the severity of COVID-19 infection, or the types and availability of treatment.</p><p id="p0185">The present work supports a growing number of structural and connective neuroimaging studies reporting findings consistent with neuroinflammation in people with N-PASC. For example, work using magnetic resonance imaging has reported lower post-recovery axonal density (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2022</xref>) and changes in the cerebral connectome consistent with neuroinflammation among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rau et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, previous studies have reported similar findings to pervade individuals from the general population who reported mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2023</xref>) and essential workers with N-PASC (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clouston et al., 2024</xref>). Our results support these findings but further suggest that the role of neuroinflammation may not always be maladaptive in N-PASC.</p><p id="p0190">We reported that gliosis was most consistently associated with COVID across the medial and orbital portions of the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is where COVID-19 is most likely to invade the cerebrum through the olfactory bulb (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Meinhardt et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, while the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex lies above the eyes and the olfactory bulb, making them potential points of neuroinvasion, this is not true of the hippocampus where we found the strongest regional results. Neuroinflammation in this study was widespread throughout the cortical and subcortical structures and in the cerebellum. Coupled with evidence of improved cognition in people with N-PASC these results might indicate the presence of a robust neuroimmune response in these regions is associated with improved outcomes.</p><p id="p0195">There is concern that inflammation could be damaging the cerebrum in N-PASC. We found that while [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA was increased in N-PASC, individuals whose [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA V<sub>T</sub> was higher seemed to have better verbal fluency than those with more normal [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA binding levels. This result might imply that the neuroinflammation seen in N-PASC is supporting an adaptive immunological response, which is an unanticipated result if the brain is experiencing a singular systemic shock but may be expected in the case that there is a viral reservoir as has been hypothesized to occur in N-PASC (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Proal et al., 2023</xref>). Yet, the same data suggested that global cognitive performance as measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was reduced in those individuals with higher hippocampal [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA distribution volume. These results support the view that reductions in cerebral gliosis might emerge when the cerebrum is damaged, a process that might specifically reduce global cognitive performance.</p><p id="p0200">SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve rapidly since it began infecting individuals and has continued to mutate in order to improve transmissibility (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Markov et al., 2023</xref>). Most of these participants are essential workers who developed PASC on their first infection prior to the widespread availability of vaccines. However, different variants have different symptoms and vary in terms of severity and the risk of PASC. For example, as one large study showed the risk of PASC was much lower following infection with omicron versus delta and pre-delta variants (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2024</xref>), while some results imply that omicron subvariants also differ in terms of severity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, this literature implies that the risk of PASC is lower now that more people have been vaccinated amd are exposed to omicron-based variants, these mutations have also allowed the virus to both re-infect individuals who have been previously infected and break through protections offered by vaccination. Thus, while the risk of N-PASC may be lower, now, than in the first years of the pandemic the risk of being re-infected increases yearly and that also increases the risk of follow-up N-PASC.</p><p id="p0205">Inconsistencies between results and expectations may result from multiple reasons. The first is the phase-specific nature of the neuroimmune system, which relies on several types of astrocytes and cerebral macrophages that all have pro- and anti-inflammatory phases (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Spiteri et al., 2022</xref>). While macrophages do not express translocator protein (TSPO) to the same extent as glial cells, TSPO ligands seem to attach to different cell types and during different cell phases. To our knowledge, [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA tends to bind to M2 glial cells (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zammit et al., 2020</xref>), while other ligands may indiscriminately target TSPO-expressing cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Our results could suggest that the glial activation shown may be partially due to the need for the cerebrum to either clear out lingering viral particles or repair damage initially caused by the COVID-19 infection. Concurrently, TSPO could also be expressed by other cell types in the neuroimmune environment, such as astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Guilarte et al., 2022</xref>). This possibility is consistent with the role of these type of cells in repairing damage caused by COVID-19 to the endothelial and neurovascular structures, as noted in the other studies (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">VanElzakker et al., 2024</xref>). The second reason for our findings could be fact that the TSPO protein, even if expressed by the microglia, seems to have different functions. In fact, meanwhile TSPO is clearly associated with pro-inflammation activated microglia cells in mice, recent studies suggest that while TSPO is an accurate indicator of microglial cell density that it may not be a clear indicator of pro-inflammatory activation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nutma et al., 2023</xref>). This strengthens the possible view that the microglial cells, whose presence we found to be increased, might protect verbal fluency in N-PASC. Future work should determine whether monocytic response mechanisms and endothelial cell functioning, which uphold macrophagic reactivity, are also active and adaptive in N-PASC.</p><p id="p0210">In this study, we did not report a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) because gliosis occurs throughout the brain and there is no natural reference region, making comparison with recent studies difficult (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">VanElzakker et al., 2024</xref>). For example, we found here that differences in V<sub>T</sub>, DSUV, and to a lesser extent in SUV<sub>75-120</sub> in the white matter and, more importantly, in the cerebellum that were also elevated in COVID-19 and would render most SUVR analyses ineffectual. However, in hopes of providing a visualization we calculated both the SUV<sub>75-120</sub> and dynamic SUV (DSUV) calculated using a process akin to the one used to calculate the gold-standard distribution volume (V<sub>T</sub>) values. In these data, DSUV were moderately correlated with V<sub>T</sub> values (&#x003c1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.42 in the gray matter and 0.60 in the cerebellum) and these studies provided mildly weaker results to those found using V<sub>T</sub>. For example, while SUV<sub>75-120</sub> values were unable to identify group differences between N-PASC and pre-pandemic controls, DSUV values were able to more reliably detect a difference. DSUV values benefit from being quantifiable without an arterial line and might therefore help to make future work using TSPO ligands easier since these ligands lack a natural reference region.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="p0215">We present results from a relatively small study of glial activation at midlife in essential workers who report lingering brain fog after COVID-19 infection. First, while the focus of this study on a sample of essential workers is an important strength of the study, because many individuals were infected by COVID-19 during work before vaccines became available. However, this group is predominantly made up of males at midlife with mild to moderate COVID-19 and is therefore not representative of the general population. While not a central part of this study, we did not find that the women in this study had differences in [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA binding in general or among those with N-PASC supporting the view that these results may be generalizable to others affected by mild to moderate COVID-19. Second, the use of an arterial line is a major limitation because it screens participants who cannot tolerate it and cannot be repeatedly placed thereby reducing the chances that a recruited participant will complete the study, so this study benefited from secondary validation using DSUV. Third, this study is limited because while all N-PASC participants reported symptoms, the clinic from which these participants were recruited was not a PASC clinic so the results from this study may be different from participants who do attend PASC clinics. Fourth, since this study was done in an outpatient setting and included healthy essential workers without acute disease, we did not collect of cerebrospinal fluid to help in assessing COVID-19 biomarkers in hopes of increasing study feasibility. Since [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA has been previously validated in a variety of neurological settings, this only limits our ability to additionally assess the COVID-19 specific inflammatory proteins that might be implicated in N-PASC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0220">The increased presence of glial activation in N-PASC when compared to pre-pandemic controls imply that a neuroimmune response is a substantial component of the N-PASC phenotype. Moreover, N-PASC could be a chronic form of autoimmune encephalitis (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Graus et al., 2016</xref>), though some evidence that verbal fluency was higher in those with more glial activation as well as the lack of recent cerebral hyperintensities generally reported in autoimmune encephalitis. If adaptive, attempts to reduce glial activation could worsen N-PASC prognosis. Concurrently, results from this study might also support some recent work suggesting that there may be a COVID-19 reservoir among individuals with N-PASC (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hanson et al., 2022</xref>). Antiviral medications could improve N-PASC prognosis, though little is known about the extent to which such medications cross the blood-brain barrier or might affect glial activation. Thus, while this study does not clarify intervention targets this study does support the view that symptoms of brain fog in N-PASC represent significant increases in glial activation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0225"><bold>Sean A.P.
