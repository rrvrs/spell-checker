Seed banking is impractical for coconut conservation due to its large, recalcitrant seed, and maintaining field gene bank collections is costly and vulnerable to environmental pressures. Cryopreservation offers a promising alternative method for conserving coconut genetic diversity, but the success in recovering cryopreserved materials remains limited, with few studies consistently reporting high rates of recovery. This highlights the need for improved cryopreservation protocols, particularly in tissue dehydration, which is one of the critical steps in the process of cryopreservation and plant recovery. A desiccator was developed that enabled rapid embryo dehydration with ultra-dry airflow. The desiccator reduced embryo moisture content to 20% (the predetermined viability threshold) within 6 h representing a 2-h improvement when compared to a previous dehydration approach, while maintaining a high germination rate (71%). Smaller embryos (500 to 550 mg fresh weight) desiccated faster than larger embryos (800 to 900 mg fresh weight) but germination was reduced (30%), making small embryos unsuitable for cryopreservation. A 5-day sucrose (0.4 M) pre-treatment further reduced the dehydration time to 4 h, while maintaining a high germination rate (70%). These advances in the use of a sucrose pre-treatment, the rapid embryo dehydration, and selection of large embryos size will help to enhance the success of coconut embryo cryopreservation and recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>coconut conservation</kwd><kwd>moisture removal</kwd><kwd>embryo desiccation</kwd><kwd>cryopreservation</kwd><kwd>sucrose</kwd><kwd>pre-treatment</kwd><kwd>high-recovery</kwd><kwd>embryo size</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)</funding-source><award-id>HORT/2017/025</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>The University of Queensland HDR scholarship</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), grant number HORT/2017/025, and The University of Queensland HDR scholarship.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-plants-14-00600"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The coconut palm (<italic toggle="yes">Cocos nucifera</italic> L.) is extensively cultivated across many tropical and subtropical regions of the world, sustaining the livelihoods of many millions of smallholder farmers [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At present, the crop is cultivated on 12 million ha of land in over 93 countries with an annual production of ca. 62 million t of dehusked fruit [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A significant portion of the existing coconut plantations, established over 70 years ago, are now exhibiting reduced productivity [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] due to palm senility, and the prevalence of severe diseases such as lethal yellowing [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and cadang-cadang [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], pest invasions such as those caused by rhinoceros beetle (<italic toggle="yes">Oryctes rhinoceros</italic> L.), the red palm weevil (<italic toggle="yes">Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</italic> Olivier), and the coconut black-headed caterpillar <italic toggle="yes">Opisina arenosella</italic> Walker; [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, these senile and affected palms are being systematically destroyed in some regions, and the land repurposed for alternative crops or other uses. However, this transition away from traditional coconut-production carries a profound consequence, and that is the loss of locally adapted germplasm. Such an event does not only exacerbate the challenges faced by coconut breeders but also highlights the urgent need for a functional approach to coconut conservation to sustain its genetic diversity. The widely used seed banking method for orthodox crops cannot be used for conserving coconut germplasm due to the desiccation-sensitivity or recalcitrant nature and very large size of the coconut seed [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, field gene banks have been used as the primary method for conserving coconut germplasm [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This approach has been widely employed within the agricultural community, but it faces significant challenges as it involves managing large areas of land and a high exposure to pests, diseases and environmental threats. An alternative approach for the ex-situ conservation of coconut germplasm is cryopreservation, which utilises in vitro methods that involve a process of tissue dehydration followed by ultra-cold storage of the dehydrated tissue. Cryopreservation of coconut germplasm has proven to be quite challenging. Several researchers have experimented with different types of explants such as for coconut germplasm preservation and were not successful to achieve high success rate. To date, most reliable and higher success rate for coconut germplasm cryopreservation has been achieved using mature coconut embryos as explants [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In many plant species, the success of cryopreservation depends on the moisture content of the tissues prior to cryopreservation [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the rate at which moisture is removed from these tissues [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although advanced cryopreservation methods like the vitrification techniques have been recently developed, the physical dehydration techniques still remain a valuable tool in the cryopreservation strategies of species that produce large numbers of zygotic embryos, but no vegetative organs. The historical effectiveness, simplicity, and accessibility of zygotic embryos justify their selection, particularly for recalcitrant species and in situations where the advanced methods are not feasible [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>A rapid, physical dehydration technique using a silica gel desiccator has been developed and used for drying coconut embryos prior to cryopreservation. This past approach could dehydrate embryos to the viability threshold level of 20% fresh weight (FW) in 8 h, with 40% recovery of normal plants to soil after cryopreservation [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The germinability of embryos after recovery from cryopreservation significantly decreased when the moisture content of the embryos was either below or above the 20% threshold level [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, to improve further the recovery of plants to soil it is important to reduce further the duration time necessary for rapid physical dehydration. To meet these requirements, a new desiccator was designed, built, and tested based on the earlier prototype developed by Sisunandar et al. [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Apart from a rapid dehydration step, a sucrose pre-treatment step applied to the tissues prior to cryopreservation has been shown to improve tissue recovery [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Such pre-treatments are thought to (a) enhance tissue survival through the cryopreservation process and (b) to speed up the time to undertake tissue dehydration. For instance, pre-treating tissues in sucrose solutions helped prevent ice formation within cells during the freezing process, thereby enhancing plant recovery following cryopreservation process for several species [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has also been suggested that a sucrose pre-treatment can expedite the dehydration process by facilitating water absorption from the tissues through osmotic action [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In our current study, we focused on optimizing the dehydration process for cryopreservation of coconut embryos. The objectives of this study were to (a) trial a newly designed desiccator for its ability to rapidly, physical dehydrate coconut embryos to their viability threshold, and how this dehydration treatment would affect the ability of the embryos to germinate, (b) to assess the impact of the rapid dehydration technique on the germination of either small or large embryos and (c) to examine the impact of various sucrose pre-treatments on the time of dehydration time and germination of embryos.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-00600"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-plants-14-00600"><title>2.1. Rapid, Physical Dehydration of Coconut Embryos (Experiment 1)</title><p>In this Experiment two varieties (MYD and WAT) were used to determine the dehydration curve required to reduce the embryo moisture content to the 20% threshold level. As the rate of drying did not significantly differ between the two varieties utilised in this study, the data from both varieties were pooled for further analysis. The rate of rapid, physical dehydration comprised of two distinct phases (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A,B). In the initial 5-h phase of dehydration, there was a substantial decline in embryo moisture content from 81% FW (or 4.42 g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> DW) to 23% FW (or 0.30 g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> DW). Subsequently, from 6 to 10 h, a further gradual reduction in embryo moisture content occurred, reaching ca. 14% FW (or 0.16 g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> DW). The critical moisture threshold of 20% (or 0.25 g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> DW) was achieved after 6 h of drying (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), and therefore 6 h of dehydration was determined to be the appropriate physical dehydration time for these two varieties.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-14-00600"><title>2.2. Embryo Viability After Physical Dehydration (Experiment 2)</title><p>In this Experiment one variety (CAIRNS) was used to determine embryo viability decline during the rapid, physical dehydration process required to reduce the embryo moisture content to the 20% threshold level. The rate of dehydration of CAIRNS embryos was similar to that of WAT and MYD but not identical, reaching the critical moisture threshold of 20% after 5 h. The viability of these embryos was 70%, showing no significant difference compared to non-dehydrated embryos (85%; <xref rid="plants-14-00600-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, the percentage of viable embryos declined to 60% after further dehydration for 6 h (moisture content of 18% FW), followed by a sharp decrease to 30% after 7 h of rapid dehydration (moisture content of 12% FW; <xref rid="plants-14-00600-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Considering the embryo moisture content and the viability result, 5 h of rapid, physical dehydration was the appropriate physical dehydration time for CAIRNS embryos.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-14-00600"><title>2.3. Embryo Size on Germinability After Physical Dehydration (Experiment 3)</title><p>In this Experiment one variety (CAIRNS) was used to determine embryo moisture loss and viability decline during the rapid, physical dehydration process of two classes of embryos, large and small. The moisture loss dynamics from small embryos mirrored that seen in large embryos in Experiment 2, occurring in two phases, albeit at a faster pace for the former (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Within 4 h of rapid physical dehydration, the moisture content in small embryos had decreased from 78 to close to 20% moisture content, a rate quicker than that observed from large embryos, which achieved the same value after 5 h of dehydration. Despite the reduction in moisture content to 20% FW, the viability of small embryos declined to 58% large embryos remained high (71%) post rapid, physical dehydration (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). However, extending the dehydration treatment by an additional hour (to 18% FW) resulted in a drop in viability to 38% for small embryos and 48% for large embryos. In conclusion, although small embryos dried more rapidly than large embryos, their viability became unacceptably low (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-plants-14-00600"><title>2.4. Sucrose Pre-Treatments on Tissue Dehydration (Experiment 4)</title><p>This experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of four sucrose pre-treatment concentrations, applied at one of three different times, on the moisture content decline during rapid physical dehydration of large (&#x0003e;700 mg FW) MYD embryos over 7 days. The sucrose pre-treatments exhibited a notable impact on embryo moisture content during rapid, physical dehydration (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In the absence of sucrose (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A), the 20% FW moisture content value was achieved following 6 h of drying. However, when embryos were pre-cultured in either 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 M sucrose solutions, the same moisture content was reached after only 4 h (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;D). The time of application (either 3, 5 or 7 days) of sucrose had little effect on embryo moisture decline (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;D). Embryos pre-treated with sucrose and subjected to dehydration for 3 to 4 h, achieving a moisture content of approximately 20%, exhibited high viability, with germination rates ranging between 60% and 70% (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), with no significant differences as compared to embryos dehydrated without a sucrose pre-treatment after 6 h. Hence, a sucrose pre-treatment at any concentration between 0.2 to 0.5 M and applied at any time between 3 to 7 days could speed up embryo dehydration time to just 4 h.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-plants-14-00600"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>The objectives of this study were to (a) trial a newly designed desiccator for its ability to rapidly, physical dehydrate coconut embryos to their viability threshold (Experiment 1), and how this dehydration treatment would affect the ability of the embryos to germinate (Experiment 2), (b) to assess the impact of the rapid dehydration technique on the germination of either small or large embryos (Experiment 3) and (c) to examine the impact of various sucrose pre-treatments on the time of dehydration time and germination of embryos (Experiment 4).</p><p>The newly designed desiccator retained several advantages of the previous model [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] while incorporating key innovative features that enhance its performance and suitability for gene bank use (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="plants-14-00600-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Firstly, the new desiccator can more rapidly dehydrate embryos to their viability threshold. Secondly dehydrate ca. 150 embryos in a single run, as compared to the previous model&#x02019;s capacity of only 20 embryos. Thirdly, the desiccator maintains an airtight environment, reducing the chances of contamination occurring. Fourthly, the central chamber features a high-power fan, significantly boosting dehydration efficiency with an airflow of 1.24 m&#x000b3; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, far surpassing the previous model&#x02019;s capabilities. Finally, the apparatus is constructed from readily available components, all of which (excluding the external electronics) are autoclavable, detachable, and portable. Despite its compact size, the desiccator is capable of dehydrating large numbers of embryos, from several coconut varieties simultaneously, and can be operated efficiently in a confined space, such as a laminar airflow hood.</p><p>The newly designed desiccator was able to reduce the embryo moisture content of an equal mix of MYD and WAT embryos to 20% in just 6 h of dehydration (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), 2 h faster than the previous apparatus [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Prior research has highlighted the superiority of rapid, physical dehydration over slow dehydration methods for maintaining viability in recalcitrant seed tissues [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This superiority stems from the ability of rapid moisture removal from seed tissues, to achieve a lower moisture content, before tissue viability is compromised. Equally, prolonged moisture loss can also negatively impact cell metabolism by disrupting essential metabolic pathways, leading to the breakdown of cellular structures and impaired enzyme activity [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>For reducing the physical dehydration time, CAIRNS variety embryos achieved a moisture content of 20% in ca. 5 h, 1 h faster than the attainment observed for the two Philippine varieties (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This disparity could be because of the varieties studied in the two experiments or from disparities in post-harvest and transportation treatments employed to transport the embryos to the laboratory [10 days air freight of isolated embryos (Experiment 1) versus swift 3 days road freight of intact nuts (Experiment 2)]. Previous research on coconut dehydration protocols has highlighted varietal differences, with viability tissue recovery rates ranging from 56 to 93% across four varieties [<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, a diverse spectrum of recovery rates (ranging from 20 to 70%) following dehydration have been documented for an alternate cryopreservation protocol applied to seven coconut varieties [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Finally, a novel cryopreservation protocol for coconut embryos, based on rapid physical dehydration [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], was tested across 20 varieties and demonstrated a degree of specificity, with varying effectiveness depending on the variety.</p><p>Another crucial aspect explored in this study pertained to the impact of embryo size on post rapid, physical dehydration and survival. Findings revealed that large embryos from the CAIRNS variety (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) exhibited a higher natural viability rate (&#x0003e;90%), than observed with smaller embryos (80%). The smaller embryos studied achieved a 20% moisture content in just 4 h, as compared to 5 h for larger embryos (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Despite the expedited moisture loss achieved by smaller embryos, their viability rate post rapid, physical dehydration was notably lower (50%) as compared to the higher rate observed for large embryos (70%). Consequently, although smaller embryos achieved the target moisture content faster, their lower viability suggests a reduced likelihood of favourable recovery rates post cryopreservation. Hence, the preference lies in selecting larger embryos from a variety when establishing a cryopreservation conservation collection for coconut.</p><p>The correlation between a sucrose pre-treatment and moisture content after physical dehydration was examined utilising the NYD variety (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In the absence of a sucrose pre-treatment necessitated 6 h of rapid physical dehydration to achieve a 20% moisture content (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), like the Philippine varieties but 1 h longer than the CAIRNS variety (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Notably, sucrose concentrations, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 M exhibited a pronounced ability to help reduce moisture content during the rapid, physical dehydration step. After 4 h of dehydration, embryos pre-cultured in sucrose had a high viability ranging from 60 to 70% (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This indicates that sucrose can accelerate the rate of dehydration without affecting viability. Application of a sucrose pre-treatments prior to rapid, physical dehydration has been shown to improve the dehydration process in several palm species previously [<xref rid="B27-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] while retaining tissue viability.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-14-00600"><title>4. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4dot1-plants-14-00600"><title>4.1. Rapid Dehydration Apparatus</title><p>A rapid, physical dehydration desiccator, adapted from one previously developed [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], was used to dry embryos under sterile conditions. The newly developed desiccator presents several advancements over the previous model, including its lightweight construction, enhanced airflow system, dual moisture absorption chambers, and the ability to process up to 150 embryos per cycle, making it a more efficient and versatile tool for laboratory use (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The desiccator body was constructed from aluminium, selected for its lightweight and ability to withstand the high temperatures experienced in the autoclave and the drying oven. An airtight lid was positioned on top of the desiccator, and there was an aluminium platform with small ventilation holes (ca. 1 mm in diameter) at the top layer for placing the samples. These holes facilitated rapid, ultra-dry air movement over the embryos. A cylindrical chamber with aluminium walls was integrated below the platform to serve as the primary conduit for generating airflow. Within this chamber a 24 V direct current axial fan (1.92 W, Omron Corporation, Kyoto, Japan; <xref rid="plants-14-00600-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D) was installed, providing an airflow rate of 1.24 m<sup>3</sup> minute<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. To enhance embryo dehydration, silica gel beads (ca. 1 to 3 mm in diameter; Sigma-Aldrich Pty. Ltd., Sydney, NSW, Australia) were placed into a central compartment (5 &#x000d7; 19 cm; height/diameter) above the fan. Another silica gel compartment, located below the fan, served as an additional moisture absorber. The base of the apparatus consisted of another chamber with 3 mm diameter holes in its upper surface to allow for air circulation (<xref rid="plants-14-00600-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). To maintain a sterile environment and prevent contamination, a sturdy aluminium case (5 mm thick, with dimensions of 35 &#x000d7; 20 cm; height/diameter) enclosed the entire system in an airtight manner. The desiccator was autoclaved at 121 &#x000b0;C for 20 min and then dried overnight in an oven set at 90 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-plants-14-00600"><title>4.2.

For Experiment 1, the zygotic embryos from MYD and WAT were prepared by the Department of Agriculture-Philippine Coconut Authority and imported into Australia under import permit number 0004386518 and placed into a quarantine certified (QC2) laboratory at the University of Queensland (UQ). For Experiment 2 and 3, CAIRNS fruit were freshly harvested, dehusked at the source, and the nuts were transported to UQ by road freight (3 days in transport).

Conclusions</title><p>This study outlines the functionality of a newly developed desiccator, capable of rapidly, physically dehydrating coconut embryos while retaining their viability. This is an initial and important step in the conservation of germplasm by cryopreservation. Comparative analysis with a previously constructed apparatus demonstrated superior performance in terms of drying efficiency, with the new apparatus achieving a 2-h faster attainment of 20% FW, or a 25% faster rate as compared to the previous method [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further enhancement to drying speed were realized, reducing the time to reach 20% FW to 4 h through the utilization of a sucrose pre-treatment. However, the impact of this treatment on post-cryopreservation germination requires further investigation. Additionally, small embryos exhibit lower tolerance to rapid, physical dehydration as compared to their larger counterparts, underscoring the significance of selecting robust, large embryos for the establishment of a viable cryopreservation repository for coconut germplasm. In conclusion, the devised rapid dehydration apparatus in conjunction with sucrose pre-treatment represents a promising avenue for enhancing the dehydration of coconut embryos, a critical facet in refining the cryopreservation protocol.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge ACIAR, and UQ scholarship for their support of this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

A thick (5 mm) aluminium casing (35 &#x000d7; 20 cm; height/diameter) enclosed the system, to prevent contamination and to keep the unit airtight (<bold>G</bold>).
