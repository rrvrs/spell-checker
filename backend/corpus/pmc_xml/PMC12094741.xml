</self-uri><abstract><p>Evidence linking diet and ocular diseases is growing, yet variations persist, with a paucity of data in sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed review will systematically synthesize evidence on dietary factors associated with predominant eye disorders (cataracts, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and dry eye disease) in the sub-Saharan African population. The systematic review protocol will follow PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) for transparency in reporting. All relevant published studies in the English Language will be identified from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Health Inter-Network Access to Research Initiative (HINARI), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), African Journal of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) using medical subject headings (MeSH) and controlled vocabulary without date restrictions. The reference lists of all retrieved studies will be checked and experts will be contacted for additional relevant studies. The risk of bias for observational studies will be assessed using ROBINS-E (Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Exposure) and for non-interventional and randomized studies ROBINS-V2 (Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies version 2) and ROB2 (Cochrane Risk of Bias 2) will be employed respectively. Study quality will be assessed using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institutes Quality Assessment (NHLBI) tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies and Controlled Interventional Studies. Meta-analysis will not be considered because of the wide range of dietary factors and the susceptibility to high heterogeneity. Patterns of association between dietary factors and the specific eye diseases will be consolidated by Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM).</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>This is a study protocol and no data has been generated thereof.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>This is a study protocol and no data has been generated thereof.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The burden of eye diseases and complications of blindness has increased exponentially and remains a public health threat globally [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] although it differs across geographical regions [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and dry eye disease remain high and are responsible for millions of cases of moderate to severe visual impairment and blindness [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most cases occur in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) and territories [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, four million people live with blindness, and about 18 million have moderate-to-severe vision impairment [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The trends of ocular diseases within the region reflect a growing public health concern that necessitates urgent action.</p><p>In particular, cataract, characterized by cloudiness or opacity of the lens; uncorrected refractive errors, defined as the imbalance between axial length and refractive power of the eye; glaucoma, explained by progressive optic neuropathy with associated visual field changes; diabetic retinopathy, delineates the microvascular end-organ complication of diabetes mellitus; age-related macular degeneration expounds the deterioration of the macula and/or fovea; dry eye diseases described as the instability in tear film production, represents a major public health, economic, and societal challenges within this population [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, in children, vision impairment from uncorrected refractive error has a negative impact on their academic prowess, self-image, and social relations [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, vision loss affects the career aspirations, employment prospects, and socioeconomic status of young adults and/or middle-aged individuals [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Likewise, in the older or aged population, derangement in vision culminates in physical dependency and psychological distress [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Most probably, a deficit in visual function reversibly affects the overall quality of life across the entire age spectrum [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Of note, diet is a modifiable factor involved in eye disease [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Specifically, nutritional factors, including food intake, dietary patterns, macronutrients, and micronutrients, are essential for optimal visual development [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The dietary nutrients possess biologically potentiating properties such as antioxidants [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], anti-angiogenic [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], anticarcinogenic [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], neuroprotection [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and light filtering properties [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which are thought to confer protection against debilitating eye diseases. In particular, they mechanistically terminate the free radical reactions that result in oxidative stress, and ameliorate lipid peroxidation, which is hypothesized to mediate the pathobiology of several ocular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given the underlying central dogma, we postulate that dietary factors could serve as an impetus to reduce the burden of eye diseases in sub-Saharan Africa as evidence of protective levels becomes available.</p><p>The evidence linking diet and ocular disease is controversial with no clear consensus. For example, there is still controversy about the adequacy [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which limits its direct applicability in ocular health and vision medicine [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similarly, the pattern of evidence from various systematic reviews and longitudinal studies are mixed [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, while some authors report an association between higher intake and reduced risk of specific eye diseases [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], others report opposite [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], with most reviews showing no significant association [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and a fewer more systematic reviews unable to draw a robust conclusion [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Despite the comprehensive nature of the above reviews, which provide invaluable insights, their focus of attention was not on the sub-Saharan population, which conceals its directedness.</p><p>Dietary diversity recognized as proxies for micronutrient sufficiency, quality, and adequacy of diets [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] are linked to socioeconomic status [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The differences in the standard of living in sub-Saharan Africa compared to the northern and southern African regions and the Westernized world differ in health status variables and nutritional indicators [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Corroborated by a multicenter cross-sectional study, Galbete and colleagues revealed dietary differences between sub-Saharan migrants and their local compatriots. While the latter group showed diverse eating patterns, the former category mainly consumed starchy staples and diets dominated by animal or animal-based products [<xref rid="pone.0320030.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Acculturation, urbanization, and globalization are constantly aggravating the dietary habits of the inhabitants of the sub-Saharan Africa region, which means that an increase in the burden of the aforementioned ocular pathologies can be expected if concrete intervention strategies are not implemented. A systematic review is warranted to elucidate the dietary factors associated with prevalent eye diseases and, importantly, to propose sustainable nutritional intervention strategies for eye care in the sub-Saharan African region.

A hierarchical three-dimensional approach will be employed in the screening process. Firstly, articles will be assessed based on titles and abstracts. Secondly, the full-text version will be critically evaluated for methodological quality and presence of effect sizes. Concurrently, following prespecified eligibility criteria, authors will include all feasible studies. Of note to eliminate bias and enhance transparency, all included papers will be separately and independently assessed by two authors. Where there is indecisiveness and/or where the lead researcher includes an article but one or more of the co-authors excludes, a consensus will be reached on that study by voting. Specifically, to agree on a decision a vote will be cast for inclusion or exclusion and in a 2:1 ratio in favor of a &#x02018;yes&#x02019; or a &#x02018;no&#x02019;. Conversely, if there is an equal proportion of votes on a decision, researchers will seek the opinion of an independent systematic reviewer before that study is either included or excluded. All methodological approaches and decisions that are taken prior to the selection of our analytical sample will be documented in a PRISMA flow diagram.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Data extraction and management</title><p>The review will be conducted using Review Manager version 5.4. Data extraction will be performed on full-text articles by two independent authors using a pre-design data collection form. The data to be extracted will be categorized into study characteristics such as author name, year of publication, title, country, the primary focus of the review question, i.e., dietary factors and ocular diseases, review questions in terms of sample size, population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, and study design and/or primary findings on zero-order association between dietary factors and the specific eye diseases. Specifically, the most adjusted risk estimates, hazard ratios, risk ratios, or odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and standard deviations for continuous variables with their 95% confidence intervals will be extracted.

Given the goal of the study to identify the role of dietary factors on the various eye diseases and the expected dietary differences between children and adults, we plan to synthesize data in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, we plan to systematically synthesize how each exposure affects the outcome, i.e., how each dietary factor affects each eye disease.

Yet, there remains a paucity of data in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the planned review is to systematically synthesize evidence on dietary factors associated with ocular diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings from the review will provide regional-specific evidence and recommendations to inform ophthalmic clinicians and general physicians on the various dietary factors with beneficial and deleterious effects on the eyes which will invaluably help them advise their clients. Further, the results will guide policymakers to develop interventions to reduce the burden of eye disease in this part of the world. This review has several strengths and some limitations worth highlighting. For instance, this will be the first review to systematically synthesize evidence on the dietary factors that influence predominant eye diseases within the sub-Saharan African population. Second, the study will employ a more robust strategy that follows the PRISMA and SWiM guidelines where appropriate. Contrary, despite using multiple databases there remains a possibility of missing out on studies not indexed in these databases. However, this indexing bias is underscored by the review following a prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria together with no date restrictions that extend the possibility of including all relevant studies to aid draw a robust conclusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0320030.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) 2015 checklist: Recommended items to address in a systematic review protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0320030.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This systematic review protocol has been prepared as part of capacity building initiative by the Centre for Evidence Synthesis and Policy (CESP), University of Ghana, and Africa Communities of Evidence Synthesis and Translation (ACEST) that train experts in evidence synthesis and translation across low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly Africa.

</p><p>2. When completing the data availability statement of the submission form, you indicated that you will make your data available on acceptance. We strongly recommend all authors decide on a data sharing plan before acceptance, as the process can be lengthy and hold up publication timelines. Please note that, though access restrictions are acceptable now, your entire data will need to be made freely accessible if your manuscript is accepted for publication. This policy applies to all data except where public deposition would breach compliance with the protocol approved by your research ethics board. If you are unable to adhere to our open data policy, please kindly revise your statement to explain your reasoning and we will seek the editor's input on an exemption. Please be assured that, once you have provided your new statement, the assessment of your exemption will not hold up the peer review process.</p><p>Additional Editor Comments:</p><p>1) As this is a protocol, please ensure all verb tenses are in the future tense.</p><p>2) Please note that PRISMA-P and other reporting guidelines are designed to improve transparency in reporting and are not 'gold standards' or guidelines for designing a study. Please revise your text accordingly. You may consult this reference for further information: 10.1186/s13643-021-01671-z.</p><p>3) There are two versions of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials. Please clearly indicate which version you will use for your analysis.</p><p>4) You have selected quite broad search platforms. I recommend omitting Google Scholar and BioMed Central from your search strategy. Google Scholar may not be an ideal platform for systematic reviews due to its broad scope and limited search functionality. Studies in BioMed Central should already be accessible through PubMed or Scopus.</p><p>5) Please consider using MeSH terms in your PubMed search.</p><p>6) I concur with the reviewers that the protocol appears rather ambitious, which could pose significant challenges during the execution of your work and potentially impede the production of a final output. In addition to the points raised by the reviewers, please consider that including both experimental and observational studies in your meta-analysis may result in substantial heterogeneity. Consequently, the findings may lack meaningful interpretation. I recommend focusing on a single study design if you intend to conduct a meta-analysis, or selecting previously mentioned study designs if you wish to proceed with a narrative synthesis of the results. For the latter, you may consider incorporating the SWiM reporting guideline in your protocol (10.1136/bmj.l6890), and the meta-analysis portion of the protocol would need to be omitted.</p><p>7) Given that you have already stated your intention to use a random effects model for meta-analysis, please articulate in the text why you would assess heterogeneity both between and within studies.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

While the aim of this protocol is important, additional clarifications are needed before this protocol is ready for publication. I've recommended this manuscript for major revisions because I appreciate the time that will be required to consider and undertake the recommended revisions. I've organized my comments below into major and minor edits:</p><p>MAJOR:</p><p>1. Overall: This review is very broad, and the design risks combining effect sizes of different sizes and directions that are ultimately examining different underlying relationships, resulting in a series of statistically null pooled effect estimates but without clearly answering the research question. Additional clarification of the hypothesis would be helpful (see details below). If the aim is to identify any single factor or a small group of individual factors (e.g., antioxidants, as suggested in the Discussion) to improve ocular health, then such a broad approach is unnecessary; it would be better to instead focus on a few individual factors informed by the primary literature (and perhaps by pre-clinical studies). If instead the aim is to identify whether a diet characterized by healthier foods can reduce the risk of ocular disease, then it may be more useful to focus on dietary patterns or at least on a few food groups (e.g., fruits and vegetables, which are good sources of antioxidants).</p><p>2. Additional clarification is required to explain why another review on this topic is needed given the substantial number of other systematic reviews that show no statistically significant relationship or unclear conclusions and what we will learn from a new review that is specific to the region of sub-Saharan Africa. You clearly describe the higher prevalence of ocular diseases in this region and also the relatively lower diversity/quality of diets in this region. Please describe for readers how those 2 factors will result in a different/stronger conclusion in your proposed review. For example, is your hypothesis that these factors will give this review an improved signal-to-noise ratio, and thus greater ability to identify an effect?</p><p>3. As part of the clarification requested above, please shorten the Background to focus on the set-up to the review objective. At present, the included content is interesting, but some of it detracts from the main message.</p><p>4. Population: This section suggests that only participants with ocular diseases will be included, but the Outcomes section indicates that incidence rates will be considered. Please clarify either that the population are those at risk of ocular disease or the general population, or remove incidence from the outcomes.</p><p>5. Please describe how a medical librarian has/will contribute to the development of the search and/or peer review the search terms.</p><p>6. Data Analysis: Please describe how you will address evidence that cannot be meta-analyzed and which moderating variables you will examine. For the meta-regression, how do you propose grouping ages? Are there any other variable you will examine via subgroup analyses? Will all dietary factors be modeled together? It's not clear that all included factors listed are capturing the same biological pathway(s).</p><p>7. Measures of effect: Please describe how you will analyze the outcomes. Will you examine each of the above-mentioned diseases separately? How will you address the secondary outcomes? If so, that's a lot of models. If they are not truly independent, then p&#x0003c;0.05 may not be an appropriate cut-off for statistical significance.</p><p>MINOR:</p><p>1. Bridget Senya Boateng, Moses Awuni, and Dr Mary Adjepong listed in PROSPERO registration, but not here. If they have not met the criteria for authorship, please clarify their roles, using the Acknowledgement section if needed.</p><p>2. Background, Page 4, last paragraph: Please remove reference #47 from &#x0201c;with most reviews showing no significant association[46-49]&#x0201d; because it is not a review.</p><p>3. Intervention, Page 7, first paragraph, last sentence &#x0201c;to decrease either the prevalence, incidence, severity, and progression of the predominant eye diseases (cataract, uncorrected refractive errors, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and dry eye disease).&#x0201d; Please remove this phrase, as it describes the outcome rather than the intervention.</p><p>4. Comparators section: &#x0201c;to mitigate the abovementioned eye diseases.&#x0201d; Please remove this phrase, as it describes the outcome rather than the comparator.</p><p>5. Study design: please add non-randomized trials and retrospective cohorts to either the list of inclusion or exclusion criteria, as appropriate.</p><p>6. Study design: Please remove the sentence &#x0201c;Data from national health examination surveys without clearly defined denominator, systematic reviews, opinions, commentaries will be excluded.&#x0201d; This is addressed below until &#x0201c;Exclusion criteria&#x0201d;</p><p>7. Please move the Header &#x0201c;Inclusion criteria&#x0201d; above &#x0201c;Population&#x0201d; to clarify that studies that include the above PICOS will be included. And please remove the first sentence currently under &#x0201c;Inclusion criteria&#x0201d;, as it is repeated above.</p><p>8. Exclusion criteria: What does &#x0201c;disproportionate or heterogeneous distributions&#x0201d; mean? Distributions of what?</p><p>9. Search terms: Will this search identify dietary patterns? This is not mentioned in the manuscript, but seems like a relevant dietary factor.</p><p>10. Screening and Selection of Studies: As written, it seems like all authors will independently screen each title, abstract, and full-text. Is that correct? 2 (or 3 if there is disagreement) seems appropriate.</p><p>11. ROBINS-I is appropriate for non-randomized interventions (see minor comment 5 if those will be included). For observational studies (cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies), please use ROBINS-E: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.riskofbias.info/welcome/robins-e-tool" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.riskofbias.info/welcome/robins-e-tool</ext-link></p><p>12. Data Analysis: Please keep all descriptions of heterogeneity assessment together, either here in or below in a separate subsection.</p><p>13. Dealing with Missing Data: What does "incomplete" mean? If a study has an attrition rate &#x0003e;0%, will it be excluded?</p><p>14. Measures of Effect: Will you include Hazard Ratios, and how will you combine (or keep separate) the various ratios that will be reported?</p><p>15. Meta-Regression: This does not need to be repeated if included in the Data Analysis section.</p><p>16. Discussion: &#x0201c;Diet and dietary metabolites constitute the building&#x02026;one-carbon metabolic cycle.&#x0201d; Please either directly link this to ocular function/disease risk or delete. As written, it is too general to be relevant.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Overall, I consider the topic to be relevant and of interest to the study population.</p><p>The most important issues I would like to highlight are firstly the overly broad research question. The list of nutrients (macro and micro) to be considered is too long, as well as the diseases to be researched. There are nutrients with known associations with visual health and related pathologies such as diabetes, hypertension, among others. The reason why these nutrients are chosen, or why they are all chosen, is not properly reflected in the background section. The fact that such a long list of nutrients has been chosen makes me doubt the feasibility of obtaining reliable, conclusive and concrete results.</p><p>On the other hand, in the case of finding studies in which, instead of measuring nutrients, they have given consumption as whole foods or dietary patterns, the source from which the nutritional composition data for certain foods would be obtained has not been specified.</p><p>The measures of outcomes, especially of severity or progression of the diseases described, are not specified.</p><p>The inclusion of the adverse effects study does not seem to be relevant to the research question.</p><p>In the exclusion criteria it is stated that articles in languages other than English will be excluded, yet in the search section and in the discussion it is stated that there will be no language restrictions. This is contradictory and needs to be corrected prior to publication.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for study designs are not sufficiently justified.</p><p>In the discussion there are no citations where appropriate.</p><p>The first reference in the reference list is incorrectly formatted, the author should be &#x02018;Bourne R, et al.&#x02019;.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

</p><p>PONE-D-25-00880R1</p><p>Dietary Factors and Predominant Eye Diseases in Sub-Saharan African Populations: A Comprehensive Systematic Review Protocol</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Osei Duah Junior,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to resubmit the above-referenced manuscript. We have addressed all the reviewers&#x02019; comments, point-by-point, in our response below. The issues raised by the Reviewers are presented in normal font. We reply directly to these comments in bold font. All changes to the revised Manuscript have also been highlighted in red font.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Dr. Duah</p><p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article&#x02019;s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p><p>Thank you. We have addressed this query.</p><p>Additional Editor Comments:</p><p>1) Please note that PRISMA-P and other reporting guidelines are designed to improve transparency in reporting and are not guidelines for designing a study or preparing a work. Please revise both the abstract and main text accordingly. You may consult this reference for further information: 10.1186/s13643-021-01671-z.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised our statement as appropriate. Please see below and in the revised manuscript. Materials and methods. Page 6, Lines 118-123.</p><p>&#x0201c;The current review protocol indexed in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (ID: CRD42023402042) has been prepared following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for protocols (PRISMA-P) checklist (S1:Table 1) [56, 57] and the final review report will follow PRISMA for transparency of reporting [58, 59] and the patterns of evidence for associations between dietary factors and eye diseases will be summarized according to Systematic Review Without Meta-Analysis (SWiM) [60].&#x0201d;</p><p>2) Please present your revised search strategy as a supplementary file instead of the main text to enhance the flow and readability of your work.</p><p>Thank you. We have removed this section from the main text and showed in the supplementary file as suggested.</p><p>3) Please justify the use of both risk of bias assessment and quality assessment. The former may suffice for a systematic review.</p><p>Thank you for this opportunity. While risk of bias and quality assessment are often used interchangeably, there is a slight difference that we believe when both are combined as proposed in this review could improve the robustness of our evidence. For example, risk of bias aims to identify sources of systematic error, whereas quality assessment aims to determine the validity and reliability of the study thus the methodological soundness and rigour. Taken together, the quality assessment provides a holistic evaluation of the studies other than a single determination of systematic error.</p><p>4) Please ensure the future tense is used throughout the text. The patient and public involvement section still contains past tense. This does not apply to the reporting or dissemination plans of your work as these will be done in the future.</p><p>Thank you, we have extensively proofread the manuscript to reflect the tenses.</p><p>5) Please ensure that your references are reported in accordance with the PLOS One style. Your may consult the followings for further information: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines;" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines;</ext-link>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html." ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</ext-link>.</p><p>We have ensured that our referencing style is conforming to the PLOS referencing guidelines.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for addressing most of my comments from the first review. This protocol is close to being ready for publication, but a few more edits will ensure it meets reporting standards. Please see my recommendations below:</p><p>MAJOR:</p><p>1. The review is still very broad, which will make the evidence synthesis challenging and highlights the need for a clear synthesis plan. Because you intend to follow SWiM guidelines, please detail your synthesis plan in the Data Synthesis section, specifically including how studies will be grouped together for synthesis. Will any of the primary outcomes be combined or will you address them each separately? What about the exposures? Will you combine evidence for children and adults in a single summary statement? Will any other key variables be considered in the synthesis?</p><p>Thank you for the rigorous critical appraisal and though provoking questions which has helped us improved our work. We have addressed this query as seen below and in the Revised manuscript. Materials and Methods. Data Synthesis. Page 8, Lines 221-225</p><p>&#x0201c;Given the goal of the study to identify the role of dietary factors on the various eye diseases and the expected dietary differences between children and adults, we plan to synthesize data in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, we plan to systematically synthesize how each exposure affects the outcome, i.e., how each dietary factor affects each eye disease. In addition, we plan to isolate and uniquely highlight, where appropriate, dietary factors that affect children visual health.&#x0201d;</p><p>2. The protocol does not yet describe how a medical librarian has developed, or peer reviewed, the search. Please add that to ensure that the search will be thorough and replicable.</p><p>Thank you. We have provided a statement of such in the main text as requested. Materials and Methods. Data Sources, Search Terms, and Search Strategies for Identifying Studies. Page 8, Lines 172-173.</p><p>&#x0201c;The search terms and strategy will be developed in consultation with a librarian to ensure robustness and replicability.&#x0201d;</p><p>MINOR:</p><p>1. Thank you for adding clarifications about the objective and rationale in the Introduction. It would also be helpful to shorten to Introduction to focus on the objectives and rationale.</p><p>We have abridged the introduction to focus on the goals and rationale as suggested. However, we have retained some key details to provide context for the review.</p><p>2. Line 116-117: both &#x0201c;micronutrients&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dietary vitamins or minerals&#x0201d; are listed here. Please select 1.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Please we have deleted the &#x0201c;dietary vitamins or minerals&#x0201d; from the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript contains some grammatical errors that affect clarity. A thorough revision of the English language, preferably with the assistance of a native speaker or professional proofreader, is recommended.</p><p>Thank you for your concern. We have done extensive proofreading of the manuscript and have enlisted the help of two other experts who have helped us improve the overall clarity and readability of the manuscript.</p><p>Abstract (Main text line 27, and abstract on submission form) change "propose" to "proposed"</p><p>We have incorporated the change.

Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p><p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p><p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>4.
