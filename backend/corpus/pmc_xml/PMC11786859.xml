Made from natural biopolymers such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, these coatings form a thin, edible layer on food surfaces. This barrier reduces moisture loss, protects against oxidative damage, and limits microbial growth, thereby extending shelf life while preserving food quality. Enhanced with natural additives like essential oils and antioxidants, these coatings offer antimicrobial benefits and contribute to health. Applications span from fresh produce, where they control respiration and moisture, to meat, dairy, and bakery products, maintaining sensory and nutritional properties. Innovations in coating technologies&#x02014;such as composite materials, nano-emulsions, and bio-nanocomposites&#x02014;are improving their mechanical strength, barrier properties, and compatibility with other preservation methods like modified atmosphere packaging. Although challenges remain in cost, consumer acceptance, and regulation, edible coatings represent a significant stride towards sustainable food systems and reduced dependence on synthetic packaging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Edible coatings extend freshness, reduce waste, and promote food sustainability.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Plant-based coatings meet eco-friendly packaging needs in global markets.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Nano-emulsions enhance coatings, offering quality with minimal additives.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Antioxidant coatings preserve flavor and health, revolutionizing preservation.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Biopolymer-based coatings combat pollution, advancing green food solutions.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Edible coatings</kwd><kwd>Antioxidant</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobial</kwd><kwd>Biopolymer</kwd><kwd>Nano-emulsions</kwd><kwd>Food preservation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">In recent years, consumer demand has shifted dramatically towards healthier and more sustainable food choices, with a clear rejection of products containing synthetic additives in favor of fresh and natural alternatives. This trend is compounded by rising environmental concerns, with a strong emphasis on minimizing plastic use and reducing food waste. At the same time, the food industry faces significant challenges in maintaining the quality and volume of perishable products from harvest to consumption. These challenges primarily stem from microbial spoilage, oxidative degradation, and sensory deterioration, which compromise food safety, pose health risks, and diminish consumer appeal (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aayush et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Abdel Aziz &#x00026; Salama, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Abu-Shama et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">In response to these pressures, edible coatings have emerged as a promising solution, offering an alternative to conventional plastic packaging and chemical preservatives. Edible coatings consist of thin, consumable layers applied directly to the surface of food items, preserving quality and extending shelf life (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Abu-Shama et al., 2020</xref>). They are especially beneficial for perishable foods like fruits and vegetables, effectively reducing microbial contamination, oxidative damage, and moisture loss. Critical parameters for formulating edible coatings include barrier properties (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability), transparency, and sensory neutrality ensuring the coatings are tasteless, odorless, and do not alter the food's appearance (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Abedi et al., 2021</xref>). Despite occasional limitations, such as suboptimal mechanical properties or insufficient antimicrobial efficacy, advancements in edible coatings continue. These coatings can incorporate natural additives like antimicrobials and antioxidants, enhancing their functionality and stability. Edible coatings are biodegradable and can utilize food industry by-products, aligning with circular economy principles and contributing to sustainability by reducing food waste and reliance on plastic (<xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">Matta &#x00026; Bertola, 2020</xref>). Formulations vary, ranging from hydrocolloids (polysaccharides and proteins) to lipids and composite blends, each tailored to specific food preservation needs. This adaptability, combined with cost-effectiveness and safety, positions edible coatings as a viable, environmentally-friendly packaging alternative in the modern food industry. <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> addresses the unique packaging requirements and problems associated with preserving the quality, safety, and shelf-life of various food categories.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the key techno-functional properties and diverse applications of edible coatings in food preservation and enhancement.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1" id="lk0005"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="t0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the main challenges and typical solutions to improve food preservation, safety, and consumer satisfaction.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0050">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><bold>Food Type</bold></th><th><bold>Packaging Challenges</bold></th><th><bold>Packaging Issues</bold></th><th><bold>Packaging Solutions</bold></th><th><bold>Ref.</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Fresh Produce (Fruits &#x00026;

<xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">Gajendran &#x00026; Rajamani, 2024</xref>). Their consumption supports immune function and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers, making them indispensable for a balanced diet. However, managing F&#x00026;Vs along the supply chain is challenging due to their postharvest physiological activity, including respiration (CO&#x02082; release and O&#x02082; uptake), which continues after harvest. High water content also renders F&#x00026;Vs highly perishable, leading to rapid spoilage. Effective postharvest strategies must focus on controlling factors like respiration rate, ethylene production, moisture loss, and microbial contamination to extend shelf life. F&#x00026;Vs are vulnerable to infections from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and molds, as changes in physiological and compositional properties during transport make them ideal substrates for microbial growth (<xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">Jemilakshmi et al., 2020</xref>). Key factors influencing spoilage include pH, temperature, and water activity (aw). Fruits, with a pH below 4.5, are prone to fungal growth, while vegetables, with a pH range of 4.8 to 6.5, support fungi and bacterial growth. Maintaining storage temperatures between 0 and 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C is critical, as higher temperatures accelerate respiration, while lower temperatures reduce microbial proliferation. However, the risk of psychrotrophic bacteria, fungi, and chilling injuries must also be managed (<xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">Kasapo&#x0011f;lu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">Globally, food loss and waste (FLW) of F&#x00026;Vs exceed 20&#x000a0;%, with 3&#x02013;18&#x000a0;% occurring during processing due to human errors, poor management, and technical issues. As the global population is projected to reach 9.1 billion by 2050, extending the shelf life of F&#x00026;Vs is imperative to meet demand. Traditional plastic packaging falls short, both environmentally and functionally, highlighting the need for alternatives like edible coatings (<xref rid="bb0805" ref-type="bibr">Perez-Vazquez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bb0920" ref-type="bibr">Sharma, Nakano, et al., 2024</xref>). The use of biodegradable layers can greatly enhance the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by microbial spoilage, moisture loss, and minimizing respiration, providing an environmentally sustainable alternative to plastic.

Effective packaging materials must act as a barrier to moisture, light, oxygen, and microbial contamination&#x02014;factors that accelerate spoilage. For instance, packaging fresh produce like leafy greens requires breathable materials that facilitate optimal gas exchange, preserving texture and nutritional quality (<xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0965" ref-type="bibr">Souza et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, processed meats demand vacuum-sealed packaging to minimize oxygen exposure, thus preventing oxidation and microbial growth (<xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2023</xref>). Selecting suitable material is not just a matter of protection; it must align with the specific preservation needs of each food type to ensure quality and minimize food waste. This complexity is compounded by the need to balance functionality with sustainability. As consumers increasingly demand eco-friendly options, finding effective and environmentally responsible materials is paramount. Inappropriate material choices can lead to compromised food-quality, shorter shelf-life, and heightened levels of food waste, impacting both the economy and the environment. Addressing these challenges requires a nuanced understanding of food properties, technological advancements in material science, and adherence to regulatory standards, ensuring that packaging solutions effectively meet safety and sustainability requirements (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Abdel Aziz &#x00026; Salama, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Alamdari et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Alamdari et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Al-Moghazy et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="p0065"><bold>Environmental challenges</bold> in food packaging are significant, mainly due to the persistent use of conventional materials like plastics, which contribute heavily to pollution and are slow to break down. Single-use plastics, prevalent in snacks, beverages, and ready-to-eat meal packaging, are significant contributors to global waste (<xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bb0625" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, there is an increasing shift towards eco-friendly alternatives. Compostable options derived from corn starch or sugarcane are gaining traction as sustainable substitutes. However, these alternatives often fall short in durability and shelf life, leading to a challenging trade-off between environmental sustainability and practical functionality (<xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Fitch-Vargas et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="p0070"><bold>Consumer demands</bold> add another layer of complexity to packaging innovation. Modern consumers expect packaging to perform effectively and be convenient, visually appealing, and environmentally sustainable. Innovations must reconcile consumer convenience with ecological concerns by creating resealable, lightweight designs or opting for transparent materials that highlight freshness. An example is &#x0201c;smart&#x0201d; packaging, which offers real-time freshness indicators, catering to consumer desires for transparency. However, these advanced features can escalate costs and not be feasible for all manufacturers (<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes &#x00026; Miranda, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Hamed et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bb0575" ref-type="bibr">Janowicz et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="p0075"><bold>Economic viability</bold> is a crucial concern, as sustainable packaging solutions often have a higher price tag. Small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face particular challenges, as materials like bioplastics and smart sensors tend to be costlier. These higher production costs frequently translate to increased retail prices, potentially making eco-friendly products less competitive. Companies investing in biodegradable packaging, for instance, face material costs that are substantially higher than conventional plastics, limiting affordability for price-sensitive markets (<xref rid="bb0670" ref-type="bibr">Mahmud et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bb0955" ref-type="bibr">Soro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb1150" ref-type="bibr">Zulewska et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="p0080"><bold>Regulatory requirements</bold> also play a critical role in shaping packaging innovations.

These coatings play a crucial role in food preservation, extending shelf life, enhancing quality, and reducing spoilage in a range of perishable products (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Abdelshafy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Al-Ismail et al., 2020</xref>). Edible coatings, composed of natural ingredients such as lipids, polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids, are biodegradable, safe for consumption, and align with the growing demand for sustainable food solutions. An essential benefit of edible coatings is their ability to control moisture loss, which is a major factor contributing to degradation in fruits and vegetables (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Ashrafi et al., 2024</xref>). During storage, moisture loss leads to weight reduction, texture deterioration, and shriveling. Polysaccharide based coatings, such as those from cellulose and pectin, form a semi-permeable layer that controls water evaporation, preserving freshness. For instance, pectin coatings applied to strawberries minimize water loss, maintain firmness, and extend shelf life significantly.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Key Properties and Benefits of Edible Coatings in Food Preservation and Quality Enhancement.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0015">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3" id="lk0015"/></fig></p><p id="p0090">Beyond moisture management, edible coatings serve as an effective barrier against oxygen, a key trigger for oxidative reactions that can lead to off-flavors, discoloration, and the degradation of nutrients (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Abdelshafy et al., 2023</xref>). Lipid based coatings, such as beeswax and carnauba wax, are particularly effective at limiting oxygen exposure (<xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">Hashemi et al., 2023</xref>). These coatings are often applied to fruits like apples, which help slow down oxidation, prevent browning, and minimize nutrient loss, thereby improving both the produce's visual appeal and market value over more extended storage periods (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, incorporating natural antimicrobials and antioxidants into edible coatings enhances their functionality, offering extended protection against spoilage and preserving food quality (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al., 2024</xref>). Essential oils, like thyme or rosemary, can be incorporated to prevent microbial growth (<xref rid="bb0800" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>).

Additionally, chitosan is a bioactive layer in paper-based packaging systems designed to inhibit yeast growth in orange juice (<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Demircan &#x00026; Velioglu, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="p0120"><bold>Starch</bold>, a readily available polysaccharide extracted from various agricultural sources like grains and tubers, has gained widespread application due to its excellent film-forming capabilities. Structurally, it consists of two primary components: amylose and amylopectin. The specific ratio between these fractions determines the starch's solubility and film-forming properties (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Almajidi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Berti et al., 2020</xref>). Adding plasticizers can greatly improve the internal elasticity of starch-based films, increasing tensile strength while decreasing water solubility (<xref rid="bb0680" ref-type="bibr">Mendon&#x000e7;a et al., 2024</xref>). This modification makes starch more versatile for diverse applications in biodegradable packaging and other industries.

Alginate's exceptional efficiency originates from its unusual ability to interact with calcium ions, resulting in semi-permeable membranes (<xref rid="bb1140" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). These membranes are essential in maintaining the delicate balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen during respiration, vital for the sensory and visual integrity of perishable and fresh produce meals. By controlling gas exchange, alginate avoids discoloration, retains texture and improves the overall appeal of cheese, poultry, meat, vegetables, and fruits. As a result, alginate-based coatings have grown in popularity due to their potential to dramatically lengthen shelf life while keeping desirable visual and sensory attributes (<xref rid="bb1025" ref-type="bibr">Vlahova-Vangelova et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0135"><bold>Pullulan</bold>, a linear extracellular polysaccharide made by fungus from sugar and starch, is gaining popularity quickly because of its exceptional properties, including excellent solubility, non-toxicity, and biodegradability.

Collagen-based coatings are recognized for their superior moisture and oxygen barrier properties, which help inhibit microbial growth and significantly enhance food preservation. In sausage packaging, collagen minimizes fat uptake and improves the product's texture and flow characteristics. Collagen bolsters structural integrity and reduces lipid oxidation when co-extruded with meat into sausage casings, resulting in a more stable and longer-lasting product (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="p0155">Whey, a nutrient-rich byproduct of the dairy industry, is notable for its water solubility and distinctive yellow-green hue. This versatile ingredient is categorized into two main types: whey protein isolate (WPI) and whey protein concentrate (WPC) (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Azizi et al., 2024</xref>). WPI is particularly prized for its higher protein content and lower fats, carbohydrates, and lactose levels. The increased protein concentration in whey facilitates the formation of robust, three-dimensional gel networks, positioning it as an excellent candidate for innovative edible packaging solutions. Compared to polysaccharides, pure whey protein films exhibit remarkable film-forming capabilities, enhanced physical strength, and superior barrier properties. Additionally, whey is rich in naturally occurring bioactive compounds&#x02014;such as lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, and cysteine&#x02014;which provide inherent antimicrobial and antioxidant benefits (<xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2023</xref>). For example, an edible coating derived from whey protein concentrate and infused with cinnamon extract has been shown to preserve the sensory qualities of curd cheese while effectively inhibiting the molds and yeast growth during storage (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Alizadeh-Sani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">Kandasamy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0690" ref-type="bibr">Mileriene et al., 2021</xref>).

However, gluten's inherent drawbacks include its limited elongation, structural rigidity, and water vapor barrier properties. Additionally, gluten is a known allergen, which poses a significant challenge in its application, particularly for consumers with gluten intolerance, as it can trigger celiac disease. Despite these concerns, no reports have emerged indicating that gluten-based edible films cause allergic reactions, and using gluten below allergenic thresholds presents a promising avenue for broadening market acceptance (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Ananey-Obiri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb1085" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). When applied to fruits and vegetables, gluten-based coatings create a fibrous matrix that enhances product resilience and aesthetic appeal and delays spoilage, thereby improving shelf life (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Armghan Khalid et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0165"><bold>Soy protein</bold>, derived from soy flour or milk, offers a strong nutritional profile that rivals whey protein. Its exceptional adhesiveness, cohesiveness, and viscoelasticity enable the creation of transparent, flexible films. However, its hydrophilic nature limits its effectiveness as a water vapor barrier, posing challenges for broader food packaging applications.

The natural water-repellent properties of lipids form a strong barrier that significantly reduces moisture permeation, helping to minimize water loss in perishable food items and ultimately prolonging their shelf life. These coatings exhibit remarkable compatibility when combined with other biopolymers, enhancing their functionality and enabling the delivery of bioactive ingredients (<xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Devi, Jaiswal, &#x00026; Jaiswal, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bb1020" ref-type="bibr">Vakili-Ghartavol et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bb1070" ref-type="bibr">Wu, Wu, &#x00026; Hu, 2024</xref>). However, despite these advantages, lipid coatings are prone to oxidative rancidity due to exposure to atmospheric oxygen, resulting in undesirable sensory characteristics. Furthermore, lipids lack inherent film-forming capabilities and adhesive properties, limiting their direct application on certain food surfaces.
