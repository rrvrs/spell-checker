Introduction</title><p>Macromolecules, including proteins and peptides, antibodies, oligonucleotides, and polysaccharides, represent the most promising new chemical entity class, because of their advantages in terms of tolerability, specificity, efficacy, and potency [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In fact, of the new drugs approved in 2023 by the Food and Drug Administration, only 50% were small molecules, which a few years ago accounted for more than 80% of all marked drugs [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Of the 55 new drugs approved, 26 were macromolecules, specifically 12 monoclonal antibodies, 5 proteins/enzymes, 5 peptides, and 4 oligonucleotides. In most of the cases, owing to their physicochemical properties, macromolecule administration requires the parenteral route; the drawbacks of this method (poor patient compliance, cost, risk of infections, etc.) stimulated researchers to find alternative administration routes [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Oromucosal administration, i.e., administration of the drug through the buccal or sublingual mucosa, has recently received a certain interest, also for macromolecular drugs. Despite the many advantages (accessibility, low enzymatic activity, avoidance of first pass effect, etc.), the mucosal delivery of high-molecular-weight drugs is still challenging due to their large molecular weight, hydrophilic nature, and poor permeability across epithelia. Different strategies to increase macromolecule penetration have been proposed, such as chemical penetration enhancers, enzyme inhibitors, pro-drugs, mucoadhesive materials, and microneedles [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Chemical penetration enhancers (surfactants, bile salts, fatty acids, Azone, ethanol, etc.) have received a certain attention for their ability to increase skin and mucosa permeation [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; however, their use is associated with possible irritation, membrane damage, and toxicity [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In a previous work [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we studied the effect of several penetration enhancers (fatty acids and bile salts) on fluorescently labeled dextran (m.w. 4000 Da) penetration; these preliminary data were then used to evaluate the buccal mucosa penetration of high-molecular-weight dextrans (up to 150 kDa) [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The results obtained represent the proof of concept of the possibility to promote the mucosal penetration of high-molecular-weight dextrans (70 and 150 kDa) using caprylic acid in pre-treatment or sodium taurocholate in co-administration. The use of chemical enhancers is not free from problems related to the above-mentioned possible toxic effects and to the need of a complex formulation and/or a specific application protocol, in particular in the case of pre-treatment [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Microneedles (MNs) are micron-sized needles, on a solid support, with heights ranging between 25 and 2000 &#x000b5;m, that can pierce biological tissues and create microchannels [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The concept of MNs was first presented in a patent in 1971 [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; since then, a wide variety of MNs have been developed in terms of type, material, and shape, mostly for skin application. MNs are conventionally applied to the skin with a patch or a roller or an applicator and, at present, there are five main types of microneedles: solid, dissolving, hollow, coated, and hydrogel-forming [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Solid MNs deliver drugs by creating microchannels in the stratum corneum and promoting the release of drug molecules to and across the tissue [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dissolving MNs, made of soluble excipients, dissolve after insertion into the tissue; they do not require a removal step, making them more patient-friendly. Dissolving MNs can deliver a broad range of drugs and therapeutic high-molecular-weight molecules, following the needle&#x02019;s dissolution inside the skin tissue [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several geometrical parameters can affect skin penetration of solid MNs, such as shape [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], needle length [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], tip and base width/diameter [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and pitch [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The application of MNs to the buccal mucosa is more recent and less characterized, compared to their application to the skin. In a recent review [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it was concluded that MNs have the potential to produce a better treatment outcome with reduced side effects. MN application has also been explored for vaccine [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and peptide (human insulin and human growth hormone) [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] administration.</p><p>This work aimed at investigating the effect of different microneedle-based strategies on high-molecular-weight model molecule permeation through porcine esophageal epithelium. Fluorescently labeled dextrans (FDs) with 70 kDa and 150 kDa molecular weight were used as a model for therapeutic high-molecular-weight compounds, because they have been shown not to cross the buccal epithelium in passive conditions [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Two different approaches were evaluated: (1) stainless steel MNs of 500 &#x000b5;m height used for tissue pre-treatment before FD solution application; and (2) soluble microneedles, containing PVP as a soluble and biocompatible polymer and FDs, prepared using the solvent casting technique. These MNs had a pyramid shape, and three different lengths were tested, 150, 500, and 800 &#x000b5;m.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-18-00158"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmaceuticals-18-00158"><title>2.1. Soluble MN Characterization</title><p>Polyvinyl pyrrolidone was chosen as a dissolvable polymer, because it has been shown to produce MNs of sufficient strength to penetrate the skin, is biocompatible, and exhibits low toxicity [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both &#x0201c;blank&#x0201d; and FD-loaded microneedles were studied, collecting 3D images (Z-stacks) and emission spectra, using two-photon microscopy. <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00158-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows a representative example of 800 &#x000b5;m MNs loaded with FD-70 (panel a) and blank (panel b).</p><p>The shape and size of the microneedles were in line with the values expected from mold size: pyramidal shape, approximately 800 &#x000b5;m in height, and 200 &#x000d7; 200 &#x000b5;m base. The emission spectra shown in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00158-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (panel c) suggest that the green emission of the FD-70-loaded MN comes from the fluorescein present in dextran, while the red fluorescence detected in the &#x0201c;blank&#x0201d; MN probably comes from the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) scaffold itself (or from some impurities).</p><p>MN arrays were also characterized in terms of rate of dissolution, by measuring the amount of FD-70 released over time from single arrays placed in 5 mL of pH 7.4 buffer solution. The results show that, when placed in aqueous medium, MNs dissolved in less than 4 min, in agreement with the reported quick dissolution of the polymer [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The average amount of FD-70 loaded was approx. 800 &#x000b5;g per array.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmaceuticals-18-00158"><title>2.2. Permeation Studies</title><p>In this work, microneedle patches with different needle lengths and containing different-molecular-weight fluorescent dextrans were tested in vitro using pig esophageal epithelium as the barrier.</p><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-pharmaceuticals-18-00158"><title>2.2.1. Stainless Steel MNs vs. Soluble MNs</title><p>At first, stainless steel MNs were evaluated. In analogy with the data published on the skin [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the dermaroller cylinder (MNs of 500 &#x000b5;m in length) was rolled on the mucosa surface four or eight times, and then a 2 mg/mL FD-70 solution was applied. The results obtained, reported in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00158-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> (panel a), demonstrated that MNs can pierce the buccal tissue (the corresponding passive experiments were zero), although probably due to the elasticity of the tissue, the micropores created did not allow the important penetration of FD-70. Additionally, the permeation kinetic was very slow, the data are characterized by a very high variability, and no statistical difference between four and eight passes is present. Research data on MN application to the skin, using a dermaroller cylinder, shows that micropores created in the skin increase at each pass of the roller [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but again, the elasticity of the epithelial tissue may reduce this effect. In fact, the elastic modulus of the skin is reported to be approx. 19.6 MPa, whereas the buccal mucosa shows a value of approx. 8 MPa [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and the esophagus of approx. 2 MPa [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], demonstrating a higher elasticity.</p><p>Considering these results, and the difficulties in the practical application of this approach to the mucosa, the use of this system was discarded and only soluble MNs were further investigated.</p><p>Preliminary experiments with soluble MNs were performed to find the more appropriate conditions for in vitro experiments (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00158-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, panel b). First of all, the application time was determined: the length of time during which the array is applied to the mucosa should be long enough to guarantee MN dissolution, but not too long to produce patient discomfort. MNs (500 &#x000b5;m length, loaded with FD-70) were applied to the mucosa for 5 min, 10 min, and 2 h (in all cases, FD permeation was followed up to 4 h). The obtained results show that 5 min is too short to allow for the complete dissolution of MNs inside the tissue: when the array was removed, it was possible to observe that some MNs were still undissolved and, at the end of the experiment, the variability obtained was very high. As observed also by other authors [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the limited amount of water inside the tissue reduced the dissolution rate of the polymer and dextran, if compared with the conditions of the dissolution experiment, in which MNs dissolved in 4 min (see <xref rid="sec2dot1-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1</xref>. Soluble MN Characterization). When MNs were applied to the tissue for the whole length of the experiment (as was done in the case of skin application), a large amount of dextrans penetrated the skin; however, this condition is uncomfortable for the patient. An application time of 10 min was found to be adequate to guarantee MN dissolution and this application time can be considered acceptable for the patient.</p><p>Considering these results, in all subsequent experiments, MN patches were applied to the mucosa for 10 min and then removed, whereas the release of dextrans across the tissue was monitored for up to 2 h, because after 2 h the release profile flattened, indicating that the available FD had already penetrated across the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-pharmaceuticals-18-00158"><title>2.2.2. In Vitro Evaluation of Dissolving Microneedle Arrays</title><p><xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00158-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the permeation profiles of FD-70 (panel a) and FD-150 (panel b) across pig esophageal epithelium after the application of patches with three different needle lengths, namely, 150, 500, and 800 &#x000b5;m, for 10 min. High-molecular-weight dextrans permeated the mucosa very quickly, within a few minutes, and the extent was highly dependent on the length of the needles. After the application of 150 &#x003bc;m MNs, no dextran permeation was observed; probably the MNs were too short to cross the membrane, which had a thickness of approx. 400 &#x000b5;m (consistent with the data in the literature, reporting an average thickness of pig epithelium of 340&#x02013;490 &#x000b5;m [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Additionally, it might be necessary to have a minimum needle length to overcome the elasticity of the mucosa, as has been reported for the skin [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>When 500 &#x000b5;m MNs were used, both dextrans, FD-70 and FD-150, penetrated the tissue quite quickly and to the same extent. The same was observed with 800 &#x000b5;m, although the total amount permeated was higher (not significantly different for the two dextrans; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test). Considering the effect of needle length on the permeation of the individual dextrans, in both cases, the transport was significantly higher for all time points (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 for FD-70 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for FD-150; <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test). Longer needles (800 &#x000b5;m) can probably cross the whole tissue, whereas shorter ones (500 &#x000b5;m) cannot do the same, although they are nominally longer than tissue thickness (400 &#x000b5;m). The literature reports that when using soluble MNs, the penetration depth in the skin is considerably lower than the MNs&#x02019; length [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

This result is somewhat surprising, although it has already been observed. In fact, no difference in the permeability of FD-70 and FD-150 was found by (i) Matsukawa et al. across rat alveolar epithelium (the hypothesized mechanism is pinocytosis) [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], (ii) Fantini et al. across pig esophageal epithelium using chemical penetration enhancers (high-molecular-weight dextrans permeate through the opening of tight junctions [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), and Ambati et al. across rabbit sclera (the hypothesized dextrans are transported by porous diffusion through a fiber matrix [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), or (iii) Hutton et al. across the skin from hydrogel-forming MNs [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the present work, the absence of differences is probably due to the mechanism of dissolvable MNs: they pierce the membrane, creating holes, and then dissolve, releasing the active molecules into and/or across the tissue (depending on their length).</p><p>Comparing these results with those obtained using chemical penetration enhancers [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00158" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it is evident that MN application allows a very quick onset of action, whereas non-invasive techniques require several hours.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot3-pharmaceuticals-18-00158"><title>2.2.3.

Two-Photon Microscopy</title><p>Specimens were analyzed with a Two-Photon Microscope Nikon A1R MP+ Upright (Nikon, Tokyo, J) equipped with a femtosecond pulsed laser Coherent Chameleon Discovery (~100 fs pulse duration with 80 MHz repetition rate; tunable wavelength output 660&#x02013;1320 nm). A 25&#x000d7; water dipping objective with numerical aperture 1.1 and 2 mm working distance was employed to focus the excitation beam and to collect the two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) signal. The TPEF signal was directed by a dichroic mirror to a series of two non-descanned detectors (high-sensitivity GaAsP photomultiplier tubes), allowing fast image acquisition. The two detectors are preceded by optical filters allowing the simultaneous acquisition of two separated channels: green channel (506&#x02013;593 nm) and red channel (604&#x02013;679 nm). The imaging overlay of the three channels and processing were performed by the operation software of the microscope. Additionally, a third GaAsP photomultiplier detector, connected to the microscope through an optical fiber and preceded by a dispersive element, was used to record the spectral profile of the TPEF signal (wavelength range 430 to 650 nm with a bandpass of 10 nm). The TPEF images and emission spectra of both porcine esophagus and microneedles were collected with excitation light at 850 or 1030 nm. Images were acquired with a typical field of view of 500 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 500 &#x003bc;m. To ensure consistency among images, detector gains were kept at the same relative values in all the images of the esophageal tissue. The focal plane was controlled by the motorized movement of the objective lens, enabling the imaging of specific regions at varying depths within the sample. Three-dimensional images were reconstructed from series of two-dimensional images (Z-stack) collected at predefined depths (Z-step). To prevent their structural deformation, microneedles were analyzed in the absence of water. Images of MNs applied to porcine tissue were obtained immediately after applying MN arrays to the luminal side of full-thickness esophagi.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-pharmaceuticals-18-00158"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The results obtained show that by applying soluble MNs, the transport of high-molecular-weight dextrans (70 and 150 kDa) across and into the mucosal tissue occurs very rapidly. A minimum length is required to cross the esophageal epithelium: 150 &#x000b5;m MNs did not produce any effect either in terms of amount permeated or tissue fluorescence, probably because they were too short to pierce the tissue (whose thickness is typically 400 &#x000b5;m). When 500 &#x000b5;m MNs were used, both types of dextrans permeated the tissue in similar amounts. The permeation was very quick, started within minutes, and leveled out in approx. 30 min, indicating that all available dextran was released. The use of solid MNs of the same length to pre-treat the tissue, followed by the application of a solution of the permeant, did not produce the same effect in terms of onset of permeation, which was found to be much slower. Increasing the length of MNs to 800 &#x000b5;m increased to a significant extent the amount permeated (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, respectively, for FD-70 and FD-150; <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test), again in a similar manner for the two dextrans. The multiphoton microscopy analysis of MNs applied to the tissue allowed for the visualization in depth of the diffuse fluorescence signal from the partially dissolved MNs, confirming the presence of holes in the tissue and the permeation of the fluorescein-labeled dextrans. Since many other factors can influence skin permeability, further work will be required to optimize the MN array, for instance, by changing not only the length, but also the shape and pitch.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work has been carried out in the frame of the ALIFAR project, funded by the Italian Ministry of University through the program &#x0201c;Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2023&#x02013;2027&#x0201d;.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
