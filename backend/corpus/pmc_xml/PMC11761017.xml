However, it remains unclear when the genetic events associated with immune escape occur during cancer development. Here, we integrate functional genomics studies of immunomodulatory genes with a tumor evolution reconstruction approach to infer the evolution of immune escape across 38 cancer types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes dataset. Different cancers favor mutations in different immunomodulatory pathways. For example, the antigen presentation machinery is highly mutated in colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, and the protein methylation pathway is highly mutated in bladder transitional cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. We also observe different timing patterns in multiple immunomodulatory pathways. For instance, mutations impacting genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolism were more likely to happen late in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network pathway tended to occur early, while mutations in the TNF pathways were more likely to occur late in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mutations in the NOD1/2 signaling pathway and DNA binding transcription factor activity tended to happen late in breast adenocarcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma.

Various immune escape mechanisms have been discovered (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), among which impairment of antigen presentation is a frequent event (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, it remains unclear when the genetic events that underlie immune escape occur during cancer development. Gaining such knowledge can help us understand how immune resistance emerges, what genetic events precede its emergence, and how cancers further evolve after acquiring immune resistance. This in turn can help devise personalized therapeutic strategies that block the adaptation of cancers to evolving selection pressures.</p><p id="P7">As our understanding of anti-cancer immunity deepens, the evolution of immune escape has elicited intense interest in the field of cancer immunology. Multiple studies performed multi-region sampling (such as primary and metastatic sites) followed by whole exome/genome sequencing to infer the evolution of immune escape in each patient (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These studies have led to recurrent observations of impairment of (neo)antigen presentation in early-stage tumors (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, this approach relies heavily on the availability of multi-region samples and therefore sample size has been limited. Besides, this approach cannot compare the timing of clonal mutations that are present in all cancer cells in the tumor. Several studies also delineated the genetic landscape that underlies immune escape in primary and metastatic cancers (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For example, a recent study characterized mutations in six molecules or pathways that can cause immune escape: HLA, antigen presentation, IFN&#x003b3; pathway, PD-L1 amplification, CD58 alteration, and epigenetic regulation by SETDB1 (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Nevertheless, the selection of immune escape pathways in existing studies is often limited and arbitrary, with a bias toward well-documented pathways such as antigen presentation.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we utilize a tumor evolution reconstruction approach and leverage our recently developed GRITIC tool (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to perform fine-scaled timing of events in tumor evolution. We also utilize published functional genomics screens to systematically identify the immunomodulatory genes and pathways whose mutation might underlie immune escape. We first focused on the antigen presentation machinery (APM) and inferred the timing of mutations in genes involved in this pathway. Next, we expanded to the core pathways that regulate other aspects of cancer-immune interaction and delineate the evolutionary trajectories of mutations in these pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Prevalence of antigen presentation machinery mutations across cancer types</title><p id="P9">The antigen presentation machinery (APM) mediates the recognition of cancer cells by T cells. Its impairment is prevalent in cancer and is a major mechanism of resistance to immunotherapies. Antigen presentation mediated by Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC-I) is prevalent in all cell types, whereas antigen presentation mediated by Class II MHC (MHC-II) is mostly present in antigen presenting cells (APCs) (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, we focused on mutations in the MHC-I mediated APM. We first examined the prevalence of APM mutations in the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset with 2,658 whole genome sequences (WGS) of cancers from 38 cancer types (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1A</xref>). 7.7% of samples showed point mutations in the APM, dominated by <italic toggle="yes">NLRC5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic> mutations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition, 18.9% of samples showed HLA loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Multiple cancer types showed a high prevalence of APM mutations, such as chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>). These findings align with previous studies reporting APM mutations in various cancers (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is often associated with immune selection pressure. Indeed, we found in multiple cancer types that tumor samples with APM mutation showed higher TMB levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Furthermore, compared with tumors without APM mutation, those with APM mutation showed higher levels of immune infiltration in multiple cancer types, including melanoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Comparison of bulk tumor gene expression showed that in breast adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer, and melanoma, samples with APM mutation showed higher expression of genes involved in inflammation and T cell activation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Conversely, in breast lobular carcinoma, thyroid adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma, samples with APM mutation showed lower expression of genes involved in B-cell-mediated immune response (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we investigated whether APM point mutations are under selection across cancer types using the non-synonymous:synonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). APM mutations presented a dN/dS ratio of &#x0003e;1 in truncating mutations in a pan-cancer analysis. Positive selection of truncated mutations in APM was also found in colorectal adenocarcinoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Timing of mutations in the antigen presentation machinery across cancer types</title><p id="P12">We then inferred the timing of mutations in the APM across cancer types in all PCAWG samples leveraging the principles of GRITIC (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to time individual mutations, and characterized how cancers evolve before or after acquiring mutations in the APM. Briefly, our approach uses read counts to infer the relative timing of a given SNV and any overlapping copy number gains. The gain timing distributions from GRITIC are then used to produce posterior timing distributions for each SNV. The SNV timing is on a scale called mutation time which ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing conception and 1 representing the end of the tumor&#x02019;s clonal evolutionary period (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The relative timing of mutations in each gene was calculated by subtracting the mean timing of all SNVs in driver genes from the gene mutation timing in each sample (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To evaluate the performance of our approach for inferring SNV timing, we first used it to reconstruct event timing in colorectal cancer, where mutations in <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, and TP53 are known to be the early steps in tumor evolution (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Reassuringly, our approach infers that <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations are among the earliest events in colorectal cancer evolution (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with the published studies (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We then evaluated the timing of APM mutations across cancer types. Of the 137 SNVs in APM genes, 86% were clonal, and 14% were subclonal (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>). We were able to time most SNVs, particularly clonal SNVs in samples with complex copy number alterations (CNAs), building upon the strengths of GRITIC in timing complex copy number gains (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). For example, in a bladder transitional cell carcinoma patient with clonal mutations in <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and whole genome doubling (WGD), GRITIC inferred that the <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic> mutation happened after the <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation and the WGD (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We defined the mean timing of all mutations in driver genes as the background timing for each sample. For mutations in the APM, we compared their timing with the background timing and categorized them as &#x0201c;early&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;late&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;undetermined&#x0201d; in each patient (<xref rid="S9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Compared to the background timing in each sample, APM point mutations often happened late in colorectal cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">For samples with HLA LOH, it is difficult to directly infer the timing of LOH, due to the loss of mutation information on the lost allele. As an alternative approach, in tumors with WGD, we used the timing of the WGD as a reference for timing HLA LOH (<xref rid="S9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We found that breast adenocarcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma, and leiomyosarcoma tend to have early HLA LOH events (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of genetic pathways with immunomodulatory effects</title><p id="P17">In addition to mutations in the APM, various other pathways have been reported to contribute to immune escape. Existing genomic studies assessing the prevalence of immune escape mechanisms in primary patient tumors suffer from arbitrary selection of a handful of pathways (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). To overcome this limitation, we utilized published genome-wide CRISPR screens that systematically identify the genes involved in different immunomodulatory aspects, such as regulation of MHC-I expression or response to immune-cell-mediated killing (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We identified the top regulators in each study using MAGeCK (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and conducted Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways with immunomodulatory effects. Next, we selected the most frequently enriched immunomodulatory pathways across studies and inferred their mutation timing.</p><p id="P18">Reassuringly, pathways enriched by positive regulators of MHC-I expression included antigen processing and presentation via MHC class I, the IFN&#x003b1; pathway, and IFN&#x003b3; signaling. Conversely, pathways enriched by negative regulators of MHC-I expression included protein methylation and autophagy, among others (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Regarding the sensitivity of cancer cells to T-cell cytotoxicity, the leading positive regulatory processes were necroptosis, IFN&#x003b3; signaling, and antigen processing and presentation via MHC class I. The leading negative regulatory processes were autophagy and apoptosis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Pathways enriched by regulators of response of cancer cells to other immune cells include the PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint pathway in NK-cell-mediated killing, SWI/SNF in macrophage-mediated killing, and regulation of precursor metabolite generation in &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cell-mediated-killing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mutation frequencies of immunomodulatory pathways across cancer types</title><p id="P19">Based on the results above, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of the prevalence of mutations in immunomodulatory pathways. For MHC-I regulators, protein methylation-related genes (<italic toggle="yes">SETD2, KDM6A, MEN1, SETD1B, EZH2, SETDB1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">BCOR</italic>) were the most frequently mutated, accounting for 14.6% of all PCAWG samples. Notably, PRC complexes encoded by these genes were identified as negative regulators of MHC-I expression (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Regarding the sensitivity of cancer cells to T-cell killing, autophagy, as a negative regulator (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), had the highest prevalence of mutations, occurring in 11.5% of PCAWG samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Mutations in the other representative pathways, IFN&#x003b3; signaling (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) accounted for 6.0% of all the samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). The prevalence of mutations in the regulatory pathways of cancer cells&#x02019; responses to other immune-cell-mediated killing varied across cancer types (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We next explored whether mutations in these immunomodulatory pathways were under selection, by calculating the dN/dS ratio. For MHC-I regulators, we observe positive selection in multiple pathways, including the IFN&#x003b3; pathway, negative regulation of catabolic processes, protein methylation, and regulation of autophagy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5A</xref>). In the regulation of sensitivity of cancer cells to T cell-mediated killing, positive selection was found in DNA Binding transcription factor activity, IFN&#x003b3; signaling, necroptosis, RIPK1-mediated necrosis, and the TNF pathway (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).

For regulation of the MHC-I expression, mutations in the protein methylation pathway presented as late events in ovarian adenocarcinoma and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6A</xref>). For regulation of sensitivity of cancer cells to T cell-mediated killing, mutations in the DNA binding transcription factor activity pathway presented as late events in ovarian adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B</xref>).

Mutations in the cellular amino acid metabolic process, including <italic toggle="yes">FPGS and GART</italic>, tended to happen late in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network pathway, including <italic toggle="yes">CREBBP</italic>, tended to occur early, while mutations in the TNF pathways tended to happen late in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Mutations in the NOD1/2 signaling pathway and in DNA binding transcription factor activity, affecting genes such as <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K7, UBE2N, IKBKG, CHUK</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">IKBKB</italic>, occurred late in breast adenocarcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>).

We wondered whether the timing of such mutations is associated with differences in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we compared bulk tumor gene expression between samples with early mutations to those with late mutations for each immunomodulatory pathway in each cancer type. We found that the timing of mutations in immunomodulatory pathways is associated with a different tumor microenvironment in multiple cancer types. For example, patients with early mutations involved in regulation of autophagy had higher expression of negative regulation in immune response in squamous cell lung carcinoma. Patients with late mutations in this pathway had higher expression of genes in leukocyte activity in lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, patients with late mutations in the apoptosis or DNA binding transcription factor pathway had higher expression of genes involved in leukocyte activation and proliferation in melanoma. Conversely, melanoma patients with early mutations in the autophagy pathway had higher expression of genes involved in leukocyte activity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S20</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Altogether, these results illustrate that different cancer types harness different evolutionary trajectories for immune escape.

During the evolution of cancer, cancer cells can develop various strategies to escape immunosurveillance, but the evolutionary process of immune escape is poorly understood, hampering early detection and intervention of immune escape. Answering this question faces two major challenges: (i) identify genes whose mutations can confer immune escape; (ii) determine when such mutations occur in cancer&#x02019;s evolutionary history. Consequently, previous studies have largely focused on a small number of well-documented pathways in a limited number of cancers.</p><p id="P29">In this study, we performed data mining of functional genomics screens to systematically identify genes with immunomodulatory effects. We also built upon previous work in evolutionary history inference and built upon our recently developed GRITIC tools to perform fine-scaled timing of events in tumor evolution. Our study reconstructs the evolutionary trajectories of mutations in various immunomodulatory pathways across 38 cancer types in the PCAWG dataset. Together, this study reconstructs the timelines summarizing the typical evolutionary history of immune escape in cancer.</p><p id="P30">Several limitations in this study should be considered. First, regarding the timing of HLA LOH, as with any statistical approach using multiplicity to infer the evolutionary trajectories, GRITIC cannot quantitatively time chromosomal losses. However, for samples with WGD, we are able to use the relative timing compared to WGD to infer broad timing of HLA LOH. Second, all non-synonymous mutations in a pathway were included for reconstructing the timeline, irrespective of whether they resulted in gain or loss of function. Further investigation into the effects of these mutations on protein function is needed to understand their impact on the evolutionary history of immune escape.</p><p id="P31">Aligned with previous studies (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), we observed that samples with mutations in APM were associated with higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in several cancer types. Especially in colorectal adenocarcinoma, higher levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and TMB were found in samples with APM mutations, and APM mutations are under positive selection. These results suggest that the genetic alterations of APM genes might develop escape mechanisms upon strong immune selection pressures.</p><p id="P32">Besides the diverse timing patterns of APM mutations in cancers, mutations in other immunomodulatory pathways presented different evolutionary trajectories across cancers. The cellular amino acid metabolic process was identified as a negative regulator of tumor cell response to &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T-cell killing, with a mutation prevalence of 2.5% in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Previous studies reported that &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells can infiltrate into the pancreatic adenocarcinoma microenvironment (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our study suggests that mutations in this pathway can be late-occurring events in pancreatic adenocarcinoma to mediate resistance to &#x003b3;&#x003b4;-T-cell-mediated killing. The TNF pathway, a positive regulator of tumor cell response to T-cell killing, exhibited mutations in 12.5% of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Previous studies revealed that Caspase 8 is often lost or mutated in various tumor types, making it a common target for immune evasion (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our results suggest that mutations in this pathway happen late in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p id="P33">The DNA-binding transcription factor activity pathway and the NOD1/2 pathway were identified as negative regulators of tumor cell response to T-cell killing, occurring as late events in breast and ovarian adenocarcinomas. The SWI/SNF pathway was identified as a positive regulator of tumor cell sensitivity to macrophage killing, with mutations found in 11.1% of hepatocellular carcinomas. We found that mutations in this pathway are late events in hepatocellular carcinoma evolution. The glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network pathway, a positive regulator of tumor cell response to macrophage killing, showed high mutation prevalence in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Our results suggest that mutations in this pathway occur early during B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma development, potentially facilitating evasion from macrophage killing. Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">CREBBP</italic>, a key gene in this pathway, is a known driver gene of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

As glucocorticoids are important therapeutic agents for aggressive lymphomas (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), understanding the timing of genetic alterations in this pathway can facilitate more personalized timelines for drug administration.</p><p id="P34">In conclusion, our study illustrated the evolutionary trajectories of immune escape across cancer types with a broad coverage of immunomodulatory pathways, demonstrating temporally heterogeneous immunogenomic features across cancers.

(C-D) Timing of mutations in genetic pathways with immunomodulatory effects in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (C) and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (D). Green represents early timing, transitioning gradually to purple for late timing. The color intensity reflects the proportion of early or late events out of 250 samplings, indicating the likelihood of an event occurring early or late. Right Panel: The event is classified as &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; at the cancer-type level. If the ratio &#x0003c; 0.5, the event is classified as &#x0201c;early&#x0201d;. If the ratio &#x0003e; 2, the event is classified as &#x0201c;late&#x0201d;. Ratio = (Number of late + 1) / (Number of late + 1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihpp-2025.01.17.632799v1-f0004" position="float"/></fig></floats-group></article>
