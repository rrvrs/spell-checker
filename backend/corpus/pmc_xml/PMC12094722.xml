</self-uri><abstract><p>Deregulated energy metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, characterized by increased glycolytic flux. Cancer-specific modification of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) impairs its ability to regulate the enzyme&#x02019;s activity which increases glycolytic flux. Consequently, excessive cytosolic NADH formation triggers a harmful redox imbalance in cancer cells, which is rapidly neutralized by the formation of lactic acid and superoxide (SOX). To learn more about deregulated glycolysis in cancer cells, a supercomputer used the atomic model of the crystal structure of human PFK1 for virtual screening a database of 4.5 million compounds by docking with the catalytic binding sites of the enzyme. The screening revealed two compounds capable of reducing modified, cancer-specific PFK1 activity and simultaneously suppressing lactate and SOX formation. A dose-dependent inhibition was observed in the cells treated by compounds in the following tumorigenic cells: Jurkat (Acute T cells leukemia); Caco-2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma); COLO 829 (melanoma); and MDA-MB-231 (breast gland adenocarcinoma). In addition, two selected compounds assessed for cytostatic and cytotoxic activity showed no negative effects on tumorigenic cells. However, during incubation, the strengths of inhibitions continuously decreased, both during lactate and SOX formation. No such effects were observed if compounds were sequentially submitted to the cells at low concentrations every 24 hours. Additional experiments performed by Jurkat cells revealed reduced respiration and glycolysis rates in the cells treated with compounds concerning the untreated cells. Inhibition of modified cancer-specific PFK1 activity reduces deregulated glycolytic flux, prevents abundant cytosolic NADH formation, and restores redox balance thus simultaneously preventing the formation of deleterious effects of lactate and SOX, two crucial players in cancer initiation and development.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

To maintain their growth, cancer cells undergo complex restructuring characterized by changes in metabolic pathways involved in energy production and biosynthetic processes. One of these changes, designated a &#x0201c;hallmark of cancer&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], is the deregulation of cellular energetics.</p><p>There are reasons to believe that the post-translational modification of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase may cause aberrant energy metabolism in cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The native human 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) (EC 2.7.1.11) exhibits the most complex control of the glycolytic pathway in normal cells, surpassing the regulatory functions of other allosteric enzymes. PFK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate using Mg-ATP as a phosphoryl donor [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PFK1 is stimulated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), ADP/AMP, and ammonium ions, whereas citrate and ATP act as potent inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Three different PFK1 genes are present in the human genome: muscle type (PFK-M), 85.183&#x02009;Da [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; liver type (PFK-L), 85.018&#x02009;Da [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; and platelet type (PFK-P), 85.596&#x02009;Da [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which are expressed differently in specific tissues. Different levels of isoenzymes have also been found in tumor-forming cells [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and may differ in certain stages of growth in individual tumors [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>During evolution, eukaryotic PFK1 enzymes developed by duplication, tandem fusion, and divergence of a prokaryotic ancestor&#x02019;s catalytic and effector binding sites [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the strict conservation between the active site residues in the N-terminal segment of the eukaryotic enzyme and those of bacterial PFKs suggests that the active site of eukaryotic PFK1 is located in the N-terminal part [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, the allosteric ligand binding sites, which have arisen during evolution through mutations in the C-terminus, allow fine-tuning of the regulatory enzyme through the increased levels of specific downstream metabolites. One of the allosteric ligands is citrate, which acts as a potent inhibitor of all mammalian PFK1 isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while some effectors, such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, increase the activity of the enzyme to a higher level than that of the native enzyme. The native 87-kDa PFK1s is, therefore, a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis.</p><p>We were the first to show that in cancer cells, the human native PFK1 enzymes, which are generally under the control of feedback inhibition, undergo post-translational modifications. After proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal part of the enzyme, highly active, shorter 45-47&#x02009;kDa in PFK-M isoenzyme [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and 70&#x02009;kDa in PFK-L isoenzymes fragments [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] are formed that are insensitive to citrate and ATP inhibition. However, no post-translational modification of PFK-P isoform has been observed in MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or other tumorigenic cells.</p><p>Deregulated cancer-specific, highly active PFK-M, and PFK-K fragments lacking allosteric binding sites trigger uncontrolled glycolytic flux and abundant cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generation as a by-product of glycolysis. This occurs at the sixth step of glycolysis acolytes where two molecules of glycerol-3-phosphate are oxidized to two molecules of 1,2-bisphosphoglycerate coupled with the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The balance between NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is vital in all organisms. Both pyridine nucleotide molecules act as freely diffusible electron carriers; however, they are engaged in distinct metabolic pathways. NADH drives energy production in the cytosol by glycolysis and in the mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation, while NADPH governs reductive biosynthesis, antioxidation, and oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To maintain redox homeostasis in proliferating cells, redundant cytosolic NADH must be re-oxidized by two mechanisms; in the cytosol, NADH is re-oxidized by reducing pyruvate as the last step of glycolysis, into lactic acid, which is finally transported out of the cells [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The effect of deregulated metabolic flux, redox imbalance, and abundant NADH formation was observed in <italic toggle="yes">pfk</italic>-null <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> hosting recombinant highly active cancer-specific PFK-M enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The extracellular accumulation of lactic acid leads to acidification of the tumor microenvironment, creating a pH gradient between the extracellular pHe (6.6-6.9) and the intracellular pHi (7.2-7.5), which supports the malignant phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] characterized by immune evade [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], metastases [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], triggering angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Simultaneously the malate-aspartate shuttle translates some redundant cytosolic NADH into the mitochondrial compartment [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. When NADH molecules need to be re-oxidized (each NADH molecule donates one pair of electrons), the electrons are passed to the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Still, some escape permanently from the ETC and react directly with oxygen to generate Superoxide ions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>.) Most commonly, superoxide (SOX) is formed at cytochrome III level by incomplete one-electron reduction of oxygen [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. SOX is short-lived but can be rapidly converted into other Reactive oxygen species (ROS). By superoxide dismutase hydrogen, peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is formed, which is more stable and can diffuse throughout the cell. Increased steady-state cytosolic concentrations of SOX may also reduce transition metals, which in turn react with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> producing hydroxyl radicals (OH&#x02022;) [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hydroxyl radicals are strong oxidants capable of irreversible nitration of proteins, inactivating enzymes, and causing DNA lesions [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In the past, numerous attempts were made to suppress the individual synthesis of lactate or SOX by inhibiting various metabolic targets. However, suppressing one method of NADH re-oxidizing must inevitably increase another system of re-oxidation to maintain appropriate redox balance. Using small-molecule inhibitors to suppress cancer-specific PFK1 activities to the level of normal PFK1 cells, seems to be the more effective method for reducing deregulated glycolysis flux.</p><p>This study shows that selected small-molecule inhibitors discovered to reduce modified cancer-specific PFK1 activities are suitable means for inhibiting dysregulated glycolytic flux in cancer cells simultaneously preventing lactate and SOX formation. The reduced glycolytic flux avoids excess cytosolic NADH formation and shows no cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. Besides, by suppressing lactate and SOX formation detrimental developmental effects such as angiogenesis, immune evade, metastases, and mutations are prevented (<xref rid="pone.0321998.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0321998.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0321998.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>A schematic presentation of simultaneous prevention of lactate and ROS/SOX generations by using small-molecule compounds to reduce the activity of cancer-specific 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1).</title><p>Dysregulated metabolic processes in cancer lead to the formation of numerous glycolytic intermediates, including cytosolic NADH. As abundant NADH is formed at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, the cellular redox system becomes unbalanced. Excess NADH must be reoxidized immediately to avoid damaging disruption through lactate and superoxide formation. While NADH is mainly reoxidized in the cytosol by reducing pyruvate to lactate, part of the NADH enters the mitochondrial compartment through the aspartate-malate shuttle. Mitochondrial NADH is oxidized by donating electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). If there is an excess of electrons, some can incompletely reduce the oxygen with a single electron and form superoxide. Small molecule cmpds of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) reduce the activity of the enzyme&#x02019;s highly active, cancer-specific form to the level of normal PFK1 enzymes. At the same time, the metabolism in the cancer cells is reduced, and the formation of abundant NADH is suppressed. Restoring the redox balance eliminates the need for NADH reoxidation, and prevents lactate and superoxide formation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0321998.g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>PFK1 molecular modeling and small-molecule inhibitors screening</title><p>To find the drugs inhibiting highly active, cancer-specific PFK1s, the atomic model of the human PFK-P iso-enzyme was designed based on the crystal structure of the human PFK-P tetramer (UniProt Q01813) in combination with ATP&#x02013;Mg<sup>2+</sup> at a resolution of 3.1 &#x000c5; (Protein Data Bank accession number 4XYJ) [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Taxol induces PFK detachment from the cytoskeleton and has been reported to affect PFK1 activity by reducing gene expression. However, these agents act not only by reducing the transcription of genes but also by other glycolytic genes. For example, cisplatin, used for the clinical treatment of testicular, ovarian, head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer, and recurrent lymphoma, impairs transcription and replication, promoting apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, glycolytic flux in eukaryotic organisms is tightly controlled by allosteric enzymes, which maintain their regulation by feedback inhibition despite the increased activities of intermediate enzymes. Therefore, specific intervention in an irreversible, rate-limiting step of glycolysis may be more effective in reducing dysregulated glycolytic flux.</p><p>In the past, numerous attempts have been made to target enzymes to treat impaired energy metabolism, which causes lactate formation and increased ROS levels in cancer cells. The following enzymes have been most frequently targeted: Hexokinase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, mono-carboxylase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but not 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase.</p><p>Interestingly, inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) by the small molecule inhibitor FX11 led to a decrease in lactate and ATP concentration in the tumors but simultaneously caused a significant increase in ROS concentration, which triggered oxidative stress and eventually cell death [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Similar effects, namely the suppression of lactate formation and the excessive formation of ROS, have been observed with the cancer drug dichloroacetate (DCA). It could be used to treat hereditary lactic acidosis. DCA indirectly stimulates the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and diverts pyruvate from lactate formation to mitochondrial catabolism [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although some tests suggest that DCA is effective and well tolerated by patients with glioblastoma, it should be emphasized that the dysregulated glycolytic flux leaves cytosolic NADH abundance unchanged, so that ROS formation is enhanced by OXPHOS, causing oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The resulting mitochondrial overload impairs the efficiency of the antioxidant system, which cannot cope with the excessive amount of ROS. Recently, it has been shown that the lack of well-equipped machinery capable of coping with sustained oxidative phosphorylation leads to damage to the nervous system and, thus, to peripheral neuropathy [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Much research has been done in the past on 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKB3), which converts fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a potent activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As a vital regulator of glycolysis, numerous studies suggest that PFKB3 is indirectly associated with many aspects of cancer, including carcinogenesis and cancer cell proliferation. F2,6BP not only acts as a potent PFK1 activator, enabling increased glycolytic flux but also activates cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and then stimulates Cdk-mediated phosphorylation of the Cip/Kip protein p27. Mediated p27 phosphorylation, in turn, leads to a decrease in p27 levels due to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by Cdk1. Since p27 is a potent suppressor of the G1/S transition and activator of apoptosis, inhibition of PFKB3 and the concomitant decrease in F2,6BP levels could also prevent p27 degradation and, consequently, cell cycle arrest [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, the compound 3PO, a potent inhibitor of PFKB3, was found to cause a slowdown in the G2-M phase preceded by a reduction in F2,6BP levels [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although 3PO and its derivatives were initially shown to inhibit lactate formation, the more important therapeutic benefit of these inhibitors in cancer treatment appears to be their specific cytotoxicity. However, the induced cell cycle arrest makes the compound unsuitable for combination with immunotherapy.</p><p>Rather than reducing PFKB3 activities, which leads to a reduction in F2,6BP levels, partial inhibition of PFK1 activities by small molecule inhibitors appears to be the more straightforward mechanism to control dysregulated glycolytic flux in cancer cells.</p><p>However, no specific inhibitors were tested for the iso-enzymes of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), which are irreversible key enzymes of glycolysis that could act as a key factor in impaired metabolism. We were the first to report that post-translationally modified PFK1 enzymes were present in the cancer cells. While the 47&#x02009;kDa fragment was predominant in the modified PFK-M isoform [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the 70&#x02009;kDa form was characteristic of the modified PFK-L isoform [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interestingly, systemic deletions and point mutations in the C-terminus of mammalian PFK1 cells have identified two amino acid residues (Leu-767 and Glu-768) that allow allosteric inhibition by MgATP. These amino acids are located at the very end of the C-terminus of human PFK1. Leu-767 and Glu-768 are the only two residues of the C-terminus that are conserved in all mammalian isoenzymes. Furthermore, their deletion leads to a disruption of inhibition by citrate and MgATP and, thus, to a dysregulation of PFK1. These results suggest that the truncation length is irrelevant to deactivating the allosteric negative control [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, for IC<sub>50</sub> determination, similar results of lactate suppression were observed with purified shorter PFK-M enzymes (45&#x02009;kDa) and purified shorter PFK-L enzymes (70&#x02009;kDa).</p><p>Highly active, cancer-specific shorter PFK1 fragments were previously overlooked mainly because of their extreme instability under in vitro conditions. Rapid deactivation was observed during enzyme activity measurements. It appears that cleavage of the C-terminus of the holoenzyme is known to stabilize the tetrameric structure of the native enzyme, making the enzyme more susceptible to dissociation. It looks likely that the shorter fragments, which lack most of the C-terminus, can only assemble in dimeric forms [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The inactivation of PFK1 enzymes by dissociation at low protein concentrations has been previously reported and well characterized for the rat liver enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Corrupted control of glycolytic flux at the level of PFK1 in cancer cells was indirectly confirmed by other authors. Analysis of two rapidly growing cell types, human HeLa cells, and rodent AS-30D cells, showed a lack of allosteric control at the level of PFK1, which was also confirmed by kinetic analyses of the enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In experiments with PC3 cells, prostate cancer-derived cells, an overexpressed short-form, citrate-resistant PFK1 was detected. In addition, the citrate-resistant cells accumulated more mitochondrial ROS than the control cells [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Shorter cancer-specific liver-type PFK-L were described in several tumorigenic cells with overexpressed Tap73, a structural homolog of the tumor suppressor p53. By Western analysis, only shorter 70&#x02009;kDa PFK-L fragments were detected during growth under enhanced proliferation conditions to promote the Warburg effect [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>However, not only cancer cells, but also rapidly proliferating normal cells require increased nutrient uptake and catabolism to support cell growth. Therefore, increased glycolytic flux typically occurs in normal human cells. In normal, rapidly proliferating stem cells, different types of primary anabolic metabolism can be found that play a crucial role in whether a cell proliferates, differentiates, or remains quiescent [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In proliferating hematopoietic cells, for example, anabolic glycolysis is activated, which enables the simultaneous formation of lactate and ROS. In mesenchymal stem cells differentiating into adipocytes, high OXPHOS and ROS formation were found, whereas, in mesenchymal cells differentiating into osteoblasts and chondroblasts, ROS formation was blocked. In contrast, in differentiated embryonic cells, a reduced glycolytic flux prevents lactate formation, while ROS formation is possible [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>It should be emphasized that the proliferative metabolism of normal cells is tightly controlled by growth and transcription factors and other signaling mechanisms that enable the cells to differentiate into other cell types. Metabolic activities also change during the different stages of the cell cycle. A ROS-enriched environment, as found in some forms of proliferating normal cells, can trigger mutations that can lead to carcinogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It is generally believed that dysregulated glycolysis is an early event in oncogenesis that is a direct consequence of the first mutations [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, KRAS in pancreatic cancer and BRAF in melanoma occur before cell invasion in benign and early lesions [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Selected small molecule inhibitors shown to diminish cancer-specific modified forms of PFK1 may be a suitable way of reducing dysregulated glycolytic flux in cancer cells. The devastating metabolic flux typical of cancer cells can thus be controlled and reach that of non-proliferating normal cells. Most importantly, the redox balance is restored, eliminating the need to re-oxidize excessive amounts of cytosolic NADH by the simultaneous lactate and superoxide formation.</p><p>Since elevated levels of ROS are thought to trigger neoplastic signaling and equally devastating mutations, modified PFK1 inhibition could thwart the development of several pre-cancerous hallmarks, such as genome instability and mutations, dysregulated cell metabolism, maintenance of proliferation signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, facilitation of replicative immortality, and resistance to cell death.</p><p>At the same time, preventing lactate formation could preclude mechanisms involved in developing other cancer hallmarks, such as triggering angiogenesis, immune escape, tumor-promoting inflammation, and metastasis (<xref rid="pone.0321998.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0321998.g009"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0321998.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Schematic presentation of lactate and superoxide functions in cancer development.</title><p>The schematic shows the involvement of lactate and superoxide in the development of solid tumors with specific cancer characteristics. While extracellularly elevated lactate levels trigger acidosis in the tumor matrix, which leads to immune response, contributes to chronic inflammation, stimulates angiogenesis, and promotes metastasis formation, superoxide is considered a precursor of hydroxyl radicals, the most potent endogenous mutagen. The involvement of lactate (yellow) and superoxide (blue) in carcinogenesis is illustrated in the scheme previously published in &#x0201c;Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0321998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0321998.g009" position="float"/></fig><p>The accumulation of lactate and ROS is the key factor in developing solid tumors. These arguments support the hypothesis that cancer-specific, highly active modified PFK1s are the &#x0201c;key players&#x0201d; in cancer development and progression. Therefore, reduced PFK1 activity in cancer cells could prevent early development in the pre-cancerous stage and progression in the later stages of invasive cancers.</p></sec><sec id="sec028" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>PFK1 Cloning, expression, purification, and measurements.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321998.s001.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>PFK1 Enzymatic assays.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321998.s002.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table and Text</label><caption><title>Small-molecule inhibitors.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321998.s003.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Preliminary screening of selected compounds in colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321998.s004.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Preliminary screening of selected compounds in melanoma COLO 829 cells.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321998.s005.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Preliminary screening of selected compounds in breast gland adenocarcinoma MDA-MD-231 cells.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321998.s006.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s007" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Dose-dependent inhibition of lactate formation in Caco-2 cells.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321998.s007.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321998.s008" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Dose-dependent inhibition of lactate formation in Caco-2 cells &#x02013;
