However, self-stigma has equally negative psychosocial consequences for them (Shargh et al, 2015). Therefore, identifying the clinical and psychological characteristics of self-stigma in BD patients, especially in the initial stages of the disease, and developing on this basis new directions for their psychosocial rehabilitation to reduce self-stigma is relevant.</p></sec><sec id="sec1111"><title>Objectives</title><p>To identify clinical and psychological characteristics of self-stigma in BD patients, to identify targets for psychosocial rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1112"><title>Methods</title><p>&#x000ab;Questionnaire for assessing the phenomenon of self-stigmatization of mentally ill people&#x000bb; (Mikhailova et al., 2005), &#x000ab;Insight Scale for Psychosis&#x000bb; - ISP (Birchwood et al., 1994). We examined 17 patients (12 women and 5 men) with a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (F31.xxx according to ICD-10). The average age of the patients was 25.52&#x000b1;4.55 years. The duration of the disorder is 0.5-3 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec1113"><title>Results</title><p>It was shown, that patients with BD had a high level of self-stigma. Indicator &#x000ab;General level of self-stigma&#x000bb; was 1.22&#x000b1;0.73 points, that higher its average values. The main component in the structure of self-stigmatization was an overestimation of possible limitations of one&#x02019;s own internal activity and self-realization (1.96 &#x000b1; 0.87 and 1.62 &#x000b1; 0.82 points, respectively) associated with the disease. Idealization of one&#x02019;s pre-illness qualities and achievements (1.62&#x000b1;0.82 points) and the formation of misconceptions about the loss of previous opportunities will able to lead to negative personal changes and limit the activity of patients. Correlation analysis revealed significant (p&#x02264;0.01) correlations between the &#x000ab;Patient&#x02019;s ability to recognize painful phenomena as symptoms of mental illness&#x000bb; scale of the ISP scale and individual parameters of the questionnaire for assessing self-stigma: &#x000ab;Imagination of one&#x02019;s own failure due to illness&#x000bb; - r = 0, 52; &#x000ab;Fear of becoming insolvent due to illness&#x000bb; - r=0.54; &#x000ab;Idealization of the &#x000ab;healthy self&#x000bb;, r=0.51. Thus, in BD patients, self-stigma is associated with low awareness of the disease and misconceptions about it and about themselves.</p></sec><sec id="sec1114"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Psychoeducation programs, aimed at formation an adequate perception of mental disorder, the ability to recognize its symptoms, and&#x000a0;destigmatization trainings to increase the social activity are needed for BD patients. Such trainings were developed during the research and are currently being tested.</p></sec><sec id="sec1115"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
