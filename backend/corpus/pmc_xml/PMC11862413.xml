Stigma associated with mental illness is one of the most important mental health issues faced by these caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="sec6691"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our aims were to assess perceived stigma among family caregivers of patients with severe mental disorders and to identify its associated factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec6692"><title>Methods</title><p>
We conducted a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study among family caregivers of patients followed at the psychiatry outpatient clinic of the Hedi Chaker University Hospital in Sfax, during the period from February 2022 to July 2022.</p><p>A structured interview questionnaire was designed to collect socio-demographic data of both patients and their caregivers. We used the Stigma Devaluation Scale (SDS) to assess stigma.</p></sec><sec id="sec6693"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 family caregivers of severely mentally ill patients were included: 26 men and 64 women, with an average age of 50.68 &#x000b1;11.67 years.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; parents accounted for 40% of family caregivers. The majority of family caregivers (83.3%) had no more than secondary education. Married people represented 70% of cases.</p><p>The median age of patients was 42 years. Schizophrenia was the diagnosis in 68.9% of cases. The mean duration of illness was 16.23 years.</p><p>Daily assistance lasted from 4 to 8 hours in 30% of cases and more than 8 hours in 66.7% of cases.</p><p>The mean score (SDS12) for family-focused stigma was 13.12 &#x000b1; 2.34 with ranges from 8 to 18.</p><p>Perceived stigma scores were significantly higher among caregivers caring for non-married patients (p=0.04), with an age &#x0003c;50 years (p=0.04), and with a higher level of education (p=0.02).</p><p>Long duration of providing care (&#x0003e; 8 hours per day) (p=0.05) and insufficient information&#x000a0;about&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;illness (p=0.02) were significantly associated with perceived stigma.</p></sec><sec id="sec6694"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The clinicians managing patients with severe mental disorders must focus on stigma and psychological distress among the caregivers and plan intervention strategies to reduce stigma.</p></sec><sec id="sec6695"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
