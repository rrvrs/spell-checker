The KKS consists of prekallikrein (PK), high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), and coagulation factor XII (FXII) and is activated by FXII autoactivation upon exposure to negatively charged surfaces, the exact endogenous identity of which remains elusive (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). KKS activation can also involve membrane-associated prolylcarboxypeptidase or a complex of PK, HK, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) on endothelial cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>The initial generation of plasma kallikrein (PKa) promotes a rapid burst of localized KKS activation through the PKa-catalyzed conversion of FXII to its active form (FXIIa), which generates additional PKa (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). FXIIa can initiate the intrinsic coagulation pathway through the generation of FXIa, and inhibitors of FXIIa and FXIa have been proposed as novel anti-thrombotic agents, as they have the potential to be anti-thrombotic without increasing the risk of bleeding (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). PKa also cleaves HK to liberate bradykinin, a 9-amino acid peptide, and cleaved HK (HKa). Bradykinin-mediated edema occurs through the activation of the constitutively expressed B2 receptor or the inducible B1 receptor (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Endogenous KKS activation is regulated through protease inhibitors, including <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>2-macroglobulin and C1 inhibitor (C1INH) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>A genetic deficiency in C1INH leads to dysregulated KKS activation, excess bradykinin production, and the debilitating disease of hereditary angioedema due to C1INH deficiency (HAE-C1INH) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). HAE-C1INH is an autosomal dominant disease manifesting as intermittent edematous attacks at locations that include the gastrointestinal tract, facial tissue, the upper airway, oropharynx, urogenital region, and/or extremities. Patients with HAE-C1INH type I have mutations in the <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene that lead to a deficiency in the total amount of C1INH protein, whereas HAE-C1INH type II patients have a dysfunctional C1INH (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The role of excess KKS activation in HAE-C1INH pathophysiology has been validated by the approval of therapies that include C1INH protein replacement products, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (icatibant), and PKa inhibitors (ecallantide, lanadelumab, and berotralstat).</p><p>HKa has previously been shown to be a disease state biomarker of KKS activation and is elevated in plasma from HAE-C1INH patients and other disease states (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We describe the development of a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to specifically detect HKa in human plasma and demonstrate the utility of the assay in comparing the <italic>in vitro</italic> potency of PKa inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>HK, HKa, PKa, FXII, and FXIIa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN, USA). Low-molecular-weight kininogen (LK) was procured from Athens Research (Athens, GA, USA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies 11H05 and 13B12 were generated at BBI Solutions (Portland, ME, USA) following immunization with human HKa. PK-deficient and FXII-deficient plasma were obtained from George King Biomedical (Overland Park, KS, USA) using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. HK-deficient human plasma using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant was obtained from Affinity Biologicals (Ancaster, ON, Canada). SCAT169 plastic evacuated blood collection tubes (5&#x02005;ml volume) were prepared by Prolytix (Essex Junction, VT, USA) and contained 0.5&#x02005;ml of a 10&#x000d7; concentrated mixture [100&#x02005;mM benzamidine, 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/ml polybrene, 2&#x02005;mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20&#x02005;mM EDTA, 263&#x02005;&#x000b5;M leupeptin, and 20&#x02005;mM 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) dissolved in acid citrate dextrose (100&#x02005;mM sodium citrate, 67&#x02005;mM citric acid, and 2% dextrose, pH 4.5)]. P100 Blood Collection System tubes were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Normal human plasma, collected with sodium citrate, SCAT169, or P100 tubes, was obtained from BioIVT (Westbury, NY, USA). Ellagic acid was obtained as a 0.003% solution (Pacific Hemostasis APTT-XL reagent) from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2</label><title>Plasma collection</title><p>Plasma was collected from healthy volunteers (HVs) or patients with HAE-C1INH with approval by the institutional review boards or ethics committees of the participating institutions (see Acknowledgments). Plasma was collected from HAE-C1INH patients at baseline (e.g., not during an attack) or within 6&#x02005;h of the onset of an angioedema attack. HAE-C1INH plasma was collected and analyzed before the availability of recently approved prophylactic therapies (e.g., lanadelumab, berotralstat, or subcutaneous C1INH). All healthy volunteers and patients provided written informed consent to use the blood for the investigation of exploratory biomarkers of KKS activation. To minimize the <italic>ex vivo</italic> activation of the KKS during blood collection, plasma was collected from subjects with HAE-C1INH and healthy controls by means of a clean venipuncture with a butterfly needle/catheter kit (BD Biosciences, #367296). The first tube of blood was discarded, and blood was collected into polypropylene-evacuated tubes containing either 3.2% sodium citrate (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) or a protease inhibitor/anticoagulant mixture (SCAT169 or P100 tubes). Blood samples were centrifuged within 1&#x02005;h, and plasma was aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><label>2.3</label><title>Phage display</title><p>Antibodies specific for HKa were discovered using a human antibody phage display library (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) by first performing a negative selection of the library with an input of approximately 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>12</sup> phage against biotinylated HK that was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads&#x02122; M-280, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The depleted library was then incubated with biotinylated HKa immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The beads were extensively washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer and used to infect <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for phage output amplification to complete a round of selection. Three rounds of selection were performed before screening individual phage colonies using an ELISA with biotinylated HK and HKa immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 antibody and absorbance detection through substrate hydrolysis of 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Recombinant fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragments were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified by protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Recombinant immunoglobulin G (IgG1) human anti-HKa antibodies were transiently expressed in 293T cells and purified by protein A Sepharose chromatography. Fab specificity was determined by coating 96-well or 384-well plates with each purified Fab and measuring the binding to biotinylated HK, biotinylated HKa, or biotinylated LK.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2.4</label><title>Western blot</title><p>Plasma was analyzed by a western blot assay (WBA) after activation with various agents (e.g., ellagic acid, FXIIa, or PKa) or after the addition of a 1/10th volume of the 10&#x000d7; SCAT169 cocktail upon thawing of frozen plasma (45&#x02005;&#x000b5;l) and diluted (1:20) in Tris-buffered saline. Samples were further diluted in NuPAGE&#x000ae; Sample Buffer (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 50&#x02005;mM of dithiothreitol and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a precast 4%&#x02013;12% acrylamide gradient gel and the 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer system (Life Technologies Corporation). Protein was transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot&#x000ae; system (Life Technologies Corporation). Membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 1&#x02005;h at room temperature (RT) with a mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the light chain of HK (Clone 11H05) diluted to 1&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/ml in Odyssey blocking buffer. Goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye 680 was prepared at a 1:15,000 dilution (LI-COR Biosciences) and the membrane was incubated for 1&#x02005;h at RT. After a PBS wash, membranes were analyzed using a LI-COR Odyssey CLx (LI-COR Biosciences). The percentage of HKa was calculated from the fluorescent intensities of bands attributed to the cleaved light chain of HKa compared with total HK in each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><label>2.5</label><title>HKa ELISA</title><p>For the initial ELISA, the Fab version of the HKa-specific antibody (M4-B4 Fab) was coated on 96-well plates (Costar, #9018) overnight in PBS before being washed and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) buffer. Samples, standards, and quality controls were diluted in LowCross-Buffer (Boca Scientific, Boca Raton, FL, USA) and added to the plate. After an incubation and wash, plate-bound HKa was detected by adding HRP-labeled sheep anti-HK polyclonal antibody (Affinity Biologicals, Ancaster, ON, Canada). After incubation with the detection antibody, the plate was washed, TMB substrate was added, the incubation was stopped with phosphoric acid, and the optical density was measured at 450&#x02005;nm with subtraction at 630&#x02005;nm. Further ELISA optimization involved coating the M4-B4 Fab or IgG on Nunc MaxiSorp plates overnight in PBS, before washing and blocking with BSA (protease/IgG-free) buffer. Samples, standards, and quality controls diluted in 0.1% BSA buffer were added to the plate and, after a subsequent incubation, plate-bound HKa was detected by adding mouse anti-HK monoclonal antibodies (either pooled 11H05 and 13B12 or just 11H05), which were selected based on their ability to form a sandwich pair with the M4-B4. The plate was washed and a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG HRP was added to the plate, followed by TMB substrate, stopping with phosphoric acid, and OD measurement at 450&#x02005;nm with subtraction at 630&#x02005;nm.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><label>2.6</label><title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> KKS activation assay in minimally diluted plasma</title><p>To assess the inhibition potency of PKa inhibitors, 2.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;l of serially diluted inhibitors (synthetic compounds were diluted in DMSO and biologics were diluted in PBS) were dispensed into 96-well PCR plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AB0600) followed by the addition of 45&#x02005;&#x000b5;l of sodium citrate plasma (pooled from three donors).

As target immobilization could mask epitope(s) present in HKa as opposed to HK, and as the goal was to develop an ELISA to detect soluble HKa in plasma, subsequent screening was performed using purified Fabs immobilized on 384-well or 96-well plates with the detection of either biotinylated HK, LK, or HKa binding via streptavidin-HRP.

The specificity of M4-B4 suggests that the antibody binds a neo-epitope(s) on HKa not present on HK or LK that is dependent on PKa or KLK1 activity. HK is a 626 amino acid glycoprotein that consists of six domains, and PKa or KLK1 cleave within domain four to release bradykinin or Lys-bradykinin, respectively, and generate HKa, which consists of two polypeptide chains linked by a disulfide (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). HKa has bioactivities (e.g., induction of endothelial cell apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis) not exhibited by HK (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which is consistent with HKa having a distinct conformation from HK that is recognized by M4-B4. The increased binding affinity of M4-B4 for HKa in the presence of zinc suggests that the epitope may be near, or influenced by, the zinc-binding site on domain five of the light chain, which mediates the assembly of the KKS on cell surface receptors (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>The importance of plasma collection methods and stabilization against proteolytic degradation has been described previously for the analysis of KKS activation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

Consequently, plasma obtained in this study relied on a blood collection protocol to minimize <italic>ex vivo</italic> KKS activation. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> KKS activation can be further minimized using an anticoagulant mixture that includes protease inhibitors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In this study, <italic>ex vivo</italic> KKS activation, as measured by the concentration of HKa, was higher in citrated plasma from HVs and HAE-C1INH patients than in plasma collected in blood collection tubes that contained protease inhibitors (SCAT169 or P100 tubes).</p><p>The amount of HKa in citrated plasma by WBA during HAE-C1INH attacks was approximately 61.5% (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which is similar to previous estimates (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). An HKa ELISA in SCAT169 may provide estimates of the amount of HKa generated during an HAE-C1INH attack (4.4% or 32.7&#x02005;nM), in basal HAE-C1INH conditions (2.2% or 16.2&#x02005;nM), or in healthy controls (0.5% or 3.4&#x02005;nM) (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). HKa concentrations should match the concentration of bradykinin generated during an attack, and the following evidence indicates that an approximately equivalent amount of PKa is generated during an HAE-C1INH attack: (1) the concentration of covalent PKa-&#x003b1;-macroglobulin complex (30&#x02013;110 nM) during an attack (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and (2) PKa estimates calculated from the extent of PK consumption during an attack (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and (3) from the maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;83&#x02005;nM) of ecallantide, which is a PKa inhibitor approved for treating an HAE-C1INH attack (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Comparable concentrations of PKa and HKa suggest that when the KKS is activated at angioedema attack locations, the generated PKa cleaves HK with approximately equimolar stoichiometry (i.e., single turnover catalytic conditions).</p><p>Therefore, KKS activation occurring <italic>in vivo</italic> during an HAE-C1INH attack involves approximately equal concentrations of PKa protease and HK natural protein substrate and are expected to undergo fewer catalytic turnovers than <italic>in vitro</italic> reactions using a high concentrations of a synthetic peptide PKa substrate (e.g., 100 &#x003bc;M) that is at least 1000-fold higher than the concentration of PKa in undiluted activated plasma (&#x0223c;100 nM) or in purified protein assays (&#x0223c;1 nM). The higher catalytic turnovers expected with synthetic peptide substrates may contribute to the higher observed potency of certain reported PKa inhibitors measured using a fluorogenic synthetic peptide in minimally diluted plasma activated with FXIIa than with our HKa ELISA (see <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Furthermore, the use of 90% plasma in our HKa ELISA, as opposed to higher dilutions of plasma, may better predict endogenous PKa inhibition as the effects of interfering substances in the plasma (e.g., plasma protein binding) can be minimized at higher plasma dilutions and thereby artifactually increase the observed potency. The use of different KKS activators may also contribute to different observed potencies for PKa inhibitors; ellagic acid or dextran sulfate activates through inducing FXII autoactivation, the kinetics of which are not as immediate as directly adding FXIIa (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Therefore, KKS activation induced by FXIIa addition may be expected to generate PKa more rapidly than other reported activators and thereby require higher inhibitor concentrations than KKS activators that act via FXII autoactivation. Consequently, our HKa ELISA may be a useful <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for helping to predict <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy for PKa inhibitors in development for HAE-C1INH and other indications potentially mediated by PKa, such as bradykinin-mediated angioedema (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), diabetic macular edema (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), ischemic stroke (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), myocardial infarction (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), cancer (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and sepsis (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the investigators who provided plasma samples from HAE-C1INH patients.
