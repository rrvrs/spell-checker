While CST was previously shown to function in double-strand break repair and promote replication restart, it is currently unclear whether it has specialized roles in other DNA repair pathways. Proper and efficient repair of DNA is critical to protecting genome integrity. Telomeres and other G-rich regions are strongly predisposed to oxidative DNA damage in the form of 8-oxoguanines, which are typically repaired by the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Moreover, recent studies suggest that CST functions in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Therefore, we tested whether CST interacts with and regulates BER protein activity. Here, we show that CST robustly stimulates proteins involved in BER, including OGG1, Pol &#x003b2;, APE1, and LIGI, on both telomeric and non-telomeric DNA substrates. Biochemical reconstitution of the pathway indicates that CST stimulates BER. Finally, knockout of STN1 or CTC1 leads to increased levels of 8-oxoguanine, suggesting defective BER in the absence of CST. Combined, our results define an undiscovered function of CST in BER, where it acts as a stimulatory factor to promote efficient genome-wide oxidative repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CST complex</kwd><kwd>oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>base excision repair (BER)</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an unintended consequence of cellular metabolism, which triggers progressive oxidative damage to the genome and, ultimately cell death. Efficient repair of the damage, generated by ROS, is crucial to prevent mutagenesis and maintain genome stability. Guanine bases are particularly prone to oxidative damage due to having a low redox potential. Therefore, G-rich regions, such as telomeres and CpG islands, are especially prone to oxidative damage in the form of 8-dihydro-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanine (8-oxoG). 8-oxoG is the most common DNA lesion, and estimates are that 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> spontaneous 8-oxoGs are formed in the genome each day due to normal metabolic processes.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">Exposure to harmful ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, inflammation, and environmental pollutants, such as chemical carcinogens and tobacco smoke, can significantly compound the volume of ROS and, thus, 8-oxoGs produced in the cell.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> When 8-oxoGs are not repaired, they are highly mutagenic and can lead to the development of cancer and other aging disorders. Furthermore, high amounts of oxidative stress can accelerate the rate of telomere shortening, which can contribute to telomere biology disorders.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> High amounts of oxidative damage at telomeres are also linked to the onset of diabetes<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and cancer.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">Consequently, it is imperative that oxidative lesions are correctly repaired. The most significant pathway used to repair single base lesions is base excision repair (BER).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> BER is initiated through the action of DNA glycosylases, which locate and remove oxidized, deaminated, or other inappropriate bases.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Amongst the various oxidized lesions, generation of 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-G) is the most frequently occurring one.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This lesion is recognized by 8-oxo-guanine glycosylase (OGG1), that binds the lesion and cleaves the N-glycosidic bond, releasing the damaged base and generating an abasic site. It can further catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond generating a 5&#x02032;phosphate (5&#x02032;P) and 3&#x02032; &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-polyunsaturated aldehyde (3&#x02032;PUA) end, which is processed in the next step.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Abasic sites generated by DNA glycosylases is cleaved by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) to form a single-strand nick, containing a 3&#x02032;hydroxyl (3&#x02032;OH) and 5deoxyribose phosphate end (5&#x02032;dRP), that can then be repaired via DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;) through one of two pathways: short patch BER [SP-BER] (in which a single nucleotide gets replaced)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> or long patch BER [LP-BER] (in which approximately 2&#x02013;13 nucleotides are replaced).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Typically, the LP-BER pathway is employed when the 5&#x02032;dRP moiety is either oxidized or reduced, thereby inhibiting the lyase activity of Pol &#x003b2;. The polymerase then performs strand displacement synthesis to create a displaced flap which is cleaved by flap endonuclease (FEN1) to remove the modified 5&#x02032;dRP moiety.</p><p id="P5">While the basic mechanisms of BER have been characterized, whether additional accessory factors are required in response to different DNA structures/sequences and chromatin environments is still not well understood. For example, the shelterin complex, a six-membered protein complex essential for telomere protection, has been implicated in stimulating the BER pathway <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> several mechanisms including the stimulation of Pol &#x003b2;.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Here, we tested whether another telomere-associated complex, CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST), also stimulates BER. CST is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, which shares structural similarity to Replication Protein A (RPA).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> It primarily functions in the replication and maintenance of telomeres, where it coordinates telomere duplex replication and telomerase-dependent telomere elongation.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> CST also functions in various aspects of DNA replication and repair, including origin licensing, the rescue of stalled replication, and double-strand break repair.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Mutations in CST are associated with the telomere biology disorders dyskeratosis congenita, Coats plus, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as well as increased risk of various cancers.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Previous work demonstrated that CST has preference for binding to G-rich DNA, such as telomeres and CpG islands, and can resolve DNA secondary structures called G-quadruplexes (G4s).<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Similar to RPA, CST can recruit and/or enhance the enzymatic activity of several proteins to promote various DNA maintenance pathways, including telomere replication, DNA replication restart, and double-strand break repair. A well-known function of CST is its ability to interact with and stimulate the activity of DNA polymerase &#x003b1;-primase (Pol &#x003b1;).<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Recent findings from two independent groups identified links between defective oxidative DNA repair and CST deficiency, suggesting a potential function of CST in the repair of oxidative DNA damage.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Work by Nguyen et al. demonstrated that conditional deletion of STN1 increased the levels of oxidative DNA damage and resulted in increased tumor incidence and burden in a colorectal mouse model. Furthermore, another study by Hara et al., investigating the effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in STN1 depleted cells, showed that cells lacking CST are particularly sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced DNA damage, leading to defective RAD51 foci formation and S-phase progression. These findings suggest CST may participate in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, potentially through the modulation of BER. However, how CST functions in this process remains poorly defined. Therefore, we sought to directly test the extent to which CST promotes BER <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> as well as determine whether CST associates with BER factors in cells. Since CST stimulates Pol &#x003b1;, we postulated that CST may also interact with and regulate the activity the BER polymerase Pol &#x003b2;.</p><p id="P7">Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that CST interacts with Pol &#x003b2; and stimulates its various activities <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, we tested the individual components of the BER pathway and found that the CST complex interacts with other BER components and stimulates multiple steps in the repair process on both telomere and non-telomere substrates. Biochemical reconstitution of the entire long patch BER pathway demonstrated that CST greatly stimulates BER <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. In line with these findings, deletion of STN1 or CTC1 increased genomic 8-oxo-Gs, indicating a defect in BER. Overall, our findings strongly support a role for CST in the repair of oxidative DNA damage through stimulation of BER.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>STN1 interacts with BER components</title><p id="P8">Pol &#x003b2; plays a crucial role in maintaining fidelity of the genome through its function in BER, where it synthesizes new bases to replace those that were damaged.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Since CST is known to interact with and stimulate pol &#x003b1;, we performed proximity ligation assay (PLA)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> with antibodies to endogenous STN1 and Pol &#x003b2;. In comparison to single antibody controls, we observed an increase in the number of PLA foci with antibodies to STN1 and Pol &#x003b2; (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Next, we treated cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to determine whether oxidative stress increased the association between CST and Pol &#x003b2;. Treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> led to an approximate 2-fold increase in PLA foci, suggesting that their interaction is linked to oxidative stress and potentially BER (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Since the primary role of Pol &#x003b2; is in BER, we hypothesized that CST interacts or associates with other BER components, so we next tested whether OGG1 and STN1 interact by PLA and observed a strong interaction between OGG1 and STN1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). PLA was then performed with antibodies to other factors that function in BER, including PARP1 and XRCC1. Like Pol &#x003b2; and OGG1, STN1 associated with PARP1 and XRCC1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). As a control, we also performed PLA for Pol &#x003b2;-XRCC1, which showed a strong interaction as expected (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To further validate the PLA data, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments to explore whether individual components of the CST complex interacted with BER-associated proteins. Individual components of the CST complex (Flag-CTC1, Myc-STN1, or Flag-TEN1) were overexpressed in HEK293T cells for 24 h. Cells were then either left untreated or treated with 200 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 h prior to performing immunoprecipitation assays. Since it was previously reported that CST plays a role in oxidative damage, we were interested in observing if interactions between CST components occurred in undamaged cells or if they only occurred in the presence of oxidative damage (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment). To ensure that interaction was not mediated by DNA, lyastes were treated with benzonase prior to Co-IP. Individual BER proteins (OGG1, APE1, Pol &#x003b2;, FEN1 and LigI) were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with either anti-Flag (to detect CTC1 or TEN1) or anti-Myc (to detect STN1) antibody (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, CST subunits showed varied interaction with different BER proteins. STN1 showed a strong interaction with OGG1 in both the presence and absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas CTC1 showed an extremely weak interaction in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and TEN1 showed no detectable interaction (lanes 4&#x02013;5, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). CTC1 and STN1 interacted with APE1 in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but no interactions were observed with TEN1 (lanes 6&#x02013;7, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). All three subunits (CTC1, STN1 and TEN1) interacted with Pol &#x003b2;, with STN1 showing interactions even in the absence of oxidative damage (lanes 8&#x02013;9, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). CTC1 and STN1 interacted with FEN1 in the presence or absence of oxidative damage, albeit CTC1 showed greater interaction compared to STN1. TEN1 showed no interaction with FEN1 (lanes 10&#x02013;11, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). CTC1 and TEN1 components also showed interacted with LigI in the presence of oxidative damage, with TEN1 showing the highest binding efficiency and both CTC1 displaying a weak interaction (lanes 12&#x02013;13, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Together, these findings suggest that the CST components interact with various proteins in the BER pathway, strongly suggesting a potential function of CST in BER.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CST enhances multiple steps in BER in vitro</title><p id="P11">To better understand how CST may promote BER, we sought to characterize how CST and individual CST components affected the different steps of BER through biochemical reconstitution, using purified proteins and DNA substrates that resemble the different intermediates of both SP- and LP-BER. We first confirmed that our purified CST was active by observing DNA binding on a ssDNA oligonucleotide (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). Consistent with previous studies,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> individual subunits showed weak to undetectable binding in comparison to the full CST complex (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>). Since our PLA results suggested that within the cell, some components on the CST complex were in a complex with BER proteins, we next tested to see if the recombinant proteins used in our biochemical assays interact with each other. For the binding assays, we incubated the CST complex with individual components of the BER pathway (OGG1, APE1, Pol &#x003b2;, FEN1 and LigI) in a 1:1 ratio for 2 h and subsequently incubated the binding reactions on Flag beads for 4 h to pulldown Flag-CTC1. Interactions between CST and the BER proteins were probed by assaying the input (I), flowthrough (F) and eluate (E) using an anti-His antibody (since all BER recombinant proteins are 6X-His tagged). Results showed that all BER proteins interacted with the CST complex (eluate lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). However, we also observed bands in the flowthrough fractions (F) suggesting that not all BER proteins bound to the CST complex in a 1:1 ratio (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>).</p><sec id="S5"><title>CST stimulates OGG1 cleavage.</title><p id="P12">OGG1 is a glycosylase that recognizes oxidized guanines and removes the lesion to create an abasic site.

Removal of the 8-oxo-G lesion and cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone were analyzed on a denaturing gel (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and fold change in activity calculated. Removal of lesion and cleavage activity of OGG1 was increased by 3.1-fold in the presence of CTC1, 4.3-fold in the presence of STN1 and 5.9-fold in the presence of the full CST complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The presence of TEN1 did not improve OGG1 activity, which was not surprising, since TEN1 did not seem to interact with OGG1 in the Co-IP assay, whereas STN1 showed strong and CTC1 weak interaction with OGG1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CST stimulates APE1 cleavage.</title><p id="P13">During BER, APE1 cleaves the abasic site generated after a DNA glycosylase removes the oxidized or damaged base.

As mentioned previously, 8-oxoG is the most common form of oxidative base damage and is highly mutagenic. Accordingly, we tested whether cells lacking STN1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>) had increased levels of 8-oxoG. HeLa STN1 KO cells were treated with increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50, 100 or 200 &#x003bc;M) for 1 h. Cells were then washed and released into fresh media for 4 h prior to collection. Genomic DNA was then extracted and 8-oxoG content measured (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). Intriguingly, even in the absence of exogenous oxidative stress, 8-oxoG levels in STN1 KO cells were approximately double that of the parental cells, indicating that CST aids in oxidative repair even in unstressed cells. Following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, there was also a corresponding increase in the percentage of 8-oxoGs (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To confirm our findings, we tested whether removal of CTC1 also increased the levels of 8-oxoG in a previously characterized HCT116 CTC1 KO cell line.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> While CTC1 loss significantly increased 8-oxoGs at higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 or 200 &#x003bc;M), its overall effect was much lower than STN1 loss. This may be due to differences in parental cell lines (i.e., STN1 KO &#x02013; HeLa, CTC1 KO &#x02013; HCT116). However, Western blot analysis of the cell lines revealed that, following STN1 KO, CTC1 and TEN1 levels are greatly diminished, while CTC1 KO did not affect the levels of STN1 or TEN1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>).

Finally, an assessment of cellular 8-oxoG levels indicate that CST is needed to prevent the accumulation of basal endogenous and exogenous oxidative DNA damage.

Considering that Pol &#x003b2; is the chief polymerase responsible for nucleotide synthesis during BER, our observed biochemical stimulation of Pol &#x003b2; by CST provides compelling evidence that CST stimulates Pol &#x003b2; to promote BER. This agrees with past work indicating that human CST acts as a stimulatory factor for Pol &#x003b1;.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> It is also interesting to note that individual CST subunits still stimulated Pol &#x003b2; (although to differing degrees), which suggests multiple contact points between CST and Pol &#x003b2;. This is in line with a recent structure of the CST-Pol &#x003b1; complex, which found interactions sites between all three subunits of CST and Pol &#x003b1; with the N-terminus of STN1 and TEN1 interacting with the primase domain and CTC1 and the C-terminus of STN1 interacting with the polymerase domain.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p><p id="P28">Moreover, we note that CST interacted with and stimulated the enzymatic activities of other proteins in the pathway, including OGG1, APE1, FEN1, and LIG1. Therefore, CST may function more generally to stimulate the entire process. Initial characterization of mammalian CST focused on its ability to interact with and stimulate Pol &#x003b1;, a function conserved across eukaryotes.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> However, more recent work has shown that CST can also stimulate the activities of RAD51 and MRE11.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> These interactions are proposed to facilitate the rescue of stalled replication forks. Thus, CST likely acts at several points to facilitate or stimulate this process.

This correlates with the diminished levels of CTC1 and TEN1 in the STN1 KO cells, which appears as an almost complete loss of CST from these cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). In contrast, CTC1 KO did not alter STN1 and TEN1 levels. This is not surprising given that STN1 bridges the interaction between CTC1 and TEN1 and expression of STN1 was previously reported to stabilize CTC1.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> However, this may provide some insight into how CST promotes BER. Our biochemical analysis revealed that the full CST complex can stimulate all steps of LP-BER <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, except for FEN1 activity, with the greatest effect on OGG1 and Pol &#x003b2; polymerase and lyase activities. Thus, in cases where CST is required for BER, its loss is predicted to have an immediate impact the recognition/removal of the oxidized base through the stimulation of OGG1. This is consistent with an overall loss of CST in the STN1 KO cells leading to increased 8-oxoGs even in the absence of exogenous oxidative damage. In contrast, removal of CTC1 causes only a minor increase in 8-oxoGs after exogenous oxidative DNA damage. Based on our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> data, STN1 strongly interacts with OGG1 and stimulates its activity as well as Pol &#x003b2; polymerase and lyase activities. Accordingly, BER may still proceed in the absence of CTC1 until 8-oxoGs reach levels that require the assistance of the full CST complex. Whether CST subcomplexes form in the cell is still currently unclear but it is likely that STN1-TEN1 can function in the absence of CTC1 similar to their yeast counterparts.<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p><p id="P30">While further work will be required to determine the timing and mechanism of CST localization to oxidative DNA damage, we speculate that CST acts to localize or recruit BER factors to G-rich regions of the genome, such as telomeres and CpG islands, where oxidative DNA damage is common and CST is known to localize and bind.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> At these sites, CST could help to resolve G4s, which may affect the efficiency of 8-oxoG repair in this structural motif.<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> The presence of G4s may make it difficult for BER-associated proteins to optimally function, as has been observed for other proteins. For example, it has been shown that DNA Pol &#x003b4; synthesis is severely impeded by the presence of G4s.<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> Given that CST binds to G-rich telomeric sequences and can resolve G4 structures, CST is well-equipped to promote oxidative repair in G-rich DNA. It is important, however, to note that the stimulatory effects of CST on individual BER-associated proteins and full reconstitution of LP-BER was similar on both telomere and non-telomere substrates. Therefore, CST may function more generally in BER across the genome. A recent study by Hara et al. also demonstrated that STN1 depletion results defective S-phase progression following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and affected RAD51 loading.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Thus, it is possible that the increase in 8-oxoGs observed relates to CST&#x02019;s ability to load RAD51 at stalled replication forks. However, our biochemical work demonstrates a direct interaction and stimulation of BER and RAD51 does not appear to have a major role in BER, arguing against an indirect affect from replication fork stalling. Nevertheless, future work to tease out the diverse roles of CST in genome maintenance and sites of localization following different types of DNA damage will be important to fully understand CST&#x02019;s role in BER as well as other repair pathways.</p><p id="P31">Overall, our biochemical results have identified previously unknown interactions between CST and BER-associated proteins and provide an important foundation for future studies seeking to understand how oxidative damaged DNA is repaired to maintain genome integrity and prevent disease.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p id="P32">Recombinant human Pol &#x003b2;,<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> FEN1,<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> APE1,<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> and LIG1,<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> were purified as described previously.
