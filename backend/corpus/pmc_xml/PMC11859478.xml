Introduction</title><p>Aging represents a complex biological phenomenon marked by progressive cellular dysfunction and heightened susceptibility to a variety of diseases. This decline is particularly evident in the skin, a vital organ that not only acts as a protective barrier but also undergoes significant age-related changes [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The skin aging processes are determined both by chronological aging, which affects the entire body, and by foreign factors to which the skin is subjected, i.e., UV radiation, chemicals, pollution, etc. [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Key among these age-related skin changes are increased oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, which can detrimentally alter skin structure and function and contribute to a higher incidence of skin disorders, including dermatitis and skin cancers. The interaction between oxidative stress and inflammation represents an area of growing interest in scientific research, as it highlights how these two phenomena are interconnected and contribute to the onset of numerous age-related disorders. This synergistic link creates a vicious cycle, in which the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cellular and tissue damage, which, in turn, activates inflammatory responses that may further exacerbate oxidative stress. Therefore, it is urgent to promote practical and effective interventions capable of significantly altering the course of these conditions [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress arises when there is an imbalance between the generation of ROS and the cellular antioxidative defenses. Free radicals, produced as byproducts of normal metabolic processes, can be exacerbated by environmental factors such as pollution and UV radiation [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The accumulation of ROS can result in damage to critical cellular structures, i.e., DNA, proteins, and lipids, disrupting homeostasis and compromising cellular function. As such, elucidating strategies to counteract and prevent oxidative stress is crucial for maintaining skin health and mitigating the repercussions associated with the skin aging process [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A pivotal regulator of the cellular response to oxidative stress is nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The Nrf2 signaling system has emerged as perhaps the most important cellular defense and survival pathway against oxidative stress and toxicants. Disruption of Nrf2 signaling is associated with an increased susceptibility to oxidative insults [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nrf2 modulates the expression of a multitude of genes that play essential roles in antioxidative defense. Under physiological conditions, Nrf2 is kept at low levels through proteasomal degradation; however, oxidative stress prompts its translocation to the nucleus, where it engages antioxidative response elements (ARE) to activate protective genes. A particularly important player in this process is heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), whose expression is induced by Nrf2 and which contributes to cellular detoxification and redox homeostasis. Furthermore, the activation of Nrf2 involves intricate signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, indicative of a multifaceted cellular response to oxidative stimuli [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Antioxidants are protective molecules against ROS toxicity; while cells produce antioxidative enzymes and metabolites, to neutralize ROS, numerous natural compounds from various sources also play a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. For this reason, the quest for natural compounds with notable antioxidative potential has led to the identification of various plant species rich in bioactive metabolites, such as carotenoids, polyphenols, and essential oils. These secondary plant metabolites possess diverse therapeutic properties, primarily attributed to their antioxidative activities, which play a crucial role in mitigating oxidative stress and its associated detrimental effects [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Among these bioactive compounds, oleanolic acid (OA), a natural triterpenoid, has garnered substantial interest in pharmacological research due to its presence in multiple medicinal plants, including <italic toggle="yes">Olea europaea</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Viscum album</italic> L. [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. OA is widely recognized for its potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Our previous studies have highlighted a significant anti-inflammatory role for OA in murine macrophage cell models [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], as well as its antiglycation activity in vitro [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], thereby underscoring its healing potential in various inflammation- and glycation-related diseases. It is well-known that the aging process, which is influenced by both physiological factors and external agents, is marked by an inflammatory response, along with the glycation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, which contributes to the deterioration of skin health [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The already recognized properties of OA position it as a promising candidate for addressing the oxidative stress effects associated with aging, particularly regarding skin health. In light of these considerations, this study aims to deepen the understanding of the potential cytoprotective effects of OA on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells in the context of oxidative stress induced by the pro-oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP). HaCaT cells serve as a well-established model for investigating epidermal homeostasis and the mechanisms underlying skin pathophysiology [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Existing literature indicates that tBHP can induce oxidative damage to keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide, an organic peroxide that acts as pro-oxidant, undergoes metabolic conversion in cells via cytochrome P450, leading to the generation of peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals or its detoxification to tert-butanol, both of which contribute to the rapid oxidation and depletion of cellular glutathione. Such pathways are associated with oxidative injury to cells, establishing tBHP as a dependable model for simulating oxidative stress that parallels the damaging effects of environmental stressors, including UV radiation [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Our research aims to analyze intracellular ROS production and to examine the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), with a particular focus on nitric oxide (NO) production levels. Such analyses are fundamental for understanding the cellular mechanisms and possible signaling pathways through which OA exerts its protective actions. The data obtained from this study hold significant importance and could provide insights for further research aimed at preventing and mitigating oxidative damage, thereby contributing to improved skin health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-18-00238"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmaceuticals-18-00238"><title>2.1. The Impact of Oleanolic Acid (OA) on Viability and Oxidative Stress in HaCaT Cells</title><p>In the present study, the effect of different concentrations of OA was analyzed in HaCaT cells using an MTT assay to evaluate mitochondrial activity as a measure of cell viability. OA exerted a dose-dependent effect at the tested concentrations, ranging from 0 to 10 &#x000b5;g mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, in accordance with previous results reported in the literature [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Based on the outcomes obtained, subsequent experiments were performed using the lowest non-toxic concentration for the cells (1.25 &#x000b5;g mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> OA) in order to ensure an optimal cellular environment and to minimize potential adverse effects.</p><p>To simulate an exogenous oxidative insult, HaCaT cells were exposed to the pro-oxidative action of tBHP. The exposure of HaCaT cells to tBHP showed a significant negative impact on cell viability. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, treatment with tBHP (200 &#x000b5;M) resulted in a reduction in cell viability of approximately 30% (73 &#x000b1; 4%) compared with untreated control cells (CTRL). However, cell pre-treatment with OA (1.25 &#x000b5;g mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) showed a significant protective effect. In particular, OA pre-treated cells exposed to tBHP exhibited a limited reduction in cell viability of only 12% (88 &#x000b1; 6%) compared with CTRL, indicating effective protection by OA against the toxicity induced by the pro-oxidative factor. This defensive mechanism induced by OA was further highlighted by intracellular ROS detection. Indeed, treatment with tBHP caused a significant increase in intracellular ROS, with a variation of 50% (152 &#x000b1; 18%) compared with CTRL. However, OA cell pre-treatment prevented this increase, maintaining comparable intracellular ROS levels to those of untreated control cells, even in the presence of tBHP.</p><p>These results suggest that OA pre-treatment triggers an effective protective mechanism against tBHP-induced toxicity in HaCaT cells, mitigating both the reduction in cell viability and the increase in intracellular ROS levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmaceuticals-18-00238"><title>2.2. The Role of OA in the Expression of iNOS and NO Release</title><p>In the skin, the NO derived from the inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS) plays a crucial role in the inflammatory process. Aberrant iNOS activity and NO production in response to inflammatory signals or cellular stress have been implicated in several skin pathologies [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Western blotting analysis of the inducible isoform of NOS expression in HaCaT cells exposed to the pro-oxidant tBHP revealed a significant increase (222 &#x000b1; 31%) in iNOS levels compared with control cells (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), confirming what has already been suggested in the literature about the activation of inflammatory responses or cellular stress under exposure conditions. Consequently, the pro-oxidative activity of tBHP led to a significant increase in NO synthesis (952 &#x000b1; 224%), as assessed by the Griess test (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>An interesting aspect that emerged from this research is the protective role of OA. Indeed, OA-pretreatment was able to prevent the increase in iNOS expression levels induced by tBHP. In fact, the levels of iNOS in HaCaT cells pre-treated with OA and subsequently exposed to tBHP were comparable to those of untreated control cells, indicating that OA pre-treatment effectively inhibits the activation of iNOS expression (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). This preventive effect of OA on iNOS expression levels translated into reduced synthesis and, therefore, limited release of NO into the culture medium. Indeed, cells pre-treated with OA before exposure to tBHP showed a significant reduction in NO levels, amounting to only 283 &#x000b1; 109% compared with cells exposed to the pro-oxidative factor alone (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). These results suggest a significant modulation of iNOS activity by OA, highlighting a potential protective effect against oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmaceuticals-18-00238"><title>2.3. The Role of OA in Modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway</title><p>The nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase (HO-1) signaling pathway is an essential signaling pathway in the oxidative stress response [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, Nrf2 levels are generally low, but in response to pro-oxidative stimuli, they increase and translocate to the nucleus, activating the expression of over 200 protective genes against oxidative stress, including HO-1 [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Given the cytoprotective action of OA cellular pre-treatment against the oxidative effect of tBHP, the involvement of the Nrf2 signaling pathway was investigated. Data were obtained by Western blot analysis and super-resolution confocal microscopy. Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in Nrf2 levels in cells treated with tBHP, with an increase of approximately 30% (136 &#x000b1; 13%) compared with control cells (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These data are consistent with literature suggesting the activation of the Nrf2 pathway as a cellular adaptation to oxidative damage [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, cellular pre-treatment with OA did not show any effect on the expression of Nrf2, with levels remaining similar to those of the control (97 &#x000b1; 17%), as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the confocal microscopy images shown in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> provide further confirmation of the cellular mechanisms involved in the oxidative stress response. The images show that upon exposure to tBHP, there is a significant increase in the levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Their resultant levels were similar to those in control cells under OA and tBHP+OA conditions, raising intriguing questions about the potential mechanisms by which OA may inhibit Nrf2 activation.</p><p>HO-1 is a gene regulated by the Nrf2 protein and represents one of the most important cytoprotective molecules in the organism. Due to its ability to degrade free heme, HO-1 plays a fundamental role in protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. It acts not only by reducing the production of ROS but also by promoting cellular repair mechanisms. In this way, HO-1 helps to maintain the redox balance in cells and protects tissues from oxidation-related diseases [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Analysis of the nuclear localization of HO-1 using super-resolution confocal microscopy (STED) showed a significant increase in the nuclear localization of Nrf2 (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A) and HO-1 (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B) in cells exposed to tBHP. This increase suggests an active engagement of the cellular defense mechanisms against the oxidative stress induced by tBHP, highlighting a crucial role for HO-1 in mitigating cellular damage caused by ROS. In contrast, reduced levels of nuclear HO-1 were observed in cells pre-treated with OA and then exposed to tBHP. This result may indicate that OA pre-treatment inhibits the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, preventing its translocation to the nucleus and the subsequent transcription of HO-1 (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This may suggest a different mechanism of action whereby OA does not enhance the oxidative stress response through the classical Nrf2-mediated pathway. It is possible that OA engages other signaling pathways or mechanisms that modulate the cellular response to oxidative stress, possibly through direct antioxidative effects or alternative stress response pathways.</p><p>These data suggest that OA cellular pre-treatment exerts a cytoprotective action through cellular mechanisms not mediated by the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Analysis of the MAPK pathway further revealed that while tBHP induced an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK (146 &#x000b1; 19%) and p38 (152 &#x000b1; 2%), these levels remained unchanged in OA pre-treated cells (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00238-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These observations lead to the hypothesis that OA exerts its cellular antioxidative protective role independently of the Nrf2 pathway, suggesting an alternative cellular protective mechanism for OA that warrants further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-pharmaceuticals-18-00238"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>The aging process is a complex biological phenomenon that manifests itself in cellular dysfunction and an increased vulnerability to diseases, most prominently in the skin. As the body&#x02019;s largest organ, the skin plays a significant role as a barrier against external environmental threats; however, it is also highly susceptible to age-related changes that compromise its structural integrity and function.</p><p>Oxidative stress arises from an imbalance between ROS production and cellular antioxidative defenses. The presence of environmental stressors, such as UV radiation, chemicals, and pollutants, exacerbates cellular ROS generation, leading to harmful consequences for cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids. These dysfunctions in cellular homeostasis contribute not only to the functional decline of skin cells but also to an increased risk of developing a number of skin disorders ranging from dermatitis to more severe conditions such as skin cancer [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Aging processes, both the physiological process and those related to the exposure to various environmental factors, have been widely studied in relation to phenomena such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and the glycation of ECM proteins (i.e., collagen). As we have previously demonstrated, OA possesses both anti-inflammatory properties, tested in a cellular model of mouse macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and anti-glycation properties, verified in vitro on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and gelatin (as a model for collagen) [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This evidence, together with the growing literature emphasizing the benefits of OA [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], has sparked our interest in investigating its potential for preventing oxidative stress-induced cell damage in a cellular model of human keratinocytes. Our study investigated exposure to tBHP, a well-known pro-oxidative agent, and the results were promising. Pre-exposure treatments with OA showed effective protection of cell viability and contributed to regulating the production of ROS. These findings support the notion that OA may possess significant antioxidative and cytoprotective properties, providing a relevant contribution to the understanding of the functions and benefits of this molecule in skin health and beyond.</p><p>Furthermore, the interaction between NO and OA could have a significant impact on the physiological and pathological course of skin diseases. As discussed in the literature, imbalances in the production or activity of NO can lead to pathological conditions, highlighting the need for the precise regulation of NO levels in tissues. In the skin, NO-associated diseases stem from imbalances in its levels caused by deficiencies or excesses. The dual nature of NO as a beneficial or potentially harmful molecule in the skin is largely determined by the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. iNOS is an inducible isoform that is normally silent but can be upregulated in response to inflammatory signals or cellular stress [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that exposure of keratinocytes to tBHP leads to a significant increase both in iNOS expression and, consequently, to an increase in NO levels. In the skin, the iNOS-derived NO plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses, and aberrant iNOS activity and NO production have been implicated in various skin pathologies [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A promising aspect highlighted by our research is that pre-treatment with OA not only counteracts intracellular ROS production but also reduces iNOS expression in HaCaT cells, suggesting some modulation of NO levels. This mechanism of action of OA in cell protection may represent an important therapeutic approach for the treatment of skin diseases, in which oxidation plays a crucial role. Additionally, OA&#x02019;s ability to reduce the excessive production of NO by iNOS could prove to be an interesting strategy to prevent the cellular damage resulting from an imbalance in NO homeostasis.</p><p>In order to understand the mechanisms by which OA confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress on keratinocytes, this study also investigated the possible involvement of the Nrf2 pathway. Indeed, the Nrf2 signaling pathway is recognized as the main regulator of the cellular antioxidative response, activating the expression of over 200 genes involved in the defense against oxidative stress. Under homeostatic cellular conditions, Nrf2 levels are kept low, but in response to pro-oxidative stimuli, Nrf2 accumulates and translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus, activating target genes such as HO-1 [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This study highlights the role of the pro-oxidative stimulus tBHP in inducing intracellular ROS production and the subsequent activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in HaCaT keratinocytes. The results clearly show an increase in Nrf2 levels, accompanied by its translocation to the nucleus, and a subsequent increase in HO-1 expression at the nuclear level. These findings are consistent with what has been reported in the literature, where it has been documented that situations of intracellular cellular oxidation can activate the Nrf2 pathway as an adaptive response to restore redox balance and prevent ROS-induced toxicity [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In addition, an interesting connection with the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) system emerges: the MAPK signaling pathway was found to be activated in response to the pro-oxidative tBHP exposure, confirming what has already been reported in the literature regarding the response of MAPKs to various stimuli, including oxidative stress. This activation should not be underestimated, as MAPKs play a significant role in Nrf2 induction. Therefore, the interaction between MAPKs and Nrf2 represents an important synergy in cell signaling pathways, enabling cells to adapt and respond to adverse oxidative conditions [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>An interesting aspect of our study emerged with the cell pre-treatment with OA, which was shown to prevent the induction of intracellular ROS production by tBHP exposure. Our results suggest that the absence of a significant increase in intracellular ROS in OA pre-treated cells, even when the cells are exposed to tBHP, indicates that the Nrf2 pathway is not activated as expected. Cells pre-treated with OA show expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 comparable to those in control cells, suggesting a potential stabilizing and cytoprotective effect of OA against oxidative stress. This OA cytoprotective role is confirmed by the reduced levels of intracellular ROS in OA pre-treated cells when exposed to the pro-oxidative tBHP.</p><p>Although Nrf2 plays a central role in the cellular defense against oxidative stress by regulating the expression of various antioxidative and detoxifying enzymes, there are also pathways that contribute to cellular protection and the stress response that are independent of Nrf2. The literature suggests that OA may exert protective effects through Nrf2-independent pathways, i.e., by regulating the expression of a 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In fact, heat shock proteins, a group of proteins that help protect cells from stress, can be induced by various stress signals and are regulated by different pathways independently of Nrf2 [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>There are also several other mechanisms capable of protecting cells from oxidative stress independently of Nrf2 activation. Some antioxidative enzymes can be regulated by transcription factors other than Nrf2 [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For instance, activation of specific signaling pathways can lead to an upregulation of these enzymes without the direct involvement of Nrf2.</p><p>Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#x003ba;B) is also a critical transcription factor involved in the inflammatory response. It can regulate genes related to oxidative stress and inflammation, providing a protective response independently of Nrf2, as reported in the literature [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>However, further investigations are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying the OA effects.</p><p>Therefore, the antioxidative properties of OA in human keratinocyte cells exposed to a stress factor, along with its already demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-glycation potential, make OA an excellent candidate for further studies on skin prevention and protection in the aging process and skin care [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Indeed, this molecule could play a crucial role in maintaining skin health by counteracting the harmful effects of free radicals and inflammatory processes, thereby contributing to the improvement in skin appearance and functionality over time. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], OA could be used against various inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, its role as a modulator of lipid metabolism presents interesting opportunities for pharmaceutical development [<xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For instance, OA could be investigated as a potential agent to improve the skin&#x02019;s barrier function, increase hydration, and deliver active compounds more effectively in topical formulations.</p><p>Looking forward, the implications of OA in skin care and pharmaceutical development are significant. As the demand for natural and effective skin care solutions increases, the incorporation of OA into formulations could provide a competitive advantage.</p><p>Furthermore, despite the known poor aqueous solubility and limited bioavailability of OA, numerous studies have explored various approaches and advances in OA-based drug delivery systems, aiming to improve the biopharmaceutical characteristics and overall efficacy in different therapeutic contexts [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00238" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These efforts are aimed at overcoming the challenges associated with OA formulation to make it more accessible and usable in clinical settings.</p><p>In this regard, future research could open up new perspectives for the use of OA, not only in therapeutic contexts but also in cosmetic formulations. In fact, the incorporation of OA into cosmetic products could prove particularly beneficial for slowing down the signs of aging, thanks to its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Continuous innovation in formulation technologies could facilitate the absorption and effectiveness of OA, making it a key ingredient for the development of innovative and multifunctional products.</p><p>Finally, the study of olive-leaf-derived OA represents a unique intersection between health benefits and environmental sustainability. As the olive tree industry produces significant amounts of waste, mainly in the form of olive leaves, the opportunity to recycle this by-product into a valuable health compound underlines the importance of moving toward a circular bioeconomy. This approach not only aims to mitigate the environmental impact of waste production but also contributes to the development of sustainable health products that respond to the growing consumer demand for natural and effective alternatives to synthetic drugs.</p><p>The bioactive properties of OA deserve extensive discussion, especially in light of its antioxidative potential.</p><p>In this context, skin-related disorders are increasingly recognized as being influenced by oxidative damage, and the protective qualities of OA further amplify its relevance in the dermatological and skin care field.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-pharmaceuticals-18-00238"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our pilot study on the effects of OA against tBHP-induced oxidative stress in HaCaT cells highlights the potential protective role of this bioactive compound in skin health and aging. The results underline the ability of OA to prevent the formation of intracellular ROS and to reduce the expression of iNOS and NO release in keratinocytes, thereby counteracting oxidative stress and potential cellular damage. These findings, together with the anti-inflammatory and anti-glycation properties we have previously demonstrated, indicate the promising potential of OA in mitigating oxidative damage and preserving the structural integrity of skin. Furthermore, this study suggests that OA may provide protection against oxidative stress in keratinocytes through a mechanism independent of the Nrf2 and MAPK signaling pathways. The possibility of extracting OA from olive leaves also has significant implications for both human health and environmental sustainability, which is in line with the growing movement toward circular bioeconomy practices. In an effort to promote an environment beneficial for both human health and ecological balance, OA is emerging as a key component in achieving these dual objectives. The capacity to modulate cellular responses in the context of oxidative stress with natural compounds could have considerable implications for enhancing skin health and developing treatments for oxidation-related diseases. Future research could greatly enhance our understanding of skin health and aging, elucidating the specific pathways through which OA exerts its effects. Our results emphasize the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate biochemistry, human health, and environmental sciences, ultimately guiding future research efforts. This holistic perspective represents a significant step forward in promoting a healthier population and a sustainable planet.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
