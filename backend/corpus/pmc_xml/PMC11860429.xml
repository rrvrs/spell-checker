This review analyzes the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and the Y-Balance Test (YBT) landscape. Although these instruments are widely used because of their simplicity and ease of access, their accuracy in predicting injuries is inconsistent. Significant issues include reliance on broad scoring systems, varying contextual relevance, and neglecting individual characteristics such as age, gender, fitness levels, and past injuries. Meta-analyses reveal that the FMS and YBT overall scores often lack clinical relevance, exhibiting significant variability in sensitivity and specificity among different groups. Findings support the effectiveness of multifactorial models that consider modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as workload ratios, injury history, and fitness data for better prediction outcomes. Advances in machine learning (ML) and wearable technology, including inertial measurement units (IMUs) and intelligent monitoring systems, show promise by capturing dynamic and personalized high-dimensional data. Such approaches enhance our understanding of how biomechanical, physiological, and contextual injury aspects interact. This review discusses the problems of conventional movement screens, highlights the necessity for workload monitoring and personalized evaluations, and promotes the integration of technology-driven and data-centered techniques. Adopting tailored, multifactorial models could significantly improve injury prediction and prevention across varied populations.

Introduction</title><p>Injury risk screening has been extensively studied, with the primary goal of accurately predicting first-time injuries. In recent decades, field expedient screens have gained popularity in rehabilitation, sports, and fitness training settings owing to their appeal among practitioners looking to customize programs for their patients and clients. Among the most popular of these screens are the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)/Y-Balance Test (YBT) and the Functional Movement Screen (FMS). Although earlier research demonstrating the predictive value of these screens showed promise, more recent studies have raised several concerns regarding their validity. The most pressing concerns are whether performances in a limited but fundamental set of movements can forecast future performance in a broader range of movements, and whether faulty fundamental movements can predict injury. Early research challenged this idea based on the evidence available at the time. However, acceptable levels of reliability, perceived practical utility, and a lack of studies on validity may have delayed further investigation [<xref rid="B1-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since then, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have attempted to quantify the overall injury-predictive capabilities of movement screens, often recommending caution or suggesting that they should be used alongside other methods. Despite numerous studies in this field, few updated approaches to injury risk assessment have been proposed. In this review, we will address the following questions: What are the theoretical underpinnings of movement screens? Are field-based movement screens effective in predicting injury risk? What factors affect the predictive value of movement screens? Are the underlying premises of current movement screens valid? What other factors affect injury risk? Where do we go from here?</p></sec><sec id="sec2-sports-13-00046"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>To thoroughly examine the research on this topic, we conducted several literature searches using various databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus. We explored different combinations of keywords from the following list: musculoskeletal injury risk factors, Y-Balance Test (YBT), Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), Functional Movement Screen (FMS), injury prediction, systematic review, meta-analysis, and injury prevention. For inclusion in the review, we considered investigations such as systematic reviews, with or without meta-analyses, prospective cohort studies, epidemiological studies, cross-sectional studies, and case&#x02013;control studies pertaining to the predictive validity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and construct validity of the FMS and YBT. Narrative reviews that provided a critical appraisal of the FMS or YBT were also included to offer contextual perspectives. Study abstracts were screened and categorized based on publication date, relevance to our research questions, and level of evidence. To ensure that relevant studies were not overlooked, we consulted the bibliographies of pertinent studies, such as recent systematic reviews. We prioritized studies published in the last 15 years that demonstrated both high relevance and a strong level of evidence. Since the predictive value of the FMS and YBT has been widely studied, recent meta-analyses that addressed specific themes or research questions were included, while individual studies related to similar themes or research questions were excluded. Studies involving children younger than high school age were excluded. Earlier works discussing the theoretical, historical, and biomechanical foundations of movement screens were included but limited. We excluded studies based on irrelevance, duplication, insufficient focus on validity, or a failure to contribute new information or context in addressing the research questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-sports-13-00046"><title>3. Results</title><p>The literature search yielded a total of 479 records, of which 319 were excluded for duplication or for not sufficiently addressing any of the research questions (<xref rid="sports-13-00046-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, 127 were excluded due to a publication date older than 15 years or because a study with a higher level of evidence, such as a meta-analysis, was available to address a specific theme. After exclusion, 32 studies pertaining specifically to the predictive value of the FMS or YBT remained. The total review included 75 studies, comprising five theoretical framework studies, 22 systematic reviews with meta-analyses, eight systematic reviews, six narrative reviews, 18 prospective cohort studies, 10 cross-sectional studies, four case&#x02013;control studies, and two animal studies. <xref rid="sports-13-00046-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> displays the included studies and the key outcomes of each study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-sports-13-00046"><title>4. Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-sports-13-00046"><title>4.1. Theoretical Underpinnings</title><p>Musculoskeletal injuries usually result from excessive passive loading of tissues due to external forces, delayed or inadequate motor responses to sensory stimuli, or impaired afferent signals caused by disease or previous injury. Extensive research on the relationship among muscle performances, biomechanics, and clinical outcomes has helped shape an accepted theoretical framework on which injury risk assessment approaches are based. Four core tenets can describe this framework:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Movement performances depend on the kinetic chain, which encompasses the synergistic behavior of bone, muscles, connective tissues, and nerves spanning multiple joints. Closed-chain exercises involving fixed distal body segments help promote functional joint stability;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Muscle performance deficits cause compensatory behavior in local or adjacent body segments, promoting fatigue and decreasing overall movement efficiency. For example, one proposed cause of knee valgus is weak ipsilateral gluteus medius [<xref rid="B58-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p>Compensatory patterns are dictated by the forces acting on a joint (e.g., tension, compression, shear, etc.). For example, valgus knee responses lead to anterior tibial shear forces contributing to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury [<xref rid="B75-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p>Joint and muscle performances depend on the performance of proximal or distal segments, a phenomenon known as regional interdependence [<xref rid="B74-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B76-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>Since muscle synergies among joint agonists, antagonists, and other kinetic chain segments proximal to the primary effectors facilitate human movement, compensatory movement is often viewed as a pervasive manifestation of suboptimal muscle synergies at one or more loci.</p><p>Key insights into motor learning and control processes have shaped the understanding of the mechanisms involved in compensatory movement. Early research demonstrating autonomous task-based muscle synergies in response to spontaneous perturbations highlighted the specificity of neural adaptations to environmental stimuli [<xref rid="B31-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B69-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The biomechanical outcome of specific movements is a byproduct of neuromechanical tuning, which relies on task-specific sensory inputs that, in turn, refine the central program generator (CPG) involved in the task. Furthermore, the variability in the CPG pattern for a given task is history-dependent, emphasizing the plasticity of neuromotor activity and underscoring the importance of movement experience for future performances. Although the exact mechanisms governing neuromotor control remain unclear, experiments on the effects of attentional foci on muscle activity have provided practical applications for sports training and rehabilitation. While the internal focus of attention (IFOA) involves focusing on the specific actions of muscles and limbs during a movement, the external focus of attention (EFOA) involves conscious selective attention directed towards the outcome, creating task-specific constraints on coordination. EFOA has been convincingly shown to enhance motor efficiency for functional skills compared to IFOA [<xref rid="B77-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Since biomechanics are influenced by local muscular imbalances and task-specific neuromuscular deficiencies, this supports the idea that biomechanical limitations are better assessed in situ&#x02014;within the context of a functional movement rather than in isolation.</p><p>Growing evidence indicates that training and rehabilitation programs focused on functional context yield comparable, if not superior, outcomes to interventions aimed at local muscles or joints [<xref rid="B74-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. As a result, there has been a significant rise in the popularity of task-based programs within the rehabilitation community despite their relatively slow adoption [<xref rid="B76-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In contrast, extensive research extolling the advantages of ground-based strength and power training for athletic performance prompted the swift adoption of kinetic chain approaches in the fitness and sports performance sectors. When movement screens like the FMS and YBT became commercially accessible, reliable methods for assessing functional limitations from a biomechanical standpoint were absent for non-clinical professionals, such as personal trainers or strength and conditioning coaches [<xref rid="B15-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, the FMS (later bundled with the YBT) gained considerable popularity. It provided exercise professionals with a perceived competitive edge by offering a quasi-clinical assessment to optimize exercise prescriptions, address injury prevention, and improve overall training effects. However, in the 20-plus years since the introduction of the SEBT/YBT and FMS, mounting research has cast doubt on the capacity of criterion-referenced movement screens to predict injuries by identifying movement compensations.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-sports-13-00046"><title>4.2. Current Evidence on the Predictive Value of Field-Expedient Movement Screens</title><sec id="sec4dot2dot1-sports-13-00046"><title>4.2.1. Star Excursion Balance Test/Y-Balance Test</title><p>The YBT (and its earlier version, the SEBT) emerged from the neuromuscular revolution in training and rehabilitation. The YBT is a dynamic balance test that requires the performer to reach in various directions with one leg while balancing on the other. Reach distances are summed and normalized to lower leg length. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted on the predictive value of the SEBT/YBT [<xref rid="B29-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B56-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Gribble et al. conducted an early systematic review of the validity of the SEBT to predict lower extremity injury risk [<xref rid="B29-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Only one study by Plisky et al. on the predictive value of the SEBT was included in the analysis due to high heterogeneity among the studies meeting the inclusion criteria [<xref rid="B78-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In that study, basketball players with anterior reach asymmetries of greater than 4 cm were 2.5 times more likely to sustain lower extremity injuries. Furthermore, girls with a composite reach score below 94% of their limb length were 6.5 times more likely to experience a lower extremity injury. Recently, Plisky and colleagues conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the predictive validity of the YBT-LQ (lower quarter) [<xref rid="B56-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The inclusion criteria were narrowed to studies in which the YBT assessment kit or YBT procedures were strictly followed. Sixteen studies on predictive validity were included. Similar to Gribble et al., a meta-analysis could not be performed due to the high heterogeneity among the included studies. Studies examining the relationship between future injury and reach asymmetries were mixed across various populations, cutoff scores, and injury definitions. In one of the studies included in the review, injuries and surgeries were associated with lower scores in the FMS, but YBT scores were not impacted [<xref rid="B10-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Significant differences in reach scores were observed across multiple subgroups, including sex and sport, but no differences emerged when analyzed by competition level. Due to the low number of female studies, they were excluded from the subgroup analysis. Of the 13 included studies, one reported an odds ratio of 3.5 for future injury using a composite score cutoff of 89.6%, with 100% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity. However, other studies utilized a range of composite score asymmetry thresholds and found no significant relationship with future injury. Smith et al. reported a two-fold increase in injury risk using a greater than 4 cm asymmetry cutoff, with a specificity of 72% (moderate) and sensitivity of 58% (poor) [<xref rid="B62-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Lai et al. also reported poor sensitivity and specificity when cutoff scores were optimized through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis [<xref rid="B39-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot2-sports-13-00046"><title>4.2.2. The Functional Movement Screen</title><p>The FMS is a criterion-based screening tool for assessing mobility and stability deficits, left&#x02013;right asymmetries, and pain, evaluated through performances in seven so-called fundamental movement patterns [<xref rid="B15-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The creators assert that FMS tests encompass both simple and complex movement patterns, with performances in these movements being interdependent. Scores from all subtests are compiled to create a composite score intended to quantify overall motor competence. Early studies confirmed that a cut score of 14 or lower was linked to a significant increase in injury risk [<xref rid="B35-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, these findings faced criticism due to their poor study design and insufficient support for the unidimensional construct of the FMS [<xref rid="B1-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A factor analysis study involving marine officer candidates and another involving elite athletes discovered weak factor loadings in FMS subtests, resulting in incoherent factor structures [<xref rid="B34-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B41-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Conversely, a study of a general healthcare sample with 1113 participants revealed a two-factor structure categorized as &#x0201c;basic&#x0201d; (FMS tests: shoulder mobility and active straight leg raise) and &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; (FMS tests: deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability) movements [<xref rid="B37-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Overall, however, component coefficients ranged from weak to moderate, and the internal consistency of the FMS scoring fell below acceptable levels for all but one model [<xref rid="B34-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B37-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B41-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis involving six studies with active adult samples (including athletes, military personnel, and firefighters), the authors reported an overall sensitivity of 24.7%, a true positive value of 42.8%, and a true negative value of 72.5% [<xref rid="B17-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In another meta-analysis that examined nine studies on athletes and military personnel, an FMS score of 14 or lower was linked to a pooled odds ratio of 2.74 for sustaining an injury [<xref rid="B8-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the authors acknowledged several limitations, such as differences in the optimal cutoff score for males and females, discrepancies in the definition of injury, and methodological challenges in assessing individual subtest score variance. Additionally, three studies involving 225 participants did not find a statistically significant correlation between FMS scores and injury risk.</p><p>Moore et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 29 prospective studies to clarify research gaps and identify factors influencing the relationship between FMS scores and injury risk [<xref rid="B48-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Notable findings from the pooled analysis of 36 studies indicate that for FMS scores of 14 or lower, the odds of injury tended to be higher in sports with a greater prevalence of contact injuries, but were inconsistent. The odds were significantly higher for injuries defined by limited or full training or match time loss, and were greater in males compared to females. The specificity and sensitivity of scores of 14 or lower to identify increased injury risk varied widely among all subgroups. However, specificity was found to be higher than sensitivity overall. Furthermore, having one or more asymmetries significantly increased the odds of all-cause injuries when defined by limited or full training or match time loss, and resulted in higher sensitivity for injury risk, regardless of age or injury type. Pain experienced during one or more subtests was significantly associated with increased odds of injury in senior athletes, but not in junior athletes. Nonetheless, all three studies concluded that effect sizes for the relationships between the FMS scores and injury risk were likely not clinically meaningful.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-sports-13-00046"><title>4.3. Factors Affecting the Predictive Validity of Movement Screens</title><p>Several studies have either advised against using movement screens or suggested their use alongside other factors [<xref rid="B6-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B17-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B48-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Some early reviews failed to assess confounding variables such as sex, sports, or injury definitions, resulting in conflicting findings [<xref rid="B8-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B17-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Subsequently, Moran et al. reported that there were only a few FMS studies within military and athlete cohorts that had sufficient homogeneity to conduct a meta-analysis. They concluded that the actual effect size was small [<xref rid="B49-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In a more recent review, Moore et al. confirmed Moran&#x02019;s findings, noting that variations in athlete age, sex, sport type, and asymmetries accounted for some of the mixed results in FMS injury risk studies. Overall, review studies on the FMS and YBT indicated significant variations in composite scores and asymmetries across sport, sex, and age and recommended further research to establish the unique cutoffs that correlate with good predictive validity in each subpopulation [<xref rid="B48-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B56-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><sec id="sec4dot3dot1-sports-13-00046"><title>4.3.1. Age and Sex</title><p>In the general population, age strongly predicts musculoskeletal disorders, such as knee osteoarthritis and lower back pain [<xref rid="B22-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, since age closely correlates with numerous other risk factors, analyses often employ age-matched controls or narrow age ranges to provide more pertinent estimates for particular age groups. For example, after adjusting for age, Eckart et al. reported diminished associations between a multifactorial risk model and injury rates in a sample representative of the US population [<xref rid="B22-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a meta-analysis examining risk factors for knee osteoarthritis, age was significant, although obesity and prior injury contributed the most to population-attributable risk [<xref rid="B60-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In another meta-analysis, the prevalence of low back pain was generally higher in females compared to males, with prevalence in females varying across age ranges from 6 to over 50 years. However, sex differences in low back pain were not evident in studies with narrow age ranges [<xref rid="B79-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. A meta-analysis focused on military personnel indicated that, while age was not a significant predictor in studies with a narrow age range, substantial differences were identified when the age range was expanded [<xref rid="B57-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This implies that other predictors, such as sex, BMI, physical activity levels, as well as occupational factors, may serve as more reliable injury predictors when samples are classified by age.</p><p>Sex influences vulnerability to certain injuries. For instance, females face a higher risk of ACL injuries, whereas males are more susceptible to shoulder injuries related to instability [<xref rid="B47-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Overall evidence suggests that females achieve higher composite FMS scores and perform better in flexibility and balance movements, aligning with known sex-based musculoskeletal traits [<xref rid="B6-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B54-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Several studies assessing the predictive validity of the FMS and YBT in athletic populations reveal sex differences in both composite and component scores while showing no significant difference in injury risk [<xref rid="B5-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B36-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B54-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, Kapnik et al. discovered that cut-off scores maximizing sensitivity and specificity were lower for males (&#x02264;11) than for females (&#x02264;14). Nevertheless, sensitivity and specificity were considerably higher for females (60% sensitivity, 61% specificity) than for males (22% sensitivity, 87% specificity) [<xref rid="B36-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

The FMS composite score showed slightly higher sensitivity to non-contact injuries compared to all-cause injuries, though it was based on only a few studies focused on non-contact injuries. Moore et al. recommended that future research adopt a more precise definition of injury, including only serious injuries associated with significant time loss (e.g., one week or more) [<xref rid="B48-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3dot3-sports-13-00046"><title>4.3.3.

For instance, studies have demonstrated a link between ACL, groin, and back injuries and the occurrence of subsequent hamstring injuries [<xref rid="B70-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Although it may be an oversimplification, reasonable explanations for the heightened risk following an initial injury include changes in biomechanics and motor control, as well as a return to excessively high training and competition loads after recovery. However, a reliable biomechanical model that prospectively predicts injury, independent of injury history, has yet to be developed. Nonetheless, many studies on injury risk exhibit methodological flaws by attempting to identify risk factors through retrospective designs [<xref rid="B13-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since injury risk screens are intended to predict future and first-time injuries, analyzing scores after injury undermines their overall utility.

Are the Premises of Movement Screens Flawed?</title><p>The core concept behind an injury-predictive movement screen is its capacity to pinpoint motor control limitations in movement patterns deemed universal to physical functioning. Consequently, only a limited number of idealized movements that supposedly represent essential motor skills are included. Performances in these movements are evaluated against a predefined ideal that is presumed to accurately represent optimal neuromuscular control.</p><p>This system is said to cast a &#x0201c;wider net&#x0201d; to capture functional limitations [<xref rid="B15-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, if a person has trunk instability, it may manifest as compensatory movements in several FMS movement tests. Similarly, if a person experiences ankle stiffness, it could result in relatively short reaches in the YBT or low scores in the deep squat or in-line lunge. There is limited evidence supporting the validity of this theory. Nevertheless, performance-based movement screens are widely adopted, potentially due to a common logical fallacy. This fallacy assumes that a motor skill, which integrates various general physical characteristics, will effectively assess athletic or functional performance, regardless of the specificity of the movement context. To enhance sport-specific performance, trainers and therapists often employ exercises as proxies for sporting movements (<xref rid="sports-13-00046-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). These proxies are further abstracted to represent &#x02018;fundamental&#x02019; movements, evolving into &#x02018;movement assessments&#x02019; because they are perceived as composites of the essential motor skills necessary for athleticism. This reasoning, illustrated below, is frequently invoked to justify the relevance of movement screens to functional or sporting activities. For instance, dynamic single-leg balance is valued in many sporting contexts due to its face validity for numerous sports movements and its requirement for whole-body motor control, strength, and flexibility. As a result, assessments of single-leg dynamic balance are used to identify functional limitations and serve as a foundation for exercise programming. To illustrate the underlying logic, let C represent the plant phase of the lower body during a baseball pitch; B denotes the common lunge exercise often performed in training; and A signifies the FMS in-line lunge or the lower limb reaches in the YBT.<disp-formula>If A&#x02192;B&#x02192;C, then A&#x02192;C</disp-formula></p><p>While the YBT or in-line lunge can be compared to various sports actions, several critical factors regarding its applicability are frequently overlooked. These include the experience of performing the test and the differences in fatigue effects, forces, velocities, kinematics, and unique coordination patterns manifested in the test compared to similar actions during gameplay.</p><p>Another example pertains to the deep squat in the FMS. The FMS deep squat is an overhead squat performed with a dowel and is sometimes utilized as a stand-alone test of athletic gross motor function due to its high demands on neuromuscular coordination, trunk stability, and joint mobility. Its direct connection to athletic performances appears restricted to specific sports like Olympic weightlifting or CrossFit. Nevertheless, the rationale for employing the overhead squat assessment is frequently rooted in the assumption that proficiency in this proposed proxy of whole-body motor control implies general athletic ability. One potential reason for the widespread acceptance of this assumption is the common mistake of attributing causes when only associations exist. Athletes are exposed to various training regimens and are more likely to encounter exercises similar to those in movement screens. It is also plausible that athletes who engage in demanding exercises like the deep squat are more inclined to try new exercises, resulting in a broader movement repertoire.</p><p>Indeed, athletes engage in a wider variety of exercises and movements than their sedentary counterparts. However, the question arises of whether criterion-referenced proficiency in these exercises provides resilience against injury. If that were true, evidence would indicate a relationship between higher screen scores and athletic event performances. Nonetheless, a systematic review of the association between the FMS and athletic performance challenges the validity of movement performance assessments by proxy [<xref rid="B53-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In one study, the deep squat identified only minor deficits in athletic field test performances [<xref rid="B53-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In other studies, the deep squat, along with other gross motor patterns, such as the in-line lunge and hurdle step, did not predict athletic performance [<xref rid="B53-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Also important is the evidence showing a practice effect on subsequent FMS scores that is not explained by the scoring criteria. Frost et al. asked a group of firefighters to perform the FMS without prior knowledge of the scoring criteria [<xref rid="B26-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. After the initial trial, firefighters were informed of the criteria for each score, resulting in improvements in composite scores in the second trial. This suggests that scores partially reflect performance expectations rather than genuine motor deficiencies.</p><p>With the noted bias toward experience, the next question is whether the FMS scoring criteria are sensitive enough to detect compensations related to injury. The initial screening procedures require measurements of key body segments used to score specific tests. For instance, the shin length measured from the floor to the tibial tuberosity is used to set the height of the hurdle step and position the feet in the in-line lunge. For the deep squat, if the criteria for a score of 3, considered optimal performance, are not achieved after several attempts, the approximately 1.5-inch-thick board that comes with the FMS kit is placed under the heels. This effectively &#x0201c;lengthens&#x0201d; the posterior chain and &#x0201c;increases&#x0201d; ankle dorsiflexion by allowing more degrees of freedom between two fixed points&#x02014;the feet and the dowel held overhead with both hands. Curiously, the height of the heel raise is entirely arbitrary and universal to all participants, regardless of individual morphologies. This modification might lead to successful completion, corresponding to a score of 2, considered &#x0201c;satisfactory&#x0201d;. This presents yet another conundrum. Although the score decreases by one, the compensation is not necessarily flagged as problematic, suggesting that the criteria for a score of 3 might be an unreasonable standard. A more glaring example of an unreasonable standard is the criteria to score a 3 on the rotary stability test. In the quadruped position, with the hands and knees kept approximately 4 inches apart (the width of the FMS board), participants must perform an ipsilateral arm/leg reach without losing balance. If three attempts to perform this are unsuccessful, the participant is asked to perform the same action contralaterally, which offers significantly more stability. Once again, if successful, the performance is scored at 2, which is deemed satisfactory. These examples highlight the inconsistency in the FMS scoring system by acknowledging participants&#x02019; tendency to compensate strategically while incorporating arbitrary modifications as a response to an unreasonable standard.</p><p>Movement screens may only be predictive to the extent that a specific test involves joints or body segments that are integral to a participant&#x02019;s sport or function, or when the scoring criteria reveal injury-specific deficiencies. For example, Chorba et al. analyzed the relationship between FMS scores and lower extremity injuries in a female cohort from various sports [<xref rid="B11-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The association between FMS scores and injury was stronger when shoulder mobility scores were excluded from the total score. The composite score includes scores from upper and lower body subtests, which undermines the overall predictive sensitivity for athletes whose injuries primarily involve the areas used during sport, such as the lower extremities in soccer players. However, evidence suggests that the validity of the subtest criteria is also questionable. The scoring criteria were developed based on the assumption that specific compensations are inherent in fundamental movement patterns, and that the differences in scores would indicate specific levels of dysfunction. Recent studies have challenged this assumption, demonstrating considerable overlap in joint ranges of motion (ROM) across FMS subtest scores [<xref rid="B4-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B30-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In one study, ankle mobility restrictions were indicated by lower scores in the deep squat and in-line lunge. However, lower scores did not always predict ankle mobility limitations [<xref rid="B30-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, there was significant variability in the ROM of the ankle, hip, and shoulder associated with FMS scores. In a similar study, shoulder ROM during the deep squat differed only between scores of 1 and 2. Recent findings also suggest that generalized joint laxity was associated with higher DS scores, indicating that genetic variations in joint structure may explain scores independently of dysfunction or injury [<xref rid="B80-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>A balanced critique of movement screens acknowledges some evidence of predictive validity and seeks to examine the apparent links. When viewed through the lens of specificity, it becomes clearer why the FMS and YBT may sometimes predict injury. As stated earlier, fitter individuals who engage in a variety of exercises possess greater strength, stability, and mobility, which serve to confer injury protection and might explain the higher FMS scores [<xref rid="B37-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, since these screens mimic common exercises performed in the gym, criterion bias tends to favor those with diverse exercise experience [<xref rid="B26-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the problem is that these screens generalize functional limitations observed in specific movements to all movements without taking into account their specificity to the movement goal. Consequently, the evidence regarding causal links between higher FMS scores, greater fitness levels, and decreased injury rates is inconsistent. For example, Tehyan et al. observed reduced injury rates among those with higher FMS scores and better fitness test scores in military cohorts, whereas Svensson et al. found no correlation among athletic performance tests, FMS scores, and injury rates in football players [<xref rid="B65-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Many studies show improvements in FMS scores and injury rates following various interventions, regardless of the specific characteristics of each cohort [<xref rid="B1-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether experience in performing the FMS tests or specific training interventions led to improved FMS scores due to a lack of studies controlling for the practice effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-sports-13-00046"><title>4.5.

However, being inactive at work can be equally harmful, if not more so.

Supporting these findings, a large-scale epidemiological study by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) reported that force exertion, demanding postures, repetitiveness, hand-arm vibrations, lifting, kneeling, squatting, or climbing for 2 or more hours a day significantly increased odds ratios for osteoarthritis of the knee or hip compared to low or no exposure [<xref rid="B32-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In addition to intraday work demands, shift work is linked to inadequate recovery between workdays.

The risks tied to shift work affect all shift-based occupations, but they are particularly evident in allied health professions, which involve long shifts, prolonged standing, and repetitive patterns and postures [<xref rid="B12-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B19-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B23-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B43-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

Joint Laxity</title><p>Joint laxity, or hypermobility, is characterized by excessive ranges of motion and could be caused by a heritable phenotype, injury, or an adaptation to repeat exposures.

Singh et al. evaluated Generalized Joint Hypermobility (GJH) using the BS scoring system in 1000 males and females aged 3&#x02013;101. Generally, females and non-Caucasians had higher BS scores across the lifespan. A cut-off score of &#x02265;4 demonstrated 80% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity for females aged 40&#x02013;59 and males aged 8&#x02013;39. However, using the &#x02265;4 cutoff for both sexes across the lifespan resulted in a 60% false-positive rate.</p><p>Malek et al. note that the BS&#x02019;s ability to accurately reflect GJH remains controversial, as the joints represented in the scoring system are primarily the upper limbs, overlooking several major joints, thereby hindering a direct identification of GJH [<xref rid="B46-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The researchers concluded that the BS should not be employed as the main tool for differentiating between localized and generalized hypermobility, nor should it be used in isolation to rule out the presence of GJH.

However, few injury risk studies exist that integrate movement screens with other modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. An early study by Lehr et al. included 183 collegiate athletes across ten sports, utilizing aggregated movement screen scores [<xref rid="B40-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Evidence-based cut-off points specific to competition level, sport, injury history, and gender were employed to establish low- and high-risk categories.

Workloads and Injury</title><p>MSI risk is considered to be proportional to the difference between acute and chronic workloads through fatigue mechanisms. Several prospective studies have demonstrated a negative impact on injury risk factors such as postural control, joint position sense, and lower limb strength when acute fatigue is induced [<xref rid="B72-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In the meta-analysis by Eckard et al., several notable relationships between load and injury risk were identified [<xref rid="B21-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The workload measures in these studies included internal training loads (ITL), external training loads (ETL), and absolute and relative training loads. Common ETLs encompassed session frequency, distance, duration, and repetitions, while ITL measures included questionnaires and session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE). Recent studies report moderate-strength evidence linking acute-to-chronic workload ratios (ACWRs) with injuries in both athlete and tactical populations [<xref rid="B21-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Researchers typically define ACWR as the ratio of the mean training load in the current period to the mean in the previous period. Several ACWRs associated with an increased injury risk have been documented, including daily and weekly ratios. Eckard et al. reported that direct relationships between workloads and injury rates were primarily found in studies utilizing acute absolute loads. Conversely, inverse relationships were mainly observed in studies evaluating chronic loads [<xref rid="B21-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This supports the notion that high chronic loads can offer protection against injuries. Research employing a mix of workload measures reveals a U-shaped relationship, where low loads do not trigger protective physiological adaptations, while excessive loads lead to increased fatigue and damage, thus diminishing injury resistance [<xref rid="B21-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The frequency of training sessions was an inconsistent external workload measure with no clear link to injury risk; however, the sRPE emerged as the most useful internal workload measure. Ultimately, minor to moderate adjustments in relative workloads correlated with a lower injury risk compared to either very small or very large changes.</p><p>Although injury risk assessment based on workloads is promising, this area of research faces similar limitations as movement screens. Presumably, injury rates vary across predisposing factors such as sport, sex, or injury history. However, studies measuring workloads have not differentiated risk for these specific injury factors, which could provide greater predictive accuracy for injuries [<xref rid="B21-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some studies indicate a latency period between workload exposures and increased injury rates, possibly due to the decline in adaptive reserves, which refers to how well an athlete&#x02019;s HPA axis regulates stress responses and adapts physiological processes to changing demands. Although ACWRs account for differences in physiological stress between periods, they do not consider the adaptive reserve or recovery efficiency between training or sporting bouts. Latency periods may clarify the temporal relationship between workload exposures and injury events. Still, this does not address the challenge of predicting specific injuries, which would require the continuous measurement of local tissue workloads during sports and training activities, as well as monitoring overall on- and off-field workloads, sleep quality, and other recovery determinants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-sports-13-00046"><title>4.6. Emerging Approaches in Injury Prediction</title><p>Arguably, basic linear methods for injury prediction have yet to yield models with strong sensitivity or specificity [<xref rid="B63-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

Complex behaviors demonstrate nonlinear characteristics, where the effects of interconnected components develop in relation to one another and the outcome. The biomechanical outcome of a specific movement can be understood as an emergent property stemming from the self-organization of a dynamical system that adjusts feedforward and feedback mechanisms using current and past inputs. Following an injury or as a consequence of fatigue, biomechanical components undergo fundamental changes that alter the dynamical landscape and establish a new pattern of movement synergies, which cannot be anticipated through linear associations between components from before the exposure.</p><p>However, the core issue affecting biomechanical approaches to injury risk stratification is not merely compensation due to fatigue, but rather capturing the dynamic multiscale interactions of injury factors at the individual level (<xref rid="sports-13-00046-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This necessitates analyses of specific movements and their associated biomechanics, including the precise kinematics, forces, and velocities at which injuries might occur, while considering factors such as gender, age, sport, fitness level, acute and chronic workloads, previous injuries, and indicators of athlete readiness, such as exertional indices (e.g., heart rate, heart rate variability, RPE) and measures of strength and power. To achieve this, wearable or easily deployable technologies are essential for data collection, management, and real-time analysis to develop personalized neuromuscular models.</p><p>Machine learning approaches possess the ability to manage complex, nonlinear, multiscale, and dynamic interactions, positioning injury prediction with high-dimensional data as a promising objective. Consequently, studies utilizing nonlinear and machine learning (ML) models have started to arise [<xref rid="B82-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Furthermore, the advancement of wireless intelligent monitoring technologies, including markerless motion capture and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors that integrate GPS, gyroscope, and accelerometer technology, makes non-invasive methods for modeling and assessing ground reaction forces and tissue loading easily accessible to sports performance coaches, fitness professionals, and rehabilitation clinicians.</p><p>Although a comprehensive examination is beyond the scope of this review, it is worth noting that various machine learning methods have been used to investigate injury predictors in different populations, such as athletes, occupational workers, and military personnel, with relatively high accuracy [<xref rid="B83-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. These studies often include sensor data, questionnaires, fitness tests, motor skill evaluations, and anthropometric data. However, only a few studies utilizing ML methods have used a combination of multifactorial predictors to assess injury risk prospectively. One remarkable study by Rossi et al. used a multifactorial feature set, including anthropometrics, kinematic, metabolic, mechanical load, and fatigue data collected from GPS/IMU monitoring systems, to prospectively predict injury in professional male soccer players. The decision tree injury classifier achieved a recall of 80% and a precision of 50%, and its predictive accuracy improved as more data were collected throughout the season [<xref rid="B84-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Interestingly, previous injuries emerged as a significant predictor when combined with cut-offs for specific workload metrics. To summarize, a previous injury plus a lower value for high-speed running distance in a training session accounted for 42% of new injuries. A previous injury plus a higher value for high-speed running distance and a lower value for total distance covered in a training session accounted for 30% of new injuries. Finally, previous injuries plus higher values for high-speed running distance and a total distance covered of over 2.5 times the player&#x02019;s average accounted for 28% of new injury cases. However, the homogeneity of the sample, the collection of time-series data during training and sport participation periods, including all relevant features, and the collection of relevant sport/activity-specific workload measurements are essential in producing highly accurate models [<xref rid="B33-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B86-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. For example, IMU measurements collected from a one-time Cooper test and questionnaire data produced low-performing ML models in a college-aged cohort of men and women [<xref rid="B86-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. However, the performances of gender-specific models were better than those of mixed-gender models. In another mixed sample of male and female floorball and basketball players, a combination of biomechanical, joint-laxity, and flexibility tests yielded an AUC ROC of 0.63, which is generally considered poor for diagnostic purposes [<xref rid="B33-sports-13-00046" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although gender, body composition, and physical features were among the most important, the lack of time-series data that could be used to account for changes incurred by varying workloads throughout training and sports season likely reduced the model&#x02019;s predictive value.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-sports-13-00046"><title>4.7. Practical Considerations</title><p>The FMS and YBT show an inconsistent ability to predict injuries. Factors such as sex, age, type of sport, injury history, and physical fitness significantly affect the validity of these screens. Future research should investigate scoring systems for movement screens that consider these differences. While they can be useful in certain situations, risk screens often generalize limitations in contexts where specificity is essential. It is necessary to develop methods of injury risk assessment that focus on specific and crucial sporting actions. Although familiarity with movement tests can enhance scores, it is questionable whether higher scores truly indicate an effective injury prevention capability. Additional research is needed on modifying existing or creating new movement screens that reduce or eliminate prior experience bias. Factors such as repetitive motions, inadequate recovery (e.g., shift work), and sleep disturbances, if considered, may improve the sensitivity of injury risk assessments. Machine learning and wearable devices, like IMUs, offer more accurate and dynamic methods for predicting injury risk through multifactorial models and individualized workload/recovery monitoring. In general, tailored approaches that combine relevant movement/activity assessments with broader risk factors, such as relative workloads, recovery metrics, and past injuries, will improve predictions in injury assessments.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot8-sports-13-00046"><title>4.8. Limitations</title><p>Our intention was not to conduct a systematic review. However, higher reporting standards for narrative reviews are essential, as they promote transparency and trustworthiness while providing context for the authors&#x02019; conclusions. Therefore, we adopted a structured approach to our literature search and study inclusion methods. We did not adhere to the standard practices for systematic reviews, such as study selection and risk of bias assessment. Consequently, some relevant studies may not have been included in this review. Nonetheless, by incorporating both earlier and more recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the FMS and YBT, our perspective reflects the current weight of evidence regarding these screens.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-sports-13-00046"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Field-based screens for musculoskeletal injuries, such as the FMS and the YBT, have limited utility in predicting injuries due to their context-specific nature. Various confounding factors, inconsistent scoring validity, and an overreliance on general movement patterns undermine their effectiveness. Innovative approaches like workload monitoring and machine learning demonstrate greater promise by combining multifaceted data and personalizing risk assessments. Future efforts should focus on integrating movement screens with individualized evaluations that take into account unique exertional, biomechanical, occupational, and lifestyle factors to enhance injury prediction and prevention. This shift toward more dynamic, technology-driven models is essential for increasing accuracy and relevance across different populations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
