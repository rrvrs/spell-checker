UI can impact the psychological dimension of people, hindering various aspects of their lives (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Evidence highlights how UI is strongly associated with overall poor levels of health&#x02010;related quality of life and reduced sexual well&#x02010;being, likely due to the incapacity of controlling urine loss in social and intimate contexts (Pizzol et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Corrado et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lim et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). To improve UI symptoms, the first line of recommended conservative treatment is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) ((UK) NGA,&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Alouini et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), consisting of progressive exercises involving pelvic floor muscles aimed at maximising a person's functional capabilities (Cacciari et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>In its early stages, PFMT often involves the adoption of devices, mainly endocavitary (i.e., vaginal or anal), with different purposes. One is to offer a facilitation to awareness of pelvic floor muscle contractions to exercise effectively through biofeedback, typically delivered via visual or auditory cues derived from pressure, ultrasound or electromyographic signals (Mazur&#x02010;Bialy et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Another purpose is to offer resistance to voluntary contractions, thereby potentially enhancing muscle fibre strength. A third is to induce a local muscle effect (e.g., relaxation or strength improvement) through electrical stimulation (Bo et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Examples of endocavitary devices used during PFMT are weight kegel balls, yoni eggs, vaginal or anal cones or dilators, vibrating devices, and biofeedback devices (Ong et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Thomas et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). These devices have been shown to improve symptoms of urinary incontinence and, when present, sexual dysfunction (Bo et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These devices aim to produce both physical effects and behavioural effects by increasing body awareness and encouraging active participation, supporting the view of PFMT as both a physical and behavioural therapy (Frawley et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>).</p><p>However, using these devices may cause discomfort during PFMT (H. N. Lee et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Specifically, the literature highlights that nudity and invasive physical contact with internal, intimate body parts, as well as manual techniques performed by the physiotherapist (e.g., digital vaginal or rectal examination), can lead participants to feel embarrassed and displeased, influenced by concerns about potential pain and cultural factors (Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Kondo et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Fernandes et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). As a result, this discomfort may negatively affect adherence to PFMT (H. N. Lee et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, these devices often require the user to be naked in supine, seated, or lateral decubitus positions, making it challenging to establish an appropriate setting for training (Bo et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative research provides conflicting evidence towards the added value of endocavitary devices during PFMT in people with UI. Systematic reviews have reported no differences or inconclusive results in terms of incontinence quality of life, or symptom cure or improvement, when investigating the added benefits of devices to PFMT in people with UI (Fernandes et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>; Benedetto et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). However, in Italy, clinical guidelines for the conservative management of UI recommend using biofeedback and electrical stimulation&#x02014;often delivered via endocavitary devices&#x02014;as part of the physiotherapy intervention (Societ&#x000e0; Italiana di Urologia and European Association of Urology&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Therefore, exploring the experiences and perceptions of people with UI regarding invasive devices during PFMT could help to get valuable insights into how these devices are perceived and the emotions they evoke (Oben&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Qualitative research, by exploring the beliefs, experiences, and perspectives, can further enhance understanding of patients' experiences. This knowledge can guide physiotherapists in addressing users' discomfort and proposing strategies to overcome their engagement and satisfaction (Oben&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Maher and Dertadian&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>Hence, the following study aimed to understand the experience of using invasive devices, regardless of whether they offered only biofeedback or a local muscle effect, during PFMT in people with UI. By offering insights into users' emotional responses and engagement strategies, this study aims to inform more patient&#x02010;centred PFMT practices and contribute to improving treatment satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="pri70071-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="pri70071-sec-0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Design</title><p>We conducted an interview qualitative study to explore the experience of invasive devices of people with UI who underwent PFMT. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee for University Research (CERA) of the University of Genova, Italy (CERA2023/80; approval date: 31/10/2023). The study followed the &#x02018;Declaration of Helsinki&#x02019; and is reported in line with the &#x02018;Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Research for reporting qualitative studies&#x02019; (COREQ) (Booth et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="pri70071-sec-0040"><label>2.2</label><title>Participants</title><p>Adult (+18) people with UI who underwent a PFMT programme involving an invasive device, such as anal or vaginal biofeedback, electrical stimulation, weight kegel balls, or cones, were recruited adopting a purposive sampling. This approach was chosen to ensure the inclusion of participants with direct and relevant experience related to the research question. Specifically, we aimed to include Italian&#x02010;speaking participants of different genders, age groups, sexual orientations, and experiences with different types of intracavitary devices; however, although diversity in age and gender was achieved, the final sample reflected heterosexual participants. To reach participants, different pelvic floor physiotherapists were contacted to share the opportunity to partake in the study with their patients, as well as aims, inclusion criteria and procedures. Once they received enough information on the study's purposes, patients were invited to contact BG if they were interested in partaking. Moreover, emails, social media and snowball sampling were used to reach as many participants as possible and maximise the diversity. Online interviews allowed us to reach more Italian regions from the north, mid and south. The informed consent form and the informative note were shared with participants to explain the objective and modality of the study. No restrictions were applied to gender and age. Participants could withdraw from the study at any moment without the need for an explanation.</p></sec><sec id="pri70071-sec-0050"><label>2.3</label><title>Research Team</title><p>The research team was composed by B.G., G.L., O.B., M.T. and S.B.

No pilot testing was conducted. The interview guide was specific for the endocavitary devices, as the general expectations, beliefs and experience of PFMT, in the same population, have been explored in another study (Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). As such, we did not seek to replicate those findings but provide a focused exploration of participants' perspectives on the use of invasive devices, considering that PFMT users reported a degree of discomfort also during vaginal examination and digital rectal palpation (Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>, <xref rid="pri70071-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Hence, the interviews aimed to capture the lived experience, including the thoughts and beliefs of participants about the use of endocavitary devices. Before the interview, sociodemographic data, such as age, gender, sexual orientation, educational attainment, employment, marital status and clinical conditions, were collected and registered on an Excel sheet. B.G. conducted one&#x02010;to&#x02010;one online interviews in Italian on Microsoft Teams to prevent the embarrassment of a group interview (i.e., focus groups) on intimate topics. Online interviews facilitated participation by removing the need for physical travel and allowing participants to remain in a comfortable environment (e.g., home) and fostering privacy when talking about intimate topics and experiences. Moreover, participants could choose to disable or turn off their webcam if it made them feel more at ease, preserving their visual privacy&#x02014;important given the sensitivity of the topic.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pri70071-tbl-0001" content-type="TABLE"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Interview guide.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><thead valign="bottom"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questions</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dimension</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

None of the participants had met the interviewer before.</p></sec><sec id="pri70071-sec-0070"><label>2.5</label><title>Data Analysis</title><p>A descriptive analysis was adopted for sociodemographic data. Transcribed data were analysed by adopting the &#x02018;Reflexive Thematic Analysis&#x02019; (RTA) by Braun &#x00026; Clarke (Braun and Clarke&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>) to get patterns of meaning among the dataset. RTA belongs to the &#x02018;Big Q&#x02019; qualitative paradigm and allows for identifying common patterns of meaning in the data. Moreover, it does not adhere to &#x02018;small Q&#x02019; strategies such as minimising bias, coding accuracy and using other strategies like data saturation and member checking to increase trustworthiness (Braun and Clarke&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>). Hence, the sample size was decided following the &#x02018;information power&#x02019; model, which reports that the number of participants depends on the study aim, sample specificity, theoretical background, quality of dialogue, and the analysis method (Malterud et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Given the narrow aim of the study, the sample specificity, the theoretical perspectives of the study, the expertise of the researcher conducting the interviews and in the pelvic clinical field (B.G.), and the purposive sample selection, we estimated a sample of participants between 12 and 16. Specific attention was given to diversify the group by considering participants' gender and age. The specific methodology of RTA followed for this study is represented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Data codification was inductive to allow the researchers to catch the richness and variability of data without imposing any framework. The objective was to identify reflexed shared meanings among the dataset, adopting an experiential qualitative theory and a realistic framework (Braun and Clarke&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>, <xref rid="pri70071-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>). The use of field notes, like memos and diary, during interviews was allowed to promote reflexivity. Data codification was semantic, allowing researchers to stay on the explicit or surface of the meaning of data. When possible, researchers also adopted a latent approach, going beyond the surface data content to interpret underlying meaning, assumption, and ideas. The participants' and researchers' original language (Italian) was used to develop codes and themes, which were then translated into English by B.G. for publication (Yunus et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). To ensure conceptual accuracy and preserve the transferability of research findings, we adopted the rechecking process (Yunus et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). B.G. and S.B. are proficient in the English language, and they compared the translation with the original data, checking that the original meaning was not lost. Moreover, the entire team reviewed and agreed on the translations.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pri70071-tbl-0002" content-type="TABLE"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p>Six steps of the &#x02018;reflexive thematic analysis&#x02019;.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><thead valign="bottom"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phases</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Process</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Authors' involvement</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Authors' actions</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1) Data familiarisation</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Authors immerged themselves in the data to understand the depth and breadth of the content.</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Authors became familiar with the data in this phase.</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Initially, many experienced anxiety and discomfort about the idea of using an endocavitary device, particularly in the context of being undressed in front of a physiotherapist. Some participants even described the use of endocavitary devices as &#x02018;something not natural&#x02019; due to its invasiveness. However, over time, some participants changed their minds and became comfortable with the device. Specifically, they reported an initial prejudice that after making the experience of the devices disappeared.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>I had this prejudice that introducing this machine meant I needed something extra because I wasn&#x02019;t capable on my own. Also, I saw it as invasive and unnatural&#x02014;Participant 6, 45 yo, woman</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Men were often reluctant towards endocavitary devices but viewed them, or were guided to see them, as a necessary step for relieving their symptoms. Therefore, men approached the devices as a required and discomforting but worthwhile obligation.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>I was resigned and convinced that I needed to solve the problem because incontinence is inconvenient&#x02026; it&#x02019;s uncomfortable and unpleasant.

This step&#x02010;by&#x02010;step approach involved physiotherapists presenting the idea repeatedly but with kindness and discretion, ensuring patients felt supported rather than pressured. Positive communication, characterised by an empathetic and patient&#x02010;centred narrative, fostered confidence and comfort. This helped participants feel safe and guided through what could be an intimidating experience.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>It felt like, at least in my case, I needed to prepare myself for the idea, try the experience first, see how it went, and then realise that I could try something more.&#x02014;Participant 6, 45 yo, woman</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Moreover, a deep sense of trust in the physiotherapist was necessary in alleviating the discomfort associated with endocavitary devices. This trust allowed participants to view the device as a valuable tool in their rehabilitation process rather than a source of distress.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>I quickly got to know my therapist and understood that they were advising me for my own good.

</p><p>Finally, participants highlighted the importance of being educated on the proper use of the device and understanding why it was useful at that specific stage of their rehabilitation. When physiotherapists contextualised the device's role in recovery and tailored the treatment to the individual's needs, participants reported greater acceptance of the device. This patient&#x02010;centred approach was crucial in building confidence and reducing device resistance.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>Take it very gradually, providing explanations.

</p><p>Thanks to the biofeedback function, participants found that using the devices was crucial in helping them become self&#x02010;managed over time. The flexibility and ease of use of the devices allowed participants to independently train their pelvic floor muscles while monitoring their progress session by session, fostering a sense of empowerment.

</p><p>Participants noted that the structured nature of the programmes offered by these devices helped address the adherence to PFMT, which was experienced as a primary challenge. The device offered clear guidance on timing and contractions (e.g., fast or endurance), reducing the mental effort required and encouraging more frequent training. This made the devices practical and compact &#x02018;trainers&#x02019; for PFMT, allowing participants to use them anywhere and anytime.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>The advantage is knowing exactly how long it takes.

While using them, participants needed to remain focused and actively contract their pelvic floor muscles to build awareness, which is required for the following stages of PFMT, requiring independence from the device.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>I think being an active part of rehabilitation really makes a difference.

For many, the need to undress, often lying down, and ensuring complete privacy at home was a source of anxiety. Additionally, the fear of being interrupted or discovered by relatives while using the device increased their discomfort and made consistent use challenging. Another barrier that hindered discretion was identified in the device design. Participants noted that larger, less portable devices were complex to bring, making them inconvenient to transport or use outside clinical settings.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>You need a quiet place to do them, so it requires some preparation. If you&#x02019;re feeling stressed, your mind races, and it could cause anxiety in certain individuals.&#x02014;Participant 2, 27 yo, woman</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>An important barrier reported was the low accessibility of the devices in terms of costs, operator&#x02010;dependency and clear settings. Devices' costs were reported as expensive and often inaccessible for regular personal use. These constraints limited their use of supervised PFMT sessions in clinical settings, as patients did not have the knowledge and recourses to have them at home. Moreover, participants reported that certain devices required assistance or setup by physiotherapists, reducing their autonomy. Participants expressed a desire for simpler devices, with accessible user interfaces that the user could independently manage.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>Some of these devices aren&#x02019;t accessible because they can only be used by certain professionals. The ones you can use on your own don&#x02019;t, in my opinion, provide the same benefits&#x02014;Participant 2, 27 yo, woman</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Practical challenges in adopting invasive devices also emerged, such as the necessity of lubricants, which participants felt were not sufficiently emphasised in device instructions but were crucial for comfort. One participant, who was blind, noted the lack of accessibility features, such as vocal assistance, which did not facilitate autonomous use.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>Many people assume you don&#x02019;t need lubricant, but I think this should be made clear. I read about it or was told, but the availability to adapt or make changes is crucial if someone isn&#x02019;t ready yet&#x02014;Participant 2, 27 yo, woman</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>To conclude, participants expressed the need for invasive devices to be more user&#x02010;friendly, discreet, and adaptable to diverse needs, enabling greater autonomy and integration into daily life while reducing the logistical and psychological barriers to their use.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>Ease of use. I had trouble with some devices, for instance, setting the heat&#x02026; It should be something that people can manage themselves, automatically.&#x02014;Participant 2, 27 yo, woman</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="pri70071-sec-0140"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>This study explored the experiences of people with UI using invasive devices during PFMT. Participants shared their emotional responses upon being introduced to the devices, ranging from rejection to a sense of obligation and eventually acceptance (&#x02018;A Tool for Pelvic Floor Muscles: from Obligation to Acceptance&#x02019;). Physiotherapists could support people doing PFMT in managing these emotions positively using strategies like gradual exposure, patient education and tailored rehabilitation process (&#x02018;Building Trust Through Gradual Exposure and Tailored Guidance&#x02019;). As participants gained experience with the invasive devices, they recognised how biofeedback function helped them to increase their pelvic floor muscle awareness and self&#x02010;management skills, especially when actively engaged during the use (&#x02018;A Compact Trainer for PFMT&#x02019;). Finally, participants expressed a desire for more practical, accessible and easy to use devices (&#x02018;&#x0201d;Users&#x0201d; Needs: Privacy, Accessibility, Usability, and Autonomy&#x02019;).</p><p>Participants reported a sense of anxiety and discomfort about the idea of using endocavitary devices, perceiving them as &#x02018;not natural&#x02019;, in line with the results of another study on the overall PFMT experience (Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Specifically, a participant worried about &#x02019;what other people would think about me?&#x02019; a thought potentially linked to societal taboos surrounding the pelvic area, which potentially may affect engagement (Xu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), as reported by other authors (Xu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Elenskaia et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pedofsky et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However, not all participants shared this feeling, as some viewed devices as not an issue, especially if they had a positive relationship with their bodies. Men accepted to use anal devices as an obligation step to improve their symptoms, despite describing the experience as unpleasant. This could be linked to societal gendered norms (Connell and Messerschmidt&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Samulowitz A. et&#x000a0;al. investigated gendered norms in chronic pain and reported that men, in line with hegemonic masculinity, associate men's gender identity with strength, power and stoicism (Samulowitz et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In this context, hegemonic masculinity might have led participants to perceive the use of endocavitary devices as feminine and, therefore, a threat to their masculinity (Connell and Messerschmidt&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Clinicians should evaluate if the use of an endocavitary device is fundamental for men with UI, and if so, address gendered misconceptions through education, presenting the device as a supportive treatment rather than a threat to masculinity.</p><p>To overcome negative feelings, participants emphasised the crucial role of a trusting relationship and open communication with the physiotherapists. Being introduced to the invasive devices with kindness, discretion and a gradual approach made acceptance easier (Navarro&#x02010;Braz&#x000e1;lez et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). These results resonate with other studies highlighting how the role of the physiotherapist can influence feelings about PFMT (Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Hay&#x02010;Smith et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Trust in health professionals was considered crucial as it helped participants view devices as valuable rehabilitation tools. Providing education about the devices, explaining their utility and purpose, and contextualising them within patients' needs further improved acceptance. In this sense, patient education is a well&#x02010;known strategy to increase patients' satisfaction with PFMT programmes (Leite et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Grant and Currie&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These supportive strategies described by participants, such as education, reassurance, and progressive exposure, align with behavioural intervention functions such as persuasion and training, facilitating users' capability, opportunity, and motivation to empower PFMT users (Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>).</p><p>The biofeedback function of the invasive devices was highly valued for improving participants' ability to contract pelvic floor muscles, ultimately improving their self&#x02010;management skills, consistent with other studies (Xu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Perrier and Aumont&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Having a device available for home use allowed participants to engage in structured training independently while monitoring their progress. Similarly, Perrier and Aumont highlighted the benefits of using an endocavitary device for improving self&#x02010;management in women with UI (Perrier and Aumont&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). However, participants emphasised how devices should be used with an active approach, focussing on how they contract pelvic floor muscles to become independent and progress within the PFMT without relying on devices. They stressed the importance of cognitive engagement during use to effectively learn pelvic floor muscle control, rather than treating devices as passive treatments. This reflects the view of PFMT as a behavioural therapy, where sustained improvements rely on active participation, motor learning, and psychological involvement, as highlighted by Frawley et&#x000a0;al. (Frawley et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Although quantitative data about the added value of devices to PFMT appears inconsistent regarding clinical symptom improvements (Fernandes et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>; Benedetto et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), our findings suggest how devices could play a role in facilitating PFMT engagement based on patients' perceptions. Specifically, participants' narratives point to psychological benefits such as confidence, autonomy and a greater sense of control. More research is needed to understand which users are most likely to benefit from these behavioural effects, and to what extent.</p><p>Participants also identified some barriers to device use. Privacy concerns were significant, as training required creating an environment where they could undress and lie down without fear of interruption, consistent with findings from studies in other cultural contexts (Giardulli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Mishra et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Some devices lacked discretion, making them unsuitable for travel or visible at home. Additionally, cost was a challenge for some participants, and the devices perceived as most effective often required professional setup or specialised licences, limiting accessibility. Finally, improving the accessibility of these devices for individuals with disabilities, such as those who are blind, is essential for future devices' development.</p><p>Based on participants' experience, possible alternatives could include the development of external, non&#x02010;invasive biofeedback devices, such as pressure sensors, that maintain the benefits of pelvic floor muscle awareness while avoiding the discomfort of endocavitary devices, though without offering physical stimulation (e.g., electrostimulation). Compact, wireless devices would allow a discreet home use, reducing anxiety and privacy concern while increasing autonomy. Audio instructions or tactile feedback features (e.g., vibration) could enhance accessibility for users with visual and hearing impairments, respectively. To support users with limited hand mobility or dexterity (e.g., due to arthritis or neurological conditions), devices should have intuitive controls, voice commands, or app&#x02010;based interfaces with accessibility features. For users with cognitive impairments, simplified instructions and guided, step&#x02010;by&#x02010;step feedback could facilitate safe and effective use (B. A. Lee et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="pri70071-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Devices usable in seated or standing positions would address physical and environmental limitations, making the training more adaptable to daily life. In line with participants' emphasis on active engagement, future designs could include interactive features that promote conscious control of muscle contractions, supporting motor learning rather than passive stimulation use. Finally, co&#x02010;designing such devices with users from diverse backgrounds&#x02014;considering gender, body awareness, and usability preferences&#x02014;may result in more acceptable, effective, and empowering tools for PFMT.</p><p>Some limitations need to be addressed. Participants in this study identified as heterosexual and cisgender, limiting the transferability of findings to LGBTQIA+populations and requiring further research. Additionally, our sample consisted of Italian patients with UI, potentially excluding perspectives from diverse cultural or ethnic backgrounds. Moreover, we included experiences with various types of invasive devices, provided they were endocavitary. Future research focussing on each device type individually could deepen our understanding of users' specific experiences. The study also included people willing to share their experiences, not considering those less inclined to discuss such topics. Moreover, online interviews could also have limited participation from people less comfortable with technology. Online interviews could have hindered the development of trust between participant and interviewer&#x02014;while some participants may have felt more comfortable disclosing from the privacy of their home, others might have preferred the familiarity and warmth of face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face interaction. Finally, this study focused exclusively on participants' therapeutic experiences and did not explore potential sexual pleasure or uses beyond the clinical context, as this was outside its scope and aim. Future studies should consider broader populations to capture diverse perspectives, including how therapeutic devices may intersect with cultural or sexual meanings. Despite these limitations, the study offers valuable insights into the experiences of using invasive devices in people doing PFMT, highlighting critical factors influencing acceptance, usability, and self&#x02010;management outcomes.</p><p>This study highlights the emotional experiences of people with UI using endocavitary devices during PFMT. Participants initially experienced anxiety and discomfort, perhaps influenced by societal taboos. However, these feelings were mitigated through gradual exposure to the devices, positive communication, and education provided by physiotherapists. When used with an active participation, focussing on how to contract the pelvic floor muscles, the devices were particularly valued for enhancing pelvic floor muscle awareness and self&#x02010;management skills and fostering empowerment. Challenges, such as privacy concerns, cost, and usability, highlight the need for improvements in device design and accessibility. Finally, findings emphasise a supportive therapeutic relationship and tailored guidance in promoting device acceptance and PFMT engagement in UI management.</p></sec><sec id="pri70071-sec-0150"><label>5</label><title>Implications of Physiotherapy Practice</title><p>Physiotherapists play a fundamental role in guiding patients through the emotional and practical challenges of using invasive devices during PFMT.
