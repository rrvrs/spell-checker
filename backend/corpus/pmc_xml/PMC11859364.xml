Introduction</title><p>Bluetooth has revolutionized wireless communication by replacing cumbersome wired connections, transforming how devices interact. Since its inception in the late 1990s, Bluetooth has continuously evolved, becoming a versatile standard that facilitates seamless connectivity and efficient data transfer. This manuscript addresses the evolution of Bluetooth and its influence on the future of wireless communication. While the development of Bluetooth involved a team effort, the credit for inventing the core technology goes to Jacobus Cornelis Haartsen, a Dutch electrical engineer working at Ericsson Mobile. In the late 1990s, Bluetooth&#x02019;s journey began with the version 1.0, by replacing clunky cables with short-range wireless connections for headsets and phones. The early 2000s saw a surge in Bluetooth adoption with features like data transfer. The introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in 2010 marked a significant milestone in Bluetooth technology. Gomez et al. provided an early overview and evaluation of BLE, highlighting its potential as an emerging low-power wireless technology [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This early assessment proved prescient, as BLE went on to revolutionize the landscape with its ultra-low power consumption, paving the way for the widespread use of Bluetooth in wearables, smart homes, and the ever-growing Internet of Things (IoT). Bluetooth Technology utilizes short-range radio waves within the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band to connect devices wirelessly. This wireless personal area network technology, overseen by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG), comes in two main types: Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy. Bluetooth Classic or Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) is described in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 1.0 to 3.0. A major shift came in 2010 with Bluetooth version 4.0, introducing Bluetooth Low Energy. This entirely new protocol operates largely independently of Bluetooth Classic. Compared to Bluetooth Classic, BLE is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range. BLE is independent of BR/EDR and has no compatibility, but they are able to coexist. Quite early, as of 2017, Mikhaylov et al. [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] conducted a comparative analysis of BLE, IEEE 802.15.4, and SimpliciTI, demonstrating the superior performance of BLE in energy efficiency, low latency, and theoretical throughput, which solidifies its position as a leading technology for IoT applications. The theoretical maximum throughput of BLE of 320 kbps and a frame turnaround time of under 1 ms highlight its responsiveness and suitability for low-power scenarios. While real-world implementations face software limitations that reduce throughput, with BLE, the significant energy savings and optimized design for short-range communication make it ideal for IoT devices requiring extended battery life and reliable performance. This analysis emphasizes the practicality of BLE and its advantage in supporting modern IoT ecosystems.</p><p>At its core, the IoT ecosystem refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, sensors, software, and networks that collect and exchange data to create smarter and more responsive systems. In an IoT ecosystem, devices can include anything from wearable health monitors and smart home appliances to industrial machines and connected vehicles. These devices are typically equipped with sensors that track parameters such as temperature, motion, or location and actuators that enable devices to perform tasks in response to the collected data. Connectivity, via wireless protocols such as BLE, Wi-Fi, or cellular, allows these devices to communicate with each other or transmit data to edge or cloud platforms for analysis. These data may then trigger automated actions, inform human decision-making, or be visualized in dashboards. Security is essential throughout this process, safeguarding both device integrity and data privacy. By uniting devices, networks, and intelligent data processing, an IoT ecosystem can bring about efficiencies, improve user experiences, and even enable entirely new business models across diverse sectors.</p><p>The primary purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of Bluetooth technology, with a particular focus on BLE, and its pivotal role in the IoT ecosystem.

Technical Specifications: Detailed Technical Aspects of BLE</title><p>To fully understand the capabilities and limitations of BLE in IoT applications, it is essential to delve into its technical specifications.</p><p>This subsection provides an in-depth examination of the technical aspects of BLE, including its power consumption, range, throughput, latency, advertising and scanning, security, topology, frequency, and modulation. The key technical specifications of BLE, compared to its predecessor Bluetooth Classic, are summarized in <xref rid="sensors-25-00996-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, highlighting differences in channels, throughput, radio profiles, power consumption, range, and network topologies.</p><sec id="sec3dot2dot1-sensors-25-00996"><title>3.2.1. Power Consumption</title><p>One of the most notable features of BLE is its remarkably low power consumption. BLE achieves this by using short bursts of data transmission and extended periods of inactivity, known as &#x0201c;nap&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sleep&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;deep sleep&#x0201d; states. This allows devices to operate on small batteries for extended periods, often up to several years, depending on the usage pattern. The low duty cycle, combined with efficient use of the radio, significantly reduces power draw compared to Bluetooth Classic. Bluetooth technology supports transmit powers from &#x02212;20 dBm (0.01 mW) to +20 dBm (100 mW).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot2-sensors-25-00996"><title>3.2.2. Range</title><p>BLE offers a versatile range that can be finely tuned according to the specific requirements of an application. Typically, in open environments characterized by Line-of-Sight (LOS) and minimal radio frequency interference, BLE devices can achieve a range of up to 100 m. However, this range is highly susceptible to environmental factors: (a) obstacles (e.g., thick walls and metal barriers) can significantly reduce the effective range, and (b) interference (e.g., from Wi-Fi routers and microwaves) may degrade the signal quality. To extend the range, BLE devices can utilize higher transmit power settings, albeit at the cost of increased power consumption.</p><p>Moreover, a significant enhancement to the range capabilities of BLE was introduced with BLE in Long Range mode, also known as LE Coded PHY [<xref rid="B17-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-25-00996" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This feature is specifically designed to enhance the range of Bluetooth Low Energy communication without necessitating an increase in transmit power, thereby maintaining power efficiency. LE Coded PHY achieves this through Forward Error Correction (FEC) and coding schemes that allow for more reliable data transmission over longer distances. The implementation of LE Coded PHY has a profound impact on the achievable range of BLE devices. In theoretical terms, it can extend the range up to four (4) times the original distance, reaching approximately 400 m under ideal conditions. More practically, this enhancement significantly improves connectivity in challenging environments, which particularly benefits applications that rely on reliable long-range communication, such as those found in industrial or smart infrastructure settings. Additionally, the sensitivity of the receiver remains a critical factor in maintaining reliable long-range communication. The wireless signal degrades predictably over distance, following the inverse square law. For example, a low-sensitivity receiver, with a sensitivity below &#x02212;90 dBm, may struggle to decipher information accurately at longer ranges. With a 6 dBm sensitivity increase, the range should theoretically double. Advancements in receiver technology, such as improved filtering and amplifier designs, have further enhanced the sensitivity of modern BLE devices, thereby supporting more robust long-range communication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot3-sensors-25-00996"><title>3.2.3.
