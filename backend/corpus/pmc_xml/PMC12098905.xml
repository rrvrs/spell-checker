Metabolic reprogramming in tumors plays a pivotal role in promoting cancer progression. However, little is known about the metabolic alterations in tumors that drive cancer drug resistance in patients with PDAC. Here, we identified acyl-CoA thioesterase 8 (ACOT8) as a key player in driving PDAC gemcitabine (GEM) resistance. The expression of ACOT8 is significantly upregulated in GEM-resistant PDAC tissues and is closely associated with poor survival in patients with PDAC. Gain- and loss-of-function studies have shown that ACOT8 drives PDAC GEM resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ACOT8 regulates cellular cholesterol ester (CE) levels, decreases the levels of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) that bind to polyunsaturated fatty acids and promote peroxisome activation. The knockdown of ACOT8 promotes ferroptosis and increases the chemosensitivity of tumors to GEM by inducing ferroptosis-associated pathway activation in PDAC cell lines. The combination of orlistat, an ACOT8 inhibitor, and GEM significantly inhibited tumor growth in PDAC organoid and mouse models. This study reveals the biological importance of ACOT8 and provides a potential combination therapy for treating patients with advanced GEM-resistant PDAC.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Pharmacological Society 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Pancreatic cancer, a highly heterogeneous tumor of the pancreas, is characterized by high malignancy and mortality rates. More than 90% of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which arises from the exocrine cells of the pancreas and produces digestive enzymes. Among U.S. cancer-related deaths, PDAC represents one of the top 10 causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and it is expected to become the second leading cause of death by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The number of patients with PDAC in China has increased, and surgical resection is the major treatment, but fewer than 20% of patients are eligible for surgery. Recently, extensive research and advanced clinical diagnosis and treatment of PDAC have notably advanced, but the 5-year survival rate of patients with PDAC has not significantly improved. Limited effective chemotherapeutic options are available for PDAC treatment, and gemcitabine (GEM) is still the major first-in-class chemotherapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of patients with advanced PDAC; however, it is common for patients with gemcitabine resistance to develop resistance after receiving active treatment for a few weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, the identification and development of effective drugs for the treatment of GEM-resistant PDAC patients is of clinical importance.</p><p id="Par3">Cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming refers to a series of alterations in extracellular and intracellular metabolites, including glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and redox metabolism, that occur during tumor proliferation and progression. It plays an important role in gene expression and regulation, cellular biosynthesis, and tumor microenvironment remodeling, which result in the maintenance and evolution of the tumorigenic state. Acetyl-CoA is an important intermediate metabolite from the production of catabolic reactions. It is not only used as a precursor of lipid biosynthesis but also as a substrate for acetylation reactions that regulate dynamic acetylation and the structure of histones. Homeostasis of the cellular acetyl-CoA level is required for the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including cell growth and mitosis, transcription/translation control, and metabolism. In mammalian cells, acetyl-CoA is generated by two major catalytic enzymes, acetyl-CoA synthetase 1/2 (ACSS1/2) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase (ACLY), which are reported to play important roles in tumor progression. In addition, acetyl-CoA is metabolized exclusively by the hydrolytic enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT). Among this family, acyl-CoA thioesterase 8 (ACOT8) has been shown to be crucially involved in peroxisome function and mammalian lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It can hydrolyze activated fatty acids to free fatty acids and CoASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, ACOT8 was found to promote tumor development in lung and liver cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Two studies also revealed that ACOT8 was closely associated with cellular ferroptosis in urological tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, its roles in the development of PDAC and GEM resistance are still largely unknown.</p><p id="Par4">Ferroptosis, a novel form of iron-dependent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], is characterized by lipid peroxidation. Crucial ferroptosis-related molecules and complexes include p53, voltage-dependent anion channels, cystine/glutamate antiporters (heterodimers composed of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2), and glutathione peroxidase (especially GPX4). Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is the critical nexus between metabolism and tumor progression. Notably, ferroptosis induction has been shown to influence the effectiveness of several conventional cancer treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], indicating that ferroptosis is a potential target for overcoming tumor chemoresistance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Modulation of the expression of key molecules in the ferroptosis pathway to induce ferroptosis or reduce ferroptosis suppression may be an effective treatment option for patients with gemcitabine-resistant PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Specifically, in our previous study, we reported that SMAD4 can bind to the promoter of GPX4 and inhibit GPX4 transcription in PDAC. TGF-&#x003b2;1 increased tumor sensitivity to the ferroptosis inducer RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) via the SMAD4-GPX4 axis in SMAD4-positive organoids and pancreas xenograft models. Importantly, SMAD4 enhanced combination therapy with GEM and RSL3 in highly invasive PDAC cells. Ferroptosis is a complex, multistep process that is regulated by a multifaceted network in different temporal and spatial cellular contexts. The regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis by acetyl-CoA metabolic reprogramming via ACOT8 in PDAC remains elusive. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of ferroptosis is of great importance in the development of effective strategies to reduce GEM resistance.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we further identified ACOT8 as a key player in PDAC progression, investigated its critical roles in acetyl-CoA metabolism and GEM resistance, and revealed its potential value as a new therapeutic target for combination therapy in patients with advanced GEM-resistant PDAC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and&#x000a0;methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par6">Selleckchem provided the ferroptosis inducers RSL3, erastin, gemcitabine, and orlistat.

Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing and analysis of ACOT8-overexpressing and ACOT8-knockdown cell lines were performed using PANOMIX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.panomix.com/">https://www.panomix.com/</ext-link>). Raw data (raw reads) in fastq format were first processed through in-house Perl scripts. In this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapters, reads containing poly-N sequences and low-quality reads from the raw data. Moreover, the Q20, Q30 and GC contents of the clean data were calculated. All the downstream analyses were based on high-quality, clean data. The reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded directly from the genome website, and HISAT2 v2.0.5 was used to construct the reference genome index and compare the paired-end clean reads to the reference genome. We chose HISAT2 as the comparison tool because HISAT2 can generate splice junction databases on the basis of gene model annotation files, thus obtaining better comparison results than other nonsplice comparison tools. FPKM, the expected number of fragments per kilobase of transcript sequences per million base pairs sequenced, takes into account both the sequencing depth and gene length and is the most commonly used method to estimate gene expression levels, considering the effects of sequencing depth and gene length on read counts. Statistical routines for both were provided by the DESeq2 R package (1.20.0), which uses a model based on the negative binomial distribution to determine differential expression in numerical gene expression data and adjusts the <italic>P</italic> values to control for false discovery rates using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was implemented by the clusterProfiler R software package with correction for gene length bias, and GO terms with corrected <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes. KEGG is a database resource for understanding the high-level function and utility of biological systems, such as cells, organisms, and ecosystems, from molecular-level information, particularly large-scale molecular datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>) generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental techniques. We examined the statistical enrichment of differentially expressed genes in KEGG pathways using the clusterProfiler R package. The Reactome database includes a wide range of responses and biological pathways from human model species. The DO (Disease Ontology) database describes the functions of human genes and diseases, and DO pathways with corrected <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational method for determining whether a predefined genome is significantly and consistently different between two biological states. Genes are ranked according to their degree of differential expression in the two samples and then tested to determine whether the predefined genome is enriched at the top or bottom of the list. We used a local version of the GSEA tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp</ext-link> for independent GSEA of the GO, KEGG, Reactome, DO and DisGeNET datasets. SNP calls were made using GATK (v4.1.1.0) software. The GATK standard filtering method for raw vcf files was used (other: FS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;30.0; DP&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10). Alternative splicing is an important mechanism for regulating the expression of genes and proteins. rMATS (4.1.0) software was used to analyze AS events. PPI analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed via the STRING database, which includes known and predicted protein&#x02012;protein interactions. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) is a systematic biological method for characterizing patterns of gene associations between different samples and can be used to identify highly synergistically varying sets of genes and to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets on the basis of gene set concordance and correlation between gene sets and phenotypes. The WGCNA package is a set of functions for calculating a wide variety of weighted correlation analyses, which can be used for network construction, gene screening, gene cluster identification, topological characterization, data simulation, and visualization. WGCNA is suitable for multisample data analysis, which typically requires more than 15 samples. One input file contains the sample information, i.e., the matrix describing the traits of the sample. Traits for association analysis must be numeric variables; if they are regional or categorical variables, they need to be converted to a 0&#x02013;1 matrix. The other input file contains gene expression data; for transcriptome sequencing, FPKM data can be used as gene expression data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Nontargeted lipid metabolome sequencing</title><p id="Par22">Sequencing of the untargeted lipid metabolome of ACOT8-knockdown cell lines and controls was performed using PANOMIX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.panomix.com/">https://www.panomix.com/</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par23">LC&#x02012;MS-grade isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK).

Finally, 4 patients each were included in the SENS and RESIS groups. PDAC tissues were subjected to transcriptome sequencing and analysis to assess the differences in the levels of cellular metabolites in patients with GEM-resistant PDAC. In particular, lipid metabolism and acetyl-CoA metabolism were significantly different between the RESIS and the SENS control groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). We further analyzed the differentially expressed genes between the two groups and found that ACOT8, which plays a key role in regulating lipid metabolism and acetyl-CoA metabolism, was significantly overexpressed in the RESIS group. However, the remaining ACOT family members did not show significant differential expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), suggesting that ACOT8 may be crucially involved in gemcitabine resistance. Analysis of the PAAD_GSE148673 dataset revealed that ACOT8 was enriched in epithelial and malignant cells in PDAC tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), and analysis of ACOT8 expression levels in the TCGA database revealed significantly higher ACOT8 expression levels in cancer tissues than in paracancerous tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), which further suggests that ACOT8 may be involved in PDAC development. Tissue specimens for the TMA obtained from FUSCC were used for IHC and stain intensity scoring (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).

Different patient-derived PDAC organoids, especially those derived from patient 3 (P3), presented increased sensitivity to gemcitabine following ACOT8 knockdown (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

Next, we identified overlapping genes among genes upregulated and downregulated in the ACOT8-overexpression and ACOT8-knockdown groups, respectively, as well as genes highly expressed in patients with drug resistance. Consequently, we identified two common differentially expressed genes, namely, ACOT8 and SLC7A11 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). As mentioned earlier, SLC7A11 upregulation may inhibit cellular ferroptosis. KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes identified through cellular transcriptome analysis suggested the involvement of the ferroptosis pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Cellular transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of ferroptosis-promoting genes, such as <italic>ACSL4, LPCAT3, SAT1</italic>, and <italic>SLC39A8</italic>, was negatively correlated with ACOT8 expression levels. In contrast, the expression levels of ferroptosis-inhibiting genes, including <italic>SLC7A11, SLC3A2</italic>, and <italic>PCBP1</italic>, were positively correlated with ACOT8 expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The alterations in the expression of these genes were consistent with the results of the TCGA database analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>), which further demonstrated that elevated ACOT8 expression inhibited ferroptosis. To further determine the effect of altered ACOT8 expression on the cellular ferroptotic phenotype, we performed a C11-BODIPY assay and observed ferroptosis promotion in ACOT8-knockdown cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. A significant increase in the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate, which represents the level of lipid peroxidation, was noted, with the peak shifting to the right in the ACOT8-knockdown group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Furthermore, the intensity of green fluorescence, which represents the lipid peroxidation site, was greater in the ACOT8-knockdown group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).

The results revealed that both the ROS and MDA levels were significantly increased in the ACOT8-knockdown group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f, g</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that ACOT8 expression is negatively correlated with ferroptosis in PDAC cells. Additionally, these genetic and phenotypic alterations involve diverse ferroptotic regulatory pathways, suggesting that ACOT8 may affect ferroptosis through diverse mechanisms.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Transcriptome sequencing clustering revealed the ferroptotic pathway, and functional assays validated the inhibitory effect of ACOT8 on ferroptosis.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Comparisons of genes upregulated in the overexpression group, genes downregulated in the two knockout groups, and genes highly expressed in drug-resistant patients were performed, resulting in the identification of two common differentially expressed genes: ACOT8 and SLC7A11. <bold>b</bold> Pathway clustering of the differentially expressed genes revealed the ferroptotic pathway. <bold>c</bold> Differential mRNA expression of ferroptosis-related genes in different ACOT8 expression groups. <bold>d</bold> Detection of lipid peroxidation levels by flow cytometry in cells after ACOT8 knock down (with the ferroptosis probe BODIPY 581/591C11). <bold>e</bold> Detection of lipid peroxidation levels by immunofluorescence in cells after ACOT8 knock down (with the ferroptosis probe BODIPY 581/591C11). <bold>f</bold>,<bold> g</bold> Detection of ROS and MDA levels in cells after ACOT8 knock down.

We performed WB to verify the effect of altered ACOT8 expression on the expression levels of ferroptosis-related proteins. The findings indicated that NRF2, SLC3A2, SLC7A11, and GPX4 levels were positively correlated with ACOT8 expression levels; in contrast, KEAP1 expression levels were negatively correlated with ACOT8 expression levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), which was consistent with the inhibitory effect of ACOT8 on ferroptosis. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse subcutaneous tumors further confirmed the altered SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). For further analysis, erastin was used to inhibit the Xc system, which consists of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2. Assays of cellular lipid peroxidation and ROS levels revealed that erastin reversed the inhibitory effect of ACOT8 overexpression on ferroptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref>). These findings demonstrate that SLC7A11, a downstream molecule of ACOT8, plays a crucially role in the antiferroptotic mechanism. In addition, as ACOT8 functions as a regulatory enzyme for lipid metabolism, untargeted lipid transcriptome sequencing was conducted to determine differences in lipid metabolism between the ACOT8-knockdown and control groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Among the observed changes, we focused on changes in the cellular CE and PE levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). We found that ACOT8 knockdown significantly decreased the intracellular levels of various CE molecules, which have been shown to play procancer roles in PDAC by participating in metabolism or regulating signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In contrast, the PE levels tended to increase. Moreover, ACOT8 knockdown significantly increased the levels of several PEs bound to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially PEs containing 20:4 and 18:2, which are the main sites of lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The results revealed that after ACOT8 knockdown, the levels of multiple phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), including 20:4 (arachidonic acid, AA) and 18:2 (linoleic acid, LA), significantly increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). The increased content of AA and LA in membrane phospholipids may render them more susceptible to lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. During ferroptosis, PCs and PEs containing the aforementioned PUFAs are preferentially oxidized, and the resulting oxidized phospholipids are considered important death signal molecules in ferroptosis, with their accumulation being closely related to the outcome of cellular ferroptosis. These results suggest another mechanism through which ACOT8 regulates growth and ferroptosis from the perspective of lipid metabolism. To explore the typical manifestation of the antiferroptotic effect of ACOT8 at the subcellular level, we performed transmission electron microscopy examination of the cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). The mitochondria of the cells in the control group showed bulging and breakage in response to the drug, without ferroptosis. In contrast, the mitochondria of the cells in the ACOT8-knockdown group were in the typical ferroptotic stage and were partially solidified, with a slightly increased density of the membrane and intramembrane matrix; moreover, the mitochondrial cristae showed obvious expansion (red arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). It was difficult to identify peroxisomes in cells in the ACOT8-knockdown group using electron microscopy; however, they were visible in the cells in the control group (blue arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). According to BioGRID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thebiogrid.org/">https://thebiogrid.org/</ext-link>), ACOT8 is localized in peroxisomes and interacts with peroxisome biogenesis factor 5. To investigate whether ACOT8 expression affects peroxisomes, we performed confocal microscopy to observe the expression of the peroxisome-specific marker catalase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>). We observed significantly lower catalase expression in the ACOT8-knockdown group than in the control group. This indirectly reflects the regulatory effect of ACOT8 on peroxisomal function. Peroxisomes are crucial ROS-scavenging organelles that protect against ferroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Overall, these results suggest that ACOT8 inhibits ferroptosis by promoting the expression of antiferroptotic genes, regulating lipid metabolism, and promoting peroxisome function, which consequently results in procancer effects.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Acyl-CoA thioesterase 8 (ACOT8) inhibits ferroptosis by regulating the expression of core ferroptosis-related genes, the metabolism of cholesterol and polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and the number and function of peroxisomes.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Effects of altering ACOT8 expression on the expression of ferroptosis-related genes. <bold>b</bold> Altered expression levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11 verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to stain subcutaneous tumor blocks in mice. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Verification of the ability of 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M erastin to reverse ferroptosis resistance induced by ACOT8 overexpression via the ferroptosis probe BODIPY 581/591C11 and ROS detection. <bold>e</bold> Untargeted lipid transcriptome sequencing of MIA PaCa-2 cells after ACOT8 knock down. <bold>f</bold> Changes in the content and composition of cholesterol and PE in cells after ACOT8 knock down. <bold>g</bold> Typical ferroptosis in the mitochondria of cells after ACOT8 knock down was observed by transmission electron microscopy (red arrows: mitochondria; blue arrows: peroxisomes). <bold>h</bold> Altered expression of the peroxisome marker catalase in the ACOT8-knockdown group.

Therefore, we treated MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells with orlistat and performed WB after 3 days. Our findings revealed that orlistat inhibited the expression of ACOT8 as well as the ferroptosis suppressor genes SLC7A11 and GPX4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Additionally, orlistat reversed the promoting effect of ACOT8 overexpression on colony formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Similarly, C11-BODIPY assays, ROS assays, transmission electron microscopy, and organoid assays revealed that orlistat attenuated the inhibitory effect of ACOT8 overexpression on ferroptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c&#x02013;f</xref>). To increase basal ferroptosis and accentuate between-group differences, we induced ferroptosis using hemin, which is a ferrous ion carrier that is not related to the possible mechanism under investigation. With respect to peroxisome function and lipid metabolism, orlistat similarly reversed the promotion of peroxisomal function and reduction in CE levels induced by ACOT8 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g, h</xref>). Overall, orlistat can inhibit ACOT8 expression and the downstream ferroptosis inhibitory pathway. Moreover, it can functionally reverse the changes caused by high ACOT8 expression in various ways; therefore, orlistat can be considered a potential ACOT8 inhibitor.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>The lipid-lowering drug orlistat reverses the protective effect of acyl-CoA thioesterase 8 (ACOT8) on ferroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting ACOT8 expression.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Expression of ACOT8, SLC7A11, and GPX4 after 2 weeks of treatment of cells with graded concentrations of orlistat. <bold>b</bold> In the colony formation assays, 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;M orlistat reversed the increase in AsPC-1 cell proliferation caused by ACOT8 overexpression. <bold>c</bold>,<bold> d</bold> Orlistat (30&#x02009;&#x003bc;M in cells) reversed ferroptosis resistance caused by ACOT8 overexpression when hemin was included in the background. <bold>e</bold>,<bold> f</bold> Orlistat (30&#x02009;&#x003bc;M in cells; 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M in organoids) reversed ferroptosis resistance caused by ACOT8 overexpression when hemin was included in the background. <bold>g</bold> Orlistat reversed catalase overexpression caused by ACOT8 overexpression. <bold>h</bold> Effects of orlistat on cholesterol and PE contents in the ACOT8-overexpression group.

The findings indicated that orlistat alone had a weak inhibitory effect on PDAC; however, it significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of gemcitabine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a, b</xref>). Moreover, IC<sub>50</sub> assays confirmed that the coadministration of orlistat with gemcitabine significantly reduced the IC<sub>50</sub> of gemcitabine in PDAC cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). For the animal experiments, we administered intraperitoneal injections of low-dose gemcitabine (30&#x02009;mg/kg) or orlistat (10&#x02009;mg/kg) to each group of mice at 3-day intervals. Within 15 days, the tumor diameter in the gemcitabine + orlistat group significantly decreased, exhibiting significantly greater efficacy than the other groups. After 15 days of treatment, the tumors of mice in the gemcitabine + orlistat group were significantly smaller than those of mice in the gemcitabine or orlistat groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>).

Although gemcitabine is effective in the early stages of its application, patients with PDAC often develop gemcitabine resistance over time, resulting in a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify key molecules involved in gemcitabine resistance by investigating altered gene expression levels in gemcitabine-resistant tumor tissues. Transcriptomic sequencing analysis identified the core molecule, ACOT8, as a differentially expressed gene. Notably, the downstream molecule SLC7A11, which was identified in subsequent analyses, also demonstrated consistent differential expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), further suggesting a strong connection between ACOT8 and SLC7A11 and the potential of targeting ferroptosis to overcome gemcitabine resistance. The relationship between ferroptosis and tumor therapy has been widely recognized, with many reports indicating that ferroptosis induction promotes the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or directly kills tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">To determine the effects of ACOT8 on phenotype, we established ACOT8-overexpression and ACOT8-knockdown cell lines, as well as the corresponding controls. We observed that ACOT8 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and gemcitabine resistance in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, ACOT8 overexpression affected the morphology of AsPC-1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), which exhibit a low level of differentiation. However, under conditions of ACOT8 overexpression, these cells were more inclined to transform into shuttle-shaped cells. This change in cell morphology was stable and consistent with other experimental results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear, and determining whether this phenomenon is associated with ferroptosis is important. We speculate that this phenomenon is related to the effect of ACOT8 overexpression on lipid metabolism.</p><p id="Par40">To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we determined the antiferroptotic effect of ACOT8 using transcriptome sequencing and subsequent experiments. The role of the antiferroptotic effect in chemotherapeutic agent resistance, especially gemcitabine resistance, has been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We believe that both the role of ferroptosis in gemcitabine resistance and the mechanism through which ACOT8 regulates ferroptosis are complex and comprehensive and should not be understood only in terms of limited gene pathway regulation. We interpreted the role of ACOT8 with respect to the regulation of key genes involved in ferroptosis, alterations in lipid metabolism, and peroxisomal alterations. Although it is difficult to elucidate a mechanism that integrates these three effects, we speculate that the regulation of lipid metabolism may contribute to peroxisomal alterations. This is because cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine are crucial components of organelle membranes; additionally, their reduced levels in ACOT8-knockdown cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>) may have affected the structural integrity of the intracellular membranes, which led to a reduction in the number and function of peroxisomes. Additionally, ACOT8 knockdown increased the levels of PEs bound to PUFAs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>), whereas the total amount of PEs was not affected by the ACOT8 expression level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>). These findings suggest that ACOT8 is involved in altering the proportion of PEs containing proferroptotic motifs rather than altering the total number of PEs.</p><p id="Par41">Additionally, previous research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and our coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments with the ACOT8 protein both demonstrated a direct interaction between ACOT8 and PEX5. The primary role of PEX5 is to bind proteins containing peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) and to participate in the protein import process into peroxisomes. Consequently, the entry of ACOT8 into peroxisomes is regulated by PEX5. These findings also suggest that functional alterations in PEX5 may impact the gemcitabine resistance mediated by ACOT8.</p><p id="Par42">In addition, we assayed DCK1, HENT1, and RRM1, which are crucial for gemcitabine resistance in PDAC, through WB and observed no correlation of their expression with ACOT8-mediated gemcitabine resistance (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). These findings indicate that ACOT8-mediated gemcitabine resistance is regulated via a novel pathway.</p><p id="Par43">Our findings suggest that orlistat induces ferroptosis and overcomes gemcitabine resistance by inhibiting ACOT8 expression. Currently, the mode of administration available for orlistat does not allow it to enter the blood circulation, but it affects intestinal cells. However, the direct action of orlistat on tumor cells is known to induce ferroptosis and inhibit tumor cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, exploring alternative modes of orlistat administration may be beneficial for further clinical applications.</p><p id="Par44">This article has several limitations that require further clarification in subsequent studies. Owing to the limitations of our nontargeted lipidomic detection technology, the examination of cellular cholesterol metabolism included only various cholesterol esters and did not detect changes in the content of free cholesterol. Therefore, further experiments involving more targeted detection are needed to more comprehensively elucidate the impact of ACOT8 on cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, this study struggled to elucidate the precise relationship between the enzymatic function of ACOT8 and its role in ferroptosis resistance, and it failed to identify other specific mechanisms by which ACOT8 regulates ferroptosis. We detected changes in the cellular acetyl-CoA content and histone acetylation levels, and the experimental results were consistent with the enzymatic function of ACOT8 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c, d</xref>). However, the effects of ACOT8 on gene expression, lipid metabolism, peroxisome number, and function remain unclear. To further explore the mechanisms by which changes in ACOT8 expression lead to these effects, acetylation proteomic sequencing and isotopic labeling molecular pathway studies of lipid metabolism may be necessary. Finally, this study primarily discusses the protective role of ACOT8 against ferroptosis under the stress conditions caused by a chemotherapy drug (gemcitabine). These results indicate that ACOT8 can exert stress-protective effects by participating in the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism. However, the regulatory role of ACOT8 in the metabolic state of pancreatic cancer cells and the mechanism of ferroptosis under other common stress conditions (such as hypoxia) remain to be explored. Future research could focus on the metabolic regulatory effects of ACOT8 under various stress conditions, with the aim of comprehensively elucidating other potential stress-protective mechanisms of ACOT8.</p><p id="Par45">In summary, our findings demonstrate that ACOT8 is an important molecule for gemcitabine resistance. Further studies revealed that the promoting effect of ACOT8 on gemcitabine resistance was closely related to its antiferroptotic effect. Additionally, we investigated the possible regulatory mechanisms of ACOT8 in ferroptosis from three perspectives: gene pathways, lipid metabolism, and organelle function (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The regulatory effect of orlistat on ACOT8 expression further demonstrates its potential clinical significance in PDAC chemotherapy. In conclusion, the combined administration of orlistat and gemcitabine may contribute to overcoming gemcitabine resistance and thus improve the prognosis of patients.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>ACOT8 inhibited gemcitabine-induced pancreatic cancer cell &#x000a0;ferroptosis by regulating ferroptosis-related gene pathways, organelle function, and lipid metabolism, thereby inducing pancreatic cancer gemcitabine resistance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41401_2025_1477_Fig9_HTML" id="d33e1148"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
