In addition to providing protection against the target disease, they offer the potential to prevent transmission, provide cross-protection by stimulating humoral and cellular immunity, and allow versatility in application routes. The SARS-CoV-2 LAV candidate, OTS-228, has demonstrated excellent safety and high efficacy in preclinical models, inducing transmission-blocking immunity and providing full protection, even against variants such as Omicron BA.2, BA.5, and XBB.1.5. However, to ensure that OTS-228 has no dose-dependent side effects and to evaluate potential risk of reversion to virulence&#x02014;a known general issue with live vaccines&#x02014;detailed characterization of LAV OTS-228 is essential. To address this, we conducted four different experiments using Syrian hamsters, a model for moderate to severe COVID-19. A maximum dose trial confirmed the vaccine&#x02019;s full attenuation and prevention of transmission, even at high doses. In addition, four intentional serial in vivo passages demonstrated the genomic stability of the vaccine and the non-infectivity of nasal washings. Furthermore, OTS-228 maintained its attenuation and immunogenicity even after 15 additional in vitro passages, providing full protection against lung infection with virulent SARS-CoV-2 strains. Finally, a low-dose experiment confirmed the high efficacy of the vaccine candidate, establishing the protective dose 50 (PD<sub>50</sub>) at less than 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> per hamster. Our results provide strong evidence for the safety and efficacy of the LAV candidate OTS-228 and supports its potential as a safe and effective vaccine in a highly relevant preclinical model.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Adaptive immunity</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Virology</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>Respiratory tract diseases</kwd><kwd>Infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Live vaccines may offer several important advantages over other types of vaccines, including prevention of transmission, improved cross-protection against antigenically diverse virus variants, and the potential for non-invasive delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Our previously described live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (LAV), OTS-228, has demonstrated optimal safety as it is well attenuated in preclinical animal models and does not transmit to serologically na&#x000ef;ve contacts when administered at moderate titers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Attenuation was achieved by converting 325 serine and leucine codons in the ORF1ab into so-called &#x0201c;one-to-stop&#x0201d; (OTS) codons, which are just one random mutation away from becoming stop codons, thereby placing the virus in an unfavorable evolutionary niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This was combined with two amino acid changes (K164A, H165A) in non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), the deletion of accessory open reading frames (ORFs) 6-8, and the deletion of the spike S1/S2 polybasic cleavage site (PCS) (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, OTS-228 has demonstrated high efficacy by inducing sterile immunity when challenged with the antigenically matching SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT), and provided clinical protection against various variants of concern, such as Omicron BA.2, BA.5, and XBB.1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">LAVs are still replication-competent, and reversion to virulence has been reported for other LAVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is crucial to test the stability of attenuation and to estimate the potential for regaining virulence. Additionally, protection provided by LAVs at low dosages would be a highly beneficial feature for subsequent clinical trials and applications. To address these points, we conducted four separate experiments in Syrian hamsters, an established and sensitive preclinical model of COVID-19.</p><p id="Par4">The first objective was to confirm the attenuation of OTS-228 and its lack of transmission between Syrian hamsters following administration of the possible maximum dose of 10<sup>6.1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> per hamster. Second, we evaluated the genetic stability of OTS-228 through both in vivo and in vitro passaging. In vivo, OTS-228 was intentionally passaged four times from hamster to hamster. In vitro, the OTS-228 LAV was passaged 15 times using Vero E6 cells and then used to vaccinate Syrian hamsters at the maximum feasible dose to confirm the attenuated phenotype and immunogenic profile. These hamsters were subsequently challenged with virulent SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants to verify preserved efficacy. Finally, we determined the minimal dose of OTS-228 to induce a robust immune response and provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 WT infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intranasal administration of a maximum dose of OTS-228 in Syrian hamsters confirms attenuation and absence of transmission</title><p id="Par5">To determine whether OTS-228 has an optimal safety profile even when administered at a maximum dose, we intranasally vaccinated Syrian hamsters (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) at the highest technically feasible dose, equivalent to an infectious titer of 10<sup>6.1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> per animal, as confirmed by back titration of the inoculum.

Because LAVs mimic natural infections, they are typically administered at the site of infection and induce, in case of respiratory infections, local mucosal immune responses.

The most established live vaccines against diseases like measles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, mumps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, rubella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, yellow fever<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> or poliomyelitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> were generated traditionally by unspecific passaging in various cell cultures or embryonated chicken eggs. In contrast, OTS-228 was strategically designed by combining several attenuating genome modifications. For each of these modifications alone an attenuating effect is described: Nsp1 K164A, H165A mutations prevents host cell protein synthesis shut down<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, spike cleavage site deletion is attenuating and prevent spreading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, large scale OTS-codon modifications increase chance of stop codon generation and reduces translational efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and the deletion of ORF6-8 prevents down regulation of the host immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Only a slight interstitial, perivascular and peribronchial infiltration of immune cells and some associated viral antigen was detected. In comparison, non-attenuated ancestral SARS-CoV-2 caused significant mortality, marked weight loss and severe pneumonia even at doses more than 1000 times lower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, highlighting the safety of OTS-228. In addition, our study revealed that even at this artificial maximum dose, the vaccine virus was not transmitted to na&#x000ef;ve contact animals. This underscores its safety profile, especially considering that many studies have reported 100% transmission rates for unattenuated SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian hamsters in direct contact, even at much lower titers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">A concern with LAVs is the potential for reversion to a more virulent form, as seen with the cold-adapted influenza virus vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To address this potential concern, we extensively tested OTS-228 for genomic stability, focusing on the integrity of the introduced attenuating modifications. Therefore, we passaged OTS-228 in vivo using the hamster model. Notably, passage was only successful using homogenized nasal tissue samples; nasal washing samples were not infectious to na&#x000ef;ve hamsters. This supporting the non-transmissible nature of OTS-228 under direct contact conditions as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. It has been reported that OTS-228<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, like other modified and unmodified SARS-CoV-2 strains, does not transmit in vivo when the spike S1/S2 PCS is removed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This indicates that the PCS is critical for both virulence and transmission.</p><p id="Par28">Sequencing of the viral genome obtained from homogenized nasal conchae tissue after four passages in vivo in hamsters revealed only two non-synonymous mutations - one in nsp3 and one in the spike protein - outside the altered genomic regions, suggesting no increased virulence. The integrity of the sequence-based attenuation was further confirmed when we vaccinated hamsters with the highest possible dose (10<sup>6.0</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/hamster) of a 15-times in-vitro-passaged OTS-228. Despite some accumulated mutations that are expected in cell culture, this strain retained its fully attenuated phenotype in vivo. Unlike other LAVs, where reversion to virulence can occur with only a few point mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, OTS-228&#x02019;s attenuation relies on several mechanisms including numerous OTS-codons, point mutations (nsp1), deletion of specific domains (spike PCS), and full-gene deletions (ORFs 6-8), making full reversion to virulence highly unlikely.</p><p id="Par29">However, one of six serologically na&#x000ef;ve direct-contact animals picked up OTS-228 P.15 shortly after co-housing with a vaccinated animal, and nasal washing samples at 3 dpv (2 days post co-housing) tested positive for the vaccine genome. Genome analysis revealed no major changes; all mutations present at a frequency greater than 50% were already present in the inoculum. This transmission was likely due to residual high-titer inoculum taken up immediately after co-housing. This is supported by the in vivo passaging results, which clearly showed that nasal washing samples from OTS-228-infected hamsters could not cause infection after direct nasal inoculation of hamster. Nevertheless, transmission in 1/6 cases is rare, in a direct contact setup, compared to the 100% transmission rate for unmodified SARS-CoV-2 in na&#x000ef;ve hamsters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Despite the fact that our direct contact setup does not correspond to the situation in the human population, where mainly airborne transmission plays a role, it has been demonstrated in hamster studies that transmission efficacy is comparable in both direct contact and airborne experimental setups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Consequently, it is hypothesized that, if transmission of OTS-228 occurs at all, it should be also minimal under airborne conditions in the human population.</p><p id="Par30">OTS-228 maintained its genomic integrity and attenuated phenotype without reversion to virulence, as confirmed by deep-sequencing. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine were unaffected by a few non-synonymous mutations. The extensive point mutations and deletions in the OTS-228 genome make reversion to virulence unlikely, requiring cumulative mutations and recombination events, that did not occur under experimental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. OTS-228 also demonstrated efficacy at low doses, which is important for practical vaccination strategies. When hamsters were vaccinated with less than 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> per animal, 50% showed efficient immune responses and protection against wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Responders to the low-dose immunization showed similar protection to those receiving higher doses. This demonstrates one of the advantages of LAVs: even small amounts of the vaccine can be effective, potentially reducing production costs.</p><p id="Par31">In order to make a valid comparison between the efficacy of OTS-228 and other live attenuated or mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the present study has adopted a established interval of 21 days between immunization and challenge in preclinical animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, in the context of a pandemic, as evidenced by the experience with SARS-CoV-2, there is an imperative for rapid development and adaptation of new vaccines. This constitutes a further rationale for choosing a short interval and single-dose immunization for our trial. As demonstrated by both previous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and current data, OTS-228 induces high titres of neutralizing antibodies 14 days after vaccination, with the majority of the vaccine virus being cleared by this time. Following a natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, seroconversion occurs within the first two weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and the peak of neutralizing antibodies is observed after three to four weeks post onset of symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. It can therefore be concluded that, at the time of challenge 21 days after vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine, the humoral immune response is already well developed. Further, OTS-228 elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies in nasal and lung tissues just 5 days post infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, it should be noted that there is currently no evidence to prove that these are the more potent dimeric secretory IgA antibodies. Further investigations are required to clarify this. Nevertheless, the potential for innate immune effects, such as viral interference in influencing protective immunity after 21 days, cannot be completely excluded. Longer intervals than those used in this study are needed to investigate cellular and long-term immunity.</p><p id="Par32">The objective of this study was to enhance the characterization of OTS-228 and to demonstrate its efficacy. The study thus challenged against Alpha and Delta variants, which present the most severe challenge in the hamster model, rather than the more recent Omicron variants, against which hamsters already show reduced pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In a previous study, we have shown that OTS-228 is also capable of mediating cross-protective immunity against more recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 including Omicron BA.2, BA.5 or XBB.1.5 challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast to the challenge with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, however, transmission could not be completely prevented after challenge with the more recent variants.</p><p id="Par33">A limitation of our studies to date is the lack of evidence demonstrating the impact of pre-existing immunity on the efficacy of OTS-228 and the advantages over mRNA vaccines. However, it has been shown that the live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sCPD9 successfully reinfects pre-immunized hamsters after repeated intranasal inoculation and that immunity increases after the second dose. Furthermore, sCPD9 has been shown to provide better protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and was significantly more effective in reducing transmission compared to mRNA vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These results suggest that a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection does not compromise the efficacy of LAV and that significant advantages over previous vaccines can be anticipated. In conclusion, we found OTS-228 to be safe and effective, with no inter-animal transmission, with genetic stability, and immunogenicity, while demonstrating a low protective dose 50 (PD<sub>50</sub>). These results highlight the potential of LAV OTS-228 for effective use in the prevention of COVID-19 and underscore its suitability for further clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Hamster experiments</title><p id="Par34">All experiments were conducted under BSL-3 conditions at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Germany, using specific pathogen free (SPF) male Syrian hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) of five to nine weeks of age (Janvier labs). For inoculation (vaccination and challenge) a micropipette was used to administer a volume of 35&#x02009;&#x000b5;l each into both nostrils, for the high dosage experiment 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;l per nostril were used. Each inoculum was back-titrated on Vero E6 cells to confirm the tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) per hamster. To quantify virus shedding, each nostril was washed by 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;l PBS using a micropipette and the reflux was collected in a safe lock sample tube. Inoculation and nasal washing were performed under open-drop isoflurane anesthesia leading to short term unconscious of less than a minute, reducing the overall stress for the animals. Body weight was determined by putting the hamsters on a fine scale with a d-value of 0.1&#x02009;g. Physical well-being was assessed on a daily basis by qualified personnel through visual inspection. Body weight loss of equal or more than 20% post inoculation was defined as human endpoint. At distinct timepoints, animals were euthanized after isoflurane overdose by combining bleeding to death with severing of the spinal cord in the area of the occiput and upper respiratory (conchae nasalis and trachea) and lower respiratory tract samples (lung cranial, medial, caudal) of about 0,1&#x02009;cm3 were taken to examine virus genome loads in these organ samples. Organ samples were homogenized in a 1&#x02009;mL mixture composed of equal volumes of Hank&#x02019;s balanced salts MEM and Earle&#x02019;s balanced salts MEM with 1% penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin at 300&#x02009;Hz for 2&#x02009;min using a Tissuelyser II (Qiagen) and were then centrifuged to clarify the supernatant. Beside blood collection at end timepoints, serological follow-up samples were taken by punctuation of the saphenous vein under isoflurane anesthesia administered via a face mask. A calibrated vaporizer was used to deliver isoflurane at a concentration of 2% (v/v) in oxygen. Serum, nasal washes and organ samples were stored at -80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. All hamster experiments were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the State Office for Agriculture, Food Safety, and Fisheries of Mecklenburg&#x02013;Western Pomerania (LALLF M-V), and gained governmental approval under registration numbers LVL MV TSD/7221.3-1-001/22, 7221.3-2-005/21 and 7221.3-1-040/22.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental setup: Maximal dose experiment</title><p id="Par35">The highest possible dose of OTS-228 (10<sup>6.1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/hamster) was used to intranasally inoculate 14 male Syrian hamsters of 5 weeks of age.

Consecutive sections were processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) used according to standardized procedures of avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC)-method. In detail, endogenous peroxidase was quenched on dewaxed lung slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water for 10&#x02009;min at room temperature (RT). The antigen was subjected to heat retrieval in a pressure cooker for 20&#x02009;min in 10&#x02009;mM citrate buffer (pH 6). To block nonspecific antibody binding, the slides were incubated for 30&#x02009;min at RT with goat normal serum, diluted in PBS (1:2). A primary antibody against the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was applied overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Rockland, 200-401-A50, 1:3000), and the secondary antibody, a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody, was applied for 30&#x02009;min at RT (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, 1:200). The color was developed by incubating the sections with an ABC solution (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit; Vector Laboratories), followed by exposure to a 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate (AEC Substrate Kit, abcam). The sections were counterstained with Mayer&#x02019;s haematoxylin and cover slipped. As a negative control, consecutive sections were labeled with an irrelevant antibody (capsid protein of Rustrela virus, clone 2H11B1). In each run, an archived control slide from a SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamster was included. All slides were scanned with a Hamamatsu S60 scanner and analyzed by a trained pathologist (TB) and reviewed by a certified pathologist (AB) in a blinded manner using NDPview.2 plus software (Version 2.8.24, Hamamatsu Photonics, K.K. Japan). The lung tissue was evaluated using a 500&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;500&#x02009;&#x003bc;m grid, and the extent of pneumonia-associated consolidation was recorded as a percentage of the affected lung fields.
