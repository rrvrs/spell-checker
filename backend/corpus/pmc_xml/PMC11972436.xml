India's postgraduate medical entrance has undergone major transformations, consolidating multiple exams into the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test Post Graduate (NEET PG) to create a unified admission process. However, asynchronous counseling rounds, seat blocking, and judicial interventions continue to plague the system, resulting in inefficiencies and inequities. In contrast, the U.S. employs a structured and algorithm-driven residency matching system, primarily managed by the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) and specialized match programs like the San Francisco Match and the Urology Match. The NRMP's "applicant-proposing" algorithm offers a transparent and efficient way to match candidates with programs based on preference and availability. Additionally, financial considerations differ, with U.S. medical graduates often burdened with substantial student debt, while Indian medical education, particularly in government institutions, remains highly subsidized. Despite its progress, India's residency admission system still faces significant logistical and administrative challenges, necessitating further reforms such as integrated state and national counseling, real-time seat matrices, and a unified application platform. By examining the structured approach of the U.S. residency match system, India can implement policy changes that improve fairness, efficiency, and transparency in postgraduate medical admissions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>admission challenges and reforms</kwd><kwd>healthcare workforce training</kwd><kwd>medical residency admissions</kwd><kwd>medical school to residency transition</kwd><kwd>nrmp match system</kwd><kwd>postgraduate medical counseling</kwd><kwd>seat allocation in medical residency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>The process of getting into residency after medical school is a strenuous one, irrespective of the country in which you graduate. This article attempts to offer a comparative analysis of the entrance examinations and the counseling process for admissions in India versus the United States of America, i.e., the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) versus the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test Post Graduate (NEET PG).</p><p>India's efforts to bring uniformity to postgraduate (PG) medical counseling have been ongoing for many years, but they have faced numerous legal and political challenges before achieving any significant progress [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The first step towards this unification was the administration of the NEET PG exam in 2013, which aimed to streamline the process of medical admissions across the country [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Before this, India had a complex and fragmented system of counseling for PG admission, with separate processes for government colleges, private institutions, deemed universities, and central universities, each often governed by its own set of rules. Additionally, institutions like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), and&#x000a0;Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, conducted their separate counseling, making the entire process confusing and burdensome for students [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the U.S. follows a structured and uniform residency match process. In the fourth year of medical school, students participate in the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP, started in 1952), a process that begins with the submission of applications in the fall [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;However, before the main match in March, there are separate matches for certain specialties, such as military residencies, urology, plastic surgery, and ophthalmology, which occur in December or February [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].&#x000a0;This system provides a clear, centralized path for medical graduates to transition into their specialty training.</p><p>Additionally, in India, the education fees for students studying in government colleges and state quota seats of private medical colleges are significantly subsidized by their respective states.&#x000a0;The fees of central government-run medical institutions like AIIMS, PGIMER, and JIPMER are also negligible as the central government funds them entirely. The fees of the remaining students studying in deemed universities and private medical colleges are majorly paid by the parents of the students, greatly minimizing the burden of student loans. This significant difference in funding and infrastructure reflects the complexities of India's medical education system, which still faces challenges in achieving the level of uniformity and transparency seen in more developed systems like the U.S. A stark contrast is seen in the U.S., where the average medical school graduate's debt was about $201,490 in 2019 [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>The evolution of PG medical entrance exams in India</p><p>Before the introduction of the NEET PG exam in 2013&#x000a0;and the Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test (INICET) in 2020, admissions to PG entrance exams used to be conducted through multiple exams [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>All India Post Graduate Medical Entrance Examination (AIPGMEE)</p><p>The AIIMS&#x000a0;held a national-level exam for admission to 50% of PG seats in all India quota (AIQ) seats in government medical colleges across India [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>State-Level Entrance Exams</p><p>Different states used to conduct entrance tests for admissions to state government&#x000a0;PG seats and private medical college PG seats in that state [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Deemed University Entrance Exams</p><p>Every deemed university used to conduct its university entrance exam and then do its counseling for the PG seats under its affiliation. It used to be a very opaque process [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Institution-Specific Exams</p><p>Institutions of national eminence, such as AIIMS, JIPMER, and PGIMER, administered the entrance exams for PG admissions and counseling. Since then, all of the aforementioned tests have been eliminated. In 2013, the AIPGMEE, State Level Entrance Exam, and Deemed University Entrance Exams were combined into the NEET PGexam. In 2020, the AIIMS, JIPMER, and PGIMER Institution-Specific Exams were combined into INICET [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The present scenario for PG medical entrance examinations</p><p>NEET PG&#x000a0;was conducted in 170 cities, and 228,540 candidates appeared&#x000a0;for some&#x000a0;61,789 seats available in Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Surgery (MS), Postgraduate Diploma, and Diplomate of National Board (DNB) seats [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previously, MD/MS counseling was separate from DNB counseling, but they have been combined for the last two to three&#x000a0;years [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two different types of authorities conduct the counseling [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One is the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC), which performs all India counselling, and the second is state counselling authorities, which are different in every state [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Before the counseling process starts, each college shares the availability of recognized seats with state and center authorities [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In government PG, seats are divided into 50% quotas: AIQ&#x000a0;seats and state&#x000a0;quota seats&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

These seats are divided into 50% AIQ seats and 50% under&#x000a0;Indraprastha (I.P.) University [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>(e) 100% of seats in Central Universities, such as Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University, the University of Delhi, and other central institutes, are subject to eligibility criteria detailed in the MCC counseling scheme [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Next, students must rank their desired choices for PG seats in order of preference from most desired to least desired alternatives from top to bottom [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Each student's choices are matched to the available seat based on their NEET PG entrance exam rank [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The counseling process for seats on the MCC is divided into several stages, including the first, second, third, mop-up, and final stray vacancy rounds [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. State-level counseling follows a similar process: first, second, third, mop-up, and final stray vacancy rounds. The state counseling rounds occur after the corresponding MCC rounds are completed [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>India also adopted Diversity Equity criteria for inclusion and upliftment of various strata of society. As a part of this, the eligibility criteria vary for different categories of students. The eligibility to attend either counseling is based on the minimum qualifying/eligibility criteria for admission as mentioned in the Information Bulletin for NEET PG as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref> [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Minimum Qualifying Percentile Criteria for NEET PG Counseling Based on Candidate Category</title><p>This table&#x000a0;presents the minimum qualifying percentile criteria for NEET PG counseling across various candidate categories.

The Military Match occurs earlier, in December, rather than in March. As a result, the schedule has been pushed forward slightly. The application process may also differ. Beginning in 2019, PGY-1 students will submit documentation using a paper application rather than the Medical Operational Data System (MODS) used by the Air Force, Army, and Navy. The application, like the civilian match, contains a curriculum vitae, personal statement, USMLE&#x000a0;scores, transcript, Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), and letters of recommendation. The branch will provide candidates&#x000a0;with instructions on how to upload them. The Joint Service Graduate Medical Education (JSGME) Board rates applicants in mid-November using criteria such as grades, USMLE&#x000a0;scores, research, "audition" rotations, interviews, and past military service. Candidates can be assigned to either their primary military residency, a secondary specialty, a civilian residency (only for the Air Force and Navy), or a military transitional year. The Army, Navy, and Air Force have their own match process [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The NRMP Match algorithm</p><p>How Does This Work?</p><p>The matching algorithm is "applicant-proposing," which means it tries to place an applicant (Applicant A) in the program that appears to be the most preferred on Applicant A's ranking list. Suppose Applicant A cannot be matched to this first-choice program (because the program does not prefer Applicant A), in that case, an attempt is made to place Applicant A in the second choice program, and so on, until Applicant A obtains a tentative match, or all of Applicant A's options have been exhausted [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>What Does "Tentative Match" Mean?</p><p>Applicant A will be tentatively matched to a program if it ranks them on its rank order list and either has an open position or prefers Applicant A over another applicant (Applicant B) who has already been tentatively matched. In this situation, Applicant B is "bumped" from the tentative match with the program to make way for Applicant A [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>What Happens When an Applicant's Tentative Match Is "Bumped"?</p><p>The matching algorithm will return to Applicant B's rank order list and make a preliminary match at the next most preferred place on Applicant B's list. The same steps are taken to identify another tentative match for Applicant B as for Applicant A [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>When Does a Tentative Match Become Final?</p><p>When all applicants' rank order lists have been considered, the matching algorithm is finished, and all tentative matches are final and binding for training [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Discussion</p><p>India is moving in the right direction. Earlier, it used to have multiple entrances. Each state used to have one, each deemed university used to have one, and each institute of national eminence used to have one. There was also one national exam for AIQ seats.</p><p>After so many obstacles, India moved on to a single NEET PG exam for all the PG seats except those of institutes of national eminence. The current structure and implementation of medical counseling for PG admissions in India, particularly under the AIQ and state counseling processes, are relatively inefficient and inconsistent, resulting in a lack of transparency, fairness, and synchronization. These challenges manifest as follows:</p><p>Seat Blocking and Resource Misallocation</p><p>Candidates compete in AIQ and state counseling rounds, frequently blocking seats without a genuine desire to get into that specific college. This results in mid-ranking candidates losing opportunities to acquire their preferred seats, while lower-ranking candidates profit disproportionately from last-minute seat availability during mop-up or stray rounds.</p><p>Asynchronous Counseling Rounds</p><p>The absence of coordination between AIQ and state counseling schedules causes candidates to judge based on inadequate or ambiguous information, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. Candidates frequently block AIQ seats out of caution, reducing the availability of seats for others in the following rounds. Then, they often resign AIQ seats for state quota seats. But, when the resigned seat becomes available for counseling, students who are immediately next in line and would have been eligible for the seat become ineligible for those seats.</p><p>Judicial Interventions and Delays</p><p>Frequent lawsuits involving unresolved counseling issues disrupt the process, producing delays and confusion for candidates.</p><p>Mid-counselling Changes in Seat Availability</p><p>This system becomes unfair when seats are added or deleted in subsequent rounds,&#x000a0;which affects candidates who have already decided based on previous allocations. Inequitable seat distribution, extreme psychological strain, and candidate discontent&#x000a0;are all caused by these structural problems. Many students struggle to get seats that&#x000a0;suit their preferences despite their hard work and high rankings because of poor&#x000a0;administration, a lack of coordination, and an excessive dependence on happenstance. Resolving these issues is essential to guaranteeing an open, equitable, and effective&#x000a0;counseling procedure that respects the constitutional reservation and merit standards.</p><p>Possible solutions to overcome the above challenges</p><p>Accountability</p><p>The procedures should be held accountable, and the counseling process as a whole should be done following a scheduled and well-planned timeline without any delays or postponements.</p><p>Release an Ideal Seat Matrix Before Counseling</p><p>This guarantees that there won't be any seat confusion between rounds. Some seats are added unexpectedly in round 2, and individuals who retained their seats in round 1 do not receive the chance to apply for those seats, perplexing others who had applied for an upgrade.</p><p>Integrated All India and State Counseling</p><p>MCC and state counseling must occur simultaneously to avoid time gaps. This will prevent seat blocking and offer everyone an equal chance to obtain the available seat at their level.</p><p>Unified Platform for All India and State Counselling</p><p>Multiple states and all-India counseling are highly difficult for students to follow. Hence, it should be done on a single platform like MCC. It would make it easier for students to apply to several states.</p><p>Conducting Offline/In-Person Counselling (Combined for All India and State)</p><p>We can offer rank-based offline counseling based on the seats the student qualifies for based on the state quota and any reservations. As a result, seats will be taken on the spot and won't be blocked. No time is wasted on state counseling, resignations from seats due to state counseling, or document verification. As a result, the report time currently granted after each round will be reduced by seven days.</p><p>In the US, medical students start applications for residency in July, and the first match comes in December, which is the Military Match, and the next match, whose results are the Urology and San Francisco Match. San Francisco Match is for ophthalmology and plastic surgery only [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The main match is the NRMP Match, whose results come in mid-March. There is a week for the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP)&#x000a0;Match for the students who did not match in the main match [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Then, the NRMP Match results are declared, the students are matched, and the residency training program starts in July [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This leads to minimal wastage of time for the medical students between their medical school and residency.</p><p>In India, the NEET PG exams are at the end of medical school, and the whole counseling procedure starts after the exam results are declared.

This consolidation has reduced logistical, financial, and psychological burdens on medical aspirants, enabling a more standardized and equitable admission process. However, challenges persist, particularly in the counseling process. Asynchronous AIQ and state counseling, seat blocking, mid-counseling seat changes, and judicial interventions undermine fairness and efficiency. Proposed solutions, including an integrated counseling platform, simultaneous AIQ and state rounds, and pre-published seat matrices, could address these inefficiencies and improve transparency.</p><p>In contrast, PG medical residency counseling in the U.S., such as the NRMP Match, San Francisco Match, Urology Match, and Military Match, offers a structured and transparent algorithm-based system. The "applicant-proposing" algorithm ensures fairness by aligning applicant preferences with program selections, minimizing disruptions like seat blocking. Lessons from the USA's structured counseling system, such as synchronized schedules, centralized platforms, and binding rank-order algorithms, can inspire reforms in India's counseling framework. By addressing the existing inefficiencies and adopting proven practices from systems like the NRMP, India's PG medical admissions process can be more streamlined, equitable, and efficient, ensuring the best outcomes for candidates and institutions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Nirupam Nadella, Lokesh Edara, Gayatri R.
