A diagnosis often disrupts a patient&#x02019;s personal, familial, and occupational life, underscoring the need for holistic care that extends beyond clinical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Studies have shown that individuals with breast cancer are at increased risk of anxiety, depression, and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They experience a higher prevalence of psychological problems compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Research emphasises that the journey of breast cancer involves more than medical treatment, requiring a comprehensive approach that addresses psychosocial needs as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Social support plays a pivotal role in mitigating psychological burden, improving emotional resilience, and enhancing overall well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Support may come in various forms of emotional, informational, instrumental, and appraisal, and can be offered by healthcare professionals, family members, peers, or digital sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">However, access to consistent and personalized support is often limited, particularly for women in underserved or remote regions. Traditional support mechanisms such as in-person counselling, support groups, or family caregiving may be constrained by geographic, logistical, or socio-economic barriers. Given the proven benefits of social support in managing breast cancer, digital platforms present a promising solution to extend these benefits in scalable, accessible, and cost-effective ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Given the proven benefits of social support, digital platforms offer a scalable solution to extend these benefits remotely and continuously, overcoming many logistical challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent years have seen a significant rise in digital interventions aimed at supporting cancer patients, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional healthcare access was disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Despite growing interest in digital support tools, few studies have investigated which platform features are most valued by breast cancer patients, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resource constraints further limit access to in-person care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Understanding user preferences is crucial for designing effective and engaging platforms.</p><p id="Par11">This study addresses this gap by exploring the preferences of Iranian breast cancer patients for different attributes of a digital social care platform. Using Conjoint Analysis (CA) and a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) grounded in economic utility theory, we aim to identify the support features that patients value most, providing evidence to guide the patient-centred design of future digital interventions.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p id="Par12">To guide the development of our digital social care platform, we adopted the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) model. This framework, grounded in behavioural science and communication theory, provides a structured approach for designing technologies that influence user attitudes and behaviours in ethical and evidence-based ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The PSD model categorizes 28 persuasive design principles into four domains: primary task support, dialogue support, system credibility support, and social support. In this study, these categories were used to guide the development of platform features aligned with the psychological and emotional needs of breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The primary task support category involves features that help users effectively engage with the core functionality of the system, encouraging routine usage and supporting self-management. In our platform, this was reflected through regular delivery of practical, context-specific tips&#x02014;such as coping strategies for treatment side effects and user-friendly tracking tools that allow patients to monitor their own emotional wellbeing and social engagement. By facilitating ongoing and personalized interaction, the design promotes a sense of consistency and sustained support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Dialogue support principles focus on system interactivity and timely feedback to reinforce motivation and behaviour change. In this category, we incorporated esteem-enhancing features, such as motivational messages tailored to individual progress and interactive check-ins designed to prompt emotional reflection. These were complemented by mindfulness prompts and automated affirmations, offering psychological reinforcement to maintain engagement and alleviate distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In the domain of system credibility support, we emphasized the importance of building trust and ensuring the perceived reliability of the platform. This was achieved by integrating instructional videos based on verified medical sources and clearly indicating the credentials of content contributors, such as oncologists and licensed psychologists. Additionally, supportive educational content was sourced or adapted from reputable organizations like the World Health Organization, further reinforcing the platform&#x02019;s authority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Finally, the social support category drew upon principles that leverage social influence and community dynamics to foster user motivation. Here, we embedded features such as moderated discussion forums where users could share experiences and advice, peer-matching systems that encouraged regular check-ins between participants, and interactive challenges aimed at promoting a sense of community and shared resilience. These features were specifically designed to reduce feelings of isolation and strengthen patients&#x02019; sense of belonging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">By operationalizing PSD principles into concrete, user-informed features, we aimed to develop a persuasive, trustworthy, and emotionally supportive digital environment. This approach not only aligns with the theoretical foundations of persuasive technology but also reflects a commitment to patient-centred design in digital health interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Review of the literature</title><p id="Par18">Digital health encompasses a range of information and communication technologies designed to improve health outcomes efficiently and cost-effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Research supports that mobile applications can assist cancer patients in self-management by providing timely access to credible information and facilitating navigation through treatment pathways.</p><p id="Par19">For instance, Buscemi et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial with 50 breast cancer survivors using a mobile app called My Guide, which was designed to provide culturally tailored psychosocial support. They found significant improvements in breast cancer knowledge and patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similarly, in a cohort study involving 4,475 breast cancer patients, mobile app usage was associated with increased medication adherence, suggesting digital tools can improve treatment compliance at scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Ponder et al. assessed the psychological outcomes of a mobile app used perioperatively by breast cancer patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57), reporting significant reductions in anxiety and depression after app use, which they attributed to improved informational and emotional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Wyatt et al. surveyed 20 breast cancer patients using a web-based symptom monitoring platform, noting that enhanced communication and symptom awareness increased their confidence in decision-making and adherence to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In Taiwan, a longitudinal study involving 98 cancer patients showed that using a self-management mHealth app significantly improved quality of life over three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">While these studies confirm the general benefits of digital health interventions, many focus on clinical symptom management or informational tools. There is limited attention to platforms offering social care support, defined as emotional reassurance, esteem-building, and peer connection tailored to the unique psychosocial needs of breast cancer patients. This distinction is crucial because social care features, such as peer interaction, community belonging, and emotional validation, directly influence user engagement and mental well-being, especially in chronic illness contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The sustained use of digital platforms depends not only on medical relevance but also on meaningful social support delivered through persuasive design features.</p><p id="Par22">Persuasive System Design (PSD) offers a promising framework for developing these digital interventions. PSD categorizes persuasive features into primary task support, dialogue support, system credibility, and social support, aligning well with the behavioural and emotional needs of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, a critical gap remains it is still unclear how to translate PSD principles into features that patients truly value. For instance, do patients prefer automated reminders, or would moderated peer communities be more effective in maintaining engagement. These practical questions remain underexplored, limiting the scalability and personalization of digital social care platforms.</p><p id="Par23">However, literature supports the idea that incorporating local values, needs, and expectations improves digital health intervention adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Engaging users early in the design process is essential to ensure relevance and personalization. Therefore, exploring breast cancer patients&#x02019; preferences for social platform features is vital to operationalize PSD in ways that truly resonate.</p><p id="Par24">This research addresses this gap in preference-based design, aiming to develop a deeper understanding of the types of support features&#x02014;emotional, esteem, informational&#x02014;that patients prioritize in a digital environment. Ultimately, this knowledge will contribute to building patient-centred, persuasive social care platforms that enhance both engagement and psychosocial outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec100"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par25">This cross-sectional study used Conjoint Analysis (CA), grounded in economic utility theory, to examine breast cancer patients&#x02019; preferences for features of a digital social care platform.

The mapping of PSD categories into platform features is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For instance, esteem support was operationalized via inspirational messages and mindfulness prompts, while tangible support was represented by options such as automated medication reminders and real-world service assistance for bedridden patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec103"><title>Conjoint design</title><p id="Par31">To identify the key attributes that make breast cancer patients opt into a digital social care system based on a persuasive system design model and social care system, we used the information from the literature review to find a suitable model for designing a persuasive technology. We further examined which features had the most significant role in stimulating motivation and adherence to the digital system among patients with breast cancer. The literature review led to a broad range of potential attributes, narrowed to five based on a social support category system developed by Cutrona and Suhr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Afterward, for each attribute, the research team selected realistic, relevant, and easy-to-understand levels through which patients were asked to choose from. Therefore, eight experts discussed a preliminary list of attributes, including social medicine specialists, health services management, and health policy-making experts. The experts were selected using the purposive sampling technique, and the panel discussion was conducted at Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in October 2023. The panel discussed the features of a digital social support system and tried to suit them according to the four main categories of PSD principles.

As not all possible scenarios can be included in the CA, the fractional factorial design was adopted using the SPSS software version 20 to obtain a manageable level while capturing essential information about the system&#x02019;s behavior.

This explanation and face-to-face interviews based on the think-aloud methods were used to confirm that the scenarios in a DCE were understandable for participants before deploying the final survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The primary purpose of interviews was to examine the face validity of the questionnaire and assess the understanding of the wording used to characterize the study attributes and levels. To apply a think-aloud approach, a pilot of 20 patients was asked to complete the choice tasks before implementing the survey. In case of any ambiguity, while answering the questionnaire, the researcher tried to document all raised issues and discuss specific aspects of the survey to identify any modification and necessary changes in the wording or displaying of the survey questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To check reliability, we used a pretesting approach with a pilot of 20 patients to understand whether the choice experiment was performing as intended and ensure the relevance and comprehensiveness of the DCE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Accordingly, we checked two important items: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] whether the attributes represent the concept of interest; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] whether attribute levels are appropriate and arranged logically. Regarding the comprehension of the DCE, we also checked whether key terms are consistently comprehensible and whether participants can visualize proposed scenarios in a related context in which they are asked to make choices. Finally, in the elicitation of the DCE, we checked how the process of creating a choice is being undertaken by study participants, whether underlying mental shortcuts contribute to decision-making, and whether participant preferences reflect their choices properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec106"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par36">Data were analyzed using STATA version 13.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par58">The study aimed to explore the preferences of breast cancer patients for the features that constitute a preferable digital social care platform. Study findings indicate that emotional support significantly impacts patients&#x02019; preferences, followed by information support and esteem support. These findings are consistent with a similar study that reported that social support, including emotional support from family members, positively affected breast cancer patients&#x02019; psychological well-being and social functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Solid social support, such as family bonds and quality relationships, enhances the mental adjustment of patients. Additionally, factors such as employment and higher social status of individuals revealed a significant role in enabling them to better adapt to changes in their physical, psychological, and emotional conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Likewise, another study reported that increased social support, particularly regarding network size and social connection, was associated with better survival rates among patients with breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, breast cancer patients who perceived moderate-to-high levels of social support experienced reduced severity of chemotherapy-related symptoms compared to those with low perceived social support. Expressing emotional support on social media platforms has also enhanced cancer patients&#x02019; coping strategies by increasing their perception of bonding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Close relationships, such as marital confiding and dependable nonhouseholder support, as well as emotional processing, have been connected to decreased mortality rates in women with breast cancer. Moreover, the provision of emotional support and implementation of organizational changes in nursing care facilities could improve breast cancer patient&#x02019;s sense of safety and security, enabling them to plan for the future despite their challenging circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These findings emphasize the significant role of social support, particularly emotional support, in improving the well-being, coping strategies, and treatment outcomes among breast cancer patients. Factors such as family support, social interactions, employment, and social status of patients can motivate patients to restore balance in life and evolve positively. Our study findings also indicated that providing social care support for breast cancer patients through digital apps could significantly increase the likelihood of their engagement with and acceptability of these technologies. These findings align with the literature demonstrating that pre-visit microlearning breast cancer educational videos significantly impacted patient satisfaction and engagement with the technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial, video preparation for breast cancer treatment may support reduced distress and increased preparedness, particularly among vulnerable or underserved patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Additionally, incorporating some features, including background music, an easy-to-understand language, and short-term health videos promoting breast cancer education, improved the knowledge absorption efficiency significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Likewise, personalized video education before the first oncologic consultation was feasible and beneficial for breast cancer patients, particularly in explaining complex contents like cancer subtypes and their treatment procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Another study highlighted that interactive technologies and videotapes for cancer education could increase patients&#x02019; knowledge and awareness of the disease. Sustainable communication with health professionals brought them higher satisfaction levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Similarly, women with breast cancer expressed that computer-mediated support groups provided unique support, facilitating communication and offering emotional, encouraging, and informational support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Moreover, breast cancer patients engaging in social support exchanges on Facebook formed a peer community that helped buffer stress effects from negative health experiences during diagnosis and transitioning off cancer therapy. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of instructional videos in increasing the acceptance and utilization of digital social care applications among breast cancer patients. Using apps as supportive tools has demonstrated positive outcomes, including improved patient satisfaction, engagement, and preparedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Incorporating interactive elements and personalization further enhances the educational experience. Additionally, digital platforms, such as computer-mediated support groups and social media communities, serve as valuable sources of support, fostering communication and providing emotional and informational assistance for women with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Our results indicate that patients with access to instructional videos instead of merely receiving regular informative messages had a 17% higher probability of choosing digital social care support. Additionally, our study findings confirmed that the opportunity to receive personal online support increased the likelihood even further by 12%. A similar study revealed that perceived social support has a positive impact on the quality of life for younger breast cancer survivors. In contrast, uncertainty has a negative effect, accounting for 27.20% of the variance in life quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Moreover, participation in a Twitter breast cancer support group increased patients&#x02019; perceived knowledge and decreased anxiety. However, it is essential to consider technology access and health literacy issues when developing online digital videos for cancer prevention and education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Viewing a videotape of breast cancer educational materials can potentially influence patients&#x02019; preferences toward breast-sparing surgery, while both booklets and videos can effectively increase their knowledge about treatment options. Furthermore, digital support groups for breast carcinoma showed promise in improving individuals&#x02019; quality of life, reducing psychological symptoms, and enhancing coping skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Internet-based breast cancer support groups also played a crucial role in eliminating social isolation and empowering women by facilitating knowledge exchange and sharing experiences. Literature supports that digital platforms can provide health messages, reminders, essential support, or behaviour monitoring. The remaining topics include particular support to patients with unique health goals, such as a healthy diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, disease prevention, or engagement in behaviour monitoring to track health behaviours and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Perceived social support is crucial for the well-being of breast cancer survivors, and participation in online support groups can offer knowledge, reduce anxiety, and enhance coping. However, the efficacy of online support groups may vary, and considerations such as technology access, health literacy, and distress levels should be considered when designing and implementing these interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">The non-significant <italic>P</italic>-value for &#x0201c;Tangible Support&#x0201d; indicates that the difference between providing physical help and medication reminders did not significantly influence patients&#x02019; preferences for the digital social care platform. This result suggests that patients may view both options as equally important, or that their preferences for tangible support may be context-dependent and vary based on individual circumstances. This may reflect a preference for emotional over practical aid in a digital context, warranting further study into the role of tangible support in digital platforms for breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">The findings of a review acknowledged that the acceptability of these platforms is an important consideration for developers and policymakers, which necessitates the application of a suitable method to explore users&#x02019; preferences for the features of a digital social care platform. This study applied CA to evaluate patients&#x02019; preferences for different platform attributes without directly asking them to state their preferred options. This method has been used in different areas such as priority setting, determining desirable patient treatments, evaluating different healthcare alternatives, and exploring patients&#x02019; preferences in the physician-care recipient relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Such a method allows the ranking of health services when setting priorities and estimating the relative importance of different service features. Relative results enable policymakers to evaluate each feature&#x02019;s impact on a particular strategy&#x02019;s overall advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">The findings of this research provide valuable practical insights to guide the design and real-world implementation of effective digital social care platforms tailored to the preferences of breast cancer patients. By prioritizing the most preferred features identified, such as emotional support, informational support with instructional videos, esteem support through mindfulness exercises and positive affirmations, and personalized online support from healthcare professionals or peers, developers can create platforms that resonate with patients and increase their engagement. Incorporating these elements as core components can foster a sense of community, alleviate isolation, enhance disease self-management, and promote resilience throughout the cancer journey. However, successful implementation requires a multi-faceted approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Healthcare organizations should actively involve breast cancer patients and survivors through focus groups, usability testing, and iterative feedback loops to continuously refine and co-design platforms that evolve to meet changing needs over time. For example, focus groups could identify preferred video content, while usability testing ensures accessibility for diverse patient populations. Comprehensive training programs for staff and patients, integration into existing care pathways, robust data privacy and security protocols, and collaboration with patient advocacy groups, community organizations, and technology partners are crucial for effective dissemination and adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec107"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par63">This study had several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the sample was drawn from a single hospital in Iran, which might restrict the generalizability of study findings to other geographic regions and healthcare settings. Future multi-center studies with larger and more diverse patient populations are suggested. Moreover, although CA is a robust method for eliciting preferences, the hypothetical nature of the choice scenarios might not accurately reflect real-world decision-making. Accordingly, longitudinal studies examining patients&#x02019; uptake and engagement with digital social care platforms based on the preferred features would be valuable. Additionally, this study focused specifically on breast cancer patients. Since the need for social support might vary across different cancer types and stages, it necessitates future research studies to explore the preferences of patients with other cancer diagnoses. Understanding the unique needs and priorities of various patient groups will inform the development of tailored digital interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par64">In conclusion, our study highlights the potential effectiveness of digital social care apps and personalized online support in enhancing patient engagement and acceptability. Specifically, providing instructional videos, rather than regular informative messages, significantly increased the likelihood of patients choosing digital social care support. Additionally, offering personalized online support further enhanced this likelihood. These findings suggest that incorporating digital tools and tailored support within healthcare platforms could help increase patient engagement, potentially enhancing their well-being during the disease journey. By understanding which features encourage patients to accept and engage with digital platforms, developers can better tailor these tools to meet patient preferences and improve practical usage.</p><p id="Par65">While our study focuses on patient preferences, it is possible that features such as instructional videos and personalized support may contribute to reducing feelings of loneliness and stress by fostering greater engagement. However, further research is needed to confirm these outcomes in real-world settings.</p><p id="Par66">The implications of this study are significant for healthcare policymakers, practitioners, and technology developers. As digital health solutions continue to evolve, designing platforms that align with patient needs and preferences is crucial. Policymakers should prioritize integrating patient-centered design principles and allocate resources to developing tailored digital social care solutions. Healthcare practitioners can leverage these insights to better understand the types of support that resonate with patients, thereby improving communication, shared decision-making, and overall engagement.</p><p id="Par67">For technology developers, this study underscores the importance of co-designing digital health platforms with end-users. By actively involving patients in the design process and iterating based on their feedback, platforms are more likely to gain adoption and sustained use. Collaborative efforts between healthcare organizations, patient advocates, and technology companies will be vital to creating user-friendly, evidence-based, and effective digital social care solutions.</p><p id="Par68">Future research should validate these preferences and explore their real-world application to ensure the development of digital tools that effectively support patients throughout their cancer journey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
