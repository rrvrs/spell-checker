It constitutes 26% of the world&#x02019;s total mushroom production (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). Shiitake is recognized for its unique flavor, nutritional value and medical properties. It contains versatile bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, lentinan, ergosterol, nucleic acid derivatives, water&#x02013;soluble lignin, eritadenine, etc., conferring it promising pharmacology effects comprising antitumor, immunomodulatory, hypocholesterolemic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti&#x02013;inflammatory and antioxidant properties (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). In China, shiitake has been used in traditional medicine for more than 2000&#x0202f;years (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Shiitake is broadly distributed across subtropical to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Its cultivation happens worldwide, while most of its production is from east Aisa such as China, Japan and South Korea (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Menolli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Sierra-Patev et al., 2023</xref>). The optimal temperature for the growth of <italic>L. edodes</italic> mycelia and fruiting is 24&#x02013;27&#x000b0;C and 8&#x02013;20&#x000b0;C, respectively (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). For shiitake production, heat stress is one of the major environmental constrains, exerting a deleterious effect on its productivity. Temperatures that exceed 25&#x000b0;C can result in a highly reduced commercial value of the shiitake fruiting body, for instance the small fruiting body, thin cap, and less open umbrella (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2024</xref>). Temperatures higher than 30&#x000b0;C severely inhibit mycelia growth and fruiting body formation processes (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Heat stress has caused significant yield loss and quality deterioration of shiitake production in almost all its production areas. Unfortunately, extreme heat events are expected to intensify due to the ongoing global climate change (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Extensive literatures have documented the impacts of HS on mycelial development of shiitake, ranging from the morphological changes to metabolic reprogramming and molecular regulation. Morphologically, heat stress markedly hampers mycelial growth and weakens the mycelial regeneration when HS is removed (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Using microscope and SEM (scanning electron microscope), damages to the cell surface and loss of cytoplasmic inclusions could be observed upon exposure to heat (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>L. edodes</italic> mycelia, moreover, can respond to heat stress on physiological level by activating the antioxidant system to alleviate the damage to mycelial cell (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). In general, heat stress can induce an elevation in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, which subsequently triggers lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane. As a result, enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, etc.) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione, trehalose, indoleacetic acid, linoleic acid, etc.) antioxidants are activated to scavenge excess ROS to relieve cell injuries (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2024</xref>). The omics-based approaches offer powerful strategies to gain a global landscape of mechanisms by which shiitake copes with heat stress. Using a combined proteomic and transcriptomic approach, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2018)</xref> found that the heat shock proteins (HSPs) and IAA were functioning to the heat resistance of shiitake mycelium. Using transcriptomic techniques, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2022)</xref> investigated the mechanism by which 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) improved the thermotolerance of <italic>L. edodes</italic>.</p><p>Probably because the dikaryotic stage represents the longest period in the life cycle of shiitake, all the literature dealing with its heat-resistance mechanisms has focused on the dikaryotic mycelia. Undoubtedly, those dikaryon-based heat-resistance research is crucial to understanding how <italic>L. edodes</italic> against thermostress. Nonetheless, with the aim of breeding for the superior heat-resistant varieties, the importance of the dikaryon-based documents could be compromised, because current shiitake breeding practices are basically using monokaryons as parents. However, so far, how the monokaryotic mycelia cope with heat stress at physiological and molecular levels remain largely unknown. Recent genome sequencing studies of the two sexually compatible monokaryons of a <italic>L. edodes</italic> strain showed that their genomic structures harbored pronounced differences (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2024</xref>), implying that the two haploid nuclei might handle high temperature differently. More recently, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al. (2024)</xref> found that the monokaryons from two <italic>L. edodes</italic> strain characterized by thermo-tolerance and thermo-sensitivity may have different thermotolerance by a comparative genomic investigation. Unfortunately, in this study physiological and molecular evidence are lacking.</p><p>To fill the gap of the monokaryon-specific mechanisms in response to heat stress, we investigated the morphological, physiological, metabolic and transcriptomic changes of two sexually compatible monokaryons from a widely cultivated <italic>L. edodes</italic> strain under normal and high temperature conditions. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the two sexually compatible monokaryons respond differently to HS, deepening our understanding of the heat-resistance mechanism of <italic>L. edodes</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Fungal strains and cultivation</title><p>The two sexually compatible monokaryotic strains SP3 and SP30 were obtained from the dikaryotic <italic>L. edodes</italic> strain JZB2102217, using protoplasting method as described by <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al.

Prior to inoculation, a sterilized cellophane membrane was placed on the surface of the PDA medium for efficient collection of the mycelium samples. The two strains were cultivated in a growth incubator at 25&#x000b0;C and in permanent darkness. After 6&#x0202f;days of growth at 25&#x000b0;C, the fungal cultures were divided into control and treatment groups, in which the latter were subjected to heat exposure at 37&#x000b0;C for 12&#x0202f;h.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>2.2</label><title>Measurement of mycelial growth</title><p>Fungal colony diameter was measured every two days once the inoculant was germinated.

Recent studies showed that the two separate nuclei function differently during development and interaction with the surrounding environmental factors (<xref rid="ref1002" ref-type="bibr">Gehrmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Sperschneider et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to uncover how the two genetically different nuclei handle environmental stimulus.</p><p>For <italic>L. edodes</italic>, heat resistance is one of the most important breeding goals, as high temperature events have frequently occurred in all production areas and severely reducing its productivity and fruiting body quality. The prerequisite for genetically improving its heat-resistance is to understand how shiitake mushrooms address the high temperature condition at the molecular levels. Though plenty of work has been done to elucidate the heat-resistance mechanism of shiitake, it is still far from being clear. Particularly, how the two physically separated monokaryons function in the heterokaryotic cell when confronted high temperature is still in its infancy. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first pioneering study attempt to uncover the mechanism by which the two sexually compatible haploid nuclei handle heat stress.</p><p>Using the combination of the omics-based strategy and phenotypic parameters, we depicted the overall bare-bones how the two haploid nucleus tickled HS. Consistent with the findings in diploid mycelium, ROS production was elicited by high temperatures, which might contribute to the decrease of growth rate of mycelia. The varied extent of growth inhibition by HS suggested that the two monokaryons may have different capacity to resist HS. Further, the metabolome and transcriptome data supported the finding that the two nucleus SP3 and SP30 responded differently when challenged with high temperatures. We also found that SP30 has a greater number of DAMs and DEGs compared to SP3 under HS. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the DAMs for SP3 and SP30 were enriched in many different pathways. More interestingly, the enriched KEGG pathways for SP3 mostly tended to be downregulated, whereas those for SP30 showed an opposite trend. The glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways, which have been shown to be associated with heat-resistance in edible fungi (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2023</xref>), were enriched in both strains in our study but with different regulatory mechanisms. These results can be a good complement to our previous findings, which described that the glycerophospholipid metabolism was markedly enriched in the heterokaryotic <italic>L. edodes</italic> mycelium in response to HS (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2023</xref>). Glycerophospholipids are the dominant molecules on cell membranes, conferring its stability, fluidity, and permeability. They are required for the function of membrane proteins, receptors, and ion channels and act as reservoirs for second messengers and their precursors (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Hishikawa et al., 2014</xref>). Glycerophospholipids metabolism can be regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway. For example, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 MAPK kinases can regulate the activation of key enzymes in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway through phosphorylation (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Lapadat, 2002</xref>). MAPK signaling can also activate or inhibit some lipid metabolism-related transcription factors, such as PPAR<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3;). These transcription factors can regulate the expression of many genes involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, thus indirectly affecting the synthesis, catabolism and transport of glycerophospholipids (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Plotnikov et al., 2011</xref>). In return, the metabolism of glycerophospholipids can generate important second messengers, such as diacylglycerol (DAG), which can activate protein kinase C (PKC) and affect the activity of the MAPK signaling (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bill and Vines, 2020</xref>). As only a limited number of DEGs were found directly in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, we performed an integrative analysis using the detected glycerophospholipid metabolites with all DEGs. We discovered that the MAPK signalling pathway was highly associated with the glycerophospholipid metabolism in SP3, which was not found in SP30. It suggests that for SP3 the MAPK signaling mediated glycerophospholipid metabolism reprogramming may function to tackle heat stress. Taking together, our results support the previous findings that the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway is related to HS responses in fungi.</p><p>Thanks to the strong correlation between our metabolome and transcriptome dataset, we were able to construct a regulatory network of the DAMs and DEGs to delve deeper into the mechanisms by which the two monokaryons cope with HS. Our omics-integration analysis revealed distinct regulatory network structures between the two strains. The networks of the two monokaryons possessed completely different hub genes, further supporting our idea that the two monokaryons cope with HS using different strategies. In strain SP3, we found some highly correlated heat shock proteins (HSPs)that were not found in SP30. Two of the hub genes were annotated as HSP104. It can protect the protein from denaturation by interacting with HSP40 and HSP70 under high temperature. Knockout of the HSP104 gene causes the loss of tolerance to not only heat as well as the viability of cells stored at low temperatures (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2015</xref>). Another hub gene was annotated as HSP16. Such small HSPs are crucial for stabilizing cell membranes (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">De Maio and Hightower, 2021</xref>). Consequently, our results agreed with the importance of the role of HSPs in <italic>L. edodes</italic> heat-resistance found in dikaryotic mycelium (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2022</xref>), and further highlight the different regulatory mechanisms for the nuclei side by side in a cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec17"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Breeding for superior heat-resistant strains is critical for <italic>L. edodes</italic> production, since its cultivation is frequently threatened by high temperature stress. However, unlike plants and animals, the two sexually different nuclei stay side by side in cells and harbour different genetic structures and contribute differently during development. However, the mechanism by which the two nuclei deal with HS remains unclear. Here, we found for the first time that the two sexually compatible monokaryons regulate HS with different molecular machinery and provided informative findings from the aspect of metabolomics and transcriptomics. These results offer a holistic view of the nucleus-specific strategy for HS management, and provide candidate metabolites, responsive genes and regulatory pathways. Particularly, our results highlight the different regulation patterns of glycerophospholipid metabolism and HSPs in response to high temperature of the two nuclei of <italic>L. edodes</italic>. Nevertheless, these interesting findings should be subjected to further experimental validations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Ms. ZJ song from Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences for technical assistance on the recovery of strains.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec18"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
