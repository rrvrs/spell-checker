Shoulder pain is often reported in individuals who repetitively use their arms during sports activities and leisure time [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In sports involving overhead movements, shoulder pain might develop into chronic and disabling conditions. Repetitive movements in the upper body constitute a significant part of sports and leisure activities [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and are usually accompanied by discomfort and pain in the shoulder region [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Performing repetitive movements during sports may predispose athletes to Repetitive Movement Disorders (RMD) [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, most research investigated RMDs in the lower back region, leading to insufficient information about the causes of RMD in the upper limbs [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Various biomechanical studies have been conducted to understand factors related to Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS) in athletes [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Chronic pain is accompanied by reduced movement speed [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and increased electromyography (EMG) activity in the shoulder stabilizer muscles, aiming to preserve motor function and minimize the activity of global muscles in painful areas [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, few studies have addressed coordination and variability among athletes with SIS during repetitive movements.</p><p>Muscle coordination is a control strategy for creating an efficient, smooth, and precise movement pattern. It is defined as the ability to organize appropriate relationships between active muscles during a motion [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Coordination variability demonstrates adaptability in different movement patterns in response to internal and external disturbances [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, muscular coordination seems to be an appropriate indicator of control mechanisms during repetitive activities [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>According to the current literature, muscle synergies signify a more advanced organization of motor control, concentrating on the coordinated function of muscle groups during movement [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By examining muscle synergies, researchers can reveal how individuals utilize neuromuscular strategies to perform tasks effectively, adjust to discomfort, or accommodate functional limitations. This method offers a broader understanding of how the central nervous system coordinates movement [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned, SIS is a common injury among athletes, especially those involved in overhead movements [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Chronicity of this condition is more probable in athletes requiring such movements [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, SIS can decrease athlete performance, incurring costs for athletes, clubs, or healthcare systems [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to understand potential factors contributing to SIS among athletes. Additionally, various studies indicate that muscular coordination and variability can reflect the appropriate function of movement structures in the body [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this regard, it&#x02019;s shown that coordination and variability among muscles change in the presence of chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, no study has specifically addressed muscular coordination and variability during repetitive shoulder movements among athletes with SIS. Hence, this research aims to investigate and compare muscular coordination and variability during repetitive shoulder movements among athletes with and without SIS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>In this case-controlled study, 24 male athletes were recruited with the convenience sampling method and divided into two groups of athletes with SIS (12 persons) and without SIS (12 persons). Sample size estimation showed that a minimum of 22 male athlete volunteers would be necessary to achieve 90% statistical power at an alpha level of 0.05 within the two groups. According to a previous study, the sample size estimation was performed based on a calculated effect size (1.66) (extracted by G&#x02009;*&#x02009;Power ver 3.1 software) when investigating the effect of repetitive movement tasks on shoulder muscle activation on lower trapezius [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This study included male athletes aged 20&#x02013;35 with at least four years of training experience in overhead sports among groups with and without SIS.</p><p>For the SIS group, the athletes should have had a history of lateral shoulder pain for a minimum of 3 months on their dominant hand that the athletes usually used to throw a ball, had no pain radiations to the cervical or distal segments of the upper extremity, the pain should have aggravated with playing or training and relief with rest, and had no history of fever or night pain and cold sweat during the pain period. Additionally, clinical tests for Subacromial Impingement, such as the Neer Test and Hawkins-Kennedy Test, were performed to confirm the diagnosis of subacromial impingement syndrome. The exclusion criteria were as follows: athletes with a history of cervical radiculopathy, glenoid labrum lesion, shoulder dislocation, and shoulder girdle muscle rupture, the history of neurological, vestibular, or other balance-affecting medical conditions, and using any medications for neurological or metabolic disorders. An expert-certified musculoskeletal physical therapist performed the inclusion and exclusion criteria and diagnoses of shoulder pain with 16 years of experience in the field. Before starting the investigation, study approval was obtained from the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of Allameh Tabataba&#x02019;i University (ATU) (Ethics code: IR.ATU.REC.1401.084), and all participants gave written informed consent. The authors confirm that all research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. All subjects were right-handed. Sampling in the laboratory phase of this study began on September 23, 2023, and continued until April 13, 2024.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>The athletes were asked to perform a repetitive reaching task (RRT) for a minimum of fifteen repetitions. The last ten attempts were used as laboratory data for analysis. During the task, athletes were asked to stand on two adjacent force plates with their feet positioned relaxed at shoulder-width apart (<xref rid="pone.0319048.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). A researcher-made machine was used to control the arm movement range and maintain the upper extremity&#x02019;s testing position during the RRT. The testing shoulder was placed in the scapular plane at 90&#x02009;degrees of elevation. This machine had two adjustable cylindrical arms; one was matched with 30% and the other to 100% of the testing upper extremity length. Moreover, a circular mesh barrier was adjusted under the elbow to keep a consistent arm position during the RRT. The athletes were not allowed to touch this plate during the RRT. Then, the athletes were requested to continuously perform elbow flexion/extension so that the index finger could touch the 30% and 100% targets matched with the machine arms while the arm and elbow were maintained in the predetermined position. A metronome with auditory feedback was used to keep a rhythm of one trial per second so that the athletes could touch each target without hearing a sound. During the RRT, electromyography (EMG) data were recorded, too. Subjects continued the RRT until they had 15 successful elbow flexion/extension movements. Importantly, participants were unaware of the stopping movement.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0319048.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319048.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The laboratory setup for the repetitive movement task machine is showed from the front-right (A) and top (B) views.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0319048.g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>After preparing the skin, disposable Ag/AgCl chloride electrodes were attached to the muscles in accordance with previous recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Upper trapezius (TS upper), infraspinatus (IS), biceps brachii (BS), anterior deltoid (AD), lower trapezius (TS lower), posterior deltoid (PD), middle deltoid (MD), and triceps medial head (TB) EMG data were obtained from the examination side based on the previous guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Before starting the main test, a maximum voluntary isometric contraction test (MVIC) was taken from all the above muscles based on the recommended standards [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>A TeleMyo 900 EMG measurement device (Noraxon USA Inc., Arizona, USA) was used to record the EMG data. A 16-bit A/D card was used to digitally transform the 1200 Hz sampled data, which was stored for later examination. The participants were told to continue touching and going during each repetition, alternating between forward and backward phases. The arm and finger movement were used to define the movement phases. The forward phase began when the fingers made contact with the proximal target, and the end position represented the distal target of the same phase.

After the NNMF decomposition, we calculated the within- and between-group similarity of synergy patterns using the maximum cross-correlation function (r-max), which measures the waveform similarity across participants. To evaluate the robustness of muscle synergies, we also computed the variance accounted for (VAF) for each muscle, ensuring that the derived synergies adequately captured the underlying muscle activation patterns. The variance accounted for method was used to determine the number of synergies to retain. For further details on these analyses, readers can refer to the methods described in our previous publications.</p><p>This study determined the number of muscular synergies by the VAF. In this line, the number of muscular synergies that characterized 90% of VAF was considered the number of synergies extracted for analysis.

By averaging the r max-values of each within and between-group pairwise analysis, the within and between-group index of variability was determined. The determined metrics served as markers for the waveform consistency both between and within the following groups: 144 pairs with and without SIS (12 healthy &#x000d7;&#x02009; 12 with SIS), 66 pairs with SIS (each participant compared with the other 11), and 66 pairs with SIS (each participant compared with the other 11).

Synergy #1, primarily involves back muscles, including UT, LT, PD, IS, and TB.

Synergy #2, is predominantly active during the forward phase and, to a lesser extent, at the beginning of the reverse phase. It comprises activity in anterior upper-limb muscles, specifically BS, AD, and MD (<xref rid="pone.0319048.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> Central and bottom panel). Synergy #3, is active from the middle of the forward phase to the start of the reverse phase.

After extracting the shoulder girdle muscle synergies, this study&#x02019;s results indicated three observable muscle synergy patterns in both groups. It was demonstrated that there was no significant difference in VAF between the SIS and CON groups of athletes for all three muscle synergies. Independent analysis of muscles showed that the VAF<sub>muscle</sub> significantly differed in the posterior deltoid and middle deltoid muscles in the SIS group compared to the CON group, whereas this value was lower significantly in the subscapular muscle in the SIS group. Additionally, no significant statistical differences were shown regarding Intra-Group Variability between the groups. However, the SIS and CON groups showed significant differences in Inter-Group Variability.

However, the presence of SIS causes an impact on muscular coordination and movement variability during repetitive flexion and extension elbow movements in athletes significantly, which signifies that particular RRT results in varied neural strategies employed by the athletes. Moreover, have suggested that the shoulder girdle muscles in athletes with chronic shoulder pain are still able to generate effective movement patterns despite the presence of pain [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These results have important suggestions for understanding the musculoskeletal system&#x02019;s resilience and adaptability in the face of chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Compared to the CON group, the SIS group exhibited significantly different VAF values in the posterior deltoid, middle deltoid, and subscapularis muscles. These differences indicate alterations in the activation patterns and coordination of these specific muscles in individuals with SIS. The lower VAF valuations observed in the subscapularis muscle in the SIS group may reflect a disruption in its normal recruitment pattern, potentially contributing to impaired shoulder stability.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Intra-group variability</title><p>We observed that the synergy temporal component exhibited similar correlation values across different groups. Specifically, for the CON and SIS groups, the pairwise analysis did not reveal significant differences in the timing characteristics of the synergies. This consistency suggests that the temporal activation patterns of each synergy remained stable across subjects within each group. Additionally, the shape of the synergies showed little variability within each group. However, we did find notable differences in the correlation values between synergy #1 and #3 across the groups. Specifically, the CON group exhibited a higher degree of variability in this regard. In both the CON and SIS groups, the temporal activation patterns of muscle synergies remained remarkably consistent across subjects. This finding suggests that individuals within each group exhibited similar timing characteristics when activating these predefined motor patterns. Additionally, the shape of the synergies&#x02014;representing coordinated muscle activations&#x02014;showed little variability within each group. These consistent temporal and spatial patterns highlight the robustness of muscle synergies as fundamental building blocks for motor control [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Inter-group variability</title><p>We found that during RRT, athletes with SIS had two peaks, synergy #1, in contrast to the CON group&#x02019;s synergy #1, which exhibited only a single peak. The observed difference could be attributed to the integration of synergy #2 and #3 in the SIS group. Specifically, this integration occurs at the transition between the final phase of reverse movement and the initial phase of forward movement. In the CON group, synergy #3 appears to involve elbow extension to reach the endpoint position primarily. However, in the SIS group, the third synergy pattern exhibits a second, increasing moment, with its peak aligning with the onset of activation of the first synergy. In the CON group, synergy #3 appears to involve elbow extension to reach the endpoint position primarily. However, in the SIS group, the third synergy pattern exhibits a second, increasing moment, with its peak aligning with the onset of activation of the first synergy. In contrast to the CON group, where synergy #1 exhibits no significant activation, the SIS group shows the presence of a peak in synergy #1. Considering this activation, it appears that synergy #1 in the CON group can be conceptually divided into both synergy #1 and the initial peak of synergy #3 observed in the SIS group. The observed fractionation leads to the inclusion of the PD in synergy #1 for the SIS group, whereas the MD (middle deltoid) and the TB predominantly contribute to synergy #3.</p><p>As anticipated, the muscle vectors exhibited low correlation values. However, there was an exception for synergy #1, which displayed less variability in its composition. In contrast, synergy #2 and #3 demonstrated weaker correlations. In the context of synergy #1, it appears that the CON group relies on intrinsic synergies that have been previously utilized in similar motor tasks. Notably, the variation within both groups is approximately consistent with the variation observed between the groups. In the context of synergy #2 and #3, the observed weaker correlations could potentially be linked to the modulation of muscle synergies by the SIS. This is in line with previous studies&#x02019; findings that specific strategies in response to individuals with chronic pain were developed [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, despite the study&#x02019;s limited sample size, most of the observed significant differences in muscle synergy components and individual EMG patterns exhibited a substantial effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s d greater than 0.5). These effects extend beyond the inherent variability in data related to muscle synergy extraction during the RRT [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The observed differences between the two groups in this study highlight the importance of further investigating adaptations in repetitive shoulder movements, especially among athletes. By including individuals with SIS in other tasks, we can assess how their coordination may evolve over time. Understanding the neural strategies behind complex movements and considering different phases of task processes will be crucial for promoting intermuscular adaptations. Additionally, incorporating kinematic and kinetic data could enhance our understanding of muscle activation during movement, complementing the results obtained from EMG analysis.</p><p>The results of this research offer clinical physiotherapists an important understanding of the changed neuromuscular coordination patterns in athletes experiencing SIS. By recognizing the particular muscles, including the posterior and middle deltoids, that show changed activation patterns, physiotherapists can create focused interventions to re-establish proper coordination and enhance functional performance. Rehabilitation programs may aim to retrain muscle synergies via exercises that improve intermuscular coordination, including proprioceptive and motor control activities [<xref rid="pone.0319048.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Additionally, timely identification of changed synergy patterns might assist physiotherapists in applying preventative measures to minimize the likelihood of performance mistakes and additional injuries.</p><p>Although this article&#x02019;s results were interesting, the limitations of this research should be considered in order to generalize them. First, it should be noted that this study is a cross-sectional study. Therefore, its results cannot be attributed solely to shoulder pain in athletes. It should also be noted that motor strategies may change during exercise as athletes become fatigued. Therefore, it is recommended that this study be repeated when athletes are functionally fatigued. On the other hand, it should be noted that the movement evaluated in this laboratory study differs greatly from the movement of athletes during exercise training. Therefore, the results of the research may differ in real exercise conditions. Moreover, since simultaneous activation around the shoulder joint can provide valuable insights into joint stabilization and movement precision, consider incorporating muscle co-activation analysis into future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed differences in muscular coordination and variability during RRT in athletes with and without SIS. Three different muscle synergy patterns were demonstrated in both groups, with notable differences in the VAF in selected muscles. It shows that athletes with SIS had significantly higher VAF in the posterior and middle deltoids and lower VAF in the subscapularis muscle than controls. Moreover, inter-group variability analysis disclosed that synergy #1 (posterior shoulder muscles) and synergy #2 (anterior shoulder muscles) were activated earlier in the SIS group. In contrast, the control group activated synergy #3 (arm muscles) earlier. It seems that timing and coordination changes in muscle activation may influence movement efficiency and increase the risk of performance errors.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0319048.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary file 1.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0319048.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0319048.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Winge</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lassen Nielsen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Epidemiology of injuries in Danish championship tennis</article-title>. <source>Int J Sports Med</source>. <year>1989</year>.;<volume>10</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>368</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>71</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2599726</pub-id>
