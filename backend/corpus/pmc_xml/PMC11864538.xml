</self-uri><abstract><p>Among tremendous biodiversity within the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) are gigantic mysticetes (baleen whales) that produce structured sequences of sound described as song. From six years of passive acoustic monitoring within the central CCE we measured seasonal and interannual variations in the occurrence of blue (<italic toggle="yes">Balaenoptera musculus</italic>), fin (<italic toggle="yes">Balaenoptera physalus</italic>), and humpback (<italic toggle="yes">Megaptera novaeangliae</italic>) whale song. Song detection during 11 months of the year defines its prevalence in this foraging habitat and its potential use in behavioral ecology research. Large interannual changes in song occurrence within and between species motivates examination of causality. Humpback whales uniquely exhibited continuous interannual increases, rising from 34% to 76% of days over six years, and we examine multiple hypotheses to explain this exceptional trend. Potential influences of physical factors on detectability &#x02013; including masking and acoustic propagation &#x02013; were not supported by analysis of wind data or modeling of acoustic transmission loss. Potential influences of changes in local population abundance, site fidelity, or migration timing were supported for two of the interannual increases in song detection, based on extensive local photo ID data (17,356 IDs of 2,407 individuals). Potential influences of changes in foraging ecology and efficiency were supported across all years by analyses of the abundance and composition of forage species. Following detrimental food web impacts of a major marine heatwave that peaked during the first year of the study, foraging conditions consistently improved for humpback whales in the context of their exceptional prey-switching capacity. Stable isotope data from humpback and blue whale biopsy samples are consistent with observed interannual variations in the regional abundance and composition of forage species. This study thus indicates that major interannual changes in detection of baleen whale song may reflect underlying variations in forage species availability driven by energetic variations in ecosystem state.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

In recent decades, major advances in remote sensing technologies &#x02013; including satellites [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], coastal radar stations [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], autonomous platforms [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and uncrewed aerial systems [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] &#x02013; have contributed to the ability to observe physical, chemical, and biological processes in marine ecosystems with increasing precision and detail. Despite these advances, monitoring species of higher trophic levels at ecosystem scales remains a significant challenge. Remote sensing via passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is essential for filling this gap for several reasons. Most notably, the aquatic medium and limited visibility in marine ecosystems has led to the evolution of long-distance acoustic communication in marine animals [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], allowing for wide-ranging detection of soniferous species and their behavior using hydrophones [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this study, we examine how variations in detection of song from three baleen whale (<italic toggle="yes">Mysticeti)</italic> species with distinct foraging strategies inhabiting the central California Current Ecosystem (CCE) &#x02013; blue whales (<italic toggle="yes">B. m. musculus musculus</italic>), fin whales (<italic toggle="yes">B. p. physalus</italic>), and humpback whales (<italic toggle="yes">M. n. novaeangliae</italic>) &#x02013; track variations in ecosystem state and forage species abundance and composition.</p><p>Blue, fin, and humpback whale populations all exploit the tremendous seasonal biological productivity of the CCE to support their large body size and long-distance movements [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem also supports diverse and abundant populations of other ecologically, economically, and culturally significant organisms. Upwelling of deep, nutrient-rich water in the CCE (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) results from seasonal equatorward wind forcing and supports the growth of phytoplankton [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This primary productivity propagates to higher trophic levels, sustaining seasonally abundant forage species on which numerous and diverse predators depend [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition to strong seasonality in physical and biological oceanographic conditions, this upwelling system is marked by significant interannual variability in upwelling magnitude and phenology, levels of primary productivity, and relative abundance of distinct forage species [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, a persistent marine heatwave during 2014&#x02013;2016 changed regional upwelling dynamics and phytoplankton ecology, in turn impacting the behavior and population health of invertebrate and vertebrate animal species [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At decadal time scales, large-scale physical oscillations that drive changes in forage species abundance and composition are evident in the diets of humpback whales, as revealed by stable isotope analysis [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These impacts at higher trophic levels suggest that top predator populations could act as ecosystem sentinels [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some predator populations have recently been assessed in this context, e.g., seabirds [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], humpback whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and blue whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], each providing insights into marine heatwave impacts on forage species and predator ecology.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0318624.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318624.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Ecosystem setting.</title><p>(a) The passive acoustic monitoring site is in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) along the eastern margin of the North Pacific.

Eastern North Pacific blue whales are obligate euphausiid (krill) predators which typically forage along the shelf break off western North America during the summer and fall before migrating southward to lower-latitude breeding grounds [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The timing of blue whale arrival and departure from CCE foraging habitat can vary by several months interannually in association with changes in the phenology of physical and biological oceanographic processes which drive krill abundance, density, and distribution [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Fin whales in the eastern North Pacific also prey primarily on euphausiids, although copepods may contribute substantially to their diet in some years [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Studies employing biotelemetry [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and PAM [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggest that fin whales occupy the CCE year-round. Tag deployments on fin whales in the Southern California Bight indicated two seasonal patterns: (1) migration of part of the population to lower latitudes in winter, and (2) preferential habitat occupancy nearshore during fall and winter and offshore during spring and summer [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Relatively little is known about the habitat preferences and seasonality of fin whales in the central CCE. Humpback whales that forage in the central CCE belong almost exclusively to two of the distinct population segments in the northeastern Pacific, migrating between foraging grounds off the western United States and breeding grounds off Mexico and Central America [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While migration between foraging grounds and lower latitude breeding grounds is well documented, visual sighting and PAM data indicate nearly year-round presence of humpback whales in the central CCE [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. During their time in foraging habitat off western North America, humpback whales target both krill and forage fish (anchovy and sardine), flexibly switching between dominant prey sources depending on oceanographic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Singing behavior of blue, fin and humpback whales, involving production of sound sequences that are rhythmic and structured, is thought to be limited to mature males [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Previous studies in this region have detected song from blue whales 7 months of the year and from humpback whales 9 months of the year [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Song detection in both species can begin months before the winter breeding migration. Humpback whale song can persist for months following the breeding season, after whales return to foraging habitat in spring, a pattern also observed in foraging habitat of the western North Atlantic [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In Antarctic foraging habitat, humpback whale song can have the level of complexity found in breeding habitat, and it has been detected to occur during foraging dives [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A growing body of literature is recognizing the prevalence of this behavior within foraging habitat, in addition to migratory [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and breeding habitat [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Detection of both song (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) and foraging-associated calls can contribute to ecological research. Foraging-associated calls are produced by blue and fin whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], however they are much less prevalent than song in our study region. Blue whale tag data from the eastern North Pacific show that rates of song calls can exceed those of foraging-associated calls by an order of magnitude [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. PAM data for fin whales off Southern California show a greater proportion of hours per week and a greater proportion of the year during which song calls (20 Hz pulses) were detected compared to foraging-associated calls (40 Hz pulses) [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. No studies have identified foraging-specific humpback whale calls in our study region. The lesser occurrence of foraging associated calls and the inability to consistently examine their occurrence across all three whale species motivate the focus of the present study on detection of song, which is a more abundant signal that can be described across all three whale species.</p><p>Here we combine measured detection of blue, fin, and humpback whale song with concurrent data on whale photo ID, forage species abundance and behavior, isotope-based diet analysis from whale skin biopsy samples, oceanographic and meteorological conditions, and modeling of acoustic propagation to derive insights into the presence and foraging ecology of these sympatric mysticetes. We apply these methods within a six-year study period, July 2015 through June 2021, in the central CCE to address two questions: (1) How does song detection vary seasonally and interannually? (2) Are interannual variations in detection of song indicative of ecosystem state and availability of key forage species? In answering these questions, we show how the songs produced by these gigantic vertebrates can reveal complex dimensions of their ecology in a vast and highly variable ecosystem.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Acoustic recordings</title><p>Acoustic recordings were acquired through the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) cabled observatory, located on the continental slope outside Monterey Bay, California (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Since July 2015, MARS has supported nearly continuous recording at a sample rate of 256&#x02009;kHz using an Ocean Sonics icListen HF, an omnidirectional hydrophone with a bandwidth of 10 Hz to 200&#x02009;kHz. The data are streamed to a computer on shore and stored in 10-minute wav files. Two derived data products supported analyses: (1) daily files of original audio decimated to a 16&#x02009;kHz sample rate [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], which enabled humpback whale song detection, and (2) daily files of power spectra with temporal and frequency resolutions of 5 seconds and 1 Hz, respectively, which enabled blue and fin whale song detection. Daily acoustic metrics, described below, were the basis for examination of seasonal and interannual patterns. Only days with at least 75% recording coverage were included in analyses. Of 2192 days within the 6-year period, 96% (2111) were sampled, 97% of sampled days (2051) had coverage of 75% or greater, and 92% of sampled days (1948) had complete coverage.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Detecting whale song and quantifying its variations</title><p>Detection of humpback whale song (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) employed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that was previously trained based on recordings of North Pacific humpback whale song and proven to generalize well across a range of recording and noise conditions [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The model frames input audio into analysis windows and produces a corresponding sequence of logistic units as scoring of humpback whale song detection, ranging between 0 and 1. We resampled input data to 10&#x02009;kHz, as used in the original model development, and applied the CNN model to obtain scores at 1-second resolution over the 6-year study period. To validate model application to MARS recordings, we manually examined two years of results by directly comparing CNN scores with temporally aligned high-resolution spectrograms [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This comparison confirmed reliable and consistent detection of humpback whale song, even amid substantial background noise, and it was used to establish the threshold score used for classification. Because two other biological sound sources, gray whales and dolphins, at times produced moderately elevated scores (~0.3 to 0.6), we applied a minimum score threshold of 0.7 to reliably detect humpback whale song and distinguish it from other signals. For each day we quantified the percent of recording time during which the score exceeded this threshold. A minimum daily value of 3% of recording time with a score exceeding 0.7 was applied to define daily presence of song. Performance metrics based on these criteria are summarized in the results.</p><p>Detection of blue and fin whale song (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) used energy detection methods that focus on the most prevalent calls produced by these species in the study region: the fin whale 20 Hz call and the blue whale B call. This prevalence is indicated by previous studies in the CCE [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] as well as visual examination of high-resolution spectrograms from our monitoring site across all years of the study [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. For each species we computed a call index (CI; [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]) as the ratio of the peak spectrum level within the frequency band of the call to the average spectrum level in adjacent frequency bands that are uninfluenced by low-frequency baleen whale vocalizations. CI was calculated at daily resolution using daily mean calibrated power spectra. This method has two advantages: (1) it quantifies the integrated energy of calling, regardless of whether or not chorusing occurs, and (2) it minimizes potential bias from ephemeral noise sources affecting background spectrum levels. The biophonic signal underlying this method is represented by mean spectrum levels across the frequency range spanning both call types (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>) and the statistical distributions of daily mean spectrum levels in peak and background bands (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). The ability to quantify sound energy of targeted whale calls using this method is illustrated by the relative stability in background frequency bands compared to strong seasonal elevation of spectrum levels in the frequency range of the fin whale 20 Hz call (peak 20&#x02013;21 Hz) and the third harmonic of the blue whale B call (peak 42&#x02013;43 Hz). For both blue and fin whales, a minimum CI value of 1.01 was applied to define song presence. Considering that CI = 1.0 represents no signal and maximum daily CI values are approximately 1.2 for both species, the minimum threshold of 1.01 represents a signal approximately 5% above the floor of the dynamic range.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0318624.g003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318624.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Call index methods for blue and fin whale acoustic detection.</title><p>(a) The long-term median of daily mean spectrum levels measured at MARS (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) for the months of August through December shows peaks caused by fin whale 20 Hz pulses and the third harmonic of blue whale B calls (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

For blue whales we examined occurrence of a different call produced in songs: the A call [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In the blue whale song represented in <xref rid="pone.0318624.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, two A calls are represented (label A next to the first). Each A call was followed by a series of B calls (label B next to the third harmonic of one B call; 14 and 15 repetitions, respectively). Considering the core daily detection metric for B calls, we manually examined high-resolution spectrograms for every day within the 6-year study period for which the B-call metric exceeded the minimum threshold, and we quantified cooccurrence of A and B calls. For fin whales we also examined high-resolution spectrograms throughout the time-series to determine whether fin whale 20 Hz calls consistently occurred in series with regular interpulse intervals that are characteristic of song [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Daily time-series of metrics for all species were smoothed with a 5-day running mean to clarify temporal boundaries of persistent song presence/ absence while retaining clear description of variations within the annual period of song occurrence. The smoothed, quality-controlled daily time-series comprised the basis for examination of both seasonal and interannual patterns in acoustic detection. Considering the different methods of detecting and quantifying song occurrence across species, it is essential to apply a single consistent metric of seasonal and interannual detection levels. The metric we apply is the percent of recorded days during which detection metrics exceeded their minimum thresholds. For the seasonal time scale, we combined data from all years to define a monthly climatology of the percent of days with detection. For the interannual time scale, we computed the percent of days with detection in each year. Because of the seasonal pattern of baleen whale song, which arises in all three species between July (blue) and August (fin, humpback), each analysis year spanned July 1 of a calendar year through June 30 of the following calendar year.</p><p>Previous studies of blue whale song demonstrated that the trend in the day:night ratio of song detection during fall-winter can reveal the timing of the southward breeding migration, which covaried with upwelling and differed by as long as 4 months among the years studied [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This metric is thus included in our study as a potential indicator of behavioral ecology across all whale species examined. It is computed from the full-resolution song metrics (1 second for humpback whale song scores, 5 seconds for blue and fin whale call indices) binned into solar elevation (SE) ranges that define day (SE &#x0003e; 0&#x000b0;) and night (SE &#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;12&#x000b0;).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Examining causality of interannual variations in song detection</title><p>Using interdisciplinary observations and modeling, we consider multiple hypotheses to explain causality of the major patterns of interannual variation in detection of whale song. These hypotheses involve ecological variables that affect the source signal within the domain of acoustic reception, and environmental variables that affect signal transmission to the receiver and signal distinction within the greater soundscape. Behavioral ecology variables include whale local abundance, proximity to MARS, site fidelity, migration timing, and the acoustic behavior of mature male (singing) individuals. Environmental variables include physical conditions that determine acoustic propagation, and noise sources that can mask song signal and inhibit detection. Hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, they cannot be completely examined for any of the whale species, and they cannot all be directly examined from available data. However, hypotheses can be most fully considered for humpback whales because extensive photo ID data are uniquely available for this species. These data enable quantitative metrics of local abundance, site fidelity, and migration timing.

The first metric, <italic toggle="yes">local population abundance</italic>, is based on analysis of UID/day at seasonal and interannual time scales. Seasonal variation was examined at monthly resolution within individual years and climatologically (pooling UID/day data monthly across all years), and interannual variation was examined from UID/day data pooled within each study year. Comparisons applied graphical (boxplot) representation and evaluation of significant differences using paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The second metric, <italic toggle="yes">migration timing</italic>, is based on the temporal progression of UID/day. Monthly binning provided a statistical framework within which significant changes and threshold crossings were identified. A threshold was defined at the 33<sup>rd</sup> percentile of 1568 daily measurements of UID/day made across all years, effectively describing separation of the lower third from the upper two thirds of the statistical distribution of values. To consider the timing of northward spring migration, returning from distant breeding habitat to local foraging habitat, we identified the first month in which monthly median UID/day rose and remained above the threshold. To consider the timing of southward winter migration, away from local foraging habitat to distant breeding habitat, we identified the first month in which monthly median UID/day fell and remained below the threshold. The third metric, <italic toggle="yes">site fidelity</italic>, was based on the number of days within each year that each individual was identified in the study area. This individual-based statistic was examined at the interannual time scale via nonparametric boxplots and evaluation of significant differences using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

The metric for local population abundance indicated significant interannual increases in two sequential year-to-year comparisons: years 2&#x02013;3 and 3&#x02013;4 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7b</xref>), consistent with increasing acoustic detection (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). This visual metric subsequently decreased between years 4 and 5 and did not change between years 5 and 6 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7b</xref>), inconsistent with continuing increases in acoustic detection of song and its daytime proportion (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>).

A key reference point is the month during which median UID/day reached an annual minimum, presumably representing when the largest proportion of the regional population was away from foraging habitat due to the breeding migration; this month was February in all years. Considering the winter migration period, monthly median values of the daily metric fell and remained below the threshold of 4 UID/day in December of all years, except year 2 when this transition occurred one month later. Considering the spring migration period, monthly median values of the daily metric rose and remained above the threshold of 4 UID/day beginning within the 3-month period of March through May in the following sequence for years 1&#x02013;6: April, May, March, March, April, May. This interannual variation exhibited no trend toward earlier return to foraging habitat in a way that could have determined the positive trend in acoustic detection. Taken together, these metrics of migration timing can quantify the number of months within each year that median UID/day was above the 33<sup>rd</sup> percentile threshold: 8, 8, 11, 9, 9, and 7 months, respectively. Increased duration of UID/day above the threshold is indicated for only one year-to-year comparison: years 2&#x02013;3. Further, the year with the fewest months of sightings above the threshold, year 6, had the highest level of song detection (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Foraging ecology</title><p>Large interannual variations in forage species abundance and composition are indicated by annual spring-summer sampling off central California during the study period. During the first three years, abundance indices of forage fish (anchovy and sardine) were persistently low while krill stocks steadily increased from negative, to near-neutral, to positive anomalies (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7c</xref>). This trend in krill abundance paralleled increases in biologically effective upwelling (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>) and primary productivity during regional emergence from a multi-year marine heatwave [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. All three whale species consume krill, and song detection for all three whale species increased during these years. During the latter three years of the study period, krill abundance transitioned to strongly negative anomalies while at least one forage fish species exhibited strong positive anomalies (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7c</xref>). Of these two fish species, anchovy populations were much more abundant in absolute terms, and positive anomalies in their abundance persisted throughout all three years. During this period humpback whales uniquely showed a continuing positive trend in both song detection and the proportion of daytime song (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). In contrast, blue and fin whales showed decreases in song detection in two of three interannual comparisons.</p><p>Years 3 and 5 show particularly strong contrasts that are considered in greater detail for humpback whales, the species for which we have the most substantial data resources.

This pattern of humpback whales being seen less but heard more in year 5 versus year 3 was evident in multiple ways (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). During year 5, song was detected more during both fall (August) and spring (March&#x02013;May) and with greater daily levels of intensity in most months (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8a</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>), in strong contrast to persistently lower levels of visual detection (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8c</xref>). The greatest divergence between detection methods occurred during March&#x02013;May, when acoustic detection increased from 6% of days in year 3 to 75% of days in year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8a</xref>) while visual detection decreased significantly (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8c</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

The Monterey Bay region is an important foraging habitat for mysticetes that inhabit the eastern North Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and previous studies in the Monterey Bay region have shown how passive acoustic monitoring can reveal underlying influences of foraging ecology on the acoustic behavior and acoustic detection of baleen whale species. These studies have examined the role of krill aggregation dynamics in the foraging strategies and movement ecology of blue whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], the consequences of large interannual changes in productivity and foraging ecology for the timing of blue whale migration [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and the behavioral ecology of humpback whales amid extreme ecosystem variations [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the present study we applied interdisciplinary observations to expand, temporally and taxonomically, examination of the behavioral ecology of three sympatric mysticete species with overlapping niches in regional foraging ecology.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Seasonal patterns</title><p>Song detection in all three whale species begins annually during the late summer/ early fall (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). The rise of humpback whale song detection beginning in August follows high levels of visual detection during April&#x02013;July, indicating that the annual rise of song represents emergence of this acoustic behavior from an actively foraging population (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). Blue whales are also present in the CCE during summer, acoustically detected by their foraging-associated D calls typically by May in the Southern California Bight [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and the Monterey Bay region [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The rise of song in blue whales during July thus similarly suggests a change in acoustic behavior, specifically males beginning to sing. However, visual data indicate primary months of blue whale sighting in the Monterey Bay region during July through October [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and the rise of blue whale song in July may be influenced by both increased local population abundance and seasonal change in acoustic behavior. Fin whale sighting data off central California is limited, however a five-year study within a large region off southern California showed that fin whales were visually detected frequently beginning in July, similar to blue whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In this context, the emergence of fin whale song during August in the Southern California Bight [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and central CCE (this study) may similarly be driven by change in acoustic behavior and not simply increased local abundance.</p><p>Consistent with a life history strategy of capital breeding, the annual winter decline of song detection in this foraging habitat reflects migration to distant low-latitude breeding habitat [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. While blue and fin whales show a single decline in acoustic detection of song each year, humpback whales uniquely exhibit a bimodal pattern with secondary peaks in song detection during spring (March&#x02013;May) that are lower than the fall peak and variable from year to year with regard to occurrence, timing, duration, and intensity (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>). Humpback visual sightings consistently reached their annual minimum in February of every year in the study period, and we speculate that these variable secondary peaks in song detection during March&#x02013;May represent whales returning to foraging habitat in the spring, continuing their singing behavior that peaks in the breeding season. This interpretation is consistent with continual singing of humpback whales into late spring that has been documented for foraging habitat in the northwest Atlantic [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] as well as singing during migration from breeding to foraging habitat in the eastern North Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>The longer annual duration of song detection from fin (10 months) and humpback (11 months) whales (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>) compared to blue whales (8 months) is consistent with visual sighting data off southern California, which showed absence of blue whales in winter and spring, in contrast to humpback sightings in spring through fall and year-round sightings of fin whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. More persistent acoustic detection of fin whales compared to blue whales has been observed in the northeast Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] and associated with year-round presence in the Southern California Bight [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Regardless of these differences, all three species demonstrate prevalent and persistent singing in foraging habitat, and this prevalence enables accurate detection of song to be an effective data resource for ecological research in foraging habitat.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Interannual patterns</title><p>Interannual variability in song detection during the study period was large, varying by factors of 2.2 (humpback), 1.6 (blue) and 1.9 (fin). The primary difference across species was multifaceted distinction of humpback whales, which showed the largest range in song detection, the only continuously positive trend in song detection, and the only positive trend in the proportion of song occurring during the day. The primary similarity across species was increased song detection during the first three years, rising out of the first-year minimum. Acoustic recording began near the peak of a multi-year marine heatwave [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], which was associated with low levels of primary productivity and major food web consequences [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Beyond changes is trophic energy transfer, high levels of food web toxicity during an extreme harmful algal bloom (HAB) in the northeastern Pacific during 2015 caused the most widespread poisoning of marine mammals ever documented, including whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As observed in our study region, this HAB and its underlying physical, chemical and biological anomalies were extreme [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Initiation of this time series during the height of extremely anomalous ecosystem conditions suggests that the common rise of song among all three whale species during years 1&#x02013;3 represents recovery from exceptional conditions to more typical conditions. Key ecosystem factors considered in a prior study examining only humpback whale song were increases in primary productivity and krill abundance, in parallel with decreases in food web toxicity driven by phytoplankton ecology [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this context, one discovery of the present study &#x02013; that acoustic detection of blue and fin whales increased in parallel with that of humpback whales during three years of emergence from a heatwave &#x02013; is consistent with ecosystem-wide impacts of this major environmental perturbation. Marine heatwave influence on the acoustic behavior of blue whales has been inferred from PAM and environmental observations in the South Taranaki Bight region of Aotearoa New Zealand, where whales exhibited reduced foraging and reproductive effort during a heatwave [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Possible factors influencing interannual variation in acoustic detection at a fixed location are diverse and may be interrelated. These factors include local population abundance, local site fidelity, duration of annual residence in foraging habitat (migration timing), proximity of calling whales to the acoustic receiver, demographic composition of the local population (proportion that are mature males), acoustic behavior of mature male whales, and the extent of attenuation or masking by environmental conditions. Data resources, and hence the ability to examine hypotheses about causal factors, differ among the whale species in this study. We consider each of these species in turn, starting with the species for which we have the greatest data resources &#x02013; humpback whales.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Humpback whales.</title><p>The relatively greater potential to consider factors driving interannual variations in humpback whale song detection is largely due to extensive photo ID data that were uniquely available for this species from the full study period. These data leverage extensive sampling from ecotourism and research activities and were acquired from within MARS&#x02019; acoustic detection range [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The data do not comprehensively define age and sex of all identified whales, as would be required to estimate abundance of the local adult male population that presumably would be the primary source of song signal [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, knowledge of individual identity from photo ID enables quantification of the number of unique individuals and how this metric changes through time. Compared to simply the number of sightings of a species, the ID-based metric more accurately represents local animal abundance and is more directly comparable to acoustic detection. This photo ID data informed examination of three potential factors for all sequential year-to-year changes in song detection: local population abundance, site fidelity, and migration timing (<xref rid="pone.0318624.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0318624.t003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318624.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Assessment of factors having potential influence on interannual changes in humpback whale song detection.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0318624.t003" id="pone.0318624.t003g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Factor</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yrs 1&#x02013;2</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yrs 2&#x02013;3</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yrs 3&#x02013;4</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yrs 4&#x02013;5</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yrs 5&#x02013;6</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total <xref rid="t003fn001" ref-type="table-fn"><sup>+</sup></xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

There was only one interannual increase in the metrics representing these factors, years 2&#x02013;3 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The potential influence of local population abundance on the continuous positive trend in humpback whale song (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>) is supported to a moderate extent, for two of the five sequential interannual comparisons: years 2&#x02013;3 and 3&#x02013;4 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7b</xref>). However, comparison of visual and acoustic detection metrics also illustrates how they can diverge significantly. The large increase in acoustic detection across the focal comparison of year 3 versus year 5 coincided with decreases in local visual detection metrics derived from both the greater aggregated photo-ID dataset and regional scientific surveys (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Throughout the annual cycle of song occurrence in these years, humpback whales were persistently heard more but seen less during year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), and the period when these metrics were most divergent across years was during the spring (March&#x02013;May). Despite habitat compression that was evident during year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8d</xref>), which would cause humpback whales to forage closer to the coast [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and could have elevated sighting levels in the bay (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), we observed the opposite &#x02013; lower sighting levels during year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Figs 7b</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). Therefore, comparison of acoustic and visual detection metrics (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>) was unlikely to have been biased by environmental forcing of habitat compression. Instead, the degree to which humpback whales were seen less but heard more during year 5 may be underestimated in this comparison. Also for this focal comparison of years 3 and 5, we found no indication of influence from changes in acoustic propagation or masking by wind noise (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8f</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.g008" ref-type="fig">8g</xref>). This integrative examination thus points to considering changes in acoustic behavior. Foraging is the most essential life activity in this habitat, and changes in foraging ecology have diverse consequences for whale behavior.</p><p>Changes in foraging efficiency, driven by major changes in forage species populations, may influence prey search effort, habitat occupancy, health, energy storage on short to cumulative long-term time scales, and allocation of time to different behaviors. Changes in acoustic behavior can be indicated by divergence of acoustic and visual detection metrics, and such divergence was evident in three of the five sequential year-to-year changes: years 1&#x02013;2, 4&#x02013;5, and 5&#x02013;6 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Increases in acoustic detection relative to visual detection may indicate increased time allocation to singing behavior. Variability in forage species abundance and composition in the central CCE was consistent with increasing foraging efficiency and potential consequences for acoustic behavior across all sequential year-to-year comparisons (<xref rid="pone.0318624.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Increases in krill abundance during the first three years may have increased foraging efficiency amid persistent negative anomalies in forage fish abundance (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7c</xref>). Increases in forage fish abundance and aggregation during the latter three years may have increased foraging efficiency for humpback whales particularly, because they are known to readily switch between available prey [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and a fish-dominated diet would presumably be more energy rich. Measured wet caloric densities of prey sampled in the study region were 2&#x02013;3 times greater for anchovies and sardines compared to krill [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Measurements of forage species sampled in the California Current Ecosystem have shown that Northern anchovy (<italic toggle="yes">Engraulis mordax</italic>) is the most energy dense and nearly twice that of the dominant krill species, <italic toggle="yes">Euphausia pacifica</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Thysanoessa spinifera</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>].</p><p>A shift toward a more fish-dominated diet in local humpback whales is indicated by the isotopic compositions of biopsy samples across the strongly contrasting years of forage abundance and composition: year 3 versus year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Further, an individual sampled three times across 74 days of the foraging season in year 5 exhibited isotopic compositions indicative of a strongly and persistently fish-dominated diet (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>, CRC-ID 12049), suggestive of preference for fish when forage abundance anomalies were &#x02013;krill | +&#x02009;fish. The single largest increase in humpback whale acoustic detection, by a factor of 1.35, occurred between years 3 and 4. Although increased local population abundance may partially explain this increase (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7b</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), this was the only interannual change involving coincident occurrence of positive anomalies in the abundance of krill and both forage fish species. Humpback whales would presumably benefit uniquely from this scenario, as they can readily consume all of these prey.</p><p>Unique data resources for the final two years of the study period allow further consideration of the potential influence of foraging efficiency on humpback whale behavior and acoustic detection. Active acoustic sensing showed that increases in the local abundance (1.7&#x000d7;) and aggregation (4.4&#x000d7;) of forage fish, both of which would presumably enhance foraging efficiency, coincided with large increases in humpback whale song detection and its daytime proportion (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). This occurred despite no indications from visual detection of increased humpback whale local population abundance, site fidelity, or persistence in foraging habitat between migration periods (<xref rid="pone.0318624.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A physical basis for greater abundance and aggregation of forage fish is evident in the regional upwelling index, which increased significantly between these years (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). While enhanced primary productivity from greater upwelling nutrient supply may support a larger population of forage fish, behavioral response of forage fish to upwelling &#x02013; forming dense aggregations [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] &#x02013; may increase the efficiency of prey capture and energy gain by whales.</p><p>The uniquely increasing proportion of song detection during the day for humpback whales, nearly doubling over the six-year period, was driven by two large interannual changes: between years 2 and 3 and years 5 and 6 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). Unlike the primary annual acoustic metric that emphasizes prevalence of detection within a year, the day:night metric indicates changes in diel patterns of acoustic behavior. An increased proportion of song detection during the day could represent changes in time allocation to primary behaviors, with more efficient daily foraging effort allowing more daily time allocation to singing behavior. The depths at which humpback whales lunge feed in the study region, measured using animal-borne tags, show a dominant peak deeper than 100 m [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This is consistent with the diel vertical migration of krill and other prey species that reside at depth during the day to avoid visual predators and thus is consistent with extensive foraging effort by humpback whales at depth during the day. The apparent importance of daytime foraging makes an increasing proportion of song detection during the day meaningful with regard to humpback whale behavioral ecology and relationships between foraging and singing behaviors.</p><p>Enhancement of foraging efficiency and energy storage, particularly early in the foraging season before singing behavior begins, may cumulatively increase the potential for time and energy allocation to song after this behavior emerges. This hypothesis can be most carefully considered for the interannual comparison having the greatest data resources: years 5 and 6. Increases in forage fish abundance and aggregation between years 5 and 6, detected from nearly continuous active acoustic sensing, are consistent with this hypothesis. Proportionally greater detection of song during the day may follow proportionally lesser foraging effort during the day. Evidence of seasonally diminishing daytime foraging rates has been found using deployment of biologging tags on humpback whales along the Western Antarctic Peninsula [<xref rid="CIT0100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This study showed a seasonal progression toward feeding less often, at lower rates, and at deeper depths. These changes were interpreted to result from intensive foraging required to meet energetic needs when first transitioning from fasting to foraging, and from seasonal changes in krill availability as prey depth increases seasonally, however the potential role of intrinsic factors like satiation were considered.</p><p>Over longer time scales, fish-rich years may also allow whales to accumulate greater energy stores that support their long-distance breeding migration. In this context, greater secondary spring peaks in song detection during fish-enriched years in the CCE could reflect relatively greater energy stores, such that adult male whales returning from breeding habitat had healthier body conditions and more energy available for a full behavioral spectrum. Viewed from the other end of the range of environmental conditions, extremely poor foraging conditions &#x02013; as observed early in our study period &#x02013; would demand much greater foraging effort. This, in turn, would likely reduce energy gain, energy storage, and energy and time dedicated to behaviors other than foraging. Multiple hypotheses were considered with regard to the causality of large decreases in detection of humpback whale song within breeding habitat around Hawaii during a period when a marine heatwave strongly affected their foraging habitat in the northeastern Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These include decreased population size, shifts in the distribution of the population, altered migration patterns, and behavioral changes in (singing) males. Our study began during the same marine heatwave, and our observations within foraging habitat of the northeastern Pacific substantially support the role of changes in the behavior of male humpback whales.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Blue whales.</title><p>Interannual variation in blue whale song spanned a smaller range than that of fin and humpback whales (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>), consistent with their shorter annual period of song detection (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). Within the full study period the greatest increase in annual blue whale song detection occurred between years 2 and 3 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). This largest increase occurred in the year marked by the greatest and most persistent elevation of daily CI (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>, year 3). These patterns suggest relatively high local population abundance and site fidelity, and this interpretation is supported by observations of dense aggregations of foraging blue whales within the study area during year 3 [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Potential influence of the timing of blue whale migration is suggested by results of a prior study for the same period, which showed interannual differences of up to four months in the timing of blue whale southward migration [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During the first three years, blue whale migration from local foraging habitat to breeding habitat occurred later each year, consistent with our finding that blue whale acoustic detection in local foraging habitat trended upward during these years (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). However, during the subsequent three years, southward migration by blue whales occurred later in the year than during all of the first three years [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], inconsistent with decreases in blue whale acoustic detection during two of the three years (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). Migration timing is thus not consistently supported in explaining interannual variation in acoustic detection of blue whales.</p><p>The role of changes in foraging ecology, and its potential modulation of whale acoustic behavior, is indicated by regional forage species data and stable isotope data from blue whale biopsy samples. As for both other whale species, the rise in blue whale song detection during the first three years paralleled emergence from the marine heatwave and recovery of krill populations. Consistent with being obligate krill predators, unlike humpback whales, blue whales exhibited a somewhat closer coupling to the interannual variations in krill abundance. The initial peak in song occurrence coincided with the initial peak in krill abundance during year 3, and a minimum in song occurrence during the remainder of the time series coincided with the return of strongly negative anomalies in krill abundance during year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). The comparison of years 3 and 5 shows the largest difference in krill abundances, from the highest level of the study period during year 3 to the lowest during year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7c</xref>). The parallel decrease in blue whale song detection may simply reflect lower local whale population abundance during the krill-impoverished year. However, isotopic compositions of blue whale biopsy samples were consistent with interannual changes in foraging ecology that could affect the behavioral spectrum of blue whales. Specifically, the broader range of variation in <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C during year 5 (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9a</xref>) is consistent with foraging over a relatively larger geographic domain when krill abundances were low, as <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C varies across geographic gradients [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], and it coincided with lower levels of local acoustic detection. If relatively unfavorable foraging conditions in year 5 required blue whales to forage over larger spatial scales, this could have reduced acoustic detection in at least two ways: (1) more time and energy allocated to prey search could have made less time and energy available for singing behavior, and/or (2) more ephemeral habitat occupancy could have reduced the total time that whales were within the range of acoustic detection from the fixed monitoring location.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Fin whales.</title><p>The dominant interannual pattern of fin whale song detection was a steep rise, from 38% to 70% of days, during the first three years. Subsequently, the level of detection varied by less than 10% around the level reached in year 3. This dominant acoustic signal during the first three years is consistent with the dominant environmental variation of the study period, emergence from a marine heatwave (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). Emergence from the heatwave was accompanied by recovery of krill populations from strongly negative anomalies to strongly positive anomalies (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7c</xref>). Increased regional abundances of krill, a primary prey resource of fin whales [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], could have influenced acoustic detection through any of the factors listed at the start of the Discussion section, however none of these factors can be examined from available data resources.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Trophic niches and evolutionary considerations</title><p>Comparison of blue and humpback whale trophic niche characteristics across a major food web transition indicate unique adaptations of these predators to interannual variations, as well as consideration of evolutionary pressures shaping their behavioral ecology. In year 3 humpback whales had a broader trophic niche that partially overlapped with krill-specialist blue whales (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9a</xref>). The humpback whales observed to be foraging on krill in year 3 were sampled in close proximity to blue whales that aggregated in exceptionally dense groups at a krill foraging hotspot [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In year 5 humpback whales had a narrow trophic niche that did not overlap with blue whales, despite the fact that the blue whale isotopic niche area expanded between these years (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9a</xref>). These changes in trophic niche overlap emphasize the advantage of prey switching [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which allows humpback whales to more readily adapt to changes in the abundance and composition of forage species. Responding only to changes in the abundance and distribution of krill, blue whales can adapt to major interannual changes only through prey search effort, not prey switching. In this regard the potential for blue whales to increase efficiency through social foraging, using acoustic communication in collective regional prey searching [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], may represent an essential strategy and an evolutionary adaptation accompanying prey specialization. The efficacy of long-distance acoustic communication interpreted for blue whale social foraging may also represent an evolutionary opportunity for humpback whales, if they can recognize heightened foraging call activity of blue whales and respond to take advantage of ephemeral krill hotspots identified and acoustically signaled by a sympatric mysticete species. Because humpback whales produce sounds in the frequency range of blue whale foraging calls, it is probable that they could hear such heightened call activity from blue whales.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Energetic variations in ecosystem state</title><p>Interannual variations in forage stocks strongly depend on large-scale, highly energetic ocean climatic fluctuations [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Very large interannual variations in forage species occurred during our study period (<xref rid="pone.0318624.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7c</xref>). Longer records from the central CCE, spanning 23 years, show that krill reached their lowest abundances during year 4 of our study while anchovy rose to their highest abundances during years 4&#x02013;6 [<xref rid="pone.0318624.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Such large variations in forage species abundance and composition would naturally affect the behavioral ecology of whales within this essential foraging habitat of the northeastern Pacific. Yet understanding the complex behavioral ecology of such far-ranging predators is difficult, and the powerful propagation of sound produced by highly soniferous species confers a distinct advantage to the use of passive acoustic monitoring. We considered multiple hypotheses to explain the large interannual variations in acoustic detection by integrating diverse methods of sensing whales and their ecosystem. This data intensive effort identifies the consequences of foraging ecology as a significant and persistent driver of interannual variations in the acoustic detection of these whale species. Recognition of this complex relationship, in turn, has important implications for how we interpret passive acoustic monitoring data for scientific and management purposes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Passive acoustic monitoring through the MARS cabled observatory was made possible by Craig Dawe, David French, Paul McGill, Knute Brekke, Bryan Touryan-Schaefer and the crew of the R/V Rachel Carson.
