However, the role of non-primary caregivers such as grandparents, aunts, and older siblings has not been adequately addressed in programming. Using ChildFund International&#x02019;s programmatic data from Kenya and Uganda, this cross-sectional study examined the extent to which children aged 0&#x02013;5 years were left in the care of non-primary caregivers in the household and whether the primary caregivers&#x02019; absence was associated with engagement by non-primary caregivers. We found that a considerable proportion of children aged 0&#x02013;5 years in Kenya and Uganda were entrusted in the care of non-primary caregivers for at least 3 days or more during the week. Yet, the primary caregivers&#x02019; absence was not consistently associated with greater engagement by fathers and other members of the household. Our findings call for parenting programs to consider adopting a holistic and contextualized approach where all involved caregivers are intentionally targeted rather than focusing just on the identified primary caregiver alone.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and <xref rid="sec018" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and <xref rid="sec018" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals issued a call for greater emphasis on responsive caregiving, early learning and early child development [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Target 4.2 states that by 2030 the goal is to &#x0201c;ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x0201d; It is well known that early child development is associated with a host of learning and behavioral outcomes in school and consequently, income earning potential as adults [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Early child development is therefore a very important factor that can change the trajectory of the child&#x02019;s life course and subsequently, even outcomes of their children [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].There is already a significant evidence base that improved quality of maternal interaction with children increases the likelihood of their meeting critical developmental milestones [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many programs have thus focused on improving the mother-child relationship and mother&#x02019;s knowledge and practices of responsive caregiving related to feeding and stimulation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (4&#x02013;39). A 2021 meta-analysis study of parenting interventions with a randomized controlled design found that participation in the interventions resulted in less behavioral problems and better attachment as well as improved cognitive, language, motor, and socioemotional development for children [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For parents, their parenting knowledge, practices, and interactions with children significantly improved [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Importantly, the pooled effects were stronger for LMICs and most of the interventions implemented in LMICs primarily targeted the maternal primary caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>There has also been increasing discourse and recognition on the role of paternal stimulation and responsive caregiving in early child development [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A study examining paternal stimulation in 38 countries found that children of highly engaged fathers had small but statistically significant increases in developmental scores compared to children of fathers with moderate or low stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Such associations were found to be even more pronounced when the engagement of mothers was low. These findings highlight the importance of including male caregivers in relevant programs and imply that paternal stimulation may be protective in circumstances where mothers are not able to attend to their children [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>As evidenced by prior studies, focusing programmatic efforts on maternal and paternal engagement with children is well justified. Yet, parents are not always available in the home to care for their children [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Even if they are present, they may not always engage in responsive early stimulation with their children, or the quality of their engagement may not be at desired levels [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. During the parents&#x02019; absence, young children are left in the care of another adult (e.g., grandmothers, aunts, or other adult females) or older siblings [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and sometimes even placed under inadequate supervision (i.e., left alone or with another child under 10 years old) in the household [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>In addition, kinship care and child fostering have traditionally been common in Africa, even for children with living biological caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A recent narrative review of these care practices in the literature as well as case studies from Africa found that the proportion of mothers sending at least one child under 16 years of age to kinship care or fostering ranged from 16.4% in Kenya to 45.72% in Namibia [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Reasons for these arrangements were not only motivated by the loss of biological caregivers or crisis situations, but they were also related to seeking educational and work opportunities, providing labor, strengthening family and community ties, and longstanding cultural beliefs regarding the general benefits of kinship care and child fostering [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. While there could be benefits to this type of arrangement, there was also evidence that the fostered child living in a household with the caregivers&#x02019; biological children potentially faced differential treatment and disadvantages for opportunities [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Furthermore, little is known about the length of kinship care and fostering and the extent to which children shift in and out of these arrangements [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], especially when those offering kinship care live in proximity.</p><p>Given the frequent occurrence of kinship care, fostering, and non-primary caregivers in the same household sharing the responsibility of caregiving, focusing primarily on biological and/or step mothers and fathers in interventions may overlook the critical needs of young children in various living arrangements and circumstances. Yet, there has been very little interest in examining the contribution of other family members and relatives in early stimulation. Only a handful of studies have considered or discussed their level of engagement in early stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and very few parenting programs in LMICs have intentionally included non-primary caregivers and considered the magnitude of their roles in children&#x02019;s developmental outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>While recognizing the complexity and the fluidity of caregiving arrangements for children in Africa, the current study aims to generate useful insights about the practice of caregiving in and across households where primary and non-primary caregivers both may share the role of caregiving. Findings are also expected to raise awareness of the need for programmatically including all potential caregivers of the child rather than limiting the programs&#x02019; target to just the ones identified as primary caregivers. For the context of Kenya and Uganda, we will specifically examine: [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] the extent to which children aged 0&#x02013;5 years are left in the care of another adult in the household; and [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] whether the primary caregivers&#x02019; absence is associated with engagement by the mother, father, and other household members.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and sample</title><p>The study conducted cross-sectional analysis with the baseline programmatic data collected for ChildFund International&#x02019;s (ChildFund) Responsive and Protective Parenting (RPP) Program Model in Kenya and Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The main objective of the RPP Program Model was to &#x0201c;ensure that from pregnancy through age 5, children enjoy improved development and early learning outcomes and are protected at home and in their communities&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The RPP Program Model was implemented over a period of 18 months and included community-led information sessions, capacity building workshops, and monthly group and home parenting sessions [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In Kenya, baseline programmatic data for RPP were collected in January and February of 2021 in the areas of Homa Bay, Kitui, Laikipia, Machakos, and Nyeri. In Uganda, baseline programmatic data were collected in May of 2022 in the areas of Masindi, Gulu, and Soroti. Across these settings, data contained responses from eligible primary caregivers who were willing to participate in the RPP Program. These initially included both female and male, and biological and non-biological parents, grandparents and relatives who spend the most time with the child under 5 years old and provide for most of their needs. In Kenya, the total sample was 1,526 respondents and in Uganda, the total sample was 838 respondents. However, the final analysis samples for this study in Kenya and Uganda only included the biological, maternal primary caregivers with a child 0&#x02013;5 years old. This is because the majority of the caregiver survey respondents were biological, maternal primary caregivers. A total of 1281 women and 546 women in Kenya and Uganda were thus included in the final analysis samples respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study setting</title><p>According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, the average household size was 3.7 members, with a third of the households being led by women [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

These early stimulation activities are also listed in the UNICEF MICS surveys [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and include reading books or looking at picture books with the child, telling stories to the child, singing songs to or with the child (including lullabies), taking the child outside the home, playing with the child and naming, counting or drawing things for or with the child. Based on these 6 early stimulation activities, UNICEF assesses whether four or more activities have been performed with children as an indicator of children receiving satisfactory dosage of early stimulation. The main outcomes of the current study were therefore engagement in 4 or more early stimulation activities by the mother in the past 3 days, engagement in 4 or more early stimulation activities by the father in the past 3 days (according to the mother&#x02019;s report) and engagement in 4 or more early stimulation activities by other members of the household (15 years or older) in the past 3 days (according to the mother&#x02019;s report).</p><p>The main predictor was the number of days the child was left with another adult or family member in the past week (none, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days or more).

Total number of females over 5 years old in the household was included to proxy available support for caregiving and household chores by other female adults or siblings in the household. Polygamous unions are also not uncommon in both Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Total number of children under 5 years old in the household was included as greater numbers of children in the household could theoretically indicate less caregiver attention and resources spent on the child. Sex of the child was included to control for any potential gender-based differences in caregivers&#x02019; early stimulation. There is prior evidence in Kenya that mothers engaged in greater early stimulation with female children compared to male children [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>Experience of financial strain and caregivers&#x02019; stress over family responsibilities (never/rarely, sometimes, or always/quite frequently) were included because they could proxy caregivers&#x02019; availability and other household members&#x02019; need to care for the children. Financial strain could be driving women to participate in the labor force. In 2018, labor force participation rate of women in Sub-Saharan Africa was as high as 76% [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. A large portion of these women engaged in unremunerated agricultural work on family farms [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. There is also a growing trend for women to engage in income-generating activities outside of the family farm and domestic care work as well [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In addition, a UN Women&#x02019;s survey report from Rwanda found that women in rural areas spent less than 1.5 hours a day caring for and teaching their children while fathers&#x02019; participation in caregiving and teaching children was about 42 minutes a day [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The total number of hours spent in unpaid domestic care work (i.e., household chores) by women amounted to about 7 hours a day [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Hence, the greater the financial strain and stress over family responsibilities, the more likely it may be that caregiving responsibility is shared amongst the members of the household.</p><p>Caregiver&#x02019;s education was included because it may affect employment and subsequently, availability during the week to care for the child. It was coded as none/primary education or secondary or higher education. Marital status was included because living together with a partner could affect the engagement of fathers and others in the household. Marital status was coded as not married, divorced, separated, widowed or married or living with a partner. Receipt of information on child development and caregiver wellbeing was included because greater knowledge on the importance of early stimulation may affect the degree of their engagement. Ownership of children&#x02019;s books and various types of toys were included because they are tools that enable mothers and other members of the household to stimulate and play with the child. Prior evidence in Kenya also found that presence of children&#x02019;s books and toys were significantly associated with maternal early stimulation practices [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The effects of the covariates however are not presented as the focus of the study is to examine the effects of the main predictor.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Analysis</title><p>Descriptive and multivariable analyses were performed with Stata SE 18.5 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). The number of cases, means and frequencies were reported in descriptive <xref rid="pone.0323830.t001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0323830.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. For multivariable analyses, logistic regression was used to estimate the effects for binary outcomes with the aforementioned main predictor and covariates included in the models. For the outcome of paternal early stimulation, marital status was excluded from the model because of collinearity. Instead of reporting odds ratios, we calculated average marginal effects where each category of the main predictor is compared to the referent category for a percentage point difference in the probability of the outcome. Compared to odds ratios, average marginal effects have a more intuitive interpretation and are less sensitive to model specification changes [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Standard errors accounted for clustering at the community level and missing data techniques were not used as only about 3% of the analysis-samples were missing for both Kenya and Uganda. The reasons for missing data are unknown.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323830.t001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323830.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title> Descriptive background information: Kenya and Uganda.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323830.t001" id="pone.0323830.t001g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Kenya</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Uganda</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">

We specifically found that about a third of the children were left with another adult or family member for at least 3 days in the past week. Although the exact reasons for this in the study sample are unknown, we can speculate that they may have to do with employment or household chores as 60% of women reported financial strain and about two-thirds of women reported having stress over family responsibilities sometimes, quite frequently, or always.</p><p>The labor force participation rate of women in Sub-Saharan Africa was as high as 76% in 2018 [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. A large portion of these women engage in unremunerated agricultural work on family farms and perform domestic care work [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. A UN Women&#x02019;s survey report from Rwanda also found that women in rural areas spent less than 1.5 hours a day caring for and teaching their children while fathers&#x02019; participation in caregiving and teaching children was about 42 minutes a day [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The total number of hours spent in unpaid domestic care work (i.e., household chores) by women amounted to about 7 hours a day [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a growing trend for women to engage in income-generating activities outside of the family farm and domestic care work as well [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This means there may be little time available for maternal caregivers to interact with their children during the day and other family members and relatives may be asked to step in to fill the gap [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Our findings have significant programmatic implications as maternal caregivers have often been prioritized and targeted for participation in ECD parenting programs [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While mothers are usually identified or may self-identify as the primary caregivers, the contribution of other family members such as fathers, grandparents, aunts, and older siblings cannot be overlooked in programming. This is especially true since time spent together with other family members did not always translate to an increase of their engagement in early stimulation. In fact, longer maternal absence in Uganda was significantly associated with greater paternal stimulation but not associated with stimulation by other family members. In contrast, longer maternal absence in Kenya was significantly associated with greater stimulation by other family members but not associated with paternal stimulation. We speculate that such differences may be potentially attributable to community social norms and household dynamics, especially considering the average household size, number of children, and presence of co-wives but more qualitative and participatory research is needed to elucidate the reasons for this finding. In any case, not enough children received the recommended dosage of 4 or more early stimulation activities at the household level which suggests a need for greater engagement overall.</p><p>Past qualitative studies in Burkina Faso and Malawi further corroborate our evidence and found that different members of the household took on the role of caregiver depending on the child&#x02019;s age and stage of development [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Participants of the focus group sessions agreed that after infancy, the grandmother,&#x000a0;co-wife, older sibling, or the father will spend more time with the child away from the mother [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, activities with children were mostly instructive in nature rather than being responsive and stimulating [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Hence, our study findings as well as prior supporting evidence suggest that ECD interventions need to consider designing program content that is relevant for caregiving environments where multiple caregivers are involved. Incorporating programmatic elements specifically enhancing the quality of collective engagement by involved caregivers is therefore key and can potentially bring long-term benefits at different stages of children&#x02019;s development. A low-cost yet pragmatic strategy to complement existing ECD program models may be to restructure at least some of the group sessions or home visits to include a brief didactic session with other family members (including fathers) on responsive and stimulating interactions. Community mobilization activities, digital delivery of ECD content and using mass media may also be feasible options [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For example, the Thrive by Five program is an app-based intervention which educates parents and caregivers on the &#x0201c;why&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;how&#x0201d; of responsive caregiving based on a collectivist approach where the involvement of multiple caregivers is both acknowledged and encouraged [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Ownership of children&#x02019;s books and toys at home also provides an important foundation for early stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most surveyed households in Kenya and Uganda had some type of toys or play objects at home but ownership of children&#x02019;s books was low on average. In low-resource settings, the most practical option has been to instruct caregivers on how to make basic age-appropriate toys using low-cost, locally available materials [<xref rid="pone.0323830.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. On the contrary, continually supplying high quality, age-appropriate, and culturally relevant children&#x02019;s books in the local language may pose a greater challenge as programs tend to be short in duration and only target a specified age group whereby older cohorts age out and are replaced by newer and younger cohorts. Coupled with a programmatic solution, further investments in social advocacy and policy change may be necessary for a more sustainable solution.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Limitations</title><p>A major limitation of this study is that it lacks contextual detail about unique circumstances in which the primary caregivers have to leave their children in the care of other adults for extended periods of time during the week. There is also a lack of understanding about how non-primary caregivers in the household perceive their roles and contributions in early stimulation and development. Such information would ideally be ascertained through in-depth qualitative interviews or focus groups. In addition, the current study only analyzed the responses of the biological, maternal primary caregivers and did not have a large enough sample size to conduct the same analyses when the primary caregiver was non-biological or was the child&#x02019;s father or the grandmother. In cases where the primary caregiver is not the mother, the contribution of other family members may also take on a different meaning and significance, especially in the context of prevailing cultural and social norms. qualitative studies would be needed for understanding the fuller underlying context in such cases.</p><p>Nonetheless, our findings lend support to an old proverb that &#x0201c;it takes a village to raise a child.&#x0201d; Hence, we encourage program practitioners, policymakers, and development partners to consider adopting a holistic and contextualized strategy where all involved caregivers (including extended family members) are intentionally included in programs rather than just the identified primary caregivers and their partners alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Nearly a third of the children aged 0&#x02013;5 years in Kenya and Uganda were entrusted in the care of non-primary caregivers for at least 3 days or more during the week. Yet, the primary caregivers&#x02019; absence was not consistently associated with greater engagement in early stimulation by fathers and other family members.
