However, achieving significant success in clinical applications has remained elusive. A primary challenge has been the inability of these molecules to traverse the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB). Recognizing this hurdle, our study aimed to utilize niosomes as delivery vehicles, leveraging the &#x0201c;molecular Trojan horse&#x0201d; technology, to enhance the transport of molecules across the BBB. <bold>Methods:</bold> Previously synthesized memantine derivatives (<bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold>) were encapsulated into niosomes for improved BBB permeability, hypothesizing that this approach could minimize peripheral drug toxicity while ensuring targeted brain delivery. Using the human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line differentiated into neuron-like structures with retinoic acid and then exposed to amyloid beta 1&#x02013;42 peptide, we established an in vitro Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) model. In this model, the potential usability of <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> was assessed through viability tests (MTT) and toxicological response analysis. The niosomes&#x02019; particle size and morphological structures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with their loading and release capacities determined via UV spectroscopy. Crucially, the ability of the niosomes to cross the BBB and their potential anti-Alzheimer efficacy were analyzed in an in vitro transwell system with endothelial cells. <bold>Results:</bold> The niosomal formulations demonstrated effective drug encapsulation (encapsulation efficiency: 85.3% &#x000b1; 2.7%), controlled release (72 h release: 38.5% &#x000b1; 1.2%), and stable morphology (PDI: 0.22 &#x000b1; 0.03, zeta potential: &#x02212;31.4 &#x000b1; 1.5 mV). Among the derivatives, MP1, <bold>MP2</bold>, and <bold>MP4</bold> exhibited significant neuroprotective effects, enhancing cell viability by approximately 40% (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the presence of A&#x003b2;1-42 at a concentration of 47 &#x000b5;g/mL. The niosomal delivery system improved BBB permeability by 2.5-fold compared to free drug derivatives, as confirmed using an in vitro bEnd.3 cell model. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Memantine-loaded niosomes provide a promising platform for overcoming BBB limitations and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease treatments.

Introduction</title><p>The last few decades represent a pivotal period in understanding the potential of biological molecules used in the treatment of neurological diseases and examining their interaction with the BBB. Especially concerning Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), this intricate barrier impedes therapeutic agents from reaching brain tissue, posing a significant challenge in AD treatment [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, researchers have begun to adopt the &#x0201c;molecular Trojan horse&#x0201d; approach, devising strategies to facilitate drugs in crossing the BBB. This method could enable potential treatments to more effectively reach targets within the brain, paving the way for newer and more efficient therapeutic strategies in AD treatment. However, further research is essential for these strategies to achieve clinical success [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The &#x0201c;Molecular Trojan Horse&#x0201d; technology stands out as a noteworthy strategy in drug delivery system research. This technology facilitates the more efficient delivery of specifically targeted treatments. When addressing neurological diseases, it offers a particularly promising solution for overcoming the challenges of brain-barrier penetration. The brain-barrier represents a system that only permits a limited number of molecules to enter the brain, complicating drug delivery. The &#x0201c;Molecular Trojan Horse&#x0201d; technology employs nanoparticles or other carrier systems that can traverse this barrier and release therapeutic agents once inside the brain. Consequently, more effective therapeutic strategies can be developed for treating neurological diseases, particularly Parkinson&#x02019;s and Alzheimer&#x02019;s. Such treatments have the potential to decelerate the progression of the disease and possibly enhance quality of life [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In treating AD, memantine serves as an antagonist to NMDA receptors. These receptors are instrumental in mitigating overstimulation and neurotoxic effects through the brain&#x02019;s glutamatergic signaling. Memantine holds a crucial place in the therapeutic strategies employed, particularly in the advanced stages of AD. Recent studies on memantine derivatives aim to enhance this drug&#x02019;s efficacy. In fact, Cacciatore et al. (2017) propounded superior chemico-physical properties with good stability in both simulated gastric and intestinal fluids by using novel memantine derivatives <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> and introduced them as being appropriate for advanced in vivo pharmacokinetic studies [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These derivatives could potentially offer more targeted binding capabilities, enabling a more precise approach to addressing the specific neurological damage caused by the condition. Furthermore, evidence suggests that certain derivatives may lower oxidative stress and amplify neuroprotective benefits, presenting additional advantages that surpass the inherent positive effects by memantine [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Herein, a previous study it was revealed that novel memantine derivatives involving MEM1&#x02013;6 exerted prominent neuroprotection against oxidative damage due to their antioxidant portion residues, such as N-acetyl-Cys-OH and N-acetyl-Cys(Allyl)-OH [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, attention has been drawn to the potential of these derivatives to mitigate the toxicity of amyloid-beta oligomers, molecules that are significantly involved in the process of neurodegeneration. It is believed that these derivatives could offer avenues for directly addressing the core pathophysiological mechanisms of AD [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. New studies suggest that memantine derivatives could hold the potential to protect and improve cognitive functions in the brain from the early stages of AD. Moreover, by minimizing the side effects associated with memantine, these derivatives may provide a safer therapeutic alternative for patients. It is anticipated that, in the future, further clinical trials of memantine derivatives will be conducted, potentially leading to a new benchmark in AD treatment. Nonetheless, additional research is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms of these derivatives, and such research is crucial for their future safe and effective application [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The BBB serves as a critical diffusion barrier that blocks the entry of substances from the blood into the brain, a necessary function for maintaining the brain&#x02019;s normal operations and its homeostasis. The BBB is physically formed by tight junctions (TJs), brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and the basal membrane, creating the tightly regulated capillaries within the brain [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the endothelial cells of brain capillaries, there are no openings (fenestrations) that permit the diffusion of small molecules and proteins. Connections between endothelial cells create a seamless barrier, heavily limiting the entry of water-soluble compounds into the brain. Surrounding these endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, and the basal membrane contribute to the formation of the BBB, which restricts the movement of substances. Furthermore, brain capillary endothelial cells contain efflux transporters, adding an additional layer of defense against the entry of substances into the brain. The selectivity of the BBB is largely governed by the inter-endothelial connections, through complexes, like adherens junctions, TJs, and gap junctions, controlling its permeability [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous research has demonstrated the ability of the memantine molecule, which will be utilized in the study, to penetrate the brain. However, the distribution of this molecule in the body results in very low concentrations actually reaching the brain. Increasing the dosage to enhance the brain&#x02019;s absorption leads to unavoidable toxic effects in tissues and organs. By employing niosomal vesicles for transport, it is possible to achieve both targeted and efficient delivery to the brain while minimizing potential damage to tissues and organs.</p><p>Niosomal delivery systems are a key component of nanoparticle-based medication delivery strategies, viewed as an optimistic method for addressing neurological conditions. By utilizing vesicles made from non-ionic surfactants and cholesterol, these systems facilitate the directed delivery of therapeutic agents. Their significance, especially in managing neurodegenerative disorders, stems from their capability to efficiently traverse the BBB and enhance therapeutic levels within precise regions of the brain. In the treatment of neurological diseases, niosomal delivery systems can transport next-generation drugs capable of modulating pathological processes in the brain. These include peptides, antisense oligonucleotides, and RNA-based therapies [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to Patil and colleagues (2015), niosomes are more effective than liposomes in crossing the BBB and delivering a greater amount of medication to brain tissue. These systems are an indispensable tool for optimizing drug delivery strategies in neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and multiple sclerosis [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They can be particularly effective in reducing neuroinflammation and developing neuroprotective strategies. However, further preclinical and clinical research is needed to explore the potential applications of niosomal delivery systems. The full potential of this technology in the treatment of neurological diseases will be better understood with future research [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In light of all this information, the improved neuroprotective activity by novel memantine derivatives (<bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold>)-loaded niosomes can be considered a substantial strategy for therapeutic design and discovery. This new strategy may simultaneously enhance cell viability and neuroprotection and possess better BBB permeability properties.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00267"><title>2.

Characterization Analyses of Niosomes</title><p>The detailed analysis conducted using an electron microscope revealed that the synthesized niosomes exhibit a homogeneous distribution, containing particles with similar and regular structures closely sized to each other. Size analysis indicates that the niosomes have a size distribution ranging approximately from 170 to 300 nm. The SEM images showed that the niosomes have a spherical structure. This suggests that the particle sizes are distributed closely within this range, indicating the physical stability of the product and its suitability for potential biological applications. This size range could also be considered as an indicator that niosomes could be used as carrier systems for specific cell lines.

Among the tested derivatives, <bold>MP1</bold> and <bold>MP2</bold> demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects within their effective concentration ranges, with <bold>MP1</bold> showing optimal activity at 15.6&#x02013;62.5 &#x003bc;g/mL and <bold>MP2</bold> at 31.25&#x02013;125 &#x003bc;g/mL. Conversely, <bold>MP4</bold> exhibited cytotoxic effects at concentrations as low as 31.25 &#x003bc;g/mL, indicating a narrower therapeutic window. Despite these limitations, <bold>MP1</bold> and <bold>MP2</bold> augmented cell viability by approximately 40%, highlighting their potential utility as therapeutic agents for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. Recent studies have revealed that nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems could contribute to significant advancements in the treatment of AD [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In particular, niosomal delivery systems can enhance the neuron-protective capabilities by enabling drugs to reach the brain more effectively [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. From this perspective, the transportation of memantine derivatives through such a system could create new opportunities for protecting neurons and alleviating the symptoms of AD. This study represents an important step in the drug development process and highlights memantine derivatives as potential new therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD. While the current study provides promising insights into the neuroprotective effects of memantine derivatives encapsulated in a niosomal drug delivery system, further research is essential to translate these findings into clinical relevance. Specifically, evaluating the efficacy of <bold>MP1&#x02013;MP4</bold> in in vivo models is critical to understanding their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in a more complex biological environment. In vivo studies can provide valuable information on the compounds&#x02019; ability to cross the BBB, their distribution in target tissues, and their long-term safety and toxicity. Additionally, these models can help elucidate potential side effects, interactions with other biological systems, and mechanisms of action under physiological conditions. Advanced analyses, such as molecular imaging and behavioral assessments in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease models, can further validate the therapeutic potential of <bold>MP1&#x02013;MP4</bold>. These investigations will not only assess their suitability for clinical applications but also help optimize formulation parameters, such as drug release profiles and dosing regimens, to enhance their efficacy and safety in humans. Ultimately, the combination of in vitro and in vivo studies is indispensable for advancing these compounds toward clinical translation [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The size of nanoparticles is an essential parameter when considering the BBB. Crossing the BBB represents a significant obstacle in the treatment of nervous system diseases. This study tested the hypothesis that the niosomal delivery system could enhance the ability of memantine derivatives to cross the BBB. The results have revealed that niosomal delivery systems can transport memantine derivatives across the BBB to reach target cells. Previous studies have indicated that particles measuring below 100 nm are particularly well-suited for the desired size, while particles ranging from 100 to 200 nm are deemed suitable for this target. Zeta potential analysis is a method used to determine the surface charge of particles. In particular, studies have reported that the range of &#x02212;30 to +30 mV indicates stable systems. The enhancement of surface charge exerts a direct influence on stability, thereby affecting the repulsion force exerted by particles on one another. Previous research on BBB permeability also indicates that nanotechnology-based delivery systems can be effective in overcoming such barriers. For example, a previous study has shown that nanoparticles can cross the BBB and potentially be used in treating central nervous system diseases [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similarly, it has been observed that niosomal delivery systems can enhance the BBB permeability of compounds, like memantine derivatives. These findings are consistent with a previous study, which highlighted the potential of niosomal delivery systems in the treatment of nervous system diseases [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since memantine is an agent approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD, enhancing the capacity of its derivatives to cross the BBB could represent a significant advancement in the treatment of the disease [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted the utility of the bEnd.3 cell line in establishing in vitro transwell models of the BBB for evaluating permeability, transport mechanisms, and barrier integrity. In a previous study, this model was optimized by culturing bEnd.3 cells on transwell inserts coated with basement membrane substitutes, like fibronectin and collagen, and then assessing permeability with Lucifer Yellow. Similarly, Aday et al. developed a protocol using gelatin-coated transwells to form tight junctions, enabling nanoparticle permeability studies. Further refined BBB modeling was demonstrated by investigating the effects of extracellular matrix components, such as Matrigel, on barrier functionality. These studies collectively demonstrate the versatility of the bEnd.3 transwell system as a reproducible and adaptable tool for BBB research, providing valuable insights into drug delivery, neurotoxicity, and barrier physiology [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It can thus be concluded that the <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> loaded transport systems prepared in this study are stable within this context. This is evidenced by the regular distribution of repulsive forces exerted by the particles. Consequently, the therapeutic efficacy of the drug on the target can be augmented.</p><p>In this study, we explored the potential of combining niosomal delivery systems with <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> in the treatment of AD. The role of drug delivery systems in the treatment of AD has been emphasized by various studies, and advancements in this area hold a significant place in developing new and effective approaches to the treatment of the disease. In this context, when <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> are combined with niosomal delivery systems, an increased capacity to cross the BBB and a more effective reach to the target cells have been observed. Overcoming the BBB presents a significant challenge in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and the capacity of niosomal delivery systems can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the treatment [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Additionally, it has been determined that memantine <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> derivatives can significantly enhance cell viability, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of these compounds. This is consistent with similar studies in the literature; for instance, it has been reported that memantine derivatives can provide neuroprotective effects in in vitro models [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Another advantage of combining memantine derivatives with niosomal systems is that these systems can provide controlled drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Previous studies on memantine and its derivatives have shown that these compounds could have neuroprotective effects in AD, but crossing the BBB remains an obstacle [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-17-00267" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This study demonstrates that niosomal systems could facilitate the crossing of the BBB by memantine derivatives, thereby making the targeted treatment more effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmaceutics-17-00267"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the promising potential of niosomal delivery systems for the transport and release of memantine derivatives (<bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold>) in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD). Our findings demonstrate that these systems enable high-efficiency loading and controlled release of <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold>, which is critical for optimizing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing side effects. Importantly, niosomal delivery systems have shown the capability to enhance the permeability of <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> across the BBB, a major hurdle in treating central nervous system disorders. This advancement not only facilitates effective drug delivery to target cells but also underscores the neuroprotective effects of memantine derivatives in in vitro AD models, as evidenced by increased cell viability. The integration of nanotechnology into drug delivery, particularly through niosomal systems, represents a significant step forward in overcoming challenges, like BBB permeability and achieving targeted treatment. By combining memantine derivatives with niosomal carriers, this study opens new avenues for improving the treatment of AD, offering enhanced bioavailability, controlled drug release, and better therapeutic efficacy. While these findings are encouraging, further research is essential to validate the efficacy of <bold>MP1&#x02013;4</bold> in in vivo models and assess their potential for clinical applications. Future studies should also explore advanced delivery systems and their scalability for broader therapeutic use. Ultimately, this research contributes to the development of innovative treatment strategies for AD and lays the foundation for future advancements in neurodegenerative disease therapies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
