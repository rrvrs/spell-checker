In Australian general practice vocational training, external clinical teaching visits (ECTVs) are key observation-based WBAs. Traditionally, ECTVs are conducted face-to-face, but the COVID-19 pandemic saw the development and implementation of remote ECTV modalities. It remains unknown if perceived educational utility of remote ECTVs differs from traditional face-to-face ECTVs. This study explored the educational utility of ECTVs, including face-to-face and remote formats.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">General practice trainees (&#x02018;registrars&#x02019;) and external clinical teaching visitors (&#x02018;ECT visitors', who are independent experienced GP observers) each completed a cross-sectional questionnaire following individual ECTVs undertaken in 2020. Outcomes included overall educational utility of the ECTV as perceived by registrars, registrar ratings of likelihood to change their clinical practice as a result of the ECTV, registrar ratings of likelihood to change their approach to learning/training as a result of the ECTV, and overall educational utility of the ECTV as perceived by the ECT visitor. Educational utility ratings (5-point scales) were analysed descriptively. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were employed to examine factors associated with dichotomised educational utility ratings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Response rates were 41% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;801) for registrars and 39% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;742) for ECT visitors. Most registrars (64.1%) rated ECTV overall educational utility as &#x02018;very useful&#x02019;; 58.5% and 47.9% of registrars rated their likelihood to change practice and approach to learning/training, respectively, as &#x02018;very likely&#x02019;. No statistically significant differences in perceived educational utility ratings were identified between face-to-face and remote video/phone ECTVs (multivariable p-value range: .07-.96). Receiving feedback that was focused/specific/easy to translate into action was consistently associated with registrars&#x02019; rating overall educational utility as &#x02018;very useful&#x02019; (odds ratio (OR): 12.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.26 to19.9), rating likelihood to change practice as &#x02018;very likely&#x02019; (OR: 2.5, 95%CI: 1.59 to 3.94), and rating likelihood to change learning/training approach as &#x02018;very likely&#x02019; (OR: 3.19, 95%CI: 1.97 to 5.17).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">ECTVs are perceived by registrars and ECT visitors to be educationally useful across different delivery modalities and formats.

Direct observation-based assessments in the workplace are recognised as a fundamental component of competency-based medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Direct observation WBAs are implemented in general practice/family medicine training programs in Australia, and in other countries that share similarities with Australia, including Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In Australian vocational general practice training, external clinical teaching visits (ECTVs) are used extensively as a direct observation, workplace-based assessment. ECTVs involve an independent, experienced GP (the &#x02018;ECT visitor&#x02019;) observing the GP registrar during a clinical session (approximately three hours in duration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The ECT visitor, who is external to the registrar&#x02019;s practice, provides structured feedback regarding the registrar&#x02019;s observed strengths and weaknesses, intending for this feedback to be translated into the registrar&#x02019;s practice for ongoing competency development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ECTVs provide a vital formative function in Australia&#x02019;s apprenticeship-style vocational GP training model, where registrars practice with substantial autonomy. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Within a theory-based framework for programmatic assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], ECTVs are an example of a WBA that serve to function as both a low-stakes assessment <italic>of</italic> learning and an assessment <italic>for</italic> learning. Specifically, while each ECTV contributes a low stakes data point for monitoring satisfactory competency development across the course of training, each single ECTV also provides a potentially rich opportunity <italic>for</italic> learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Although ECTVs are anecdotally highly regarded, empirical evidence of their educational utility as a formative assessment is limited. Previous research has typically examined specific forms of WBAs that can be conducted within an ECTV, for example, Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], feedback forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and Random Case Analysis (RCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. One qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and unpublished internal evaluations indicate that ECTVs are highly educationally valued. However, to our knowledge there have been no published quantitative studies broadly assessing the perceived educational utility of ECTVs.</p><p id="Par38">Traditionally, ECTVs are conducted face-to-face. Remote ECTV options (such as video-taped consultations) have sometimes been used when distance poses a significant barrier to in-person observation. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, uptake of remote ECTV modalities had been slow. This is despite the resource-intensive nature of face-to-face ECTVs. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major disruption to medical education worldwide. Delivery of educational elements, including assessments, were rapidly adapted to remote formats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Within Australian vocational general practice training, remote ECTV modalities were developed and implemented. The rapid commencement of remote ECTVs was necessity-driven, largely preceding understanding of, and evidence for, their educational utility. It remains unknown if perceived educational utility of remote ECTVs differs from traditional face-to-face ECTVs.</p><p id="Par39">Within traditional ECTVs, the context of the clinical environment (e.g., patient case-mix), the educational content (e.g., specific topics discussed) and the complex dynamics of the assessor-trainee relationship, all have the potential to impact the educational substrate and subsequent utility as an assessment <italic>for</italic> learning. This is true for most, if not all, assessments at the &#x02018;does&#x02019; level of Miller&#x02019;s pyramid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as emphasised by van de Vleuten et al. who note &#x0201c;the real world is non-standardised and haphazard&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is unclear how the interplay of contextual factors may relate to perceived educational utility within both face-to-face and remote ECTV formats. The need to investigate a broad range of variables that could influence the formative benefit of feedback arising from observed consultations in practice has been recognised as an important research endeavour in further informing assessment feedback process models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Despite the partial return of face-to-face ECTVs since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains interest in maintaining remote ECTV formats given their relative resource efficiency compared with face-to-face ECTVs. Obtaining a better understanding of the perceived educational utility of ECTVs, and formats/elements of ECTVs relating to perceived educational utility, is paramount for informing a best-practice approach to ECTV delivery.</p><p id="Par41">This study initially intended to explore the educational utility of traditional face-to-face ECTVs. However, with the rapid pandemic-mandated implementation of remote ECTVs coinciding with the beginning of this study, our original aims were adapted accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

However, there has been a shift to a programmatic assessment framework, which draws on the theoretical concept of assessment <italic>for</italic> learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We used this approach as empirical observations arising from this study have the potential to contribute to understanding of assessment <italic>for</italic> learning through the lens of a general practice, medical education, direct-observation WBA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and setting</title><p id="Par45">This was an observational cross-sectional study.

Briefly, the study included registrars and ECT visitors from three general practice regional training organisations (RTOs) &#x02013; GP Synergy (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory), Northern Territory General Practice Education (NTGPE) and General Practice Training Tasmania (GPTT). At the time of the study, RTOs were region-specific, not-for-profit organisations that co-ordinated in-practice training and delivered out-of-practice educational programs/workshops to registrars and supervisors.

These outcomes were elicited from the questionnaires using 5-point numeric rating scales with end points only labelled (e.g., 1&#x02009;= Not at all useful/likely; 5&#x02009;= Very useful/likely). Due to a strong positive-response ceiling effect, the outcome variables were dichotomised for multivariable analyses, combining ratings of 1 to 4 for comparison with ratings of 5, in other words, to explore the educational utility of ECTVs where the ratings were most useful/likely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Independent variables</title><p id="Par51">A broad range of independent variables were included to maximise the exploratory potential of the study to identify characteristics of ECTVs associated with perceived educational utility, and to adjust for potential confounding in the relationship of ECTV modality and each of the outcome factors. Registrar and ECT visitor questionnaires elicited information about the registrar/ECT visitor, and details about the ECTV undertaken, including ECTV modality, number of patients seen/cases covered, content encountered during the visit, quality of feedback provided during the visit (with highest quality defined as being focused/specific, and easy to translate into action), frequency of feedback provided, consistency of feedback with that of their supervisor, and content discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Of the 21 &#x02018;content discussed&#x02019; items included in the questionnaire, 11 were a priori chosen for use as independent variables in multivariable analyses by two expert GPs with extensive clinical and medical education experience. The chosen topics/content items were consideration of the patient&#x02019;s agenda; organisation and flow of the consultation; developing rapport; specific patient and/or contextual factors relevant to the consultation(s); time management; management planning; appropriate medications; appropriate investigations; patient follow-up; dealing with uncertainty; and physical examination.</p><p id="Par52">To mitigate the potential impact of reduced ability to recall content details from the ECTV, any observations for which the time between the visit occurring and the questionnaire being completed exceeded 10 days were removed before analysis. Although the criterion cut-off was initially set in the protocol at more than two days after the visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], it was extended to 10 days to maximise availability of data for analysis, given challenges posed to data collection within the pandemic context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par53">Continuous variables were described using means and standard deviations for normally distributed data and median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed data. Categorical variables were summarised as proportions.</p><p id="Par54">Although some participants contributed data on multiple occasions, all analyses were cross-sectional. Univariable and multivariable associations of the four outcome factors were tested using logistic regression within the generalised estimating equations (GEE) framework to account for repeated measures within registrars and ECT visitors. An exchangeable working correlation structure was assumed. Covariates with a univariate p-value of &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.20 were considered for inclusion in the multiple regression models.</p><p id="Par55">Separate models were constructed for data elicited from ECT visitors and registrars. ECT visitor demographic variables were included in the registrar models, and registrar demographic variables were included in the ECT visitor models. Due to some missing demographic data (arising when ECT visitor/registrar demographics were not available for the corresponding ECTV occurrence), complete case (CC) and multiple imputation (MI) analyses were undertaken. CC was treated as the primary analysis and MI as the sensitivity analysis, to assess potential bias arising from CC analysis. Multiple imputation was performed for all missing independent variables, assuming data were missing at random. Imputation models included all independent variables and assumed an appropriate distribution for each variable. A total of 10 imputations were performed and estimates were combined using Rubin&#x02019;s rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Significance was declared at the conventional 0.05 level, with the magnitude and precision of effect estimates also used to interpret results.</p><p id="Par57">Analyses were programmed using STATA (versions 15.1 and 16.0) and SAS v9.84.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Post-hoc analysis</title><p id="Par58">Due to a strong effect of one registrar-specific variable (quality of feedback received during the visit), a post-hoc sensitivity analysis was run for each registrar model in which the quality of feedback variable was removed.

Registrars also generally perceived ECTVs as having a high likelihood of influencing changes in their practice and in their approach to learning. Collectively this supports the overall educational utility of ECTVs as a WBA in vocational general practice training.</p><p id="Par71">In multivariable analysis, we found no statistically significant differences in perceived educational utility of remote ECTV modalities when compared with face-to-face visits. This observation was consistent for both registrar- and ECT visitor-reported outcomes. There was some evidence (p =&#x02009;0.07 on multivariable analysis), however, for ECT visitors rating video/phone ECTVs less favourably than face-to-face ECTVs.</p><p id="Par72">Several features of feedback provided during ECTVs were significantly associated with registrar ratings of educational utility. The most striking finding was for the effect size regarding quality of feedback provided, where the odds of registrars rating the educational utility of the visits as &#x02018;very useful&#x02019; were 12.8 times higher if the quality of the feedback provided was also rated as&#x02019;very useful&#x02019;. This was similarly reflected in likelihood of changing practice and approach to training/learning outcomes, albeit with more modest effect sizes (multivariable ORs of 2.5 and 3.2 respectively). More frequent provision of feedback during the visit (i.e., for three or more consultations/cases), and the consistency of the ECT visitor&#x02019;s feedback with that previously given by the registrar&#x02019;s supervisor, were also significantly associated with registrar-rated educational utility outcomes.</p><p id="Par73">ECT visitor perceptions of the educational utility of ECTVs were generally consistent with registrar perceptions. However, there were some differences in ECTV content-related independent variables associated with utility ratings when compared with registrars (for example, the specific topics discussed).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Comparison with previous literature</title><p id="Par74">To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study to examine the perceived educational utility and associations of utility ratings for ECTVs, inclusive of both traditional face-to-face and remote ECTV modalities. A recent Australian qualitative study found that general practice trainees and assessors value the educational opportunities offered by ECTV direct observations and highlighted the importance of feedback conversations between consultations during the visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our findings, about educational utility and associations of feedback provided during ECTVs, triangulate well with the observations of Sturman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] Our results about frequency of feedback also align with the findings of an earlier qualitative study investigating the value of adding RCA to direct observation assessments, which suggested that observation and feedback provision for three or more consultations is required for generating learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our results regarding the educational utility of CNA-ECTVs, which share many similarities to RCAs conducted with direct observation, also support the conclusions of Ingham et al., where RCAs were viewed as having utility for learning within the direct observation session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">While we are not aware of any previous studies that have similarly assessed educational utility of face-to-face and remote formative assessment modalities within the GP training setting, there is some evidence regarding formative assessment conducted using videotaped sessions of registrar consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although our findings are not directly comparable with these earlier studies, which did not involve real-time videoconferencing or teleconferencing, collectively the findings of these studies support a role for remote observation of practice for formative purposes. A recent systematic review of the feasibility and acceptability of remote clinical assessments in a variety of clinical settings, including general practice, similarly indicated overall in-principle support for the potential for remote assessments for summative and formative purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">Within existing medical education formative feedback theory literature, face-to-face discussion of feedback is regarded as one of the fundamental principles of effective feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The apparent lack of difference in perceived educational utility outcomes between face-to-face and remote modalities in our study fails to support this.</p><p id="Par77">Our findings about features of the feedback received (including receiving feedback for three or more consultations/cases, receiving feedback that is specific and actionable, and consistency of the feedback received with that of the supervisor) being positively associated with all three registrar educational utility outcomes, is consistent with the inherent link between feedback and achieving the formative aims of WBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Effective feedback has been widely considered in medical education WBA contexts, and while there are many acknowledged complexities in what constitutes effective feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], our findings empirically support the value of feedback that is interactive, timely and specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">Our multivariable findings are also consistent with education feedback theory, which asserts that it is the nature, content and collaborative discussion of feedback that drives its formative utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Van de Vleuten et al. emphasise, in their theory-based framework for programmatic assessment, that feedback effectiveness is a function of the user (i.e., assessor and learner), rather than the instrument/s utilised. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our study provides empirical evidence to support the applicability of this theory within the direct observation WBA context in general practice training, where quality feedback was perceived as useful regardless of the ECTV modality by which the feedback was delivered.</p><p id="Par79">Our findings also support the robustness of Pelgrim&#x02019;s assessment feedback process schema, which identifies feedback content and &#x02018;delivery&#x02019; as the central element of useful feedback obtainment, while noting a need for more exploration of further external/contextual variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our observation that the features of the feedback received were most strongly related to perceived educational utility outcomes than a diversity of other situational/contextual factors, supports that contextual variables are a less prominent feature than the feedback itself within an effective feedback process model.</p><p id="Par80">A specific novel aspect of our findings, not well-explored in existing literature, is that the non-direct observation formats (CBD-ECTVs and CNA-ECTVs) appear to provide a similarly useful substrate for educationally useful feedback when compared with direct observation ECTV formats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Implications for practice, policy, and future research</title><p id="Par81">Our findings support the assertion that ECTVs have a high level of perceived educational utility, affirming their ongoing inclusion as a fundamental element of formative assessment frameworks within Australian vocational general practice training. Our findings on ECTVs are likely transferable to other medical training programs internationally that use similar formative direct observation within their assessment frameworks. Implementation of ECTV-style assessments may be of interest for other medical education programs as a means of increasing the frequency of direct observation, which is emphasised as critical for optimising competency-based medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We also suggest that in the context of formative WBA, non-direct observation modalities may offer a similarly viable substrate for useful, actionable feedback for learning, which is also likely to be generalisable across different medical education WBA training contexts.</p><p id="Par82">The similarities of perceived educational utility across different ECTV modalities provides initial support for inclusion of remote ECTV modalities within post-pandemic WBA frameworks. Potentially, the number of traditional face-to-face ECTVs could be reduced by substituting in some remote ECTV modalities, without detriment to the overall educational value for the registrar. A &#x02018;hybrid&#x02019; ECTV delivery model, combining a mixture of face-to-face and remote ECTVs across the course of training, may capitalise on the benefits of both assessment modalities, including resource optimisation, convenience, and varied learning opportunities. Furthermore, through inclusion of remote ECTV modalities, it may be possible to offer additional ECTVs without imposing substantive additional resourcing burden across a registrar&#x02019;s course of training.</p><p id="Par83">It must be acknowledged, however, that the different types of &#x02018;remote ECTV&#x02019; that were included in the study ranged from real-time, videoconference, ECT visitor direct observation of patient consultations, through to telephone-based discussion of previous cases selected by the registrar. Although we did not find a difference in overall perceived educational utility of different assessment modalities, the inherent differences between these remote formats and that of traditional face-to-face direct observation ECTVs, suggest potential for differences in &#x02018;educational richness&#x02019; that were not captured in the present study. Further research is required to explore how different context-specific learning experiences may vary by modality. For example, opportunities for observation of performing physical examination has been previously identified as a limitation of remote assessment modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Further investigation of the benefits and limitations of different modalities is required to gain a better understanding the relative merits and limitations of different ECTV modalities.</p><p id="Par84">Given the salient relationship between feedback quality and educational utility of ECTVs, it is essential that ECTV training and implementation (for both registrars and ECT visitors) incorporates evidence-based principles of feedback, including specificity, actionability, timeliness, two-way/collaborative, and underpinned by mutual trust and credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is particularly important for remote modalities, where video- or telephone-based observations may present additional challenges in fostering the personal connection necessary for effective feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par85">The association we identified for consistency of feedback from the ECT visitor with that of the supervisor (where registrars perceived this feedback to be of more utility) is an interesting consideration for ECTVs, where the implicit intent of the visit is to obtain feedback from an independent, experienced, and objective GP assessor. While consistency of feedback across different assessors may enhance its perceived trustworthiness, our findings raise an interesting question about registrars&#x02019; potential uptake of feedback from the ECTV in cases where it is inconsistent with that of their supervisor. This suggests a need for registrars to be supported in developing &#x02018;feedback literacy&#x02019;, defined as &#x02018;appreciating feedback, making judgments, managing affect, and taking action&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], to help maximise learning potential of the ECTV.</p><p id="Par86">Differences in associations of educational utility ratings between our registrar and ECT visitor analyses may reflect ECT visitors and registrars having different priorities for learning within the ECTV, with ECT visitors placing greater emphasis on more holistic aspects of professional practice. These different priorities and perspectives should be considered in the feedback conversations that occur during ECTVs.</p><p id="Par87">Our quantitative study provides foundational insight into the educational utility of different ECTV modalities, emphasising the key role of feedback within these WBAs. Further qualitative research is required to explore the barriers and enablers of effective feedback within ECTVs, and to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between substrates of educational richness, feedback, and practice change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par88">The strengths of this study include a large sample size, and a reasonable response rate for studies of GP clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], particularly notable given pandemic conditions. The study included participants from a variety of practice settings across multiple RTOs (encompassing urban, rural, and remote training settings, and diverse socio-economic profiles) and included GP registrars across different stages of training. Perceptions of both registrars and ECT visitors provided multiple perspectives. Many clinically and educationally relevant independent variables were included as covariates in analyses, enabling comprehensive consideration of factors that may relate to perceived educational utility of ECTVs.</p><p id="Par89">The pandemic-driven shift to remote ECTV delivery concurrent with the study provided the opportunity to assess perceived educational utility of both face-to-face and remote ECTV modalities. However, the potential effects of the pandemic context of data collection on the generalisability of the findings should be acknowledged. It is possible that the pandemic setting may have impacted upon registrars&#x02019; and ECT visitors&#x02019; judgements about how educationally useful the ECTV was, although the potential direction of this bias is unknown.</p><p id="Par90">Other limitations are noteworthy. First, the cross-sectional nature of the analyses precludes inference of causality despite several strong relationships identified. Second, we used registrars&#x02019; self-report for the likelihood of changing their practice and training/learning behaviours. Practical and resourcing constraints precluded objective measurement of actual behaviour change in this study and we were unable to explore the intention-behaviour gap. Despite inherent limitations of using self-reported intention, there is evidence to support intention as a valid proxy measure for behavioural change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Third, there was a large ceiling effect for the utility and likelihood to change outcomes, necessitating grouping ratings of one to four, for comparison with the highest rating of five. This could have impacted our ability to detect variability between the different ECTV modalities.</p><p id="Par91">Fourth, a registrar&#x02019;s previous exposure to a face-to-face ECTV could have had an impact on their ratings of subsequent remote ECTVs. It is possible that some registrars participating in the study had not previously experienced a face-to-face ECTV and therefore had no criteria to contrast remote ECTVs against. Finally, information technology (IT) issues were not specifically addressed in the questionnaire. Such logistical/practical issues have been acknowledged as problematic for remote assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and must be considered and addressed in the future rollout of remote ECTV modalities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par92">Our findings indicate that ECTVs are perceived as highly educationally useful as a direct observation-based formative WBA. Registrars and ECT visitors rated highly face-to-face and remote ECTV modalities for perceived educational utility. The quality and features of feedback appear to be the most important factors in ECTVs as an assessment for learning. The perceived educational utility of remote ECTVs provides support for inclusion of remote ECTVs within WBA frameworks in vocational general practice training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
