The tendency of predatory ants to avoid snake cloacal fluids, and the abundance and structural diversity of potentially insecticidal carboxylic acids identified in scent gland secretions (SGS), prompted speculation that SGS function to deter ants. We examined the deterrent properties of the SGS of the Middle American burrowing python (<italic>Loxocemus bicolor</italic>) in fumigation, repellency, and contact-toxicity behavioral assays against workers of the red imported fire ant (<italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>) and a species of carpenter ant (<italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic>), thus representing the two major ant sub-families, Myrmicinae and Formicinae, respectively. We also examined responses by <italic>S. invicta</italic> to the SGS of representative booid, pythonid, colubrine, elapinine, and crotaline snakes. None of the SGS samples affected the two ant species in fumigation tests. However, in repellency bioassays, ants given a choice between a droplet of water or sugar water versus a diluted droplet of SGS overwhelmingly avoided the latter, typically exhibiting rapid antennation from within a few mm, then retreating. Pure or diluted SGS applied directly to ants induced a high percentage of paralysis and death. Some treated ants exhibited symptoms of contact toxicosis but recovered within a 4-h observational period. Our results and reports of the responses of predatory ants to the Texas blindsnake (<italic>Rena dulcis</italic>) point to the scent glands as an ancient and widespread source of ant deterrents.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ant repellent/toxicant</kwd><kwd>Formicinae</kwd><kwd>Myrmicinae</kwd><kwd>Serpentes</kwd><kwd>Snake defenses</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Embedded in the tail base of all snakes is a pair of holocrine glands known as scent glands. These organs, which are synapomorphic for Serpentes (Bellairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1950</xref>; Whiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1969</xref>), expel typically foul-smelling secretions through two duct openings at the posterolateral margin of the cloaca when snakes are disturbed (e.g., Greene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1987</xref>). Here, we report on scent gland secretions (SGS) as ant deterrents, various species of which prey upon or target snakes defensively in biting or stinging attacks (Savage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1849</xref>; Retenmeyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1963</xref>; Gehlbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1968</xref>; Schneirla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1971</xref>; Webb and Shine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1993</xref>; Sazima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Studies of the defensive properties of SGS focused initially on the Texas blindsnake (<italic>Rena dulcis</italic>, Leptotyphlopidae: Epictinae). This snake, as with other scolecophidians (&#x02018;worm snakes&#x02019;), enters ant and termite nests to feed on larvae and pupae (e.g., Greene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1997</xref>). When attacked by ants, <italic>R. dulcis</italic> coils into a tight ball and writhes, smearing itself with discharged cloacal fluids containing SGS (Gehlbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1968</xref>; Watkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1969</xref>). In laboratory tests, these discharged fluids were shown to repel three species of predatory ants &#x02013; <italic>Labidus coecus</italic>, <italic>Neivamyrmex nigresens</italic>, and <italic>Solenopsis geminata</italic> &#x02013; all of which preferentially resided on a half of a test arena treated with ethanol rather than on the side treated with an ethanol extract of the cloacal fluids of <italic>R. dulcis</italic> (Watkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1969</xref>). The repellency of the cloacal fluids of <italic>R. dulcis</italic> was attributed to carboxylic acids in its SGS (Blum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1971</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">An analysis of the SGS of the Middle American burrowing python (<italic>Loxocemus bicolor</italic>, Loxocemidae), a fossorial denizen of moist to dry forests from Mexico to Costa Rica, revealed an abundance of carboxylic acids and lesser amounts of alcohols and glycerol monoalkyl ethers (Schulze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>). Over 100 C<sub>13</sub> &#x02013; C<sub>24</sub> carboxylic acids, including straight chain and mono-, di-, and trimethyl-branched compounds with up to three double bonds, were identified in the SGS of this snake. The structural diversity of these acids was hypothesized to reflect their activity as deterrents of ants and other leaf-litter arthropods.</p><p id="Par5">We examined the effects of the SGS of <italic>L. bicolor</italic> and those of representative booid, pythonid, colubrine, elapid, and crotaline snakes on the red imported fire ant (<italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>, Formicidae: Myrmicinae) in fumigation, repellency, and contact-toxicity behavioral assays. <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> is indigenous to northern Argentina (Calderra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>) but was introduced into the United States in the 1930&#x02019;s and later, from there, into Australia, Taiwan, and China (Ascunce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>). It is a soil dwelling, opportunistic omnivore, infamous for inflicting painful stings on humans, livestock, and other animals. We also tested the SGS of <italic>L. bicolor</italic> against the carpenter ant, <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> (Formicidae: Formicinae), a chiefly insectivorous ant that ranges from North Carolina to Florida and west to Mississippi.</p><p id="Par6">Phylogenetic studies date the most recent common ancestor of modern ants to the Early Cretaceous period, between 145 and 110 million years ago (Borowiec et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). The two ant species in our study represent the myrmicine and formicine lineages, the former of which is older, having originated ca. 99 million years ago (Ward et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). Snakes also arose in the Early Cretaceous period. Snakes used as SGS donors in our study represent diverse alethinophidian (&#x02018;typical snake&#x02019;) lineages thought to have arisen during the Mid-Cretaceous period (Rage and Werner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Source of ants used in bioassays</title><p id="Par7">Mature, queenright, monogyne colonies of <italic>S. invicta</italic> were collected from the Gainesville, Florida vicinity and maintained at the USDA, Imported Fire Ant and Household Insects facility, Gainesville, Florida. Major workers were used in fumigation and contact-toxicity bioassays; minor and media workers were used in repellency bioassays. Fire ant colonies produce a continuous range of worker sizes with no distinct castes, but they are classified as minor, media, and major based on size (Tschinkel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par8"><italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> workers (300&#x02013;400 individuals) were obtained from the Entomology and Nematology Department of the University of Florida, derived from a <italic>C. floridanus</italic> colony reared from a newly mated queen collected in July 2015. They were maintained in a 32 &#x000d7;&#x02009;22 &#x000d7;&#x02009;8 cm plastic tray, the upper inner walls of which were coated with Fluon&#x000ae; to keep ants from escaping.

The Petri dish lids had a hole in the center that allowed ants to move in and out.</p><p id="Par9">All ants had access to adult crickets and 10% sugar water up to the time of testing for the fumigation and contact-toxicity bioassays. <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> and <italic>C. floridanus</italic> used in repellency tests were deprived of food and water for 16 and 48 h, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Snake secretion collection</title><p id="Par10">SGS were obtained from 19 adult male, female, and unsexed <italic>L. bicolor</italic> (TL (snake length) =&#x02009;76&#x02014;110 cm). All SGS collections entailed restraining snakes while applying manual pressure to the tail base. The expressed secretions were directed into 20-ml glass scintillation vials with foil lined caps (Wheaton, DWK986546, MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO). Some samples of <italic>L. bicolor</italic> were pooled from up to five individuals, with a total of 8.2 g of SGS obtained (mean yield =&#x02009;430 mg/snake). The SGS of all snakes were kept pure.

A hole (diameter =&#x02009;12 mm) was cut in the center of a vial cap, and a hole (diameter =&#x02009;9 mm) was cut in the top of the screw-cap. The screwcap was glued into the hole of the vial cap with its thread facing downward so that the plastic tube to which it attached projected into the vial when the cap was screwed on. A 10 &#x000d7;&#x02009;14-mm-hole was cut in the sidewall of the tube. Both the top and sidewall openings of the tube were covered with a fine plastic mesh to allow volatiles to enter. The utility of our fumigation apparatus was confirmed in preliminary tests with several organic solvents, which immediately immobilized ants. All fumigation, repellency, and contact-toxicity bioassays were conducted at 21- 23 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Solenopsis invicta</title><p id="Par14">Samples of SGS used in our bioassays were first used in fumigation tests.

Ants were deemed dead if they were motionless and failed to respond to gentle prodding, or if they were moribund at the 4&#x000a0;h evaluation.

Experiments or anecdotal reports indicate that ophiophagous and other heterospecific snakes avoided zones of test arenas treated with discharged cloacal fluids (Watkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1969</xref>), and that American alligators (<italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic>) (Weldon and McNease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1991</xref>) and carnivores (Price and LaPointe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1981</xref>; Wright and Weldon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1990</xref>) refused, reluctantly consumed, or disgorged SGS-treated food. As Weldon and Fagre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1989</xref>) pointed out, however, carnivorans evolved after the origin of snakes, hence scent glands as a source of defensive chemicals likely arose in response to earlier predators.</p><p id="Par33">We examined the effects of SGS from a taxonomically diverse assemblage of snakes on two species of distantly related ants in fumigant, repellent, and contact-toxicity behavioral assays. These bioassays generally are used to assess insects&#x02019; responses to incapacitating vapors, feeding deterrents, and contact insecticides. A comparable battery of behavioral assays was used in a study of responses by ants, including <italic>S. xyloni</italic>, to the defensive secretions of heteropteran insects (Eliyahu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">Our fumigation assay failed to indicate that SGS vapors induce observable negative effects &#x0201c;e.g., physical impairment or death&#x0201d; in worker ants, despite the ample exposure they received to SGS volatiles. Ants in some experiments were exposed to freshly collected (within 2&#x000a0;h) SGS to maximize exposure to volatiles, but they nonetheless were unaffected.</p><p id="Par35">The repellency of SGS extracts, on the other hand, was indicated in each of our feeding tests: ants congregated around or sequentially visited water or sugar-laden droplets overwhelmingly more than droplets containing SGS. Both ant species in our study often approached and closely antennated SGS-laden droplets, but generally retreated without contacting them. This observation suggests that ants detected and avoided volatile compounds emanating from the diluted SCS. These results and those of the fumigation experiments suggest that the detected compounds have low volatility and are in accord with Gehlbach et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1968</xref>) observation that ants avoided the side of a test arena treated with an extract of the cloacal fluids of <italic>R. dulcis</italic>.</p><p id="Par36">Our results also indicate that SGS act as contact toxicants against ants, an activity observed indirectly in repellent bioassays and directly in contact-toxicity bioassays. In the repellent bioassays, ants became immobile and died if they breached the SGS-treated droplets. Bioassays that directly applied SGS from four snake species onto worker ants led to 49, 40, 45, and 65% mortality respectively (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In a different system of reptilian chemical defense, lice exposed to the aldehyde-laden (fumigant) odor of the crested auklet (<italic>Aethia cristatella</italic>) also exhibited paralysis, with some individuals recovering (Douglas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">Aside from the Gehlbach et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1968</xref>) report on the responses by captive <italic>R. dulcis</italic> to several species of predatory ants from Texas, detailed accounts of snake-ant encounters are scarce; hence, evidence implicating scent-gland discharge as a defense against ants is limited. Webb and Shine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1993</xref>) staged encounters between the Australian blindsnake, <italic>Ramphotyphlops nigrescens</italic>, and bulldog ants (<italic>Myrmecia</italic>) and observed that small to medium-sized blindsnakes discharged cloacal fluids only after being stung by large worker ants. These investigators failed, however, to observe that these fluids affected the ants. Whether the ants in Webb and Shine&#x02019;s study contacted the snakes&#x02019; cloacal fluids, as appears to be necessary for SGS-induced toxicosis, is unclear.</p><p id="Par38">Blum et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1971</xref>) posited that the repellence of ants by the cloacal fluids of <italic>R. dulcis</italic> is due to a series of C<sub>12</sub> &#x02013; C<sub>20</sub> carboxylic acids that are dissolved in a glycoprotein matrix of this snake&#x02019;s SGS. They pointed out that carboxylic acids generally are insecticidal and thus may deter ants. The contact toxicity of carboxylic acids has been demonstrated against a broad spectrum of insects, including hard-bodied taxa, e.g., coleopterans (Seigler and Popenoe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1925</xref>, Sims et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>, D&#x000e9;mare et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>, Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>, Krzy&#x0017c;owski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">Aside from the abundance of carboxylic acids in <italic>R. dulcis</italic> and <italic>L. bicolor</italic>, they are the sole or predominant lipoidal components in the SGS of booid (Tolson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1987</xref>; Simpson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1993</xref>), pythonid (Wood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1995</xref>), colubrid (Oldak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1976</xref>; Wood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1995</xref>), elapid (Weldon et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1991</xref>), and viperid snakes (Razakov and Sadykov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1986</xref>; Weldon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1992</xref>; Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1999</xref>). The insecticidal activities of carboxylic acids, and their ubiquity and abundance in SGS, are consistent with their contribution to snakes&#x02019; chemical defense against ants. Moreover, short-chain (C<sub>2</sub> &#x02013; C<sub>5</sub>) carboxylic acids, which occur widely in the SGS of alethinophidians (Wood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1995</xref>; Weldon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2022</xref>), are prime candidates to exert repellence. Bioassay-guided isolation of active components is needed to identify SGS components that act as ant deterrents.</p><p id="Par40">Scent glands are synapomorphic in the Serpentes, thus they can be traced back to the earliest snake. The habitus of the first snakes, however, is controversial (Gower et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>). Some molecular analyses indicate that modern scolecophidians represent an ancient phenotype inherited from the last common ancestor of snakes (Miralles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). The inferred subterranean lifestyle of early snakes and the similarities of their skull morphology to that of some extant blindsnakes are consistent with their subsistence on a diet of brood from ant and termite nests. SGS may have permitted snakes to enter these nests. Whether or not this accurately characterizes the role of SGS for early snakes, several modern snakes, including colubrids and pythonids, enter ant and termite nests to feed, oviposit, and shelter (Riley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1985</xref>; Holm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; Baer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>; Pisani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Thompson and Thompson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>).
