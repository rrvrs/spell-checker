Further evidence suggests that color and shape are processed in a segregated and parallel fashion within the VS and converge only at higher levels of visual processing (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Lafer-Sousa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>). Crucially, there is also evidence that parts of the DS utilize color information for action programming (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Claeys et al., 2004</xref>) and contribute to semantic processing (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creem and Proffitt, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Noppeney et al., 2005</xref>). Animal studies show that parts of area V4 show strong connections with dorsal stream areas such as DP, VIP LIP, PIP, or MST. This could be the direct link between VS and DS, providing color information to areas processing action, spatial vision, and spatial attention (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Roe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Baizer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Ungerleider et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In sum, these works supported the view that the motor interaction with recognizable objects and within a naturalistic setting, beyond the involvement of visuomotor processing, also implies the identification and the functional analysis of target objects (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Borchers and Himmelbach, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies put in evidence residual abilities after the damage of the VS. Investigations on patient D.F. (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Ganel and Goodale, 2019</xref>), as well as on patient H.J.A. (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Chainay and Humphreys, 2001</xref>) demonstrated part-based recognition strategies that depended mainly on color and texture features of real-life objects, thus drawing upon their remaining VS function (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2003</xref>). This allowed, for example, D.F. to reach and grasp familiar objects according to their stable affordances (<xref rid="ref7001" ref-type="bibr">Borghi and Riggio, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref7002" ref-type="bibr">Pellicano et al., 2011</xref>) as long as the objects were presented in a typical perspective (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Carey et al., 1996</xref>). Notably, familiarity with real-life objects improves grasping performance in healthy participants (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Borchers and Himmelbach, 2012</xref>). Even artificial learned associations between the size and the coloring or surface patterns of blocks facilitated grasping performance in healthy participants (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Haffenden and Goodale, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The authors concluded that &#x0201c;[I]ncorporating learned information about object size would reduce the computational demands on the visuomotor system and could allow for efficient and accurate movements directed towards everyday objects&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Haffenden and Goodale, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Further evidence has been provided that visual agnosic patients can show remarkable proficiency when handling common objects in their known surroundings (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bartolomeo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Dijkerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Karnath et al., 2009</xref>); however, to our knowledge, still no systematic investigation has been conducted on the origin of such residual proficiency.</p><p>In the present study, we presented a novel case of a patient named AC, with visual agnosia and striking similarities to the previously reported cases of D.F. (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Goodale and Milner, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Milner et al., 1991</xref>) and J.S. (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Karnath et al., 2009</xref>). In the recent comprehensive review of 21 agnosic patients, <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Peel and Chouinard (2023)</xref> look for commonalities and unified features of these patients. The most common features were an occipital lesion (20/21), inability to recognize line drawings (19/21), preserved color vision (14/21), and visual field defects (16/21). All these features can be found in AC, which underlines his deficit as visual form agnosia.</p><p>We conducted one kinematic experiment to test his reach-and-grasp performance on real objects and investigated his deficits, as well as his residual competencies within the framework of the Two Visual Streams model. We aimed to achieve insights into the nature of those competencies that were spared by the lesion and the functional relationship between the two streams.</p><p>Despite significant agnosia for objects, AC could perform everyday activities independently, including cooking, shopping, navigating familiar areas, using public transport, catching a ball, and riding a bike in safe settings (see <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Tragantzopoulou and Giannouli, 2024</xref> for a critical review on the spatial orientation assessments)<xref rid="fn0001" ref-type="fn"><sup>1</sup></xref>. AC displayed a rather preserved color vision, which he mostly relied on while interacting with common-use objects like a pen, a spoon, or a hammer. Indeed, while examining AC, we were intrigued to find him approaching object identification by describing color and texture gradients and focusing on distinctive local details in line with the report on D.F. (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Ganel and Goodale, 2019</xref>). Thus, to examine such impressive residual proficiency of AC, we designed a grasping experiment based on real-life objects for him. We investigated the effects of masking the color of object stimuli versus presenting them in natural colors and compared immediate grasping responses with delayed ones after prior naming. We assumed that such manipulations at the stimulus and response level would, first, contribute to shedding a better light on the kind and the number of deficits, as well as on the residual competencies of AC, and, second, since they lead to differently weighted activity of the two visual streams (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Jax and Buxbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Schenk et al., 2011</xref>) they would further contribute to their understanding.</p><sec id="sec2"><label>1.1</label><title>Hypothesis</title><p>Regarding the instruction variable, on the one hand, the naming of the objects (i.e., <italic>name-first</italic> conditions) would largely elicit the activation of the VS because of semantic access to object identification (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Milner, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, reach-and-grasp actions performed immediately after the stimulus onset (i.e., <italic>grasp-first</italic> condition) would minimize further higher-level processing and largely activate the DS (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Goodale et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Milner et al., 2003</xref>). Consequently, since the lesion in AC mostly affected his VS, we hypothesized a larger performance impairment in the name-first condition relative to the grasp-first condition, which instead relied on basically intact DS. For what concerns the object variable, since the color processing along AC&#x02019;s impaired VS was sufficiently spared (and appeared to be one effective identification cue in everyday life), we hypothesized a detrimental effect of color masking relative to natural color condition, as AC&#x02019;s VS deficit in object processing would emerge. Possible interactions between instruction and object variables would indicate, for example, whether the VS was mainly in charge of color processing or, as suggested by previous evidence, it also relied on some parts of the DS (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Claeys et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec3"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec4"><label>2.1</label><title>Case presentation</title><p>In 2010, AC (pseudonym), a previously healthy university student of 29&#x0202f;years, suffered sudden ventricular fibrillation and subsequent cardiac arrest. He received immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation for a total of about 45&#x0202f;min, followed by intensive care treatment. Initial CT imaging showed no cortical damage or bleeding. Irrespective of severe medical complications (severe inflammatory response syndrome and acute renal failure) within the first week of treatment, AC achieved almost complete physical recovery during the weeks and months that followed. Despite his physical recovery, it became obvious that he still displayed persistent general neuropsychological mild impairment and vision disorders. MR imaging 18&#x0202f;days after the incident showed edematous alterations and blood&#x02013;brain barrier dysfunction in the occipital lobes and the posterior-inferior temporal cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This remained the only MRI of AC&#x02019;s lesion, as he was later implanted with a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to prevent further attacks since medical examinations did not reveal any cause for the initial cardiac arrhythmia. The device was non-MRI-compatible; no further imaging data could be obtained anymore (see the limitations section).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The magnetic resonance image of AC acquired 18&#x0202f;days after the incident, showed edematous alterations and blood&#x02013;brain barrier dysfunction in the occipital lobes and the posterior-inferior temporal cortex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-16-1452979-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>Ophthalmologic examination revealed quadrantanopsia in the left lower quadrant. Moreover, a thorough neuropsychological examination 1.5&#x0202f;years after the incident revealed object agnosia and alexia.</p><p>We performed our investigation 5&#x0202f;years after the first neuropsychological examination. We examined the patient using BORB (Birmingham object recognition battery) and VOSP (Visual object and space perception test) (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Riddoch and Humphreys, (1993)</xref>; <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Warrington and James, 1991</xref>). The completion of both tests was due to the severity of the deficit not possible (the details of the neuropsychological examination are presented in a <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File</xref>). Additionally, results of the Farnsworth Dichotomous Test for Color Blindness (Panel D-15) (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Farnsworth, 1947</xref>) revealed adequate color hue discrimination proficiency (1 mistake).</p><p>In short, an investigation of the patient&#x02019;s letter and digit identification and reading skills revealed that he could identify large single letters quite smoothly, as presented in Arial 48. The smaller letters showed AC many more errors. When reading short words, he had to spell them letter by letter, and in some cases, he tracked each letter with his finger, attempting to identify the outline.</p><p>Identification of digits were error-prone (e.g., digit 9 mistaken for 0). His own handwriting was small and scrawly but decipherable, although he himself failed to read it afterward. Painting out of memory (e.g., matchstick man, house, sun) was adequate, but lines mostly failed to converge in corners or if he took off the pencil in between. This deficit was mostly due to AC&#x02019;s difficulty in finding the end of the line drawn so far and his inability to recognize his own drawings. The drawing of presented objects was much better when he could explore them tacitly before. In a test in which AC was asked to trace one of many overlapping lines, he failed because he changed the line at the first crossing. In the FRACT test, AC could not identify the gap even for large Landolt-Cs.</p><p>When visually presented with real everyday objects (e.g., cup, corkscrew, lemon, and paper clip), AC drew inferences about the object&#x02019;s identity out of perceived salient details. When asked to explain his reasoning, he described clues like surface structure (&#x0201c;This is a lemon. I know it because of the surface structure and the color&#x0201d;) or characteristic details (&#x0201c;It&#x02019;s white, it&#x02019;s a cup. The handle is located at half past one,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;This has got to be a corkscrew, I recognize it by the wooden handle and the spiral at the center,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Matchbox, because the sides look somewhat abraded&#x0201d;). Similar part-based recognition approaches have been reported in other cases of visual agnosia, most notably for D.F., who could describe a screwdriver as &#x02018;long, black, thin&#x02019; and a pair of scissors as &#x02018;long, thin, silver&#x02019; (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Milner et al., 1991</xref>); D.F. was able to make intelligent guesses, but very slowly, based on such features, whereas objects were swiftly identified by touch (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Carey et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Milner et al., 1991</xref>). However, once an object was presented outside its canonical perspective, AC showed more difficulties (e.g., he identified a pair of scissors only after the blades were closed). For objects that lacked either a characteristic design or when some characteristic clues were masked, he showed a significant deficit in form and identity recognition (apple painted with black color: &#x0201c;It is black, seems to be made of gum or leather, a piece of fruit maybe, I would say it is a ball with a stem, it&#x02019;s not symmetric&#x0201d;) and sometimes even failed to describe its geometry correctly (large cylindric glass tube: &#x0201c;I would say it is a vase, it is cone-shaped, pointy towards the bottom, it&#x02019;s open at the top&#x0201d;). In the Odd-One-Out test, where AC was asked to find one different face or object out of five, he could only report the difference when it was marked. Otherwise, he would fail. AC did not demonstrate detectable deficits of spatial orientation. He could navigate easily through the clinic corridors and could go alone to the city and return safely. On a local scale, AC could flowless match the orientation of the right hand to the slot of a rotating disc.</p><p>In summary, neuropsychological tests and subsequent investigations suggested that AC&#x02019;s proficiency in daily interactions with objects was due to knowledge he acquired prior to his disability and his ability to cleverly derive object identity from distinctive visual features. Herein, he particularly relied on color, surface texture, small details, overall size, and positioning in a room (local context) (Details of the neuropsychological assessment are described in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>2.2</label><title>Control participants</title><p>A control group of healthy participants was matched to the AC&#x02019;s age, sex, handedness, and level of education. Participants were recruited in university places; they reported they had no history of neuropsychiatric diseases and no assumption of medications affecting cognitive and motor performance. Thus, 11 male participants (mean age&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;30.1, s.d. =&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;2.0, range&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;27&#x02013;33) with ongoing or completed university education (i.e., students from mathematics or engineering university courses) were tested (see <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Crawford and Garthwaite, 2005</xref> for indications on appropriate group numerosity in single case investigations). They were all right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield, 1971</xref>) (mean score&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;+88.6, s.d.&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;19.86) and had normal or corrected-to-normal eyesight. The experiment was conducted per the <xref rid="ref7003" ref-type="bibr">Declaration of Helsinki (1964)</xref>, and all participants gave their informed consent before testing. The experiment received approval from the ethics committee of UKA (ethics committee approval EK 358&#x02013;15).</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>2.3</label><title>Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure</title><p>Participants were seated at a white table. A resting area for the right hand was marked on the table 30&#x0202f;cm to the right of the midsagittal axis, while the left hand was held comfortably underneath the table. A cross in the midsagittal axis 40&#x0202f;cm from the edge of the table marked the place where the objects were presented. A second area, 10&#x0202f;cm from the edge of the table, marked where to place the object after it was grasped.</p><p>The experimenter stood in front of the participants, and an opaque barrier prevented them from seeing the to-be-grasped object while the experimenter placed it on the marked cross. Each trial started with the removal of the barrier. Participants (the patient and the healthy control group) were required to grasp with their right hand only. Fifty-two common-use objects with recognizable graspability and stereotypical color, texture, and size were presented once in as many experimental trials. The experimental instructions were verbally given by the experimenter at the beginning of the experiment and before each half of the trial. For the first half of the trials, participants were instructed to grasp the objects as soon as they could see them after the removal of the barrier and place them on the marked area in front of them (i.e., <italic>grasp-first</italic> condition); then, they had to name them aloud. For the second half of the trials, participants first named the objects aloud and then grasped and placed them on the marked area (i.e., <italic>name-first</italic> conditions). This blocked order was adopted to maximize the chances of eliciting selective activation of the dorsal and the ventral stream in the grasp-first and the name-first condition, respectively, avoiding, in particular, possible carry-over activation effects of the ventral stream in the grasp-first trials if preceded by name-first ones. In each grasp., first and name-first condition, half the objects (13) were presented in their original colors (i.e., <italic>natural color</italic> condition), whereas objects from the second half were matched for size and shape to the first half and evenly painted in matt black (i.e., <italic>masked color</italic> condition) while preserving texture and characteristic structural details (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Natural and masked color objects were randomly intermixed with each other within each grasp-first and name-first block and were task-irrelevant.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Examples of objects for each of the four experimental conditions (from left to right: orange, apple, tennis ball, tomato).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-16-1452979-g002" position="float"/></fig><p>To observe natural grasping behaviors, participants were not given specific instructions on how to grasp the objects. As a result, we observed pincer grasps for small objects and opposition grasps for larger objects. However, since natural objects can be grasped in variable diameters, instead of examining the absolute maximum grip aperture in mm, we calculated the ratio between the maximum grip aperture and the final grip aperture, that is, when the fingertips touched the object (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Borchers and Himmelbach, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><label>2.4</label><title>Kinematic data acquisition and pre-processing</title><p>Kinematic data were collected using a 3D optical marker-based motion capture system (Vicon Motion systems, Oxford, UK). Fourteen infrared cameras (sampling rate 100&#x0202f;Hz) tracked the motion of small reflective markers (14&#x0202f;mm in diameter) placed on the barrier and the participants&#x02019; right hand. Markers were fixed on the tip (center of each fingernail) of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and ring finger, as well as lateral of the wrist (on the processus styloideus of the os radialis). In addition, we recorded the grasping movements with a video camera (Basler A602fc). Recordings of the grasping movements commenced after a verbal signal by the examiner just before a new trial started and finished when the hand came to rest. For each trial, 3D-Marker positions were reconstructed and labeled (Mthumb, Mindex, Mmiddle, Mring, Mwrist). The VICON System was calibrated each time the measurements were resumed. A stationary and dynamic calibration was performed using a dedicated calibration wand. The spatial resolution of the system was below 1x1x1 mm. Since the kinematic data were acquired by an optoelectronic system that continuously traces the trajectories of the passive markers, interrater variability was not applicable. In order to cope with the noise of the measurement, a low-pass filter was applied to the raw data, with a cutoff frequency of 10&#x0202f;Hz.</p><p>All data analyses were performed offline using custom software based on Matlab 2016b (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). The start of the reaching movement (tstart) was determined when the velocity of the Mwrist exceeded 50&#x0202f;mm/s. The following dependent kinematic parameters of reach-and-grasp action were computed for each trial: movement duration (in ms), Maximum velocity (in m/s), mime of maximum velocity relative to total movement duration (in %), ratio of maximum grip aperture relative to final grip aperture (MGA_ratio; in %), time of maximum grip aperture relative to total movement duration (in %), see also <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>.</p><p>Temporal parameters were determined as relative instead of absolute time values because of the generally decelerated movements performed by the patient relative to the control group.

In synthesis, AC&#x02019;s damage affected the ventral visual stream. His inability to identify common-use objects most likely reflected a processing problem associated with the synthesis of several visual discontinuities in brightness, textures, or colors into complex stimuli (see <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Goodale and Milner, 2013</xref> for a review). His residual abilities allowed him to access the gross shape on the one hand and the small details of objects, but he could not perform any further integration of such separate features into one perceptual representation, which ultimately led to recognition. Since real, tangible objects offer several identity cues like color and surface texture, AC could take advantage of such information to make inferences about the identity of perceived objects. Our experiment demonstrated that AC&#x02019;s preserved color vision and processing were utilized to maximize the accuracy of object identification.</p><p>Specifically, masking the color of objects had a slight influence on the performance of the healthy control group: it slowed grasping actions despite flawless verbal identification. This further supported the evidence that in healthy populations, color information is a sensitive cue for object identification (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Mapelli and Behrmann, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bram&#x000e3;o et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Chouinard and Goodale, 2012</xref>). Healthy participants displayed no difference between immediate, swift grasping (i.e., grasp-first) and prior visual identification of the target objects (i.e., name-first).</p><p>In contrast, patient AC&#x02019;s performance was characterized by significantly larger effects. He failed to identify most of the color-masked objects and demonstrated an even longer movement duration, lowering maximum velocity towards these objects. Regarding hand aperture, AC showed no overall impairment of MGA-ratio compared to the CG. However, when grasping masked objects under time constraints (grasp the first condition, see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), AC displayed a significantly larger MGA ratio than the CG. Conversely, with natural objects that provided ample color information, AC performance with respect to hand aperture ratio was comparable to healthy controls.</p><p>In the following, we discuss these results in relation to the Two Visual Stream hypothesis and other known cases of visual agnosic patients.</p><sec id="sec17"><label>4.1</label><title>Object identification</title><p>The healthy participants were able to identify all objects without errors, irrespective of masking, in both grasp-first and name-first conditions.</p><p>In the experiment, AC was able to identify 100% of the naturally colored objects, but after marked delay. This indicated his impressive remaining object identification skills with regard to everyday objects. It has been previously shown that visually agnosic individuals perform well with everyday objects (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Dijkerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Goodale and Milner, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Karnath et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, evidence has been provided by another visual agnosic patient who better recognized highly familiar objects before the brain damage occurred (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Rennig et al., 2018</xref>). While identifying objects, beyond taking advantage of their informative visual details, AC openly reported considering color information; indeed, he focused on color hues and gradients to identify natural objects. This compensatory strategy resulted in abnormally prolonged naming latencies and is consistent with previous evidence of better recognition, within visual agnosia deficits, for real objects in pictures compared to line drawings (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Mapelli and Behrmann, 1997</xref>). Similar detail-based recognition approaches and delays in naming tasks have also been described in other visual agnosic patients, for example, D.F. (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Humphrey et al., 1994</xref>; see also <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Peel and Chouinard, 2023</xref>). In contrast, AC was able to identify only 15% of color-masked common objects, thus supporting the notion that his object identification skills relied on color information for applying the aforementioned color- and detail-based approach.</p><p>In the cortex, color and form information is hierarchically processed across multiple levels from the retina to visual areas V1 to V4 and higher-level VS regions (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Conway, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Seymour et al., 2009</xref>). Although color and form representations are anatomically co-localized and highly interactive, they remain segregated along the VS (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Lafer-Sousa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Xu, 2022</xref>). In particular, visual area V4 is regarded as a mid-level processing stage along the VS that facilitates color perception, texture perception, and shape processing and is strongly interconnected with many other cortical areas (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Pasupathy et al., 2020</xref>). Beyond V4, the representation of color and shape are more segregated and can be selectively damaged, while the other functions remain preserved (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bouvier and Engel, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Xu, 2022</xref>). At these higher-level cortical areas, the conscious association of color and shape (e.g., when identifying objects by color) can also be selectively damaged (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Siuda-Krzywicka and Bartolomeo, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Stasenko et al., 2014</xref>). The well-preserved color processing of AC, as demonstrated in his good scoring on the Farnsworth Dichotomous Test (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Farnsworth, 1947</xref>), indicates that the areas for association of color and object shape were preserved. More in detail, AC plausibly retained functionality of lower- and mid-level visual areas, including V4, so that he could code color and texture. AC&#x02019;s preserved color vision is in line with previous evidence of other visual agnosia patients, like D.F.: Color vision and the conscious association of color and shape improved her voluntary interaction with objects (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Dijkerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Goodale and Milner, 2013</xref>). Neuroimaging studies demonstrated some remaining VS activation when she was presented with colored images (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2003</xref>). Neuroimaging studies also detected separate areas for the processing of texture, color, and shape and demonstrated compromised activation of D.F&#x02019;s shape discrimination area, while activation in her texture and color discrimination areas was spared (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The consistency of our data with previous clinical evidence suggests that visual agnosic patients skillfully use their remaining color vision in combination with detail-based recognition approaches in everyday activities. This plausibly contributes to their surprisingly proficient handling of common objects.</p></sec><sec id="sec18"><label>4.2</label><title>Kinematic analysis</title><p>Healthy participants were assessed to establish baseline performance in the grasping task. Color masking did not affect the visual identification of objects (100% correct for both masked and natural objects). With respect to kinematic performance, the masking of color had a small effect: movement duration was slightly longer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel, grey line), and Maximum velocity was reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel, gray line) relative to natural color. No main effect of instruction (i.e., grasp-first vs. name-first) was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, right panel). Thus, the baseline task of grasping everyday objects did not represent a problem in individuals with normal visual performance, except for some slight effects of color-masking.</p><p>The Two Visual Stream model posits that the immediate grasping of objects is subserved by the DS, whereas their visual identification is processed in the VS (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Milner and Goodale, 2008</xref>). This model further postulates a gradual processing shift from one stream to the other (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Milner and Goodale, 2006</xref>); namely, an increasing contribution of the VS would depend on the increasing amount of visual identification processing.</p><p>Our results on the healthy control group fit well within this model, suggesting that normal performance with color-masked objects requires additional processing load along the VS because of unavailable color information. This ultimately increased movement duration and reduced maximum velocity relative to natural color objects.</p><p>Interestingly, performance stayed detrimental with masked relative to natural colors irrespective of whether the objects were gasped immediately or grasped after being named. This suggests that the lack of color information also posed challenges to immediate grasp-DS processing (for which color cues within objects should not be essential to perform visuomotor transformations) and is consistent with the view that color information could also be processed along the healthy DS when color is behaviorally relevant (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Claeys et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Toth and Assad, 2002</xref>). Animal studies show that parts of area V4 show strong connections with dorsal stream areas such as DP, VIP LIP, PIP, or MST. This could be the direct link between VS and DS, providing color information to areas processing action, spatial vision, and spatial attention (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Roe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Baizer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Ungerleider et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The CG showed no overall effect for maximum grasp aperture. Familiarity with objects has previously been shown to improve grasp scaling compared to grasping neutral cuboids (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Borchers and Himmelbach, 2012</xref>). Moreover, maintaining characteristics like texture and surface pattern, e.g., roughness, has previously been shown to improve accurate grasp scaling (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Haffenden and Goodale, 2002</xref>). Healthy individuals displayed a significant interaction between color and instruction for MGA-ratio (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, gray lines). It indicated the most accurate hand aperture accommodation when objects&#x02019; color was masked, and reach-and-grasp actions started after their naming (i.e., name-first). This could also be explained by the additional delay that healthy control persons displayed when naming masked objects and by an increased contribution of the VS to the programming of reach-and-grasp actions.</p><p>All in all, we would argue that healthy participants were able to maintain accurate maximum grasp aperture towards highly familiar but color-masked objects by slowing their grasping performance, thereby allowing increased VS processing. Such basic evidence regarding the CG is essential to interpret AC&#x02019;s performance.</p><p>In visual agnosia patients like AC, VS processing is impaired, albeit partially spared (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Goodale and Milner, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2003</xref>). The VS provided AC with proficient visual identification of natural-colored objects but impaired verbal identification of masked objects (only 15%). Compared to healthy individuals, AC displayed much longer movement duration and lower Maximum velocity with masked objects relative to natural objects; this was evident in both grasp-first and name-first conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, black lines). These findings indicate that visual processing in AC&#x02019;s impaired VS was affected by color masking to a larger extent than the CG, irrespective of the amount of semantic processing prior to grasping. Thus, the object identification process (which was challenged in the CG), resulting in corruption in AC due to his lesioned VS. This effect persisted in both VS- and DS-supported grasping conditions. As for the CG, the detrimental effect of color-masking on grasping performance in grasp-first conditions might be explained in the wake of previous evidence that color information would also be processed in the early stages of the DS (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Claeys et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Roe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Baizer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Ungerleider et al., 2008</xref>) and that VS and DS would interact when handling known objects (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Milner, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the CG, such an effect was also evident in AC with natural objects. With natural objects, AC&#x02019;s movement duration was longer (and maximum velocity was lower - even if not significant) in the grasp-first condition relative to the name-first condition. This suggests that time constraints and minimized semantic processing (grasp-first conditions) impaired his performance even with natural-color objects. This is well in line with his VS impairment.</p><p>To complete the picture, the patient&#x02019;s MGA ratio was not different from that of the CG for <italic>natural</italic> objects irrespective of grasp-first and name-first instructions and for <italic>masked</italic> objects in name-first condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, black lines). This is consistent with the view that <italic>natural</italic> objects provided sufficient color and texture information to the patient&#x02019;s VS in the name-first condition to facilitate accurate grasp scaling like in the CG. We would argue that the slowing of AC&#x02019;s performance facilitated comparably skillful grasp scaling with natural objects in grasp-first conditions. Conversely, with <italic>masked</italic> objects in grasp-first conditions, AC showed increased MGA-ratio (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, dotted lines). We suggest that under time constraints and with reduced color information, the patient&#x02019;s damaged VS could not contribute sufficiently to his DS programming, thus leading to a safety grasp (i.e., an increased MGA ratio).</p><p>All in all, these results bear several interesting implications for motor interaction with highly familiar objects. In the visual agnosic patient AC, grasping performance was significantly slower when objects were color-masked. This delay presumably allows the activation and the processing of color and semantic information in the patient&#x02019;s damaged VS. This adaptation allowed rather unimpaired performance regarding his gasp aperture. Interestingly, the slowing effect of color-masking was also observed in the immediate grasping (grasp-first) condition. Immediate grasping is commonly understood to be facilitated by the fast-processing DS (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Milner and Goodale, 2008</xref>). This surprising sensitivity of the DS to color-masking would be in line with previous evidence of color processing in some parts of the DS (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Claeys et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the slowing of movement performance allowed the patient&#x02019;s grasp scaling to remain intact. Indeed, his grasp scaling only differed from healthy participants in immediate grasping (grasp-first) and with color-masked objects. According to the two visual stream models, immediate grasping should be facilitated by the DS. The failure of the patient to achieve proficient grasp scaling underlines the importance of collaboration between the two visual streams for skillful interaction with everyday objects.</p><p>Moreover, our results suggest that individuals with visual agnosia can facilitate grasping actions to a level comparable to healthy individuals, even in immediate response situations, if ample visual information is provided. This plausibly explains the slowed and deliberate object interaction that visual agnosic patients show in their everyday surroundings, which we have observed in AC and which has also been reported for other visual agnosic patients (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bartolomeo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Goodale and Milner, 2013</xref>). In a kinematic study of patient DF&#x02019;s reach-and-grasp performance, <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al. (2015)</xref> provided evidence of a significant role of terminal tactile feedback and real-time visual information in keeping the dorsal visuomotor system operating normally for prehensile acts. Analogously, our study suggests that color information also plays a similar role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec19"><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The patient AC was reported to us 5&#x0202f;years after the first neuropsychological examinations that were performed in sub-acute clinical conditions.
