In the presence of BLG, Se+ pHMOs-pre-exposed moDCs also instructed IL13 release by T cells, while increasing the percentage regulatory T cells.

Cow&#x02019;s milk, peanut and hen&#x02019;s egg allergy are among the most common food allergies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Although 60-75% of children who are allergic to cow&#x02019;s milk have overgrown this allergy by age 5 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), it remains the most prevalent food allergy during the first year of life (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Major cow&#x02019;s milk allergens include whey protein &#x003b2;-lactoglobulin (BLG) and caseins &#x003b1;s1- and &#x003b1;s2-casein (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). With low levels of these cow&#x02019;s milk allergens in human milk, and most common alternatives to breastfeeding are cow&#x02019;s milk based formula, the burdensome symptoms can occur very early in life possibly affecting nutritional status of infants, as well as the quality of life of both infants and their parents (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Allergic sensitization is a result of impaired tolerance and a T helper (Th) 2-driven immune response specific for an allergen. Upon exposure, allergens may cause epithelial cells to produce alarmins (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), priming underlying dendritic cells (DCs) toward a type 2 response. This type 2 priming in DCs is characterized by secretion of e.g. C-C motif chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) and expression of costimulatory molecules and receptors for alarmins, such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and interleukin (IL) 33 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Type 2-primed DCs present their captured allergen in the lymph nodes to na&#x000ef;ve T cells, stimulating polarization into Th2 cells rather than regulatory cells or Th1 cells. Th2 cells are characterized by secretion of IL4 and IL13 and expression of prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (or chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells (CRTH2)) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Allergen-specific Th2 cells promote isotype switching of allergen-specific B cells to produce allergen-specific IgE. Upon re-exposure, degranulation of mast cells and basophils lead to local symptoms, possibly expanding to systemic responses (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Several approaches to prevent sensitization during early life have been studied (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Breastfeeding is the universal gold standard for infant feeding (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although several studies found breastfeeding to protect against allergic diseases in general, meta-analysis and systematic reviews on cohort and cross-sectional studies do not conclude on an association between breastfeeding and food allergies (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Heterogeneity in outcome assessment, as well as the heterogeneity in human milk composition between individuals and over the course of lactation, complicates comparison of results. In addition, performing high quality studies, such as randomized controlled trials, is challenging due to ethical and practical reasons (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are, therefore, utilized to study the association between and potential mechanisms underlying human milk components, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and atopic diseases.</p><p>Human milk contains a variety of components, of which HMOs are the third most abundant, after lactose and lipids. More than 150 different and distinct HMO structures have been identified today (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The HMO composition in human milk is highly variable. The majority of variation is attributed to polymorphisms in the fucosyltransferase 2 gene (FUT2), as it affects fucosylation of HMOs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). An active FUT2 gene allows fucosylation of HMO core-structures via an &#x003b1;1,2-glycosidic linkage, defining secretors (Se+). Se+ milk is characterized by high levels of 2&#x02019;-fucosyllactose (2&#x02019;-FL) and lacto-<italic>N</italic>-fucopentaose I (LNFP I). Non-secretors (Se-) are defined by an inactive FUT2 enzyme and a (near-)absence of &#x003b1;1,2-fucosylated HMOs like 2&#x02019;-FL and LNFP I (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Some studies investigated the association of maternal secretor status with atopy development of breastfed infants. Recently, a relatively large observational study, including human milk samples from 980 breastfeeding women, showed that high concentrations of fucosylated HMOs 2&#x02019;-FL and difucosyllacto-<italic>N</italic>-hexaose, as well as total HMOs and total HMO-bound fucose were associated with reduced prevalence of recurrent wheezing in high-risk children (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Additionally, lower incidence of IgE-associated eczema at two years of age was observed for previously breastfed infants who received Se+ milk. However, this was only true for infants who were born via cesarean section (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Another observational cohort did not find a significant difference for the risk of developing atopic dermatitis in the first two years of life between infants receiving Se+ or Se- milk, although way of delivery was not considered in their analysis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These yet inconclusive findings highlight the need to further study the role of HMOs and secretor status in the risk of atopy development, including food allergies, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting to understand differences in immune response to allergens and the potential underlying mechanisms.</p><p>HMOs have bioactive functions ranging from acting as prebiotics and supporting the epithelial barrier to directly interacting with immune cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although HMOs have been detected in blood, stool and urine of breastfed infants (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), HMOs also interact locally in the intestine with the mucosal immune system (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). An <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that pooled HMOs (pHMOs) induced semi-maturation of monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), characterized by increased expression of PD-L1 and secretion of among others IL10. Na&#x000ef;ve T cells co-cultured with pHMO-pre-exposed moDCs led to an increase of CD25+/FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and increased IL10 secretion. In addition, although not significant, the ratio of Th1 (Tbet+) to Th2 (GATA3+) cell ratio tended to favor Th1 cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Another study investigated the effect of HMOs 2&#x02019;-FL and 3-FL in a sensitization co-culture model including intestinal epithelial cells, moDCs and T cells subsequently. T cells co-cultured with moDCs primed with IECs pre-exposed to ovalbumin (OVA) and 2&#x02019;-FL induced an inflammatory and regulatory response, characterized by increased secretion of IL13, IFN&#x003b3;, IL17 and IL10, compared to OVA exposure only. In contrast, T cells co-cultured with moDCs primed with IECs pre-exposed to OVA and 3-FL, decreased the secretion of IL13 compared to OVA only, implying a shift toward IL17A and IL10 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These results indicate that HMOs differentially modulate the immune response, although generally, individual HMOs or mixtures are thought to skew the immune response toward a type 1 and regulatory response (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Although several studies have explored immunomodulatory properties of individual, synthesized HMOs, in the perspective of breastfeeding, the effect of the complete HMO profile is most relevant. As the HMO profile is fundamentally different between milk from Se+ and Se- mothers, we studied the influence of Se+ and Se- pHMOs, respectively, on moDC maturation and differentiation, with and without interference of intestinal epithelium. We compared the sensitization capacity of several relevant food allergens on epithelial cells and/or moDCs. Lastly, we studied the immunomodulatory effects of Se+ and Se- pHMOs in the light of allergic sensitization on BLG-exposed (IEC-)moDCs and subsequent effect on co-cultured allogenic na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Pooled human milk oligosaccharides (pHMOs)</title><p>Human milk was collected as part of UC San Diego&#x02019;s Human Milk Institute human milk donation program. Healthy donors provided milk in excess of their own baby&#x02019;s needs. Milk was screened for secretor status by fluorescence high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-FL). Secretor milk from 13 donors and non-secretor milk from 9 donors were pooled separately to generate a secretor and a non-secretor pool. The full Se+ and Se- HMO profile was isolated from these separate donor human milk pools as previously described (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). After centrifugation, the lipid layer was removed, and proteins were precipitated from the aqueous phase by addition of ice-cold ethanol and subsequent centrifugation. Ethanol was removed from the HMO-containing supernatant by roto-evaporation. Lactose and salts were removed by gel filtration chromatography over a BioRad P2 column (100 cm x 316 mm, Bio-Rad) using a semi-automated fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system. Only pHMOs with less than 2% lactose were used for experiments.</p><p>Endotoxin levels were assessed in a 10%w/v pHMO in sterile PBS solution as &#x0003e;10<sup>4</sup>ng/mL by a LAL assay according to manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Charles River, USA), using Endotoxin-Specific Buffer (Charles River, USA). Both samples were further diluted to 5%w/v in endotoxin-free water (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Endotoxin removal was performed with spin columns according to manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). After endotoxin removal, Se+ and Se- pHMOs contained 25.2ng/mL and 9.5ng/mL endotoxins, respectively, at the highest concentration (0.5%) used in the (co-)culture experiments. An LPS control of 25ng/mL was included in the experiments. HMO composition was assessed before and after endotoxin removal by high pressure anion exchange chromatography coupled to pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) as previously described (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Levels of the five most abundant HMOs were quantified before and after endotoxin removal with a 80-95% recovery (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

The gut microbiome drives early life maturation of the mucosal immune system and HMOs in human milk are known to support microbiome development (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Specific HMOs, however, may also have direct effects on mucosal immune development by acting on intestinal epithelial cells and/or dendritic cells that can drive either tolerance or instruct immunity to food derived proteins (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Understanding the impact of environmental and possible protective factors, including human milk components such as HMOs, when exposing infants to food allergens is crucial to reduce the high burden of food allergies. Breastfeeding is the optimal nutrition for infants and contains a wide range of bioactive compounds benefiting healthy development of the immune system. However, to our knowledge, the effect of the full profile of isolated HMOs from Se+ or Se- milk in the context of food allergen sensitization has not been studied before. We found that both HMO profiles activate moDCs in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of cow&#x02019;s milk allergen BLG, only Se+ pHMOs increased type 2-associated markers CCL22 secretion and the %CD86+ and %IL33R+ moDCs, while both Se+ and Se- increased regulatory IL10 secretion and inhibitory %PD-L1+ moDCs. IECs dampened the immunomodulatory effect of BLG and/or pHMOs. Even though Se+ and Se- pHMOs, when exposed to IEC-DC co-cultures with BLG, still tended to increase some moDC markers, these pHMO- and BLG-pre-exposed moDCs did not induce T cell activation. Together, these data suggest that pHMOs differentially modulate the immune response in our models dependent on the secretor status (see <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">

Se+ milk has generally higher levels of total HMOs, higher levels of fucosylated HMOs and fucose bound via an &#x003b1;1,2-linkage (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). More specifically, Se+ milk is characterized by high levels of 2&#x02019;-FL, LNFP I and LNDFH I as opposed to milk from Se- mothers (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In contrast, Se- milk generally has lower levels of fucosylated HMOs and 3-FL and lacto-<italic>N</italic>-fucopentaose III (LNFP III) are relatively more abundant. Dependent on FUT3 gene activity, also lacto-<italic>N</italic>-fucopentaose II (LNFP II) and lacto-<italic>N</italic>-difucohexaose II (LNDFH II) are present in Se- milk (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Indeed, our Se+ pHMO samples contained high levels of 2&#x02019;-FL, also compared to our Se- pHMO sample. In contrast, Se- pHMO samples contained relatively high levels of LNT, namely more than twice as abundant compared to Se+ pHMO samples.</p><p>These HMO-compositional differences might translate to differential effects on immune cells. Different lectin receptors expressed by immune cells, including monocytes and DCs, interact with HMOs and are involved in immunomodulatory pathways. To illustrate, C-type lectin receptor DC-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) specifically binds fucosylated HMOs, as nicely reviewed by Triantis and colleagues (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We observed several consistent differences between Se+ and Se- pHMOs on immune cells. Se+ pHMOs seems to induce a stronger activating effect with a tendency of increased IL8 secretion. The immune response seems to be type 2-associated, as indicated by a tendency to increased CCL22 secretion and inclining pattern of %CD86+ moDCs, and tendency of increased IL13 secretion after co-culture with na&#x000ef;ve T cells. One of the hallmark Se+ HMOs is 2&#x02019;-FL. Several studies investigated the immunomodulatory effect of specifically 2&#x02019;-FL on non-activated moDCs but generally found little to no effect on assessed markers (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In our current DC model, in contrast to Se+ pHMOs, Se- pHMOs did not tend to induce IL8 or CCL22 secretion by moDCs, but tended to increase %CD80 moDCs. Xiao and colleagues previously showed that pHMOs (without distinguishing secretors and non-secretors) induced tolerogenic characteristics in immature moDCs after exposure, with increased IL10, IL27 and IL6 secretion and unaffected pro-inflammatory IL12p70 and TNF&#x003b1; secretion by exposed moDCs, which also induced IL10 secretion after co-culture with na&#x000ef;ve T cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We showed that Se+ pHMOs also increased IL10 secretion and tended to increase the %PD-L1+ moDCs, while Se- pHMOs reduced co-stimulatory molecule %CD86+ moDCs, all features of the semi-mature tolerogenic DCs (tDCs) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Although, this did not directly translate to the T cell response as the IL10 secretion was unaffected. Instead, Se+ pHMO-pre-exposed moDCs supported T cells which tended to secrete IL13, while T-cells cultured with Se- pHMO-pre-exposed moDCs remained silenced. The tolerogenic effect of pHMOs in the study by Xiao et&#x000a0;al. was especially shown in the context of an inflammatory trigger. In the presence of LPS, pHMOs reduced the expression of co-stimulatory markers compared to LPS alone, whereas in absence of LPS, pHMOs increased the expression of these markers (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Differences in HMO-induced responses between studies might be explained by the presence or absence of an additional environmental trigger. As described above, the presence of high LPS levels can make the difference in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Perdijk et&#x000a0;al. demonstrated that 3&#x02019;-SL induced semi-mature tDCs with reduced %CD86+ moDCs, increased IL10 and reduced IL12p70 and TNF&#x003b1; secretion. However, LPS removal from 3&#x02019;-SL diminished these effects (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). This advocates for consideration of LPS levels in HMO samples exposed to immune cells in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to distinguish HMO and LPS effects. On the other hand, in the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, HMOs interact with DCs in an environment with microbiota including LPS and other microbial components (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In our study, Se+ and Se- pHMO samples contained low levels of endotoxin after LPS removal, which may have interfered in the experiment. We therefore included a LPS control for the pHMO condition with the highest LPS levels as present in 0.5% Se+ pHMOs (25ng/mL). The LPS control did not significantly affect any of the assessed markers, although the increased %PD-L1+ moDCs after exposure to Se+ pHMOs might be partly to LPS contamination. Therefore, we concluded that interference of endotoxins was limited in our study.</p><p>We were interested in the differential effect of Se+ and Se- pHMOs in the context of a sensitizing trigger, cow&#x02019;s milk allergen BLG. Previously, the preventative effect of 2&#x02019;-FL and 3-FL on OVA-activated IECs on moDCs and subsequent na&#x000ef;ve T cell response was studied (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). OVA activated IECs despite the pre-incubation with 2&#x02019;-FL and 3-FL. Subsequently, 2&#x02019;-FL and OVA pre-exposed IECs co-cultured with moDCs, induced both a type 2 and 1 inflammatory as well as regulatory response when the collected moDCs were cultured with T cells, while 3-FL and OVA primed IEC-exposed moDCs inhibited IL13 secretion by T cells compared to OVA exposure alone, in this sequential IEC-DC and DC-T cell allogenic co-culture models. In absence of IECs, we observed that both Se+ and Se- pHMOs with simultaneous BLG exposure activated moDCs with increased IL8 secretion and %CD86+, with combined Se+ pHMOs and BLG also inducing CCL22 secretion and %TSLPR+ moDCs, compared to BLG only. Co-culture of Se+ pHMO- and BLG-pre-exposed moDCs with T cells resulted in increased IL13 as well as a tendency toward increased IFN&#x003b3; secretion, while Se- pHMOs did not affect cytokine secretion compared to BLG only. Interestingly, if we exposed moDCs to the pHMOs with BLG applied via IECs, in these IEC-DC co-cultures, the %CD86+ moDCs was reduced, indicating reduced maturity. Specifically Se+ pHMOs with BLG increased inhibitory receptor %PD-L1+ moDCs from IEC-DC co-cultures, and these moDCs could not activate T cells. A study exposing moDCs to OVA in the presence or absence of IECs also observed that OVA-pre-exposed moDCs directed toward a type 2-associated response (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). However, IECs prevented Th2 polarization and inhibited moDC maturation. When IECs were pre-exposed to OVA prior to co-culture with moDCs, these pre-exposed IEC were activated but incapable of inducing moDCs maturation during the subsequent co-culture (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). OVA was removed prior to IEC-DC co-culture, therefore preventing allergen uptake in moDCs. Since antigen uptake is essential for moDC maturation, this could explain the lack of maturation seen in this IEC-pre-exposure model (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In our IEC-DC model, IECs might limit direct contact between basolateral moDCs and apical stimuli, therefore dampening the pHMO- and BLG-activating effect on moDCs and resulting in immature moDCs, limiting the capacity of driving T cell activation.</p><p>Generally, HMOs are thought to skew the immune response toward a type 1 and regulatory response (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We show that this may apply for Se+ pHMOs in presence of BLG, but beyond a regulatory type of immune response, also a type 2 response was observed. Markers for DCs skewing the T cell phenotype toward Th2 are not as clearly defined as, for example, Th2 cells. Even though CCL22, CCL17, and surface CD86 and OX40L expression are associated with type 2 skewing, it is important to study the functional outcome of moDC priming by studying their function in na&#x000ef;ve T cell instruction. Type 2-associated DCs are therefore primarily identified by their ability to drive Th2 polarization (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Our data indicate that moDC exposure to pHMOs induced markers associated with a tDC phenotype. Interestingly, moDCs exposed to Se+ pHMOs and BLG drive T cells toward a type 2 as well as regulatory T cell response. Indeed, the helminth-associated glycan LNFP III, also present in Se+ and Se- milk, was shown to induce IL4 and reduce IFN&#x003b3; secretion by OVA-specific CD4+ T cells after co-culture with HMO-exposed moDCs indicating DC2 maturation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). We found that the effects of Se+ pHMOs with BLG on moDCs were to some extent translated into the T cell response as IL13 secretion increased, although the %CRTH2+ memory Th2 cells (CD4+/CD45RO+/CD45RA- non-Treg) tended to decrease. Interestingly, Se+ pHMO-pre-exposed moDCs significantly increased the percentage of regulatory T cells (CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+). Together, it seems that individual or pooled HMOs may have different effects on the immune response, dependent on the specific HMO or composition, and the context in which an allergen is presented.</p><p>Here we studied the effect of pHMOs in the presence of an allergenic trigger. For this, we compared the effects of cow&#x02019;s milk proteins relevant during early life on moDCs. We included whole cow&#x02019;s milk protein whey and casein and the main allergens in these factions, BLG and &#x003b1;s-casein, respectively. Hen&#x02019;s egg allergen OVA was used as a positive control as it was previously shown to have sensitizing capacity in different variations of the model (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Cow&#x02019;s milk allergy is more common during early life and presents a major burden with most infant formulas being based on cow&#x02019;s milk (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although OVA induced a stronger activating effect on moDCs than BLG, BLG had a more selective type 2-associated response. It might be that the immunomodulatory effect of pHMOs is dependent on the strength of the environmental trigger to which moDCs are exposed to. As described above, pHMOs themselves induced expression of co-stimulatory molecules by moDCs. Another study observed that, when co-exposed with LPS as an environmental trigger, pHMOs reduced the expression of several co-stimulatory molecules by moDCs compared to the LPS control (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This was also observed for 0.01% and 0.05% 2&#x02019;-FL, 3-FL, 3&#x02019;-siallyllactose (SL), 6&#x02019;-SL or lacto-<italic>N</italic>-neotetraose (LNnT) exposed to PBMCs. Exposure to non-activated PBMCs led to little to no effect on secreted cytokine profile, while addition to &#x003b1;CD3/CD28-activated PBMCs showed differential regulatory and type 1 skewing effects (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Similar effects were shown for exposure of 2&#x02019;-FL on IECs with underlying non-activated PBMCs or &#x003b1;CD3/CD28-activated PBMCs (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). A stronger activating signal, such as OVA, may enhance the regulatory modulatory impact of HMOs, while a more subtle trigger, like BLG, may not be sufficient in type 2 activation, allowing HMOs to effectively modulate the immune response toward a more regulatory and type 1-skewed response. A stronger activating signal might magnify differences between the Se+ and Se- HMO profiles <italic>in vitro</italic>. This may provide future opportunities to include sequential mucosal food allergen sensitization model also implementing steps beyond T cell polarization (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>The presented types of <italic>in vitro</italic> models help to explore whether HMOs have direct immunomodulatory effects in presence or absence of mucosal triggers, such as food allergens. Future research should further explore potential differences in the immunomodulatory effects on allergic sensitization between Se+ and Se- HMOs by considering increasing allergen levels, as indicated above, or selecting an allergen with a more robust type 2 response. In addition, we added the Se+ and Se- pHMOs in equal dosages to the model. In the real-life situation, Se- milk generally contains a lower level of total HMOs than Se+ milk (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). For example, in the Canadian CHILD cohort, the nineteen most abundant HMOs were quantified, considered to account for over 90% of total HMO content. Se- milk in the CHILD cohort contained 8.94 &#x000b1; 1.51&#x000b5;mol/mL, whereas Se+ milk contained 15.91 &#x000b1; 2.80&#x000b5;mol/mL of these nineteen most abundant HMOs (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Direct translation from our <italic>in vitro</italic> models to the <italic>in vivo</italic> early life situation is also limited because moDCs and T cells in our models were derived from PBMCs of an adult donor and may overestimate local neonatal immune response. Neonate&#x02019;s immune system is less matured and therefore may respond more subtle but similarly balanced (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). More specifically, IFN&#x003b3; as well as IL4 and IL5 secretion is reduced by stimulated blood-derived mononuclear cells from infants compared to their parents, although the ratio between type 1 to type 2 cytokines is similar. For the secretion of other cytokines, such as IL10 and IL13, there is not a clear difference between infants and their parents. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, most HMOs would be exposed to the local mucosal immune system, while part of the HMOs crosses the IEC barrier and enter the circulation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Similarly, we used the carcinogenic adult-derived non-polarized HT-29 cell line to model IECs in our IEC-DC co-culture model, since these cells previously were found more responsive to allergen exposure compared to the carcinogenic adult-derived polarized Caco-2 cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, isolated and cultured intestinal enteroids from children and adults revealed differences, showing that pediatric epithelial cell height as well as resistance was reduced compared to adult-derived enteroids (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). More importantly, secretion of cytokines such as IL8, IFN&#x003b3; and IL6 was absent or limited (below detection level) by pediatric enteroids, while adult-derived enteroids did produce detectable quantities. This suggests that pediatric enteroids may respond differently from than adult-derived cells. On the other hand, in a recent study, immunomodulation through HT-29 was compared to a non-carcinogenic fetal IEC cell line using a IEC-PBMC co-culture (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). This resulted in a similar type 1-associated and regulatory response after activation and exposure to bacterial trigger CpG. Hence, the primary fetal IEC cell line showed a similar but even more sensitive immunomodulatory effect compared to HT-29 cells, as indicated by induced type 1- and type 2-associated as well as regulatory cytokine induction, after additional exposure to non-digestible oligosaccharides. These studies indicate that HT-29 and primary human fetal intestinal epithelial cells can respond similarly in spite of their difference in origin. However, to further study the role of intestinal epithelial cells in mucosal immunomodulatory effects of HMOs, future studies could make use of primary IEC or pediatric cell line models. The availability of clinical studies with human milk are limited due to ethical reasons. Therefore, studies with HMO-supplemented infant formula are performed as Sch&#x000f6;nknecht et&#x000a0;al. recently reviewed (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Two randomized trials compared cow&#x02019;s milk allergic symptoms between infants who received whey-based extensively hydrolyzed formula with 2&#x02019;-FL and/or LNnT to infants receiving similar commercially available formula without HMOs as a secondary outcome, with no significant differences between the groups (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). As supplementing full HMO profiles would be a major undertaking, these effects could be studied in animal models as a more feasible alternative, which would allow us to study the effects after prolonged exposure. This might also provide opportunities to include the role of secretor status of the HMO-receiving offspring in the research.</p><p>This <italic>in vitro</italic> study provided a first comparison of a full HMO profile from Se+ and Se- milk on the immune response in the context of allergen exposure. Exposure to Se+ or Se- pHMOs both activated moDCs, regardless of the presence of cow&#x02019;s milk allergen BLG. Se+ pHMOs activated in a slightly more type 2-associated response if Se+ pHMOs were co-exposed with BLG. Se+ and Se- pHMOs both induced some regulatory features in moDCs which was especially clear for Se+ pHMOs in the presence of BLG, also leading to an increased regulatory T cell response, albeit also a type 2 signature developed. These data show that HMOs from secretor and non-secretor milk differentially modulate the immune response <italic>in vitro</italic>. This highlights the need to further study the relevance of these differences and how they influence the risk of developing food allergies and other allergic diseases for breastfed infants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Eline Voogd for HMO quantification and Bernd Stahl for advice, from Danone Global Research and Innovation Center (Utrecht, the Netherlands).</p></ack><fn-group><title>Abbreviations</title><fn fn-type="abbr" id="abbrev1"><p>2&#x02019;-FL, 2&#x02019;-Fucosyllactose; 3-FL, 3-Fucosyllactose; 3&#x02019;-SL, 3&#x02019;-Sialyllactose; 6&#x02019;-SL, 6&#x02019;-Sialyllactose; BLG, &#x003b2;-lactoglobulin; CCL22, C-C motif chemokine ligand 22; CRTH2, chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells; DC, Dendritic cell; DC-SIGN, Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FUT2, Fucosyltransferase 2; FMO, Fluorescence minus one control; HMO, Human milk oligosaccharide; HPAEC-PAD, High pressure anion exchange chromatography coupled to pulsed amperometric detection; HPLC-FL, Fluorescence high-performance liquid chromatography; MoDC, Monocyte-derived dendritic cells; OVA, Ovalbumin; IEC, Intestinal epithelial cell; IL, Interleukin; LNFP (I, II, III), Lacto-<italic>N</italic>-Fucopentaose (I, II, III); LNDFH II, Lacto-<italic>N-</italic>difucohexaose II; LNT, Lacto-<italic>N</italic>-tetraose; Pen/strep, Penicillin/streptomycin; pHMO, Pooled human milk oligosaccharides; Se+, Secretor; Se-, Non-secretor; tDC, Tolerogenic dendritic cell; Th, T helper cell; Treg, Regulatory T cells; TSLP, Thymic stromal lymphopoietin.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval was not required for the studies involving humans because we used PBMCs, isolated from buffy coats.
