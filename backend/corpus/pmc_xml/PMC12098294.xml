However, despite high remission rates, relapse due to antigen escape remains a significant challenge. To overcome this, designing CAR T-cells targeting multiple cancer antigens simultaneously is a promising strategy. NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) are eight stress-induced ligands expressed by cancer cells but largely absent on healthy cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>We hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of NKG2DL (using the NKG2D extracellular domain) and CD19 can prevent CD19 antigen escape and improve long-term remission rates in B-ALL patients. We developed three tandem CARs targeting both CD19 and NKG2DL and demonstrated that two tandem candidates were highly effective against both CD19+ and CD19- cancer cell lines. Importantly, when compared to CD19 CAR T-cells, tandem CAR T-cells exhibited comparable cytokine secretion, cytolytic activity and proliferation levels when incubated with cancer cells expressing CD19 and were still effective when incubated with cancer cells lacking CD19. Moreover, T-cells transduced with the selected CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR were functional against CD19+ primary B-ALL samples and controlled tumor growth in a highly challenging xenograft model representing a CD19- B-ALL relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These findings provide proof-of-concept that NKG2D-based tandem CARs offer a promising approach to overcome antigen escape and enhance anti-tumor efficacy in B-cell malignancies.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>multispecific CAR</kwd><kwd>tandem CAR</kwd><kwd>B-ALL</kwd><kwd>antigen escape</kwd><kwd>antigen heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>CD19</kwd><kwd>NKG2DL</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare financial support was received for the&#x000a0;research and/or publication of this article.

However, despite impressive clinical activity, some patients are refractory, and others eventually relapse. Mechanisms of relapse in B-cell malignancies, including B-ALL, have been extensively studied, with CD19 escape identified as a major cause, along with the lack of CAR T-cell persistence (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). During oncogenic transformation, genetic instability creates tumor variants with different adaptation levels to their environment (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Thus, the immune pressure exerted by a monospecific or single CAR-T therapy can lead to the emergence of antigen-negative or antigen-low tumor cells. This can occur through two main mechanisms: 1) lineage switch, where patients relapse with a genetically related but phenotypically different malignancy (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and 2) acquired mutations or splice variants leading to CD19 isoforms lacking the target epitope or to the absence of CD19 on the cell surface (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Patients relapsing with a CD19-negative disease have very poor prognosis, hence there is an urgent need to develop novel CAR T-cell therapies targeting alternative antigens or targeting multiple antigens simultaneously.</p><p>Recognition of multiple antigens can be achieved through various strategies. The first consists in co-infusing or infusing sequentially several monospecific CAR T-cell products. The second consists in the infusion of T-cells transduced with two viral vectors, giving rise to a mix of single and multispecific CAR T-cells. Alternatively, T-cells can be transduced with a single viral vector encoding tandem or dual (bicistronic) receptors. In the tandem design, two antigen-binding moieties (often in the form of scFv&#x02019;s) are connected via a linker and incorporated into a single CAR protein. In the dual approach, two independent monospecific CAR proteins are co-expressed on the surface of T-cells.</p><p>Preliminary clinical results with CD19 multispecific CARs highlight areas for improvement in the design of next-generation tandem CAR T-cells. First, the ideal second antigen should be highly expressed. Next, the selected engager should bind this antigen with sufficient affinity. Finally, tandem designs should minimize steric hindrance between the two engagers and ensure accessibility of each engager to its target epitope (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) represent an attractive family of targets for multispecific CAR approaches. This family is composed of eight different stress-induced ligands (MICA, MICB and ULBP1-6) that are induced upon cellular damage, cell transformation or viral infection but are largely absent from the surface of healthy cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). NKG2DL recognition by the NKG2D receptor expressed by NK cells and some subsets of T-cells allows for the surveillance against oncogenic transformation and viral infection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). NKG2DL were shown to be expressed in hematological indications such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), B-cell leukemias and lymphomas (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In addition, the susceptibility of primary B-ALL cells to NK cell activity was also shown to be dependent on the NKG2D-NKG2DL axis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), suggesting that CD19/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells might represent an interesting approach to prevent CD19 antigen escape in B-cell malignancies.</p><p>Although autologous CAR T-cell therapies proved to be effective in B-cell malignancies, the time, cost, and manufacturing failure risk associated are significant disadvantages. Off-the-shelf allogeneic approaches offer a solution to these challenges and should increase the accessibility of CAR T-cell treatments to a larger population cohort.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that allogeneic CAR T-cells expressing tandem receptors targeting CD19 and NKG2DL show equivalent efficacy to CD19 single-targeting CAR T-cells against CD19+ cancer cell lines and primary B-ALL samples. Importantly, this antitumor activity was fully conserved in the absence of the CD19 antigen. Overall, we provide the proof-of-concept that NKG2D can be combined with a CD19-targeting scFv in the context of a tandem receptor to overcome antigen escape, as an alternative to currently evaluated tandem receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Study design</title><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the functionality of different CD19/NKG2DL tandem candidates against CD19+ and CD19- cancer cell lines and CD19+ primary B-ALL samples <italic>in vitro</italic> and to demonstrate their anti-tumor efficacy in CD19- B-ALL relapse model <italic>in vivo</italic>.

</xref>). NKG2D EC was bound to a CD8&#x003b1; transmembrane domain (CD8&#x003b1; TM) via a short hinge (12 amino acids) derived from either IgG4 or CD8&#x003b1; (Tan IgG4, Tan CD8s) or via a long hinge (55 amino acids) derived from CD8&#x003b1; (Tan CD8l). The CD19 single-targeting (CD19 CAR) contained the 55 amino acids CD8&#x003b1; hinge (which is similar to the hinge used in Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)). The NKG2DL single-targeting CAR contained the 12 amino acids CD8&#x003b1; hinge (NKG2DL CAR) to mimic the natural configuration where the extracellular C-type lectin domain of NKG2D is linked to the transmembrane &#x003b1; helix via a short stalk (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Each CAR construct carried a 4-1BB co-stimulation domain and a CD3&#x003b6; activation domain and was co-expressed with a truncated CD34 (tCD34) downstream of a 2A peptide to allow for purification of transduced cells during manufacturing.

Targeting multiple antigens from the start may reduce the risk of relapse compared to single CAR T-cell therapies. Evaluation of differences in clinical efficacy for single and multispecific CAR T-cells is challenging due to the lack of direct comparison in many studies. Indeed, most multispecific CAR T-cells are only tested in small phase I clinical trials that do not include a CD19 single CAR arm (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

These results indicate that, while tandem CAR T-cells comprising CD19/CD20 and/or CD19/CD22 are being tested, no clear clinical benefit is apparent, and more data is needed to ensure the validity of the approach.</p><p>The rather limited benefit observed with multispecific CAR T-cell therapies targeting two different B-cell antigens might be due to relatively low number of patients treated, the possible presence/emergence of double negative cancer cells, or to the fact that these tandem CARs are not sensitive enough to low antigen densities. The ability of NKG2D to bind eight different tumor-specific ligands with a moderate affinity offers a broad range of targets. In addition, this approach demonstrated a manageable safety profile in &#x0003e; 100 patients evaluated in multiple phase I clinical trials using both autologous and allogeneic NKG2D-based CAR T-cells (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>In this study, with the goal to prevent CD19 antigen escape in B-cell malignancies, we created different CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells and demonstrated that the tandem candidate carrying the CD8 short hinge provided robust and sustained antitumor activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, under stress conditions. Specifically, we have shown that these tandem CAR T-cells were able to lyse CD19+ and CD19- cancer cells in both repeated antigen stimulation assays (mimicking chronic stimulation) and in an aggressive <italic>in vivo</italic> B-ALL model where tandem CAR T-cells successfully negated cancer relapse after multiple re-challenges. Finally, we demonstrated that tandem CAR T-cells with the CD8 short hinge, but also single-targeting counterparts, secreted IFN-&#x003b3; when co-cultured with primary B-ALL samples, highlighting the relevance of targeting NKG2DL in B-cell malignancies, including B-ALL.</p><p>Several studies comparing tandem CARs containing two scFv&#x02019;s to their single-targeting counterparts showed that tandem receptor displayed a lower binding to one or both target antigens, leading to impaired recognition of tumor cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In our experiments, CD19 binding was fully conserved while MICA binding was decreased by 30% in CD19/NKG2DL tandem receptors bearing a short hinge as compared to their single targeting counterparts, suggesting that the FMC63 scFv generates some steric hindrance towards the NKG2D extracellular domain. This phenomenon, which was not abrogated by increasing linker size, did not translate in a decreased functionality since T-cells expressing these tandem receptors were as effective as NKG2DL single CAR T-cells in terms of cytokine secretion, proliferation, and cytolytic activity. Moreover, the binding of MICA did not decrease the binding of CD19 and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><p>In our studies, tandem CAR T-cells with a long hinge, despite similar MICA binding, functioned poorly without CD19 antigen. This highlights the importance of hinge size over NKG2DL binding for functionality. The short extracellular spacer of natural NKG2D suggests that NKG2D-based CAR receptors require a short hinge for effective signaling. Furthermore, while many studies have assessed tandems that differ by the linker size, the linker sequence or the relative position of the scFv&#x02019;s (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), the impact of hinge size and hinge origin in CD19-targeting tandem receptors has been less commonly addressed (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the activity of tandem long hinge CAR T-cells in response to plate-bound MICA did not fully replicate the results observed with Nalm-6 CD19 KO cells. Several factors may contribute to this discrepancy. First, epitope accessibility is likely higher for immobilized ligands compared to the same ligands embedded within a cellular membrane. Second, even at low coating concentrations, the number of MICA molecules available to T-cells may greatly exceed the density of NKG2DL present on the surface of Nalm-6 cells. Third, while the plate-bound system presents a single defined ligand, Nalm-6 cells express multiple NKG2DL simultaneously. Finally, given that the natural receptor NKG2D exhibits varying affinities for its different ligands, the cumulative avidity and resulting activation threshold may differ, depending on the hinge length, potentially leading to distinct responses between T-cells expressing the tandem long hinge and tandem with shorter hinges.</p><p>Consistent with this complexity, CAR T-cells with the tandem long hinge and those with shorter hinges displayed comparable cytolytic activity against HeLa cells during the first two stimulations of the repeated killing assay. The presence of high-affinity ligands like MICA on HeLa cells may enhance the activation of long hinge CAR T-cells better than when they are activated by the ULBP ligands expressed at the surface of Nalm-6 cells.</p><p>The expression of NKG2DL in primary B-cell malignancies, and particularly in B-ALL, is relatively low in comparison to levels observed in solid tumors. Regulation mechanisms of the stress-associated NKG2DL have been extensively studied and it was demonstrated that their surface expression can be induced by different types of stress conditions such as genotoxic drugs or DNA damaging agents mostly at the post-transcriptional stages (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Moreover, different cancer treatments such as DNA -damaging agents or histone deacetylase inhibitors were shown to significantly increase their expression at the surface of cancer cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Therefore, the potential of NKG2D-based multispecific CAR-T therapies in B-cell malignancies might be improved by the patient&#x02019;s pre-conditioning regimen, standard prior treatment lines (e.g. vincristine and doxorubicin) or by combining NKG2DL CAR T-cells with an anti-cancer treatment that increases NKG2DL expression on the surface of cancer cells (e.g. bortezomib and valproate).</p><p>By targeting NKG2DL rather than a second B-cell antigen, CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells have the potential to eliminate CD19 negative clones arising from lineage switch. These clones, which may be present prior to CD19 CAR-T treatment, carry abnormalities typically associated with myeloid neoplasms, which may then develop into AML (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). This suggests that developing CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells may be a good strategy to prevent CD19 antigen-escape resulting from lineage switch as well.</p><p>Importantly, in the <italic>in vivo</italic> model used in this study, which aimed to demonstrate the capacity of CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells to control CD19- tumor cells, NKG2DL single and tandem CAR T-cells demonstrated comparable anti-tumor efficacy. While this result might suggest that a NKG2DL-targeting CAR could suffice, several key considerations support the continued development of the tandem approach. First, NKG2DL single CAR T-cells secreted lower cytokines levels when co-cultured with Nalm-6 and primary B-ALL samples. Then, CD19-targeting CAR T-cells have a well-established clinical track record and have shown robust efficacy across a range of B-cell malignancies. However, loss or mutation of CD19 often arises under immunological pressure during treatment. The tandem CAR strategy is therefore designed to extend the reach of CAR T-cells by targeting malignant cells that escape CD19-directed therapy. Moreover, the use of an scFv (FMC63) and a natural receptor (NKG2D EC) plays an important role in the design of the CD19/NKG2DL tandem. The FMC63 scFv exhibits a high affinity for CD19, enabling strong and specific binding to CD19 on B-cells. However, its avidity is limited to monovalent interactions, which can impact binding stability, especially in the presence of low antigen density (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In contrast, natural NKG2D, with its moderate affinity for multiple ligands, benefits from enhanced avidity due to its ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). By leveraging the high specificity of the FMC63 scFv and the broad, multivalent recognition capacity of NKG2D, the tandem CAR is uniquely positioned to enhance targeting across diverse tumor contexts, particularly those exhibiting heterogeneous or downregulated antigen expression.</p><p>While the present study focused on B-cell malignancies and used B-ALL as a model to provide the proof-of-concept of NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells, the broad expression profile of NKG2DL in cancer implies that it can be combined with different scFv&#x02019;s to target different indications. In most solid tumors, NKG2DL were shown to be highly expressed [reviewed in (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)]. For example, more than 80% of primary ovarian tumors appear to be positive for at least one NKG2D ligand among MICA, MICB, ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Colorectal and breast cancer tumor cells were also frequently stained for multiple NKG2DL, implying that these tumor indications would be highly susceptible to NKG2DL mediated lysis (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In addition, we have observed that fibrovascular structures associated with tumors displayed membranous staining within the endothelial compartment suggesting that NKG2D-based CAR-T therapy can target simultaneously both the tumor and the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we designed CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells that proved to be highly effective against B-cell malignant cells, where low antigen expression or antigen loss can play an important role.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We want to thank the Biobank collection of CHU UCL Namur Site Godinne that provided primary B-ALL specimens.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, upon request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by Comit&#x000e9; d&#x02019;&#x000e9;thique m&#x000e9;dical du CHU UCL Namur- Site Godinne (r&#x000e9;f&#x000e9;rence 120/2022).
