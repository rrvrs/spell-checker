An arteriovenous fistula serves as a critical lifeline for patients undergoing hemodialysis, yet its function often deteriorates due to complications such as narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels. This study aimed to clarify the relationships between the sound properties of blood flow through arteriovenous fistulas and a medical/surgical history of patients undergoing hemodialysis by analyzing the distribution of sound frequencies from 100 to 4,000 Hz. Data were collected from 53 patients to identify two key parameters: the time point within one cycle of arteriovenous fistula sounds where the power distribution reached its peak, expressed as a percentage, and the specific frequency where the power was highest within the analyzed range. The results showed that well-functioning arteriovenous fistulas exhibited peak power within the first 25 percent of the sound cycle and the highest power at 200 Hz. In contrast, higher peak percentages and lower power at 200 Hz were associated with surgical interventions due to complications such as narrowing or blockage of the arteriovenous fistula. These findings suggest that the sound properties of arteriovenous fistulas, combined with patient-specific characteristics, may serve as non-invasive indicators of arteriovenous fistula function and help predict the risk of complications. This approach provides valuable insights for improving the management of arteriovenous fistulas and patient outcomes in hemodialysis therapy.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

In Asian countries such as Taiwan and Brunei, as well as in the United States, more than 400 persons per million population are diagnosed with kidney disease annually. Consequently, the number of patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD), the primary treatment for end-stage renal failure, continues to increase each year [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence of dialysis in Japan is 2,786 per million people, the second highest in the world. Of these patients, 90% undergo HD, which necessitates the creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With an AVF, HD serves as a kidney replacement therapy, acting as a critical lifeline for patients with end-stage renal failure. Effective self-management, supported by physicians and nurses, is crucial to maintaining the optimal HD condition over time. However, AVFs often fail due to the direct inflow of blood from arteries to veins, placing significant strain on the vessels. Consequently, the primary patency rate of AVFs is about 50&#x02013;60% within 3&#x02013;5 years after AVF creation [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. When AVF failure occurs, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, thrombus aspiration, or vascular stenting procedures are performed. Ongoing research aims to develop safer and more efficient methods for these interventions [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, if the vessel cannot be adequately dilated, AVF reconstruction becomes necessary [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To address the needs of patients requiring AVF reconstruction, research is ongoing to develop safer and more effective techniques with higher success rates [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Each treatment session imposes both physical and financial burdens&#x000a0;on a person with end-stage renal failure. Therefore, it is essential to enhance self-management skills and facilitate the early detection of abnormalities before the need for endovascular treatment or AVF reconstruction arises. This approach enables long term HD using the initially created AVF and alleviates the physical and financial burdens for people with end-stage renal failure. Various methods, including ultrasonography, blood tests, and measurement of dialysis volume during HD [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], have been explored for the early detection of AVF abnormalities. However, these methods are only available when patients visit a hospital for HD, making it challenging to perform them on a daily basis.</p><p>Auscultation of AVF blood flow sounds (AVF sounds) is one method for patients to self-monitor the condition of their AVF at home. Auscultation is a simple and cost-effective method that requires only a stethoscope, and many HD patients receive instruction on how to perform auscultation of AVF sounds. However, most people with end-stage renal failure are aged 65 years or older [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and one in three individuals aged 65&#x02013;74 years, as well as approximately half of those aged 75 years or older, have hearing loss [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, auscultation as a form of AVF self-care becomes increasingly challenging with age. In addition, auscultation is subjective and challenging to evaluate objectively. AVF sounds, generated by the blood flow from arteries to veins within an AVF can be objectively analyzed through frequency analysis. The intensity of AVF sounds is anticipated to increase during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle and decrease during diastole, reflecting variations in blood flow and blood flow velocity. Therefore, any alterations in vessel wall resistance or abnormal blood flow may be reflected in the blood flow sounds. In fact, previous studies have demonstrated that stenosis in the AVF generates characteristic features in the high-frequency band [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In other words, we hypothesize that analyzing the frequency properties of AVF sounds facilitates the functional assessment of AVFs, thereby informing treatment strategies and nursing interventions to support long-term HD. End-stage renal failure is caused by several diseases, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The status of an AVF may vary based on the underlying disease in individuals with end-stage renal failure, and these differences could be reflected in the properties of AVF sounds. If the properties of AVF sounds associated with these diseases can be elucidated, the accuracy of AVF function assessment could be significantly improved.</p><p>Recent studies using machine learning to detect abnormalities in AVFs have demonstrated that AVF stenosis can be identified with high accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but this is limited to the time of observation by clinicians at HD facilities. However, if HD patients can evaluate AVF function at home using AVF sounds, it may facilitate self-management to prevent AVF abnormalities.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the relationships between the properties of AVF sounds and a medical/surgical history of HD recipients. This study is expected to aid patients in managing their AVFs and improving self-care practices by facilitating the assessment of AVF function. Furthermore, the findings of this study are anticipated to contribute to the development of advanced devices for detecting AVF failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this study, a longitudinal survey of AVF sounds in individuals with AVFs was conducted.

In fluid acoustics, it is well-established that fluid sounds are generated from the formation and dissipation of individual vortices, and the intensity of these sounds increases with higher flow velocity [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the volume of AVF sounds is lower when the blood flow velocity in the AVF is low and high when velocity is high. Typically, during the isovolumetric contraction phase, there is minimal blood ejection, resulting in reduced blood flow velocity. The velocity peaks during the rapid ventricular ejection phase and gradually decreases during the reduced ventricular ejection phase. Based on this, it is presumed that the TMP of a well-functioning AVF falls within the range corresponding to the rapid and reduced ventricular ejection phases of the cardiac cycle.</p><p>In the present study, patients without a history of diabetes mellitus and with an AVF vintage of less than five years demonstrated the lowest TMP values. Conversely, patients with a history of diabetes mellitus and an AVF vintage of five or more years exhibited the highest TMP values. According to previous studies, diabetes mellitus has been shown to contribute to arteriosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and AVFs in diabetic patients have lower patency rates than in those without diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Arteriosclerosis is considered a precursor to vascular stenosis [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the frequency of HD is associated with an increased risk of AVF failure [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The findings of the present, combined with prior research, suggest that diabetes mellitus-induced arteriosclerosis and a prolonged AVF vintage of five years or more negatively affect the vascular intima, resulting in higher TMP values. Therefore, combining TMP data with information on diabetes mellitus history and AVF vintage may provide valuable insights into the presence of AVF thickening or stenosis.</p><p>AVF stenosis is known to be associated with an increase in high-frequency components [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the PSD analysis conducted in the present study showed that consistently high values were seen at 200 Hz, regardless of the occurrence of AVF-related events within three years following the recording of AVF sounds. Further, PSD200, which is the difference between the PSD values at 200 Hz and those at 100 Hz and 300 Hz, was significantly lower in cases with AVF-related events than in those without. In the present study, the 95% confidence interval for PSD200 ranged from 757 to 14,246 in cases with an AVF-related event, and from 11,724&#x02013;48,298 in cases without an AVF-related event; the term &#x0201c;event&#x0201d; refers to surgical interventions involving AVFs, including AVF reconstruction. AVF-related events are often attributed to complications such as AVF infection, pseudoaneurysm formation, venous hypertension, stenosis and occlusion [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. AVF stenosis and occlusion are caused by turbulence resulting from the direct influx of blood from arteries to veins under high hemodynamic pressures. This turbulence induces thickening of the venous valve intima and narrowing of the vascular lumen. Additionally, repeated cannulations during HD contribute to the progressive weakening of the vascular access wall [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], further compromising its structural integrity. These factors collectively result in hypertrophy of the vascular intima [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which is thought to reduce blood flow within the AVF and compromise its function. In cases with an AVF-related event, it is presumed that blood flow in the AVF was already reduced at the time of the AVF sound recording. This reduction in blood flow likely led to a decrease in the volume of the AVF sounds and a corresponding reduction in the PSD, which quantifies the intensity of the signal components of the AVF sounds. Supporting this, a previous study using the auditory spectrum flux and the auditory spectral centroid has demonstrated that the frequency components of a well-functioning AVF are predominantly concentrated within the range of 50&#x02013;450Hz [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, another earlier study using the Maximum Entropy Method has demonstrated that the frequency components of a well- functioning AVF are predominantly found below 500 Hz [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These previous findings support the result of the present study that the lower PSD200 observed in cases with an AVF-related event is due to a significant reduction in PSD within the frequency bands typically associated with a well-functioning AVF, and that a high PSD200 value may reflect a well-functioning AVF. In Japan, hemodialysis is typically performed three times per week [<xref rid="pone.0324747.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with AVFs allowing direct blood flow from arteries to veins under similar conditions. In addition to hypertension and diabetes mellitus, which were examined in the present study, individuals experiencing AVF-related events may have other risk factors contributing to intimal hyperplasia, such as hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking. Although further investigation is required to identify these factors comprehensively, this study shows that a PSD200 value below 14,246 appears to indicate an elevated risk of AVF failure.</p><p>In the present study, the status of the AVF was not evaluated using ultrasonography or angiography. Therefore, assessing the objective risk of AVF failure beyond the acoustic analysis of blood flow remains a critical area for future research. The present study involved 53 participants, of whom only 9 underwent AVF-related interventions between 2017 and 2020. Consequently, further validation with a larger sample size is necessary to generalize the findings of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To elucidate the relationships between the properties of AVF sounds and a medical/surgical history of HD patients, this study analyzed the PSD of AVF sounds across different frequencies.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Raffaele Serra,</p><p>Thank you very much for reviewing our manuscript. Below, we have addressed the points you raised. The same information has also been included in the "Response to Reviewers."</p><p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p><p>Thank you for your guidance regarding PLOS ONE's style requirements. We have carefully reviewed and revised our manuscript to ensure it aligns with the journal's guidelines, including those pertaining to file naming conventions. All revisions have been highlighted in blue for your convenience. If there are any additional areas that require further adjustments, we respectfully request your feedback.</p><p>&#x02022;We started a new line numbering sequence from the Abstract onward.</p><p>&#x02022;Annotations for figures and tables have been marked with symbols, and new captions have been added.</p><p>2. Please state what role the funders took in the study. If the funders had no role, please state: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."</p><p>We have included the following statement in the cover letter to address this requirement:</p><p>"The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."</p><p>3. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly.</p><p>After careful review, we confirm that our manuscript does not include any Supporting Information files, as all necessary data, figures, and tables are presented within the main text. No additional captions or citations are required. We have reviewed the manuscript to ensure clarity and to avoid any potential confusion regarding supplementary materials.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Authors</p><p>Dear Reviewer</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript. Below, we have addressed the points you raised. The same information has also been included in the "Response to Reviewers."</p><p>1. I suggest to include the following paper:<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/life14111382" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.3390/life14111382</ext-link>.</p><p>We have incorporated the content of the suggested paper in lines 39- 41 of the manuscript. Further, to align with this inclusion, we have added a related statement to lines 44-45. The added content is highlighted in red in the "Revised Manuscript with Track Changes" file.</p><p>2. The language must be reviewed in details.</p><p>The language throughout the manuscript has been thoroughly reviewed and revised to improve clarity and readability. Since the revisions cover the entire manuscript, all changes have been highlighted in green in the "Revised Manuscript with Track Changes" file. We hope the revised manuscript addresses your concerns effectively.</p><p>3. The abstract is not clear, I suggest to improve the structure.</p><p>We have completely revised the abstract to improve its clarity, structure, and alignment with the study's objectives and findings. The revised version provides a clear and concise summary of the study's background, methods, results, and conclusions. We hope that the updated abstract addresses your concerns effectively.</p><p>4. Methods are clear but the language must be improved.</p><p>As noted in Comment 2, the "Methods" section has undergone a thorough language review and revisions to enhance its readability. Since these revisions extend throughout the entire "Methods" section, all changes have been highlighted in green in the "Revised Manuscript with Track Changes" file for your reference.</p><p>5.
