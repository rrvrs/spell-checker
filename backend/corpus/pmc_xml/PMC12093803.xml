However, the lack of significant improvements among those with prior dementia experience or training may reflect a ceiling effect, as they likely had higher baseline knowledge and less room for improvement. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of the game and compare its effectiveness to other interventions, potentially using a randomised controlled trial design.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dementia</kwd><kwd>Health</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Serious game</kwd><kwd>Gamification</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Dementia is an umbrella term which encompasses a range of progressive neurological illnesses causing cognitive and behavioural symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although progression will vary between individuals, common symptoms include memory loss, communication and reasoning problems, changes in personality, and a reduction in ability to carry out daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The impact of dementia represents a significant global healthcare priority with more than 55 million individuals living with dementia worldwide, and nearly 10 million new cases emerging annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Despite this high prevalence and the substantial impact of the condition on those living with dementia, their family, friends, and healthcare providers, public understanding of the condition remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, two in three of 70,000 respondents from 155 countries to an Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease International (ADI) Global survey on attitudes to dementia believed dementia to be caused by normal ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This lack of public awareness hinders the ability of those living with Dementia to live active and fulfilling lives, with many experiencing prejudice and discrimination from both the public and healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In Singapore, dementia was initially referred to as &#x075f4;&#x05446;&#x075c7; (ch&#x0012b; d&#x000e0;i zh&#x000e8;ng) in Chinese, which carries negative connotations associated with insanity and idiocy. This term has been replaced by &#x05931;&#x0667a;&#x075c7; (sh&#x0012b; zh&#x000ec; zh&#x000e8;ng), meaning &#x0201c;cognitive impairment disorder,&#x0201d; which has a less negative connotations. One in ten individuals aged 60 and above are living with dementia in Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A Singapore-wide survey found that both those living with dementia and their carers experienced rejection, loneliness and shame, with more than 30% of caregivers reporting feelings of embarrassment when providing care for their loved ones in public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another Singaporean study found a deficiency in knowledge about dementia correlated with misguided attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Due to the ageing population and growing number of people living with dementia, it is imperative to educate the public about the condition to improve knowledge and support for people living with dementia.</p><p id="Par8">Initiatives to help address the negative stigma experienced by those living with dementia include Dementia Friendly Communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], &#x0201c;Forget Us Not&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the Dementia Friends programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, there remains a need for continual improvement of public awareness to reduce discriminatory behaviour towards those with dementia. Gamification represents a novel and innovative method of promoting public awareness and may be more effective in terms of learning and knowledge retention than conventional instruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. &#x02018;Serious games&#x02019; are games which serve a specific educational purpose within an entertaining game format. Such games have become increasingly used within healthcare education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and have been found to, for example, improve awareness of pancreatic cancer symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and influenza vaccination uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">A serious game aimed at improving the general public&#x02019;s attitudes towards dementia was previously co-designed with people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; was found to elicit statistically significant improvements in attitudes toward dementia with participants indicating more optimistic perceptions of the abilities and future potential of people with dementia following evaluation with over 1,000 participants from Northern Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since this evaluation, the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; has been used by over 6,000 players across 57 countries. Whilst 50% of these players come from the UK, 12% come for European countries, 7% come from the US with 25% of players coming from countries across the SE Asia region with the largest percentage of players in Indonesia (8.84%), Singapore (7.52%) and Malaysia (5.79%). However, further research is required to investigate the game&#x02019;s effectiveness in different cultures. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact of the &#x02018;Dementia Awareness Game&#x02019; on attitudes towards dementia within the general public in Singapore.

Questionnaires were delivered immediately prior to and following participation in the game. The study was conducted using convenience sampling of members of the public with recruitment via social media as well as promotion of the study by Dementia Singapore and emails to staff and students at the Singapore Institute of Technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par13">The &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; was co-designed with people living with dementia who highlighted societal misperceptions about the activities and capabilities of people living with dementia and felt that with great awareness, the public could support people living with dementia to enjoy greater independence within the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Through the codesign process, a question bank was developed covering three themes: common symptoms of dementia; misconceptions about dementia; and abilities of people living with dementia to confront and dispel stereotypes and stigma surrounding dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The game play is simple requiring a figure to navigate a path with obstacles in a set amount of time. Questions appear in random order and the clock stops once the question appears. After the player has submitted their response, the correct answer with an explanation is given to enhance the player&#x02019;s knowledge. As questions are answered correctly, the player gains points to advance along the path until they reach the finish line. The Game can be completed in approximately three minutes. The player is allowed multiple attempts to improve their score, which places them on a leaderboard. The game is a HTML5 web-based application which can be played on any device with an internet connection and can be freely accessed here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dementiagame.com">www.dementiagame.com</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Survey instrument</title><p id="Par14">The pre- and post-measures were completed on Qualtrics. The pre-questionnaire recorded demographic details (sex, age, ethnic group, whether they had a family member or close friend living with dementia, whether they worked with people living with dementia, and whether they had previously undertaken dementia training). This was followed by the 19-item Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The ADQ has been validated with Singaporean health workers with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.80 and intra-class coefficients of 0.65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">This questionnaire consists of two domains related to &#x02018;hope&#x02019; and &#x02018;person-centred&#x02019; approaches. The &#x02018;hope&#x02019; domain demonstrates either an optimistic or pessimistic approach to a person with dementia (e.g. people with dementia are sick and need to be looked after). The &#x02018;person-centred&#x02019; domain focuses on how a person with dementia is seen as an individual person and their capabilities (e.g. it is important to respond to people with dementia with empathy and understanding). Each item of this questionnaire consisted of a five-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5).</p><p id="Par16">The post-questionnaire repeated the ADQ and included an evaluation of the game. Participants were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the game on a scale from very dissatisfied (1) to very satisfied (5). Participants were also asked the extent to which the game effectively raised their awareness and understanding of dementia by selecting one of three responses: No, yes to some extent, or yes to a great extent. The user-friendliness of the game was then assessed via participants responses of &#x02018;yes, very straightforward and clear&#x02019;, &#x02018;yes, with some difficulty&#x02019;, or &#x02018;no, they were confusing&#x02019;. Participants also rated their likelihood of recommending the game to others from very unlikely (1) to very likely (5). Finally, participants were asked to provide feedback by answering open-ended questions about the game. These sought insights into aspects of the game they found enjoyable, informative, and suggestions for improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par17">Data collection for this study took place over a five-month period from July to October 2023. Interested individuals accessed the study through a Qualtrics link or QR code provided by the research team. As this study was open to the general public in Singapore, there were no inclusion/exclusion criteria. Within the Qualtrics platform, a participant information sheet was embedded outlining the details of the study. Participants were required to click a box to confirm they had read the information and consented to participate in the study. If participants did not consent to participate, they could still play the game without participating in the research study. All participants were permitted to withdraw from the study at any stage without giving any reason and information about these processes was provided within the participant information sheet. The game, and the pre- and post-test measures were embedded within Qualtrics, and the questionnaires were completed immediately prior to and following engagement with the game. Participants played the game individually on a device of choice at a time and location of their choosing. After playing the game, participants were directed to the post questionnaire. </p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par18">Singapore Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board granted ethical approval for this study (Ref: 2023063) after considering benefits and risks and ensuring participants autonomy would be respected.

Participants who did not complete the post-test questionnaire were removed from the final dataset.</p><p id="Par20">Total scores for each questionnaire sub-scale were calculated based on Likert scale responses for both the pre- and post-test questionnaires. Several items were reverse coded to ensure higher scores reflected more positive attitudes toward dementia. Descriptive statistics were performed to observe demographic details of the participant sample. As the data did not meet the assumption of normality required for a paired-samples t-test, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to examine the change from pre-test to post-test for both domains of the ADQ as well as the total ADQ. Descriptive statistics were also used to examine differences based on whether participants had a family member or close friend living with dementia, whether they worked with people living with dementia, and whether they had undergone previous dementia training. Finally, responses to the game evaluation questions were analysed descriptively.</p><p id="Par21">The qualitative data obtained from responses to the open-ended questions presented on the post-test questionnaire were analysed using Braun and Clarke&#x02019;s six step thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate a serious game as an educational tool within the Singaporean context. While the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; has undergone evaluation in prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this was the first study to explore its impact in Singapore. Following engagement with the game, participants showed improvements in participants&#x02019; overall attitudes towards dementia, as well as in the &#x0201c;hope&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;person-centred&#x0201d; subscales, after playing the game, highlighting the potential of this &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; as an educational tool. However, those with prior experience working with people with dementia or dementia training did not show significant improvements. Most participants expressed satisfaction with the game and found it effective in raising awareness and understanding of dementia.</p><p id="Par41">In line with previous research in which the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; elicited more positive attitudes toward dementia, participants in this study showed increased scores across both &#x02018;hope&#x02019; and &#x02018;person-centredness&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This reflects the game&#x02019;s impact in promoting optimistic views of the abilities and capabilities of people with dementia as well as recognition of those with dementia as unique individuals with hopes and values. This may be explained by conceptual reframing as participants gained a more positive and nuanced understanding of the condition via the education they received through engagement with the game, an integral aspect of reducing stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Younger people in other Asian countries have been found to have a greater level of digital literacy having grown up with smart devices and the internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As the majority of participants were aged between 18 and 34, this may account for the interest in the digital game as a mechanism for raising dementia awareness, similar to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Individuals who had either worked with people with dementia or undertaken dementia training previously, however, were not found to exhibit the same level of improvement in scores following engagement with the game. This contradicts previous findings that the game demonstrated significant improvements in attitudes irrespective of professional involvement with dementia or prior dementia training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, findings may reflect the increased baseline knowledge of these groups, and a resulting ceiling effect. It is plausible that those with prior training and/or experience had less room for improvement due to their higher baseline knowledge. This is in line with previous research in which increased contact with people with dementia and prior training lead to more positive attitudes toward dementia including more person-centred attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Similarly in a study assessing the attitudes of community healthcare workers in Singapore, using the ADQ, having a family member or experience in caring for people with dementia did not translate into a higher score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although the same study revealed generally positive attitudes towards people living with dementia with a mean ADQ score 68.4 out of 95 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which was similar to the pre-test scores in this study.</p><p id="Par43">Participants highlighted various positive features of the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019;, underscoring its efficacy in challenging stereotypes and stigma surrounding dementia. Participants commented on the integration of fun and interactive gamification elements within the educational context. The interactive gameplay. Involving gamified quiz elements, map navigation, and decision-making regarding directions and routes helped to actively engage participants. Further, the point system served as a mechanism for positive reinforcement and reward-based learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">The content of the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; was determined by co-design with people with dementia.

This allowed the priorities and personal experiences of those affected to be incorporated into the game&#x02019;s design, ensuring the game captured their journey, directly challenged stereotypes, and fostered a more profound understanding among players. Other co-designed games have found similar effects of increased awareness, and positive evaluation by users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Evaluating the dementia game in Singapore provided helpful feedback in what was needed for cultural adaptation. For example, players suggested different languages as Singapore is a pluralist society and more structured content to engage players in the experience of the dementia journey. Whilst this game was successful in challenging stereotypes and fostered a more profound understanding of dementia, creating scenarios with interactive games has also been identified as a mechanism to improve dementia awareness in other Asian countries and with UK children&#x02019;s nursing students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Future dementia awareness game development should also consider the perspectives of people living with dementia and their carers in Singapore.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par46">The strengths for the present study include the adoption of a mixed methods approach which provided qualitative insights to complement the quantitative data collected. This provided a more holistic understanding of the game&#x02019;s effectiveness in evoking changes in attitudes towards dementia.</p><p id="Par47">This study is also subject to limitations including participant drop-out which resulted in low statistical power and limited the ability to detect small or moderate effects. This reduced sample size also limits the generalisability of findings to the broader population. The majority of participants identified as ethnic Chinese which further limits the generalisability of findings to more ethnically diverse settings as attitudes toward dementia can be significantly impacted by cultural factors that vary among different ethnic groups. In addition, as the game predominantly focused on introductory and basic-level information, participants with prior exposure to dementia training or working with people with dementia may not have found the content challenging or stimulating enough to evoke attitudinal changes. More personalised or advanced interventions may be required for this population.</p><p id="Par48">In terms of future research, it would be useful to extend the current findings by examining the long-term impact of engaging with the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019;. This could help to shed light on learning retention and any sustained impact the increased positive attitudes. In addition, it may be helpful to compare the impact of the serious game with other interventions. Although the pre- and post-test design of the present study represents a pragmatic and cost-effective method of evaluating the intervention, this design does not have a comparison or control group. Therefore, future research would benefit from testing the effectiveness of the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; in a randomised control trial (RCT).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par49">It is evident that the &#x02018;Dementia Game&#x02019; shows promise as an educational tool to improve attitudes towards dementia, particularly among individuals who lack prior training and/or experience in the field. Additionally, participant feedback highlights the positive experience of those who engaged with the game and provides suggestions for improvements which may be considered to enhance the game. Future research may benefit from increased sample size of a more ethnically diverse population and exploration of the long-term impacts of the game.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dementia Singapore for their support in study recruitment.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors have agreed the final version of this paper and agree to be accountable for the findings.
