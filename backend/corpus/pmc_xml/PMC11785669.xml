In the USA alone, the incidence is now almost 300,000 new cancers per year, a rate that has nearly doubled in the last 30&#x000a0;years. Most women survive, but over 40,000 women a year still die of their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. It is the most diagnosed cancer among women and the second leading cause of cancer death. Important disparities exist in breast cancer outcomes among African American women, where women die of breast cancer at higher rates, are diagnosed younger, and at a more advanced stage. We are proposing a radical shift in our thinking about breast cancer prevention&#x000a0;with an aspiration to dramatically lower breast cancer&#x000a0;incidence. Most breast cancers are driven by steroid hormones. Throughout the life course, women are offered an array of hormonal treatments for menstrual cycle control, family planning, in vitro fertilization, postpartum weaning, and menopausal symptom management. There are mixed data on the extent to which each of these may contribute to increased or decreased risk for breast cancer. These endocrine manipulations could represent a great opportunity to potentially reduce breast cancer incidence and improve quality of life for survivors. To date, they have not been designed to explicitly reduce breast cancer risk. A new holistic approach will require scientists, drug developers, breast oncologists, obstetricians, gynecologists, endocrinologists,&#x000a0;radiologists, and family medicine/internists to work together toward the common goal of reducing breast cancer risk while addressing other&#x000a0;critical issues in women&#x02019;s health.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer risk</kwd><kwd>Hormonal interventions</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A critical and yet untapped approach to reducing breast cancer incidence could come from redesigning the routine hormonal interventions most women use at some point of their lives for symptom amelioration or cycle control, as opportunities to improve breast health. These medical interventions can support broader efforts that are also needed to promote the healthy environments and lifestyles associated with greater health span.</p><p id="Par3">We use endocrine modulation for cycle control, contraception, fertility preservation, and menopause symptom management,&#x000a0;as well as to treat breast cancer and prevent recurrence. Existing methods are often at odds with each other. For example, the most common forms of menopausal hormone therapy treat symptoms well but increase the risk of breast cancer by a small amount [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Agents such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors reduce breast cancer recurrence and incidence, but cause side effects, though dose reductions in tamoxifen have now been found effective for prevention with minimal side effects. Could a more nuanced and targeted approach to endocrine modulation achieve women's health aims while reducing the risk of breast cancer? This enticing opportunity is a clarion call for urgent investment in research and development&#x000a0;to incorporate breast cancer interception and prevention in all aspects of women&#x02019;s health.</p><p id="Par4">By bringing all the relevant fields together, we can reconceptualize our approach to women&#x02019;s health. Starting from the lens of reducing the incidence of breast cancer, we can then broaden the perspective to improve options for women over the course of the many junctures where hormonal and lifestyle interventions are often considered. Here, we will:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par5">Review advances in breast cancer tumor profiling and personalization of therapy;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par6">Reimagine screening as part of a larger effort to reduce risk, where risk assessment can personalize both risk reduction and screening;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7">Review opportunities to incorporate risk reduction strategies into hormonal product design and management, as well as strategies to shorten the product development cycle;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Identify opportunities to take lessons from breast cancer prevention back full circle to safely improve the quality of life of survivors of breast cancer;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">Work to reduce misinformation about hormonal products and increase investment in generating relevant data to advance the field and our stated goals of reducing breast cancer incidence while also addressing hormonal management needs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Convene an interdisciplinary group of&#x000a0;clinicians and scientists as well as regulators and drug and investors&#x000a0;to design,&#x000a0;develop and test new products that will work for symptom amelioration and&#x000a0;breast cancer prevention and&#x000a0;envision a new women's health initiative.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par10">Cross-disciplinary collaboration is necessary to achieve such a paradigm shift. Our goal is to engage all women&#x02019;s health providers&#x000a0;(primary care, OBGYN, endocrinology, breast oncologists),&#x000a0;scientists pharmaceutical&#x000a0;developers, regulatory agencies, and advocates in this effort. Breast cancer is not one disease&#x02014;we do not treat it that way and we should not screen for it as if it is one disease or as if all women have the same risk. By the same token, all estrogens and progestogens are not equal and the products that we tested 20&#x000a0;years ago that were shown to increase the risk of breast cancer have also changed. The breast oncology community should both welcome and lead research that can reduce risk of recurrence and yet also reduce side effects that could improve the lives of cancer survivors. Together, we can better inform ourselves and our patients. We need continued and committed innovation to better design hormonal products that are designed to both reduce breast cancer risk and alleviate the litany of adverse symptoms women and survivors of breast cancer experience from current risk-reducing interventions, as well as hormonal changes across the life course (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Opportunities to reduce the incidence and mortality of breast cancer with a holistic approach to women&#x02019;s health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10549_2024_7522_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">We can take inspiration from our colleagues in cardiology, where a concerted effort to bring down the death rate from cardiac disease transitioned into routine risk assessment and management as part of primary care. The landmark 1945 Framingham study was the start of this revolution in cardiac care and provides a useful reminder of what can be accomplished: connecting risk assessment to modifiable risk factors, like blood pressure and cholesterol, transformed the field. These surrogate endpoints led to the development of risk-reducing agents and lifestyle intervention programs&#x000a0;applied in the primary care setting, resulting in lower cardiovascular disease mortality. Over the past 70&#x000a0;years, risk tools and intermediate markers have been refined to great effect. The risk of dying from coronary heart disease has now fallen 60% since the 1960s, largely because of these advances in prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A similar prevention path is possible for breast cancer. The challenge in breast cancer is that multiple commonly used&#x000a0;hormonal medications used to improve women&#x02019;s quality of life may increase breast cancer risk, making it more challenging to achieve our goal. However, as we better understand the ecosystem of estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and glucocorticoid receptors and explicitly look for opportunities to strike the right balance, we just might achieve both a revolution in prevention and improve the quality of life of women,&#x000a0;including survivors of breast cancer. In short, we should aspire to radically alter the negative impact of breast cancer&#x000a0;by adopting&#x000a0;a longitudinal approach that incorporates&#x000a0;risk reduction&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;symptom management&#x000a0;across the course of a&#x000a0;woman's life.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Section&#x000a0;1: we have made significant progress in better understanding tumor biology and tailoring subsequent treatments</title><p id="Par12">In the past several decades, enormous progress has been made in characterizing the biology and heterogeneity of breast cancer. There are many types of breast cancer, spanning a range of aggressiveness and recurrence risk. At its most basic, tumors are classified as hormone receptor (HR) negative/positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor-positive/negative. Based on both natural history and long-term trial outcomes, HR-positive tumors are generally considered slower growing, but have a risk of distant recurrence that extends for many years; HR-negative and HER2&#x02009;+&#x02009;cancers are generally faster growing, their recurrence risk largely confined to the 5&#x000a0;years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Improved tumor classification beyond HR and HER2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] has led to the development of targeted therapies, including immune-directed therapies in combination with antibody&#x02013;drug conjugates or chemotherapy for fast-growing immune-driven tumors (HR&#x02009;+&#x02009;and HR&#x000a0;&#x02212;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These targeted therapies have revolutionized how we treat breast cancer, leading to greater response and higher survival rates. We have learned that some HR-positive tumors are biologically more like triple-negative tumors. These advances may provide important information about how to develop subtype risk assessment tools and generate prevention interventions and manage the treatment of survivors of breast cancer.</p><p id="Par14">One of the important advances that has accelerated progress in finding better therapies is the development of early endpoints for trials. When systemic therapy is sequenced before surgery (neoadjuvant) for fast-growing (molecularly high risk) stage 2 and 3 cancers, response to treatment can be measured using MRI and pathology, and these endpoints predict 3- and 5-year survival, with a hazard rate of 0.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Neoadjuvant therapy allows a more personalized treatment approach, and the ability to reduce the extent of surgery, radiation and adjuvant therapy. Using the intact tumor to measure response, we provide patients and their clinicians the ability to forecast how they will do at 3 to 6&#x000a0;months, rather than waiting for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years after all patients have completed accrual to the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Over the last 15&#x000a0;years, the pCR rates have gotten higher, presaging the reduction in mortality from aggressive breast cancer. Patients with hormone-responsive tumors need different therapeutic approaches than immune-driven tumors.</p><p id="Par15">Endocrine therapy is the main intervention for hormone-positive tumors. Selective endocrine receptor modulators like tamoxifen are given in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women, largely due to concerns about small increases in uterine cancer (1.5% additional risk) and blood clots in older women, though lower doses of tamoxifen may abrogate that risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For women with aggressive hormone-positive tumors, ovarian suppression and aromatase inhibitors (lowering total estrogen exposure) have significantly better outcomes, leading to concerns about any endocrine replacement in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Tumor biology should absolutely inform our approach to screening and prevention and early endpoints accelerate the pace of learning. Germline risk factors, including pathogenic mutations in specific genes and Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) from the many genes we inherit, have emerged as a risk predictors for specific types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Subtype-specific PRS could therefore help us to identify women who would specifically benefit from risk-reducing medications and interventions. Classes of drugs that target BRCA 1 and 2 tumors could eventually be developed for prevention in mutation carriers. Boosting immunity or vaccines could be considered for those at risk for immune-driven tumors. The key is to better understand who is at risk for what type of tumor and find ways to measure impact early.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Section&#x000a0;2: reimagine screening as part of a bigger effort to reduce risk, starting with risk assessment first, and using this to personalize both risk reduction and screening</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Our current screening paradigm</title><p id="Par17">Currently, our breast screening program in the USA is a one-size-fits-all approach, assuming that all women are at equal risk of developing cancer, except for those with an inherited mutation where intensive screening is recommended, including annual mammography alternating every 6&#x000a0;months with annual MRI. Despite constantly shifting guidelines, annual mammography starting at 40 has remained the standard of care in the USA for over four decades regardless of one&#x02019;s personal risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. One of the shortcomings of this screening approach is that most aggressive cancers are not caught early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given we know breast cancers are not all the same and that risk factors differ among women, it does not make sense to screen as if everyone is the same. As with treatment, a more personalized approach to screening may be just as safe and more beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Trials of these new approaches are in progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">For women at very high risk, especially in the setting of extremely dense breast tissue, contrast-based imaging is clearly superior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However,&#x000a0;breast density should not be the only criteria for determining who receives supplemental screening, as 50% of women have BIRADS C and D density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Contrast-based imaging can cause harm because it is expensive, as it has a large copay for most women, and has a high false-positive rate which can be stressful. There is clearly room for improvement in how we identify who is most likely to benefit from MRI screening. For example, even though guidelines recommend that women with a lifetime risk of 20% receive MRI screening, there is little data to support this&#x000a0;improves outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Fortunately, other alternatives are in development that may be better for higher risk women. These include contrast enhanced mammography and fast MRI. These should reduce the cost and time and possibly false-positives and should be studied. As well, new imaging-based tools may be able to find the 10% of women with dense breast tissue that truly have high risk and warrant additional screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Tools for predicting breast cancer risk</title><p id="Par19">Risk assessment has advanced significantly in the past decade. Several risk prediction models are available. Most include clinical risk factors&#x000a0;like onset of menses, parity, family history, weight, and breast biopsy history. Many include breast density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and some include rare coding variants in susceptibility genes and polygenic risk scores (PRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Also emerging are artificial intelligence models that use mammographic features, including density, to predict risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Breast cancer risk calculation, however, is not a routine part of clinical practice. Nor have the mammographic AI risk tools been integrated with the PRS and other risk models. There is much work to be done and an opportunity to significantly improve forecasting of both lifetime and short-term risk. Risk assessment, and the identification of high-risk individuals, is critical to designing effective, targeted interventions to prevent breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Studies of personalized risk assessment and current gaps</title><p id="Par20">The WISDOM study (Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of risk) uses a tripartite risk assessment, assessing participants' risk by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model (BCSC) considering clinical and demographic risk factors, a PRS, and moderate- and high-penetrance germline mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. WISDOM, the largest personalized screening trial in the USA, has demonstrated that population-based germline testing as part of breast cancer screening is both feasible and acceptable. Genetic testing is done once, can be less expensive than a mammogram and identifies women with the highest lifetime risk of cancer, and is a better way to assess the presence of an inherited mutation than family history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The goal is to assign, assess, and improve screening guidance (when to start, how often to screen, and what modality to use) based on risk and breast density. The MyPeBS study in Europe is also testing risk-based screening in a study covering seven countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The heterogeneity of breast cancer is such that prevention and treatment strategies would ideally be tailored to the type of cancer likely to develop, but to accomplish this, we must upgrade our risk prediction tools. Most risk models today predict those who are at risk for slower growing, hormone-positive cancer, rather than faster growing cancers, because the former are the most common cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, we need to improve our ability to screen for and intercept faster growing tumors, as they pose higher short-term mortality risk. WISDOM 2.0 is the next iteration of a personalized risk assessment and tailored screening and prevention, by&#x000a0;integrating subtype-specific PRS scores as well as mammographic AI and assessing the impact of proposed changes in screening to the population at large. WISDOM 2.0 is open to women aged 30&#x02013;75 without prior breast cancer diagnosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thewisdomstudy.org/">https://www.thewisdomstudy.org/</ext-link>). Genetic testing can be done at any age. If we are going to look for mutation carriers, we should do so before they have the period of highest risk, which is in their 30s. We need better tools to&#x000a0;predict who is at risk for what type of cancer, that are generalizable across all populations, which is&#x000a0;a primary goal of WISDOM 2.0.</p><p id="Par22">We also need to ensure models are generalizable to all populations, as most models currently have been developed on data obtained from women of European ancestry. Several groups are working on developing models that better predict who is at risk for what type of cancer across all racial and ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Provider education, the use of risk assessment tools in clinic, &#x00026; standardized recommendations</title><p id="Par23">A small percentage (estimated to be 18% in 2019) of OBGYNs, primary care doctors, and radiologists (the primary providers who provide breast cancer screening recommendations) currently use risk assessment tools in their practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. There are no standardized recommendations of which model to use, which can lead to uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Studies such as WISDOM are generating data using comprehensive risk assessment based on tumor type to determine if a standardized personalized risk assessment, screening and risk-reducing recommendations alters prevention choices and reduces risk.

This could also provide options for symptom amelioration for all women, including those who are at high risk or have a prior history of breast cancer. This is a critical imperative that we should embrace.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par51">A paradigm shift in women&#x02019;s health care that optimizes for reproductive autonomy, symptom management through pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal phases and actively pursues breast cancer prevention across the life course is possible and integral to driving down the persistently high rate of breast cancer. A concerted, integrated effort on breast cancer risk reduction could make an enormous impact on reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Tools exist to identify high-risk individuals, and there are ongoing studies to improve the prediction of who is at risk for what type of cancer. This will hopefully lead to tailored interventions for both screening and prevention. An important opportunity could lie in the redesign of drugs used for hormonal control across a woman&#x02019;s lifetime. We should aspire to make routine hormonal interventions that reduce the&#x000a0;risk of incident and recurrent&#x000a0;breast cancer. Such products would have the potential to optimize for breast cancer prevention and improve the quality of life of survivors and maybe further reduce the risk of recurrence. This is a cause with potentially profound impact and&#x000a0;is too&#x000a0;tantalizing an opportunity for us not to embrace.
