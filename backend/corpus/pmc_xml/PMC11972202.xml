Comparison was made to a similar cohort group undergoing offset correction without application of bone wax, including 479 patients between 01/2008 and 12/2012. Out of the study group, six hips in five patients presented with persisting pain and growing osteolysis on the X-rays in the area of the offset correction, and two underwent subsequent revision surgery. None of the patients in the cohort group presented with osteolysis. In both groups, patients who presented with persisting pain without radiological osteolysis had other determinable causes as labral tears, progressing osteoarthritis, trochanteric bursitis, and adhesions as suggested source of the pain. We measured the relative area of the osteolysis where present (area of osteolysis/area of femoral head in %) on lateral radiographs on the first postoperative X-rays and latest follow-up X-rays, with a mean follow-up time of 8.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5 years (range, 5&#x02013;13 years).

Due to its effectiveness in haemostatic control, bone wax has found widespread use in several surgical disciplines (e.g. orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, ophthalmologic surgery and maxillofacial surgery). Though bone wax achieves good bony haemostasis, complications after its use have been reported. Foreign body granuloma as a complication of non-absorbable bone wax has not only occured in orthopaedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] but also in thoracic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], neurosurgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], ophthalmologic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and oral surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All these disciplines reported cases of foreign body granuloma and bone wax-associated complications such as non-union and infections of sternotomies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], nerve compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and inflammatory reactions due to foreign body granuloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Osteolysis has not been reported as a complication of bone wax in the literature so far, but it is a known complication of foreign body granuloma and inflammatory reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In surgical hip dislocation for femoroacetabular impingement surgery, non-absorbable bone wax, consisting of beeswax, paraffin and isopropyl palmitate has been used to stop the profuse bleeding which usually occurs after resection of the cam deformity at the femoral head-neck junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Even though there are known complications of the surgical hip dislocation (trochanteric bursitis with 12.5%, heterotopic ossifications grades 1&#x02013;4 according to Brooker with 6.8%, adhesions with about 6%, wound haematoma/infection with about 2% and trochanteric fixation failure with 1&#x02013;1.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]), osteolysis has not been one of the mentioned complications until now. As we observed focal osteolysis after the application of non- absorbable bone wax in some of our orthopaedic patients after surgical hip dislocation for femoroacetabular impingement surgery, we wanted to assess the rate and progression of osteolysis after the application of bone wax.</p><p id="Par9">We therefore asked (1) what is the rate of osteolysis and (2) is there a progression of osteolysis over time?</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p id="Par10">We performed a retrospective case series on patients after offset correction due to cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. </p><p id="Par11">Impingement, notching, infection, and metal corrosion are known causes of osteolysis. In patients after successful correction of femoroacetabular impingement, none of these causes are usually present. Therefore, we chose this patient group for analysis to prevent bias from other causes of osteolysis. Every observed osteolysis in these patients was considered to be related to bone wax. We did not include other surgical techniques, indications or surgical sites to provide statistical comparability. Our surgical technique consisted of a surgical hip dislocation with a digastric trochanteric osteotomy, performed in the lateral decubitus position. The cam-type femoroacetabular impingement was then addressed with a round high-speed burr and, in the earlier years (first study group) non-absorbable bone wax was applied on the bleeding bone at the area of the offset correction. The control study group underwent the same procedure but without application of bone wax. The use of non-absorbable bone wax was the in-house standard at the time when the first patient group was operated on but was later abandoned.</p><p id="Par12">We included all patients from our institutional database that underwent offset correction at femoroacetabular impingement surgery between 01/2002 and 12/2006, with at this time routinely performed application of non-resorbable bone wax (Ethicon, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey US) and compared them with a second group who underwent offset correction at femoroacetabular impingement surgery without application of non-absorbable bone wax at our orthopaedic department between 01/2008 and 12/2012, after we abandoned the routine application of bone wax for this procedure in 2007. The local ethics commission approved the study (KEK 2018-00078). All patients provided oral informed consent.</p><p id="Par13">We identified 571 patients in the group with the application of bone wax. Of those patients, 146 had to be excluded due to incomplete follow-up, previous operations, incomplete offset correction or trauma, which could lead to bias regarding the cause of osteolysis. In total, we included 425 patients in the group with bone wax application. The patients had a mean age of 29 &#x000b1; 9 (20 - 48) years at offset correction. In the second group without the application of bone wax, we identified 617 patients. Of those patients, 138 had to be excluded due to incomplete follow-up, previous operations, incomplete offset correction, or trauma. The included 479 patients had a mean age of 27 &#x000b1; 10 (16 - 44) years at offset correction. Cross-table lateral hip radiographs were obtained according to a standardized technique. The patient was positioned supine with the leg internally rotated, using a film-focus distance of 1.2&#x000a0;m, and with the central beam directed at the inguinal fold. The mean total X-ray follow-up was 8.6 &#x000b1; 2.5 years (5-13 years) for the study group and 8.4 years &#x000b1; 2.4 years (5-12 years) for the comparison group. To determine the rate of osteolysis, we reviewed all postoperative X-rays of the included patients in both groups. We defined an osteolysis as a loss of bone on follow-up X-rays compared to the initial post-op x-rays in the area of the offset correction. To assess any changes in the size of the focal osteolysis, we measured the relative area of the osteolysis as a quotient in % (area of the osteolysis in mm&#x000b2; / area of the femoral head in mm&#x000b2; *100) on the standardized cross-table lateral hip radiographs with OsiriX (Pixmeo, SARL, Bernex, Switzerland). The programme calculated the measured area in mm&#x000b2; based on the outlines of the area, which were defined and controlled by two of the authors. We then compared the first quotient after the operation with the quotient from the last follow-up. We used a quotient with the femoral head as a size reference, as the images were not all calibrated at this time.</p><p id="Par14">Statistical Analysis was performed with SPSS Version 1.0.0.1406 using the Wilcoxon paired test and the Fisher&#x000b4;s exact test for statistical testing.

This difference was found to be significant, with a p-value of 0.0106, by using Fisher&#x000b4;s exact test.

</p><p id="Par18">All six of the cases with osteolysis had persistent pain, and two needed revision surgery due to the growing osteolysis and persistent pain. We found the patients with osteolysis on the X-rays to have a presentation with dull pain with movement and while resting. The pain was described differently to the previous preoperative pain due to impingement and was first described in 3 of the hips after 3 months. It was present in all six hips after one year after the operation. One revision was a hip arthroscopy with debridement because a soft tissue mass was forming in the area of the osteolysis, and the other was a conversion to a total hip prosthesis as the osteolysis was expanding into the cartilage area and the patient chose a hip replacement after a discussion of the surgical possibilities. In the latter, the femoral head was taken for histopathological examination.</p><p id="Par19">There, we found bone wax persisting as a foreign body 9 years after application at femoroacetabular impingement surgery. The bone wax particles were surrounded by foreign body granuloma with the typical cell findings of polynuclear giant cells, different types of mononuclear cells and fibroblasts, consistent with aseptic osteolysis. There were no other unusual findings which could explain the osteolysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A-D).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]); compressing the optic nerve in the orbit (Katz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]); after offset correction (Lavigne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]); after laminectomy at the lumbar spine in the disc space (Ozdemir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]); at the cerebellopontine angle (Patel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]); and at a cranial defect (Wolvius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]), but no study has reported osteolysis as a side effect of bone wax yet, though studies exist, that suggest bone wax can suppress new bone formation in the resection area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Vestergaard et al. showed in a porcine model that bony healing was delayed, and fracture strength and calcification were lower after the application of bone wax compared to application of a water-soluble polymer wax. Looking at the findings of foreign body reaction and osteolysis in the context of basic research, a possible relationship between the two phenomena can be assumed. A foreign body reaction leads to a high number of multinucleated foreign body giant cells, macrophages, as well as to the expression of collagenases and proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Synovial tissue seems to be prone to generate this reaction. In addition, a generalized synovitis with lympho-plasmatic infiltration was reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Especially the macrophages release pro-inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and many others after phagocytosis of foreign bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This inflammation can finally lead to chondrolysis, bone resorption, and end stage osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Proteases released during this inflammatory process are mainly responsible for damaging the cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, a constant phagocytic reaction and release of lytic enzymes eventually results in constantly increasing osteolysis through osteoclast activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The final result is a fulminant inflammation with cartilage and bone destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The bone loss is also a result of a high count of osteoclasts, which differentiate from macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Given that macrophages are very important in the genesis of destructive osteoarthritis and the fact that they are found in very high counts in foreign body reactions, it suggests that those types of cells have osteodestructive effects, which can cause osteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. According to the literature, the clinical presentation of foreign body granuloma ranges from incidental findings to persistent pain. In our study group with the application of bone wax, we found the patients with osteolysis on the X-rays presented with dull pain during movement and while resting. Both in the bone wax group and in the control group, also other patients reported ongoing pain after the operation, but none of them showed signs of osteolysis. Additionally, all those patients had other identifiable causes for the pain (progressing osteoarthritis, labral tears, trochanteric bursitis, and adhesions). The clinical consequence of osteolysis in the neck of the femur after offset correction seems to be, first and foremost, pain with exercise and at rest. A progressive osteoarthritis due to cartilage and bone damage seems likely. A higher risk for femoral neck fractures, especially in case of trauma, might be possible for osteolysis located in the femoral neck area as in this study. Overall, the clinical consequence of osteolysis due to bone wax is hard to determine and seems to be a rare complication. However, bone wax is widely used at different locations in orthopaedic surgery, and other surgical specialties use bone wax in various indications but for the same purpose of local hemostasis. Therefore, we assume that our results also apply to other operations, surgical sites, and specialties. Bone wax can be divided into absorbable and non-absorbable types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. When comparing the literature, most of the reported complications occurred with the usage of non-absorbable bone wax or were not classified further. We acknowledge limitations to this study. First, it is a retrospective case series with the observation of a rare complication. Second, the radiographic imaging of the osteolysis was done by X-rays and not by 3D imaging at that time and therefore has a lower accuracy than 3D imaging, such as a CT scan might have had.</p><p id="Par28">Furthermore, we were only able to obtain a histopathological sample of one of those six hips. Therefore, we cannot say that the other five osteolysis we observed were also directly related to a foreign body granuloma. Most of the reported cases of foreign body granuloma in the literature were diagnosed clinically and histopathologically only in cases of revision surgery, so possible osteolysis without complications could have been missed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par29">This study suggests that osteolysis due to a long-lasting foreign body reaction might be a rare complication after the application of non-absorbable bone wax during FAI surgery.</p><p id="Par30">Surgeons should be cautious when using bone wax and be well aware of the possible side effects. To avoid this problem, the application of non- absorbable bone wax or the use of other haemostatics should be considered thoroughly. If the type of bone wax used makes a difference remains subject to further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We do not have any acknowledgements.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
