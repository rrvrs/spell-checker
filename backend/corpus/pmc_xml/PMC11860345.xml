Data were collected by the completion of the questionnaire &#x0201c;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for children&#x0201d; by Ch. Spielberger. Statistical package S.P.S.S. was used for statistical analysis. 22 and the statistical test,&#x000a0;t-test and anova. The significance level was set at p &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec1960"><title>Results</title><p>Of the total sample, sarcoma 38%, brain Ca 14%, 48% endocrine problem, and the largest percentage (57%) were aged 8-10 years. Children with cancer in 44.6% were under treatment and 55.4% in remission or recovery. Body image change was experienced by the 44%. The mean value of the state anxiety was 30.3&#x000b1;5.4 and trait was 35.3&#x000b1;6.9. Children with cancer experienced lower levels of state anxiety compared to control group, p =0.049, and did not differed in terms of trait anxiety, p=0.060. In the total sample, girls experienced trait anxiety of the highest intensity, p=0.018 and children aged 14-16, p=0.020. No statistically significant differences were found in relation to the type of cancer in both state and trait anxiety, p=0.096 and p=0.424, in relation to the phase of the disease and the change of body image, p&#x0003e;0.05. Children whose fathers were of higher education experienced less anxiety and differed significantly from those of primary and secondary education, p=0.036 and p=0.021, respectively. Comparison between control group and study group in relation to gender, showed that girls with cancer experienced trait anxiety of higher intensity, p=0.029 but children between 14-16 years from the control group experienced trait anxiety of higher intensity, p=0.030.</p></sec><sec id="sec1961"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Children of both groups experienced mild to moderate anxiety and its intensity was related to socio-demographic factors of the children and their parents.</p></sec><sec id="sec1962"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
