Despite demonstrating safety and immunogenicity when administered intramuscularly, LaAg has failed to show efficacy in clinical trials and, in some cases, has even been associated with an enhanced susceptibility to infection. Adjuvants, which are molecules or compounds added to antigens to enhance the immunogenicity or modulate the immune response, are frequently employed in vaccine studies. This study aimed to evaluate different adjuvants to improve the protective efficacy of LaAg in <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> infection using a BALB/c mouse model. Methods: BALB/c mice were immunized with LaAg in combination with various adjuvants. The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) test was assessed by measuring the infected paw and was used to evaluate the immunogenicity and to determine the most effective adjuvant. The immune response was analyzed through flow cytometry, focusing on cytokine production, immune cell recruitment and lesion size, alongside the control of parasite load at the infection site. The expression levels of iNOS and TGF-&#x003b2; were quantified using RT-qPCR, while IgG1, IgG2a and IgE antibody levels were determined via ELISA. Results: Among the adjuvants tested, only saponin (SAP) elicited a significant DTH response following LaAg challenge. SAP enhanced the immunogenicity of LaAg, as evidenced by increased IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the draining lymph nodes at 18 h post-challenge. Additionally, SAP facilitated the recruitment of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils to the infection site. Conclusions: The LaAg + SAP combination conferred partial protection, as demonstrated by a reduction in lesion size and the partial control of parasite load. In conclusion, the addition of SAP as an adjuvant to LaAg effectively modulates the immune response, enhancing the vaccine&#x02019;s protective efficacy. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of improved vaccines against <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic></kwd><kwd>saponin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)</funding-source><award-id>203.426/2023</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq), Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES) and Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) grant number 203.426/2023.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00129"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Leishmaniasis is one of the major neglected tropical diseases. It is caused by at least 20 parasitic species of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> which are transmitted between mammalian hosts by female sandflies. Two main clinical forms can be found as follows: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Today, more than 1 billion people live in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic and are at risk of infection. An estimated 50,000 to 90,000 new cases of VL and 600,000 to 1 million new cases of CL occur annually [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Treatment of leishmaniasis relies on a few chemotherapeutic agents, such as pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B, miltefosine, paromomycin and pentamidine, most of which are parenteral in use and induce severe adverse effects. Furthermore, rates of treatment failure are high and have been linked to drug resistance [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While Ambisome<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (liposomal amphotericin B) has demonstrated unparalleled efficacy in recent years, its high cost per dose limits its widespread use, particularly in endemic regions [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Presently, there is no ideal vaccine or drug to eradicate leishmaniasis.</p><p>Currently, the vaccines against leishmaniasis that are being studied can be divided into first-, second- and third-generation vaccines. First-generation vaccines are composed of killed or attenuated microorganisms, or even uncharacterized mixtures of antigens. Second-generation vaccines can be composed of defined subunits. Third-generation vaccines are genetic vaccines using DNA or RNA platforms, composed of the gene of the disease-causing agent that encodes an immunogenic antigen [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Leishvacin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a first-generation vaccine developed in Brazil for human use, is composed in the first moment of the promastigote lysates of five strains of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> and then selects one strain of <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic>. Although phase I clinical studies have attested to its safety [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and phase II clinical studies have attested to its immunogenicity [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the use of this vaccine was discontinued due to its lack of efficacy in phase III clinical studies carried out in Colombia based on the incidence of individuals that developed CL caused by <italic toggle="yes">L.panamensis</italic> (7.7% in the vaccinated group versus 6.8% in the placebo group) [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It was previously demonstrated that the intramuscular vaccination of BALB/c mice with a total lysate of <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> (LaAg) results in an increased susceptibility to CL [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, oral vaccination with LaAg protects BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice against CL [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the intrahepatic route has shown inefficiency in generating a robust immune response, making it a less favorable method for inducing protective immunity against CL in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides the vaccination route, vaccine effects can be improved from the association of antigens with adjuvants.</p><p>Adjuvants may increase the immunogenicity of antigens stimulating protective immunity based on antibody production and the induction of effector T cells, while also causing less toxicity or longer lasting immunological effects [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Various adjuvants have been researched for leishmaniasis vaccines, with some already used in existing vaccines. Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant, although potent, is known for its toxicity and is not widely used in human vaccines. Aluminum hydroxide (Alum) is one of the most commonly used adjuvants due to its safety profile and effectiveness in inducing a TH2 response, although it may be less effective for intracellular pathogens like <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Addavax&#x02122;, a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion similar to MF59, has shown promise in enhancing both antibody and T cell responses. Saponin-based adjuvants, like QS-21, have also been explored for their ability to stimulate a strong Th1 response, which is crucial for protection against <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infection [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Montanide ISA, another oil-based adjuvant, has been used in various experimental vaccines due to its ability to enhance both cellular and humoral responses. Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA), a detoxified derivative of lipopolysaccharide, has been used to boost the immune response by activating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and promoting a Th1 response, which is particularly beneficial for vaccines against intracellular pathogens [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>As demonstrated in several studies, for example, using <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> antigens, specifically <italic toggle="yes">L.braziliensis</italic> combined with saponin, is a vaccination strategy that has led to significant improvements in both homologous and heterologous challenge protection and has resulted in a reduced parasite load during the course of infection. Effective control has been achieved, associated with a robust cellular response compatible with effective parasite control. Thus, our objective was to evaluate whether the association of LaAg with different adjuvants could induce protection, and to characterize the protection mechanism of the most effective combination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00129"><title>2.

Briefly, stationary-growth phase promastigotes were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. Lysis was evaluated by observing the absence of whole parasites under the microscope. The protein concentration was assessed using the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). LaAg was lyophilized, stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C and reconstituted with PBS immediately prior to use.</p><p>Intramuscular vaccination (I.M.): BALB/c mice were vaccinated with LaAg alone (100 &#x003bc;g) or in combination with different adjuvants: CFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (80 &#x000b5;L/dose), Saponin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (SAP), Riedel de Haen&#x02019;s (100 &#x003bc;g/dose) or AddaVax&#x02122; (Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) (50 &#x000b5;L/dose) and PBS (100 &#x000b5;L&#x02014;control group). Mice received two doses of the vaccine by the intramuscular route (quadriceps muscle), with an interval of 7 days between them. After determining the association that generated the greatest cutaneous hypersensitivity response (using a caliper), we decided to investigate only the LaAg + SAP association. Thereafter, BALB/c mice (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5 animals per group) were immunized by the intramuscular route with two doses in 100 &#x003bc;L LaAg (100 &#x003bc;g in PBS), SAP (100 &#x003bc;g in PBS) or LaAg + SAP (100 &#x003bc;g of LaAg + 100 &#x003bc;g of SAP in PBS), or 100 &#x003bc;L of PBS (control group), with an interval of 7 days between the two doses. The same protocol of vaccination and infection was followed for experiments of immunogenicity, immunomodulation and efficacy. In the immunogenicity experiments, mice were euthanized 3 days after the second vaccine dose; in immunomodulation experiments, euthanasia occurred 18 h after infection/challenge (peak of hypersensitivity) and in experiments of vaccine efficacy, the development of the lesion was monitored until day 50, when the animals were euthanized.</p><p>Challenge with LaAg or <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic>: To conduct immunomodulation and vaccine efficacy experiments, seven days after the second vaccine dose, the animals were challenged with either LaAg (10 &#x003bc;g) or stationary-phase <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> promastigotes (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) in 10 &#x003bc;L of PBS on the right footpad, using a 50 &#x003bc;L microsyringe (Hamilton, CA, USA) and Ultrafine needle (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).</p><p>Evaluation of vaccine efficacy: The vaccine efficacy was evaluated by lesion progression and parasitic load analysis. After immunization and challenge, lesion sizes were measured once a week with a thickness gauge (Mitutoyo 7301) and expressed as the difference between the thicknesses of infected and contralateral non-infected footpads. The parasite load was determined at the end of the experiment (day 50), when the infected footpad was removed and individually homogenized in 1 mL of PBS using a tissue grinder. Tissue debris was eliminated through a 5 min gravity sedimentation process. Homogenates were submitted to limited dilution assay (LDA), in which the dilutions of the supernatants were plated in triplicates on a 96-well black plate. Analysis of the parasite load was also performed on infected footpads by fluorometry [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the fluorescence intensity was read in a BIO TEK plate fluorimeter at excitation and emission wavelengths of 435 nm and 538 nm, respectively. The parasite load was considered directly proportional to the fluorescence of the macerate [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Vascular permeability: BALB/c mice previously immunized with two doses of LaAg + SAP or the PBS control received the Evans blue dye (20 mg/kg) through the orbital plexus one hour before infection. The mice were euthanized 18 h after the infection and the footpads were removed. The intact footpads were weighed, incubated in formamide (4 mL/g of footpad) for 24 h at room temperature and then the spectrophotometer was read at 650 nm. The data obtained reflected the subtraction of the reading from the infected footpads by the uninfected footpads.</p><p>Histology: BALB/c mice were euthanized 18 h after infection and the footpads were sectioned uniformly to obtain the histological sections. The infected footpads were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde and decalcified in 14% EDTA. Sections of 4 &#x003bc;m were made, followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin and finally cell counting.</p><p>Real time PCR (RT-qPCR): Relative quantifications of the mRNA transcripts of TGF-&#x003b2; and iNOS were made using RT-qPCR. The footpads were incubated in 4 M guanidine solution and macerated in a tissue homogenizer (Ika Company, NC, USA). To the homogenized material was added the 0.1 time (2 M) volume of sodium acetate pH4, an equal volume of DEPC phenol and 0.3 times the volume of chloroform. The samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 2000 G/4 &#x000b0;C for 30 min. The aqueous phase, containing the RNA, was transferred to a new tube, where 1.1 times the volume of isopropanol was added. The samples were incubated for 16 h at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C and then centrifuged again at 2000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>/4 &#x000b0;C for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 70% ethanol was added to the pellet. The samples were again centrifuged. To the obtained pellet, water treated with DEPC was added. The total RNA samples obtained were dosed in NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, CA, USA) at 260 nm. For cDNA preparation, 1 &#x003bc;g of RNA was treated with DNAse (2 units, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C, followed by inactivation by the addition of 1 &#x003bc;L of 25 mM EDTA and incubation at 65 &#x000b0;C for 10 min. The SuperScript&#x02122; II Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) was used, containing 1 &#x003bc;L of 50 ng/&#x003bc;L random primer, 1 &#x003bc;L of dNTP mix (10 mM each nucleotide), 4 &#x003bc;L of enzyme buffer, 2 &#x003bc;L of DTT (10 mM) and 1 &#x003bc;L of reverse transcriptase (200 units/&#x003bc;L). The reaction was incubated at 42 &#x000b0;C for 50 min, followed by heat inactivation at 70 &#x000b0;C for 15 min. The cDNA obtained was stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. For each reaction, 1 &#x003bc;L of the cDNA obtained was used, along with 12 &#x003bc;L of SYBR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 2.5 mM of each primer (forward and reverse) and DEPC-treated water in a sufficient quantity for 25 &#x003bc;L of reaction. The primers used were designed with the program Primer Express<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed on the StepOne device (Applied Biosystems) with the StepOne&#x02122; software v2.1 program. The reaction conditions were as follows: 40 cycles at 95 &#x000b0;C/30 s and 60 &#x000b0;C/1 min. &#x003b2;-actin expression was used as the endogenous control and the control group PBS was used as the reference sample for the calculation of relative quantifications (RQ); the &#x003b2;-actin gene is widely recognized for its stability and conservation across different species and experimental conditions, making it a reliable reference gene for normalization in gene expression studies [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The relative quantification was performed using the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method, which assumes 100% efficiency of the qPCR assays [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Antibody detection: The blood collected from animals was centrifuged at 12,000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> in the centrifuge for 20 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet formed was discarded. Serum was used for antibody analysis by ELISA. Then, 1 &#x003bc;g of LaAg was plated overnight in carbonate buffer. After washing and blocking, a serum dilution of 1:250 was employed for all samples. Then, the anti-IgG1, anti-IgG2a and anti-IgE antibodies were employed (1:5000 dilution). After 1 h, streptavidin was added, each well was covered with TMB and the reactions were stopped with sulfuric acid. The reading was performed at 450 nm.</p><p>Flow Cytometry: Popliteal lymph node (draining lymph node) cells were plated (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) in a 96-well round bottom plate. The lymph node cells were cultured for 4 h at 37 &#x000b0;C in the presence of PMA (20 ng/mL, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), Ionomycin (1 &#x003bc;g/mL, Sigma Aldrich) and brefeldin A (5 mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich). The cells were then washed and stained with anti-CD3-PERCP, anti-CD4-PECY7 and anti-CD8-FITC (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA); fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS and 0,02% saponin (permeabilization buffer). Intracellular cytokine staining was performed using anti-IFN-&#x003b3;-APC and either anti-IL10-PE or anti-IL-4-PE (Biolegend) over 1 h. The cells were washed in permeabilization buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 5% fetal calf serum&#x02013;Gibco) for flow cytometry readings (BD FACSCanto&#x02122; II&#x02013;BD Biosciences, NJ, USA). The data were analyzed using the FlowJo X software v10.10.</p><p>Statistical analysis: The experiments were conducted two or three times, with the results from one representative experiment presented. The normal distribution was confirmed using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test, followed by parametric tests such One-way or Two-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni&#x02019;s post-test.

Association of LaAg-Plus-Saponin-Induced Higher Delayed-Hypersensitivity (DTH)</title><p>Initially, in a tentative attempt to make intramuscular LaAg protective, we immunized mice with LaAg alone (100 &#x003bc;g/dose) or in combination with different adjuvants as follows: CFA (80 &#x000b5;L/dose), SAP (100 &#x003bc;g/dose) or AddaVax&#x02122; (50 &#x000b5;L/dose), and PBS was used as a control group, to determine which vaccine formulation induced DTH. BALB/c mice received two doses of the vaccine by the intramuscular route, with an interval of 7 days between them. Seven days after the second dose, the animals were challenged with 10 &#x003bc;g LaAg (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) and/or 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;<italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> promastigotes in the stationary phase (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) in the footpads, and the swelling was measured at 0, 18, 24 and 48 h post-challenge. The challenge with LaAg induced DTH only in the group vaccinated with LaAg + SAP when compared to the PBS control group. The increase in thickness was observed at times of 18, 24 and 48 h (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). The challenge with <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> induced a DTH response in the LaAg + CFA, LaAg + SAP and LaAg + AddaVax&#x02122; groups when compared to the PBS control group, with a peak of DTH at 18 h post-challenge, and the LaAg + SAP group remained the most responsive (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). When the animals were challenged with <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> and, seven days post-infection, challenged with LaAg in the contralateral footpad, the profile was modified indicating that infection modified the cellular response; however, mice immunized with LaAg + SAP continued to be the most responsive (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). As the group of animals vaccinated with LaAg + SAP developed the higher DTH response, we decided to determine the possible protective mechanism of this association, as well as the vaccine efficacy of LaAg + SAP, which will be reported in the topics ahead.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vaccines-13-00129"><title>3.2.

It was observed that the LaAg + SAP vaccine induced cellular lymphoproliferation, with an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but did not induce a difference in the frequency of FoxP3+ Treg cells in the popliteal lymph nodes. Phenotypic analysis of T cells showed that the LaAg + SAP vaccine is capable of inducing IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T cells, and both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C,D) produced more IFN-&#x003b3; in the LaAg + SAP vaccine group than in the PBS control group. The immunogenicity data also showed an increase in IL-10-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G,H), but not IL-10-producing TCD4<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E,F).

The mice were euthanized 18 h after the challenge, the footpads were removed, incubated in formamide for dye extraction and the samples were read in a spectrophotometer at 650 nm. The data obtained demonstrate a greater permeability of tissue in animals previously vaccinated with LaAg + SAP when compared to the PBS control group (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). To assess the cellularity in the site of infection at the peak of DTH, we euthanized the mice 18 h after challenge and the footpads were sectioned uniformly to obtain the histological sections. There was an increase in the cellularity in the animals previously immunized with LaAg + SAP when compared to the control group PBS. The same did not occur with the LaAg or SAP control groups (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). In the LaAg + SAP vaccine group, there was a significant increase in the following cells compared to the PBS group: neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. The exception was mast cells, for which there were no changes between the PBS and LaAg + SAP (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F) groups.

The number of cells counted in Neubauer&#x02019;s camera revealed that in the LaAg + SAP vaccine group there was an increase in cellularity when compared to the PBS control. The same phenomenon did not occur in any other group. FACS labeling revealed that this increase in cell numbers was accompanied by increased numbers of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, corroborating the immunogenicity data showed previously. Phenotypic analysis of popliteal lymph node cells revealed a significant increase in IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,B), and a more significant increase in IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C,D). Although CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were the cells with the greatest expansion when compared to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, it was only the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that produced more IFN-&#x003b3;, while in the LaAg + SAP vaccine group, the IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> was 0.6% and the IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> was 20% (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;D). In addition to the increased participation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the production of IFN-&#x003b3;, these cells also produced other cytokines, such as IL-10 (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>G,H) and IL-4 (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00129-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>K,L) denoting a mixed response of the inflammatory profile after infection, predominantly directed by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

In our study, we assessed the impact of combining LaAg with various adjuvants (CFA, SAP and AddaVax&#x02122;) on DTH responses in BALB/c mice. Only the animals vaccinated with LaAg + SAP exhibited a DTH response after challenge with LaAg, compared to the PBS control group, and showed the highest DTH reaction among all groups evaluated after challenge with <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic>. DTH reactions are correlated with Th1-producing IFN-&#x003b3; and consequently with a protection against infection by <italic toggle="yes">L.infantum</italic> by previous sandfly bites in hamsters [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and dogs [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>A difference in the DTH profile was observed when comparing challenges with LaAg and live <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>. When live <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> was inoculated, a higher DTH response was observed compared to LaAg at 18 h post-infection, suggesting that the parasite modulates the immune response differently from its total antigen; however, using LaAg as challenge in the mice vaccinated with LaAg + SAP, it was observed that there was a higher DTH at 24 and 48 h post-challenge. This indicates that the parasite&#x02019;s escape mechanisms are involved in modulating the cellular response. This observation prompted us to further investigate the underlying mechanisms of DTH and identify the key early events that may be crucial for the vaccine&#x02019;s effectiveness.</p><p>We evaluated the immunogenicity and immunomodulation mechanisms of LaAg + SAP in BALB/c mice. We observed that the LaAg + SAP vaccine induced a cellular response, with an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> and TCD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the popliteal lymph nodes, showing that the protective mechanism was induced by LaAg + SAP. In addition, the LaAg + SAP vaccine was capable of inducing IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>) and decreasing IL-4-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This immune response profile favors the development of a Th1 response, which would be ideal for combating a <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infection.</p><p>Our results corroborate what was seen in an experimental study that evaluated the potential protection of the LbAg + Sap + Sal vaccine in dogs at different time points (0, 90, and 885 days), which induced an increase in type I cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3;) and a reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4) and suppressor cytokines (TGF-&#x003b2;), even after challenge with <italic toggle="yes">L.infantum</italic> [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, our proposed vaccine appears to be a promising tool for controlling infection by both in <italic toggle="yes">L.infantum</italic> [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the homologous challenge.</p><p>Regarding antibodies measured in blood plasma, LaAg + SAP induced an increase in IgG1 and IgG2a, suggesting a mixed Th1- and Th2-type immune response. The lack of a significant increase in IgG1 and IgG2a levels with the addition of SAP compared to the antigen alone may be explained by the high intrinsic immunogenicity of LaAg, which likely elicited a robust humoral response on its own, limiting the observable effect of SAP. Additionally, SAP may predominantly enhance cell-mediated immunity, aligning with the Th1-biased response observed, rather than significantly boosting antibody production. This suggests that SAP&#x02019;s primary role might be in modulating the quality of the immune response rather than increasing antibody titers. The same was seen with formulations with <italic toggle="yes">L.donovani</italic> antigens and homologous challenge, which also induced the serum protection of IgG1 and IgG2a inducted of a mixed Th1/Th2 response after immunization in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Also seen were DTH and the increased production of NO and IFN-&#x003b3; by spleen cells and the downregulation of IL-4, which demonstrates that an initial stimulation of a mixed Th1/Th2 response by vaccination instructs Th1 responses and resistance against a progressive infection [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Likewise, studies with vaccines in nanoformulations with <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or <italic toggle="yes">L.braziliensis</italic> [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with heterologous challenge (<italic toggle="yes">L.infantum</italic>) in a hamster model induced strong antigenicity with increases in total IgG levels; however, there was no correlation with protection.</p><p>The production of IL-10 by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could contribute to controlling the excessive inflammatory response that is associated to tissue damage [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The IL-10 from CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in parasitic diseases has been described as delaying control while generating immunity due to treatments or vaccination [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. According to our data, the increase in IL-10 from these same sources is correlated with the group that was partially protected. Thus, as demonstrated by Grenfell et al. (2010), BALB/c mice immunized with <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L.braziliensis</italic> antigens alone or in combination with SAP exhibited partial protection against the <italic toggle="yes">L.infantum</italic> and showed a significantly reduced production of IL-4 and IL-10 concomitantly [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A high IFN&#x003b3;/IL-10 ratio is generally associated with resistance to <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infections, as IFN&#x003b3; is a marker of Th1 response, which is essential for controlling intracellular parasites. IL-10, on the other hand, is a regulatory cytokine that can suppress the Th1 response, thereby favoring parasite persistence that is essential for protection in Leishmanization [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, maintaining a high IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-10 ratio may be crucial for protection against <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>For the determination of immunomodulation parameters, our strategy was to vaccinate mice with two doses of the vaccine by the intramuscular route, with an interval of 7 days between them. Seven days after the last dose, the animals were challenged with <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> promastigotes. The animals were euthanized 18 h after infection, which corresponded to the peak of DTH. At the site of infection, mice vaccinated with LaAg + SAP showed the following: increased cell permeability; the accumulation of neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and increased mRNA transcripts of iNOS and decreased mRNA transcripts of TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>It has already been described that besides DTH being correlated with protection and the increase of Th1 cytokines, it also enhances NO and reduces visceralization, indicating enduring protection against <italic toggle="yes">L.infantum</italic> infection [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Studies that assessed nitrite levels as a reflection of NO in the serum of vaccinated animals (LbAg + SAP or LbAg + SAP + SGE) demonstrated an increase compared to non-vaccinated groups. This finding corroborates our RT-qPCR data, which also indicated higher levels of mRNA for iNOS in samples from the footpad of vaccinated animals (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that vaccinated and partially protected groups also exhibit elevated levels of iNOS or nitrite [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>A previous study investigated the modulatory response associated with the susceptibility of BALB/c mice. Pre-vaccination with LaAg sensitized these animals for the specific production of IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;. These mice received 25 &#x000b5;g of LaAg or PBS (intramuscularly) at seven-day intervals between the two doses. This increase in TGF-&#x003b2; production was indicated from the supernatant of the draining lymph node cells. However, when anti-TGF-&#x003b2; antibody neutralization was promoted during the LaAg vaccination, there was an improvement in susceptibility, demonstrating the role of TGF-&#x003b2; as a critical factor in disease promotion [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. According to our data, there was a decrease in TGF-&#x003b2; mRNA transcripts in the LaAg + SAP group, supporting the findings of the study that TGF-&#x003b2; participation is important in disease immunomodulation.</p><p>Another study evaluated the mRNA expression of different cytokines crucial for protection or susceptibility to <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infection (IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-4, IL-13, TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10) in the dermis of dogs at several time points (1, 12, 24 and 48 h) after inoculation with the LbSAP vaccine or its components. As a result of these experiments, at 12 h, IL-12 expression in the LbSap group was higher than in the SAP group, and IL-10 expression was also higher in the LbSAP group compared to the SAP group. Additionally, positive correlations were observed between the mRNA expression of type I cytokines (IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3; TNF-&#x003b1;) and type II cytokines in groups inoculated with separate vaccine components and the LbSAP vaccine itself, indicating that cytokines at the infection site play a pivotal role in regulating the immune response concerning protection or susceptibility [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the presence of DTH in the early hours post-challenge provided evidence and confirmation that the cellular population in the microenvironment appears to indeed be associated with protection or susceptibility in the vaccine. In the popliteal lymph nodes, FACS labeling revealed that this increase in cell numbers was accompanied by increased numbers of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, corroborating the immunogenicity data. Still in the draining lymph nodes, it was observed that there was a significant increase in IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and a more significant increase in IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which also corroborates the immunogenicity data. In addition, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also produced IL-10 and IL-4, revealing a mixed Th1 and Th2 profile of these cells. In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not produce IL-4, suggesting a profile more compromised with the Th1 response, which would favor the elimination of the parasite. In addition, it was observed that there was an increase in the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IL-10, which is also positive, since a regulatory profile is also important during leishmaniasis, as an uncontrolled Th1 response is also part of the pathogenesis of this disease. The IL-10 production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also corroborates the immunogenicity data; however, in the immunogenicity experiments, there was a reduction in the frequency and number of IL-4-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, while in the immunomodulation experiments, an increase in the number of IL-4-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed. This fact shows that the infection may be modulating the production of IL-4 by these cells.</p><p>A study that evaluated the expression of cytokines and chemokines in the dermis of dogs vaccinated with LbSAP (Lb, SAP or both together) demonstrated an increase in the mRNA levels of cytokines, specifically IL-10, at 12 and 24 h. Additionally, positive correlations were observed between various cytokine expressions, including IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], suggesting that a diverse cytokine microenvironment developed following immunization with the vaccine. Post-vaccination, all dogs were challenged with <italic toggle="yes">L.infantum</italic> promastigotes and monitored bi-monthly through bone marrow aspirates and blood tests for immune response evaluation. Vaccinated dogs exhibited an enhanced immune response, indicating the potential efficacy of the LbAg vaccine [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], similar to the increased cytokine production observed with the LaAg + SAP vaccine.</p><p>Previously, our group tested MPLA/AddaVax&#x02122; plus LaAg intramuscularly with challenge with <italic toggle="yes">L.amazonensis</italic> (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> or 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) reduced lesion growth only at the peak and only with the lower parasite dose, with no reduction in parasite load. Mice challenged with 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> were not protected by LaAg. Regardless of the parasite challenge, the combination of LaAg with MPLA/AddaVax&#x02122; did not significantly increase protection compared to LaAg alone. MPLA/AddaVax&#x02122; was not effective in enhancing the efficacy of the LaAg vaccine against cutaneous leishmaniasis [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The association of LaAg + SAP, by intramuscular route, reversed the non-protective effect of LaAg alone, reducing the lesion size and parasite burden of previously vaccinated BALB/c mice when compared to the PBS, LaAg and SAP groups, which shows a beneficial effect of using SAP as an adjuvant in the vaccine formulation. The protection mechanism is mainly based on the response of IFN-&#x003b3; -producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the popliteal lymph nodes. At the site of infection, it was observed that there was increased cell permeability, the accumulation of neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and increased mRNA transcripts of iNOS and decreased mRNA transcripts of TGF-&#x003b2;. Altogether, for a deleterious antigen as LaAg, saponin works as a good adjuvant converting a non-protective vaccine into a protective vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00129"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The results indicate that the combination of LaAg with the SAP adjuvant provides significant protection against <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infections, reducing lesions and parasite load in BALB/c mice.
