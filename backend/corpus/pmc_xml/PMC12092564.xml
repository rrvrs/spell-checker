are particularly vulnerable to symptom recurrence and resulting potential lack of
decision-making capacity (Taylor et al. J Psychiatr Res 104:100-107, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>; Bagadia et al. Int J Soc Psychiatry
66:792-798, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). In these situations,
prenatal&#x000a0;and behavioral health providers have little legally viable guidance on what
medical and/or psychiatric care the patient desires (Aneja and Arora Indian J Med
Ethics V:133-139, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). We created a
&#x0201c;Reproductive Psychiatric Advance Directive (PAD),&#x0201d; grounded in Reproductive Justice
principles, that promotes patient autonomy by proactively articulating perinatal
medical and psychiatric care preferences. We conducted a medical and legal
literature review using two sets of terms related to (1) PADs and (2) reproductive
health. We convened an expert working group of legal, medical, psychiatric, peer,
and advocacy leaders and community-based organizations to develop a Reproductive
PAD. Our literature review yielded no results about Reproductive PADs. We created de
novo a Reproductive PAD template with sections on medical and psychiatric history,
informed consent for critical medical and psychiatric care, family planning and
custody preferences, and optional sections on abortion and on electroconvulsive
therapy. The Reproductive PAD provides a possible legal mechanism for people of
childbearing age with SMI diagnoses to articulate their medical and psychiatric care
choices around reproduction and pregnancy. Future research should evaluate the
Reproductive PAD as an effective tool for protecting patient autonomy during
pregnancy and postpartum and guiding medical and psychiatric providers.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at

historically been neglected in both the fields of mental health and reproductive
health care, with disastrous&#x02014;though often preventable&#x02014;outcomes for parents,
pregnancies, infants, families, and communities (Meltzer-Brody and Stuebe
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>). Perinatal suicide ranks as
one of the leading causes of pregnancy-related death, even though the Centers of
Disease Control deemed 100% of previous cases preventable (Trost et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>). Postpartum psychosis is accompanied by
infanticide and suicide rates of 4% and 5%, respectively, and the illness itself
recurs in 30% of subsequent pregnancies without prevention (Bergink et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). Despite the preventability of
both these and other adverse outcomes, people with SMI often fall out of psychiatric
care when they become pregnant, with resulting relapse of symptoms and mental health
crises (Cox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>; Dolman et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Viguera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). Our goals in creating a Reproductive
Psychiatric Advance Directive template are to improve perinatal psychiatric and
medical care, reduce these preventable adverse outcomes, preserve autonomy and
dignity in decision-making, and promote Reproductive Justice for perinatal people
with SMI diagnoses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par3">&#x0201c;Reproductive Justice&#x0201d; combines reproductive rights and social justice
into one movement with three pillars: first, everyone has the right to have a child;
second, everyone has the right <italic>not</italic> to have a
child; and third, everyone has the right to raise a child in a safe, healthy
environment (Ross et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>). The
concept of Reproductive Justice was articulated in Chicago in 1994 by the Women of
African Descent for Reproductive Justice in an effort to include Black voices in the
women&#x02019;s rights movement and expand the reproductive rights conversation beyond an
exclusive focus on abortion access. Since then, the Reproductive Justice movement
has grown to include a wide coalition of marginalized communities, including Black,
LatinX, Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI), LGBTQ&#x02009;+&#x02009;, and people with
disabilities (Sister Song <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">n.d.</xref>), among
others. One notable exception is people with SMI diagnoses, even though they have
experienced the violation of all three pillars of Reproductive Justice throughout
our country&#x02019;s history.</p><p id="Par4">The right for a person with mental illness to have a child was violated
in 1927 in the now-infamous Supreme Court <italic>Buck v.
Bell</italic> trial, which forced a woman inaccurately deemed &#x0201c;feeble-minded&#x0201d;
to undergo a hysterectomy. In establishing that society &#x0201c;can prevent those who are
manifestly unfit from continuing their kind,&#x0201d; the Court upheld the constitutionality
of sterilization for the mentally disabled (Buck v. Bell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1927</xref>). While subsequent law has largely mitigated
this ruling, it has never been formally overturned (McIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The right NOT to have a child is most glaringly violated by the recent
<italic>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x02019;s Health Organization</italic>
Supreme Court decision that overturned 40&#x000a0;years of abortion access. For people with
SMI diagnoses, denial of abortion services is particularly problematic because of
the lack of access to basic contraception and reproductive health care, lower health
literacy, and higher rates of unintended or coerced sex (Miller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>; Miller and Finnerty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>). Statistics bear this out: while the U.S.
rate of unintended pregnancy in the general population hovers around 45%, it is a
striking 65% for women with SMI diagnoses (Schonewille et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Finally, the right to raise a child in a healthy, safe environment is
constantly threatened for parents with SMI diagnoses. Child Protective Services
(CPS) agencies frequently open cases on families simply because of a mental health
diagnosis, even when no other red flags are evident (O&#x02019;Donnell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). This is especially true for Black,
Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities (Hammond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>). Even when CPS is not involved, parents
with mental illness often face significant stigma that contributes to poverty,
under-employment or unemployment, and a lack of social networks and support that
make child-rearing precarious (Dolman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Our approach to addressing these injustices for people of childbearing
age with SMI diagnoses was to develop a template for Psychiatric Advance Directives
(PADs) focused on reproductive health and care choices. In general, a PAD is a
written document that provides individuals with SMI diagnoses the opportunity to
articulate treatment preferences in advance, during times of stability (Murray and
Wortzel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>). The PAD can then be used
during psychiatric crises or when the individual is deemed without capacity&#x000a0;to make
medical decisions to ensure their treatment choices are known and hopefully
respected. A PAD works to protect autonomy and self-determination for people with
SMI diagnoses, as well as to advocate for their psychiatric, medical, and social
assistance choices. PADs have been in existence for years and implemented in several
states (Swanson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>).Our home
state, California, is currently funding a 4-year initiative to develop, launch,
train, and evaluate a PAD in five pilot counties, followed by proposed legislation
to implement it statewide (Ca.gov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">n.d.</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">However, reproductive choices&#x02014;including family planning, pregnancy
continuation versus termination, perinatal mental health care, labor and delivery
options, and custody planning&#x02014;have not been developed for inclusion within a PAD.
Our expert working group aimed to develop a &#x0201c;Reproductive PAD&#x0201d; to remedy this gap,
highlight the reproductive needs of individuals with SMI diagnoses, and prevent
adverse and potentially fatal outcomes, including maternal suicide and infanticide.
An additional goal of developing the Reproductive PAD will be its inclusion in
California&#x02019;s larger PAD initiative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Expert working group and community partners</title><p id="Par9">An expert working group was formed and consisted of (1) a
reproductive psychiatrist with extensive policy background; (2) an attorney with
lived experience and academic and research expertise in mental health law,
policy, and ethics; (3) a policy expert with lived experience with perinatal
mental illness; (4) a maternal&#x02013;fetal medicine physician with expertise in
medical ethics; (5) an attorney and PAD subject matter expert with lived
experience; (6) a subject matter expert on peer specialists and training; and
(7) two trainees, one in law school and one in medical school. The expert
working group also developed a working collaboration with two different peer
community-based organizations. The first was Painted Brain, a community-based
organization that is run by and for peers with SMI diagnoses and promotes
recovery through arts, advocacy, and skills training. Painted Brain is the peer
organization tapped by California to help develop the general PAD as part of its
statewide initiative. The second was Disability Rights California (DRC), an
advocacy group focused on defending and strengthening the rights of people with
disabilities. Specifically, we worked with their Peer Self-Advocacy staff, which
included several members with lived experience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Literature review</title><p id="Par10">We conducted a broad literature review on reproductive
decision-making as part of Psychiatric Advance Directives, given the novelty and
specificity of the topic. For the literature review, group members used
databases from both medicine and law: Pubmed, Medline, Proquest, and Hein
Online. There were no location, language, or date restrictions, as we
hypothesized that there would be a minimal amount of existing research and we
wanted to cast the widest net possible. For every search, we used at least one
term in each of two categories. The first category explored PADs, and the
following search terms were used: &#x0201c;psychiatric&#x02009;+&#x02009;advance&#x02009;+&#x02009;directives,&#x0201d;
&#x0201c;values&#x02009;+&#x02009;based&#x02009;+&#x02009;decision-making,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;conservatorship,&#x0201d; and
&#x0201c;serious&#x02009;+&#x02009;mental&#x02009;+&#x02009;illness.&#x0201d; The second category was reproductive or perinatal
health, choice, or planning, and the following terms were used: &#x0201c;pregnancy,&#x0201d;
&#x0201c;childbirth,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;contraception,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;family&#x02009;+&#x02009;planning,&#x0201d; and
&#x0201c;perinatal&#x02009;+&#x02009;mental&#x02009;+&#x02009;health.&#x0201d; For instance, search terms used in combination
included &#x0201c;psychiatric&#x02009;+&#x02009;advance&#x02009;+&#x02009;directives&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;contraception.&#x0201d; This process
took place from May 2022 to March 2023. Institutional Review Board approval was
not required since no patient data was accessed or utilized.</p><p id="Par11">After initial records were identified, they were narrowed down
based on relevancy and robustness of information. Screening was performed by
abstract review; this was done by three team members (ECD, JW, and MO).
Inclusion criteria consisted of whether or not the abstract discussed both
Psychiatric Advance Directives (directly or in theory) and reproductive or
perinatal planning, choice, or decision-making. Any articles about PADs or that
contained search terms were read in full. Disagreements about inclusion were
discussed in research team meetings until a consensus was reached.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Template development</title><p id="Par12">After the literature review, regular team meetings were held to
create the Reproductive PAD template. We utilized a spreadsheet, created by our
subject matter expert on PADs, to organize our template draft in alignment with
the larger California project. We created subcategories of relevant topics and
then potential questions or areas of education within each one. These
subcategories and questions were developed through consensus at research team
meetings, with each member contributing, editing, and refining according to
their subject matter expertise. Any disagreements were resolved through
consensus.</p><p id="Par13">Once an acceptable preliminary draft was complete, Painted Brain
was presented to their internal working group for feedback. The director then
returned all comments and suggestions back to our research team. Next, the
Disability Rights California peer self-advocacy group held an online feedback
session for any interested staff or peers. The principal investigator (ECD)
attended and brought notes on the template back to the expert working group. We
utilized this community-based feedback to further refine and finalize the
Reproductive PAD template.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Literature review</title><p id="Par14">One hundred forty-one potential articles were located in medical
and law databases. Methodologies included qualitative studies, cross-sectional
survey studies, longitudinal studies, informational articles, and trial studies.
We did not exclude any articles based on field (law versus medicine) or
methodology. All articles were in English or had been translated at publication
from French into English.</p><p id="Par15">After reviewing abstracts and removing results that did not include
a search team from both the PAD/decision-making and the reproductive health
categories, 92 results remained. These articles were divided among the research
team for further review, with the goal of determining if any of them
investigated both Psychiatric Advance Directives and any sort of reproductive
health, planning, or choice topic. No articles were found that included both.
This verified our hypothesis that this work is novel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Literature review
results</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="737_2023_1382_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Template</title><p id="Par16">The final Reproductive PAD template contains questions that must be
answered to safely manage pregnancy, labor, delivery, and postpartum care for a
perinatal person during times of psychiatric crisis. The premise is that a
person with an SMI diagnosis has the capacity at the time of completing the PAD
to make these decisions but understands that the document will guide their care
at a future time when that capacity may be impaired. Our standard for including
a question was whether or not the decision (1) could be answered in advance, (2)
was legally allowable to be made by a surrogate decision-making or agent, and
(3) was vital to safe medical and psychiatric care in the moment of
crisis.</p><p id="Par17">The final template contains three primary sections: information on
medical history and previous pregnancies that are crucial for the prenatal care
provider; preferences and informed consent for key medical and psychiatric
treatment; and preferences for essential reproductive health and parenting
choices. The language is designed to be accessible enough for a person to fill
it out independently, though ideally a peer or provider is able to assist (see
<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Appendix A</xref> for Reproductive PAD
template).</p><p id="Par18">In addition, we created two additional &#x0201c;optional&#x0201d; sections. The
first section reviews options for pregnancy continuation versus termination.
Legally, a surrogate decision-making or health care agent cannot choose to end a
pregnancy for a person unable to make that decision for themselves, even if
designated in an advance directive. By this reading of the law, a person lacking
capacity due to psychiatric crisis cannot undergo an abortion, even if they have
made their desire for one clear in the past. This is true even in states, like
California, where abortion remains legal; many other states have very limited
access to legal abortions in any circumstance. Despite this, we are keeping the
section as &#x0201c;optional&#x0201d; in order that the person filling out the Reproductive PAD
can reflect on this issue and clarify desires and values regarding pregnancy
continuation versus termination&#x000a0;in non-crisis situations.</p><p id="Par19">The second optional section asks about preferences regarding
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT remains one of the most highly effective
treatments that we have for treatment resistant mood and psychotic disorders,
and the safety profile in pregnancy is reassuring (Ward et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). However, ECT remains highly
stigmatized, and members of our expert working group with lived experience
advised that including it in the main body of the Reproductive PAD could pose
more of a barrier than a help. In addition, many people do not have access to
ECT, particularly if they are on public insurance or lack capacity to consent to
it. We only wanted to offer choices in the Reproductive PAD that were feasible.
For both of these reasons, we moved questions about ECT preferences into an
&#x0201c;optional&#x0201d; section, for those who are open to, and able to access, ECT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion and impact</title><p id="Par20">In the realms of mental health and reproductive choice, perinatal
people with SMI diagnoses have a unique set of needs and risks that require
innovative approaches. However, because these two realms rarely overlap, we were
unable to find any legally viable&#x000a0;mechanisms that would support a person of
childbearing age with a serious mental illness diagnosis in documenting their own
reproductive preferences and plans. Per the tenets of Reproductive Justice, however,
this population has the same rights as anyone else to have a child, to not have a
child, and to raise a child in a healthy, safe environment. We believe that the
novel Reproductive PAD can promote these rights.</p><p id="Par21">At the same time, we understand through lived experience and clinical
expertise that safe parenting may not be feasible for all individuals with mental
health challenges, all of the time. This is particularly true in the United States,
where arcane convoluted rules around access health care and public benefits,
punitive child welfare systems, and stigma against the mentally ill&#x02014;particularly
those who are also BIPOC or otherwise marginalized&#x02014;throw up more barriers to
supported parenting than assistance. In certain circumstances, the right to raise a
child may need to be revoked, either temporarily or permanently, if the parent
cannot provide safety. Even in these situations, however, the birthing person should
be able to articulate a preference as to who does parent their child, and we
included specifications for custody as a key area in the Reproductive PAD.</p><p id="Par22">Strengths of this study include the varying and extensive subject
matter and lived expertise of different working group members. We incorporated
medical, legal, advocacy, ethics, and educational perspectives that ranged from
decades of experience to current trainees. An additional strength is the
collaboration with two community-based organizations to gather feedback from a wide
range of individuals, including peers for disability rights and mental health
advocates across rural and urban regions. This range of expertise is essential
because there is little existing literature about PADs in general or reproductive
health in perinatal people with SMI diagnoses, and none on Reproductive PADs.</p><p id="Par23">At this point, the primary limitation of our work is its novelty and
the need to implement it in clinical populations for study. We designed the
Reproductive PAD to be a living document, open to continuous shaping and
refinement&#x000a0;through clinical application. We are hopeful that for individuals with
SMI diagnoses, the Reproductive PAD will be an innovative and effective tool for
spotlighting reproductive health needs and desires, promoting autonomy, advocating
for medical and psychiatric care preferences, and preventing adverse and even fatal
perinatal outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary
