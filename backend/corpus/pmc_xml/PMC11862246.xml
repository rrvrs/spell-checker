Early Intervention Psychosis (EIP) teams attend high rates of migrant and ethnic diverse populations but the study of ethnic differences in pathways to obtain and maintain care is still scarce . The most consistent findings are that minorities are less involved with primary services, have a higher risk of being treated in a coercive way and are at higher risk of early disengagement. Despite the increasing migration rates&#x000a0;there has been very little investigation in Spain.</p></sec><sec id="sec1363"><title>Objectives</title><p>To investigate ethno-racial differences in pathways to obtain care, adherence and engagement during their first year of follow-up of subjects who start treatment&#x000a0;at&#x000a0;EIP of Reus, Catalonia, Spain</p></sec><sec id="sec1364"><title>Methods</title><p>

Nearly 31% belonged to a minority ethno-racial group being the Maghrebi (60.4%) followed by the Latin-American (20.1%) the most frequent minority groups. The 81.2% of the minority group were first-generation migrants and 7.5% second generation migrants.&#x000a0;The 52.2 % were referred from community services, 18.5% from emergency unit and 29.3% from inpatient unit. At follow up 64.5%, were highly adherent to EIP (&#x0003e; 75% of attended appointments), 16.7% required hospitalization and 11% disengaged.&#x000a0;Multivariate analysis showed that the minority group was 2.19 times more likely to be low adherent [(95% CI 0.78-3.17; p=0.03], 2.89 times more likely to be hospitalised [(95% CI 1.20-6.98); p=0.01], and 4 times more likely to disengage from the EIP [(95% CI 1.35-11.90); p= 0.01] during follow-up than the majority group. No group differences were found in pathways to obtain care or in causes of disengagement.</p></sec><sec id="sec1366"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In agreement with previous studies from other countries we found high rates of ethno-racial diversity in the EIP of Reus.&#x000a0;In addition, we also found inequalities in the use of services, being minorities more likely to disengage, to be low adherent to the program and at greater risk of hospitalization. On contrary to other studies we did not find significant differences between groups in the source of referral to EIP</p></sec><sec id="sec1367"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
