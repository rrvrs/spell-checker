However, this complication and its causes are rarely reported and discussed in the literature. We describe two cases of internal carotid artery rupture during endovascular thrombectomy in patients with tandem occlusion. It is hypothesised that the primary approach to the distal lesion, before recanalization, creates a blind alley that faces an intraluminal pressure increase upon manual contrast injection, surpassing the vessel&#x02019;s resistance and resulting in arterial wall rupture. To prevent this complication, approaches such as treating the proximal occlusion first, injecting the contrast through a microcatheter or retracting the endovascular support catheter proximally to the stenosis of the cervical internal carotid artery have been suggested and are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Complicated endovascular thrombectomy</kwd><kwd>internal carotid artery rupture</kwd><kwd>subarachnoid haemorrhage</kwd><kwd>tandem occlusion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts10</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-19714009241252624"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

</sup> In our reported patients, after attempted aspiration thrombectomy, the internal carotid artery ruptured in its post-cavernous segment, during regular manual contrast injection for angiographic control. The catheters did not pass the thrombus and, additionally, the guidewire was J-shaped and went smoothly through all the procedure. Nevertheless, in both cases, the absence of clot aspiration during the initial attempt entails a period, during injection, in which a distal and proximal internal carotid occlusion occurred simultaneously.</p><p>Upon entering the intracranial region, the internal carotid artery loses its external elastic lamina at the cavernous segment (C4) and acquires a thinner adventitia.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> This thinner arterial wall, after the distal dural ring, may render it more susceptible to rupture, especially in the presence of increased intraluminal pressure or arterial wall injury.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> Structural changes such as aneurysms can contribute to this type of complication.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> Yet, in these cases, the rupture is believed to be caused by contrast injection, which fills the blind alley/closed system formed due to tandem occlusion, leading to a significant increase in intraluminal pressure that exceeds the arterial wall resistance.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>To prevent this complication, one option is to initially treat the proximal lesion, with angioplasty and/or stenting, although this approach delays recanalization of the intracerebral distal blood flow. However, if the guiding catheter can traverse the occlusion site, as observed in our cases, a retrograde approach may be deemed preferable. Nonetheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that this approach creates a blind alley after the guiding catheter insertion in the internal carotid artery, with the vascular circuit occluded by the distal lesion and proximal carotid stenosis plus the diameter of the guiding catheter.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Another option would be a low flow manual injection or the injection through a microcatheter, to avoid excessive increase in intraluminal pressure during contrast injection.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-19714009241252624" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> Additionally, the guiding catheter may be retracted proximally to the stenosis of the internal carotid artery, while injecting contrast, preventing the formation of a blind alley but potentially resulting in a lower quality angiographic results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec4-19714009241252624"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Endovascular thrombectomy is an effective treatment for most tandem occlusions, allowing for early reperfusion of distal territories. However, in rare cases, the procedure can create a closed arterial system that leads to intradural internal carotid artery rupture upon contrast injection due to a significant increase in intraluminal pressure, resulting in fatal subarachnoid haemorrhage. To ensure the safety of this procedure, further studies are needed to compare the retrograde approach (initially treating the distal lesion) with other endovascular thrombectomy techniques, to determine the approach with the lowest risk of internal carotid artery rupture. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the few registered cases could help identify other risk factors for this complication, enabling the implementation of preventive measures in high-risk cases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="orcid" id="sec7-19714009241252624"><title>ORCID iDs</title><p>Catarina Freitas Lopes <ext-link xlink:href="https://orcid.org/0009-0006-2169-0364" ext-link-type="uri">https://orcid.org/0009-0006-2169-0364</ext-link></p><p>Lia Lucas Neto <ext-link xlink:href="https://orcid.org/0009-0006-2169-0364" ext-link-type="uri">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7880-9625</ext-link></p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-19714009241252624"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author">
