Our previous study explored how equal and unequal social comparison-related outcomes modulate event-related potential (ERP) responses to subsequently presented faces, where interests between oneself and others were independent (noncompetitive situations). Here, we aimed to extend this investigation by assessing how different unequal social comparison-related outcomes affect face processing under noncompetitive and competitive situations (i.e. a conflict of interest exists between the self and others). To address this issue, 39 participants were exposed to self-related and social comparison-related outcomes, categorized as positive or negative, after performing an attentional task with peers. Rewards and punishments depended on social comparison-related outcomes in the competition condition and on self-related outcomes in the noncompetition condition. ERP results showed that social comparison-related outcomes influenced P100 responses to faces in the self-positive condition. More notably, the effects on N170 responses observed in the noncompetition condition were absent in the competition condition. There was an effect on late positive potential responses only in the competition and self-negative condition. These findings suggest that social comparison-related outcomes influence early face processing irrespective of competition, while competition subsequently disrupts this processing but, later, enhances depending on self-related outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>competition</kwd><kwd>social comparison-related contexts</kwd><kwd>face perception</kwd><kwd>P100</kwd><kwd>N170</kwd><kwd>LPP</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source>

In routine life, faces are often viewed within social contexts, in particular socio-emotional contexts. Accumulated studies have repeatedly investigated whether socio-emotional contexts influence how we interpret and process simultaneously presented faces (e.g. <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Righart and De Gelder 2006</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Gu et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Kato and Takeda 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Liang 2019</xref>). However, the contexts also appear prior to the faces. It is also interesting to understand how prior emotional knowledge influences face processing.</p><p>Several event-related potential (ERP) components [i.e. P100, N170, and late positive potentials (LPPs)] have been identified to reflect the contextual effects on face processing. P100, a positive component that starts &#x0223c;100&#x02009;ms after stimulus onset and is distributed over occipital scalp sites, is thought to reflect early perception of a stimulus (e.g. <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Luck and Hillyard 1994</xref>). N170, a face-sensitive component that peaks &#x0223c;170&#x02009;ms after face onset and is distributed over occipito-temporal scalp sites, is thought to be associated with structural encoding of faces (e.g. <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Eimer and McCarthy 1999</xref>, Eimer <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). In a subsequent time range, the LPP, which is a positive component that starts at &#x0223c;500&#x02009;ms and is largest over parietal scalp sites, has been shown to reflect attentional allocation during emotional evaluations (e.g. <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Schupp et&#x000a0;al. 2000</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Leite et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Hilgard et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have utilized these components to explore whether prior socio-emotional stimuli affect neural responses to faces. Specifically, research on the P100 response has shown that this response is more pronounced for target faces following angry expressions compared to neutral ones (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Additionally, the P100 response is greater for faces that are preceded by negative scenes compared to positive ones (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hietanen and Astikainen 2013</xref>). These findings suggest that early face perception is heightened by preceding negative contexts.</p><p>Subsequently, the N170 response was found to be stronger to faces preceded by angry vocal expressions compared to those preceded by neutral expressions (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Liang 2023</xref>). However, two other studies reported smaller N170 responses to target faces following contextually negative facial expressions than to those following contextually neutral expressions (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Furl et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al. 2015b</xref>). Additionally, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Di&#x000e9;guez-Risco et&#x000a0;al. (2015)</xref> found larger N170 responses to positive and negative faces that were preceded by emotionally incongruent compared to congruent sentences, while the effect was reversed when relevant faces were preceded by social scenes (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hietanen and Astikainen 2013</xref>) and expectancy cues (Lin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). These findings indicate that prior positive and negative contexts may influence the structural encoding of a face. However, the direction of the effects appears to depend on experimental design and stimulus categories.</p><p>Regarding the LPP, studies have shown that the response is larger to positive and negative faces preceded by emotionally incongruent cues (Lin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Liang et&#x000a0;al. 2024</xref>), sentences (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Di&#x000e9;guez-Risco et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), and scenes (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hietanen and Astikainen 2013</xref>) compared to congruent ones. This suggests that high arousing and salient contexts enlarge LPP responses. However, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated that high arousing contextual facial expressions (e.g. surprised expressions) reduced LPP responses to subsequent target faces. These findings might suggest that emotional arousal influences face evaluations, depending on experimental design.</p><p>Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that prior negative and/or high arousing performance feedback regarding an individual influences ERP responses to that individual&#x02019;s face. For example, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Matyjek et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> reported that preceding negative behaviours associated with an individual led to larger P100 responses to their face. Additionally, it has reported that the N170 response is greater to faces whose identities have previously received negative evaluations compared to neutral ones (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Krasowski et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Schindler et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>). These studies also revealed increased LPP responses to faces linked with negative evaluations, particularly when the task required recalling evaluative information. Additionally, <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Breton et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref> reported increased LPP responses to faces whose identities had received high social ranks compared to medium and low ones, as well as low ranks compared to medium ones.</p><p>Recently, our study (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Liang 2024a</xref>) explored the effect of preceding performance feedback by investigating the effects of social comparison-related outcomes on ERP responses during face perception. Social comparison, which refers to comparing one&#x02019;s own attributes (e.g. abilities and performance outcomes) with those of others (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Festinger 1954</xref>), alters emotional value of the outcomes of one&#x02019;s performance depending on the outcomes of others (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Collins 1996</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler et&#x000a0;al. 1997</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Mussweiler et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Zell et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>, Lin and Liang <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">2021c</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al. 2023</xref>). For instance, an outcome superior to others (i.e. positive social comparison-related outcomes) typically triggers positive emotions, such as happiness (e.g. <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Suls et&#x000a0;al. 2002</xref>) and pride (e.g. <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2000</xref>). Conversely, an inferior outcome (i.e. negative social comparison-related outcomes) often leads to negative emotions, including envy (e.g. <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">van de Ven and Zeelenberg 2020</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Liang 2021a</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), threat (e.g. <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Mendes et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>), and shame (e.g. <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2000</xref>).</p><p>In our previous study (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">2024a</xref>), participants were told that they and a peer each engaged in a monetary game. Participants were presented with both their own and the peer&#x02019;s positive or negative outcomes (i.e. monetary gain or loss). Following this, participants were shown the face of the peer with whom they had just been paired. The findings revealed that peer&#x02019;s positive outcomes, compared to negative outcomes, led to more negative N170 responses to the peer&#x02019;s face when participants encountered negative outcomes themselves. This suggests that negative social comparison-related outcomes affect the structural encoding of faces. Additionally, the LPP response was generally weaker to peers&#x02019; faces when the peers had received positive outcomes compared to negative outcomes. This implies that social outcomes, rather than social comparison-related outcomes, influence face evaluations.</p><p>Note that our previous study (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">2024a</xref>) primarily investigated the effects between unequal (e.g. self-negative and other positive) and equal social comparison-related outcomes (e.g. self-negative and other negative). However, it remains unknown whether face processing is modulated by different types of unequal social comparison-related outcomes (e.g. positive and negative ones). Given that both prior positive and negative contexts have been shown to influence the abovementioned ERP responses to faces, those responses might also reflect the difference between positive and negative social comparison-related outcomes.</p><p>More importantly, in our previous study (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">2024a</xref>), rewards and punishments were based on participant&#x02019;s performance and an individual&#x02019;s interests were independent of those of others (i.e. noncompetitive circumstances). In social circumstances, however, rewards and punishments are often linked with performances involving social comparison, for instance, individuals are rewarded when their performance surpasses that of others and punished when their performance falls short (competitive circumstances; e.g. <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Tor and Garcia 2023</xref>). It remains unclear whether the effects of social comparison-related outcomes on face perception differ between competitive and noncompetitive circumstances. Nevertheless, competition is believed to enhance the processing of social comparison-related outcomes (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>, Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>). The heightened processing might apply for faces, leading to altered effects of social comparison-related outcomes on ERP responses to faces. Overall, exploring effects of positive and negative social comparison-related outcomes depending on competition could enhance our understanding of how social performance feedback influences face processing in broader social situations.</p><p>Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate whether positive and negative social comparison-related outcomes influence ERP responses during the processing of subsequently presented faces relying on competition. To address this issue, participants were presented with either positive or negative self-related outcomes and social comparison-related outcomes after completing an attentional task with several peers. In the noncompetition condition, rewards and punishments were based on self-related outcomes, while in competition condition, they were determined by social comparison-related outcomes. Subsequently, participants were shown a facial photo that was said to have been taken from their peers.</p><p>Based on our previous study (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">2024a</xref>), we predicted that social comparison-related outcomes would influence N170 responses but not LPP responses to faces in noncompetitive circumstances. Furthermore, in noncompetitive situations, social comparison-related outcomes are irrelevant to an individual&#x02019;s interest. This irrelevance might diminish concerns regarding social comparison-related outcomes (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Tor and Garcia 2023</xref>), particularly those that cannot bring about social rewards (e.g. nonpositive outcomes), resulting in reduced N170 responses. In contrast, competition could enhance the processing of social comparison-related outcomes overall (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>, Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>), potentially diminishing the differential processing between distinctive social comparison-related outcomes. Therefore, our first hypothesis posited that positive compared to negative social comparison-related outcomes would evoke larger N170 responses to subsequently presented faces in the noncompetition condition, which would be absent in the competition condition.</p><p>In contrast to the N170 time range, individuals within the LPP time range exhibit greater flexibility in adjusting their attention. This allows them to potentially enhance their focus on the most arousing stimuli. In the competition condition, the most arousing outcome was the self-negative and social-positive one, which indicated that participants were rewarded despite not performing well. Accordingly, our second hypothesis posits that positive social comparison-related outcomes would enlarge LPP responses specifically in the competition and self-negative condition. However, due to the limited literature on this topic, we did not have a clear hypothesis regarding the P100 effects of social comparison-related outcomes in relation to competition.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2-s1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-one undergraduate students were recruited as participants. Two participants were excluded due to excessive electroencephalogram (EEG) artefacts. This led to a final sample of 39 participants (24 women; 18&#x02013;22&#x02009;years, <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.35, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.78). Our previous study revealed a small to medium effect size for the interaction between competition and social comparison-related outcomes, as well as for the interaction among competition, social comparison-related and self-related outcomes (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>). We therefore considered whether the current sample size could also achieve a similar effect size. To assess this, a sensitivity power analysis was conducted using G*power 3.1.7 (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Faul et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>). The results revealed that the present sample size had a power of 80% to detect a small to medium effect size (<italic toggle="yes">f</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15&#x02013;0.19) for the abovementioned 2-/3-way interactions. All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and did not report neurological illness or a history. All participants provided written informed consent, which was in accordance with standard ethical guidelines from the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Academic Committee of School of National Finance, Guangdong University of Finance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-s2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>The stimuli included 42 neutral faces (21 women and 21 men). Of these, forty faces (20 women and 20 men), which were used in the test phase, were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences&#x02019; Pose, Expression, Accessory and Lighting Large-Scale Chinese Face Database (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>). The remaining two faces, which served as practice stimuli, were taken from the experimenters. Facial pictures were cropped similarly around the face outline and centred, so that eyes, noses, and mouths were located at similar positions. For all pictures, external features (e.g. neck, shoulder, distant hair, and jewellery) were removed and the size was adjusted into 6.75&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;9&#x02009;cm (horizontal&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;vertical). The background colour was set to black. Each facial stimulus (excluding the stimuli presented in the practice) was presented once in each experimental condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-s3"><title>Procedure</title><p>Prior to the experiment, participants were informed that they would perform an attentional task and obtain or lose 5 RMB according to self-related or social comparison-related outcomes (see the following paragraphs for details). Participants were informed that the overall compensation would be based on the general gain or loss for all trials, entailing the addition or subtraction of the basic compensation of 30 RMB, respectively [e.g. if participants generally gain 10 RMB for all trials in the attentional task, they would receive an overall compensation of 40 (i.e. 30&#x02009;+&#x02009;10) RMB; otherwise, if they generally lose 10 RMB, they would receive an overall compensation of 20 (i.e. 30&#x02013;10) RMB]. In fact, the general gain or loss was randomized by the computers, ranging from &#x02212;10 to 10 RMB. Nevertheless, to ensure the principle of voluntary participation, participants were also told that the compensation provided to them were noncoercive.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>, a white fixation point (&#x0201c;*&#x0201d;) was firstly displayed for 500&#x02009;ms. After showing a blank screen between 800 and 1200&#x02009;ms (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1000&#x02009;ms), there was an attentional task that was repeated 5 times. For each trial of this task, participants had to indicate whether the target letter &#x0201c;F&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;D&#x0201d; appeared among six letters [more details could be found in our previous study (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>)]. A blank screen was presented for a random duration between 800 and 1200&#x02009;ms (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1000&#x02009;ms) after every two trials of the attentional task.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of the experimental procedure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nsaf005f1" position="float"/></fig><p>Subsequently, a comparison face task was presented 5 times. In this task, two symbols were displayed on the upper and lower sides of the screen. For half of the participants, the &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;&#x02212;&#x0201d; symbol appeared on the upper side, while the &#x0201c;&#x0003e;&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;&#x0003c;&#x0201d; symbol was shown on the lower side. The positions of the symbols were reversed for the other half of the participants.</p><p>The &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;&#x02212;&#x0201d; symbols represented self-related positive and negative outcomes, respectively. Participants were informed that the valence of the outcome depended on the difference between their averaged performances in the current five trials and those in several preceding trials. It was emphasized to participants that the preceding trials were selected randomly by a computer, which meant that self-related outcomes could sometimes be surprising, e.g. outcomes might be positive even if a participant made an incorrect and slow response or negative if the response was correct and fast. This emphasis was intended to enhance participants&#x02019; belief in the authenticity of the outcome. In reality, however, the computer did not compare participants&#x02019; performances in the current trials with those from preceding trials and all performance outcomes were presented in a randomized order.</p><p>The &#x0201c;&#x0003e;&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;&#x0003c;&#x0201d; symbols indicated positive and negative social comparison-related outcomes, respectively. Participants were informed that the experimenters had previously recruited a large number of undergraduate and postgraduate students from other universities or colleges to perform the same attention task. Participants were told that the valence of social comparison-related outcomes was based on outcome differences between the participants themselves and another student. Participants were told that in each trial, their averaged performance over the current five trials of the attentional task would be compared with the averaged performance of another student who had also completed the same five trials. In reality, however, there were no students, and the social comparison-related outcomes were presented in a randomized order.</p><p>To understand the influence of competition, participants in the competition condition were told that the &#x0201c;&#x0003e;&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;&#x0003c;&#x0201d; symbols were depicted in red and rewards and punishments depended on social comparison-related outcomes (i.e. the attainment of positive social comparison-related outcomes would result in a gain of 5 RMB, while negative outcomes would lead to a loss of 5 RMB). In the noncompetition condition, the participants were informed that the &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;&#x02212;&#x0201d; symbols were depicted in red and rewards and punishments were based on their own performance outcomes. The sequence of the competition and noncompetition conditions was randomized across participants.</p><p>Following another blank screen between 800 and 1200&#x02009;ms (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1000&#x02009;ms), a face was presented at the centre of the screen for 2000&#x02009;ms. Participants were told that the person was someone they had just played with. After viewing the face, participants were asked to rate to which they liked the person on a 9-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;very dislikeable, 9&#x02009;=&#x02009;very likeable) by pressing the corresponding number on the number keyboard using their right hand.

Prior to the experiment, there were eight practice trials to familiarize with the experimental procedure. During the practice session, participants were told that their task performance would be recorded and used in the actual task. However, the self-related and social comparison-related outcomes were presented in a randomized order, and the facial pictures were taken from the experimenters.

Ag/AgCl electrodes were placed on the scalp by using an EasyCap electrode system (EASYCAP GmbH, Herrsching-Breitbrunn, Germany) based on the 10-20 system. The AFz electrode was used as the ground electrode. All other electrodes were referenced to the FCz electrode during data collection. The horizontal electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded from two electrodes at the outer canthi of both eyes, and the vertical EOG was recorded in a bipolar fashion from two electrodes that were on the upper and lower sides of the right eye to monitor eye blinks and movements. The sample rate was 1000&#x02009;Hz, and band-pass filtering (0.05&#x02013;100&#x02009;Hz) was applied with a 50-Hz notch filter online.

Artefact rejection was performed with an amplitude threshold of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;V, a gradient criterion of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;V/ms, and lowest activity criterion of 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;V per 100&#x02009;ms. Artefact-free trials were then averaged from each channel and experimental condition. Averaged ERPs were low-passed filtered at 30&#x02009;Hz (24&#x02009;db/oct, zero phase shift). Finally, ERPs were recomputed to an average reference excluding vertical and horizontal EOG channels.

Results showed that social-negative compared to social-positive outcomes elicited a larger P100 response to faces in the self-positive condition, irrespective of competition. More notably, social-positive compared to social-negative outcomes resulted in a more negative N170 response to subsequently presented faces under the noncompetition condition, an effect that was not observed under the competition condition. Additionally, faces preceded by social-positive outcomes elicited a larger LPP response compared to those preceded by social-negative outcomes, specifically in the competition and self-negative condition. The findings might suggest that prior positive and negative social comparison-related outcomes have differential influences on face processing across various time ranges, depending on self-related outcomes and, importantly, the presence of competition.</p><p>The P100 is thought to reflect early stimulus perception (e.g. <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Luck and Hillyard 1994</xref>). Research indicates that prior exposure of negative stimuli, e.g. faces and scenes (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hietanen and Astikainen 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>), as well as negative social knowledge (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Matyjek et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>), enlarges the P100 response to faces. This suggests that negative social contexts exert a more significant influence on early face perception. Accordingly, the current findings suggest that negative social comparison-related outcomes may strengthen early face perception more substantially than positive outcomes, particularly in the self-positive condition.</p><p>It has been suggested that negative social comparison-related outcomes elicit negative emotions, such as envy (e.g. <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">van de Ven and Zeelenberg 2020</xref>), threat (e.g. <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Mendes et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>), and shame (e.g. <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2000</xref>). Envy and threat prompt individuals heighten their vigilance to those they perceive as superior (e.g. <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Koster et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Hill et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). In contrast, feelings of shame lead individuals to avoid engaging with superior persons (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Schmader and Lickel 2006</xref>). In the present study, participants who obtained negative social comparison-related outcomes might have generally felt envy and threat. However, those in the self-negative condition might have felt more shame than those in the self-positive condition. This increased sense of shame could reduce attention to the faces of superior individuals, leading to a diminished impact of social comparison-related outcomes in the self-negative condition.</p><p>In later time ranges, the N170 is associated with early configural and structural perception of a face (e.g. <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Eimer and McCarthy 1999</xref>, Eimer <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) and the LPP with emotional evaluations (e.g. <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Schupp et&#x000a0;al. 2000</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Leite et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Hilgard et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). The current findings might suggest that competition weakens distinct structural encoding of faces associated with positive and negative social comparison-related outcomes, while it strengthens differential evaluations of relevant faces in the self-negative condition.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the N170 and LPP reflect not only negative but also positive contextual stimuli. Accordingly, for the current study, not only negative but also positive social comparison-related outcomes elicited N170 and LPP responses. It has been suggested that individuals who obtain positive social comparison-related outcomes express pride to inferior others (e.g. <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2000</xref>). This expression might increase attention to others&#x02019; faces, even overpassing attention in the social-negative condition, and thus enhance structural encoding and emotional evaluation of relevant faces.</p><p>Nevertheless, increased responses to faces associated with positive social comparison-related outcomes, compared to those linked with negative outcomes, were observed only in the noncompetition condition during the N170 time range, but in the competition and self-negative condition in the LPP time range. In the competition condition, social comparison-related outcomes were particularly relevant to self-interest, which might strengthen attention to social comparison-related outcomes (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>, Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>). The N170 reflects automatic attention to faces (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Cauquil et&#x000a0;al. 2000</xref>), and during this stage, brains might fail to adjust attention flexibly. In this case, enhanced attention could occur regardless of outcome valence, leading to a reduction in the effect of social comparison-related outcomes on face perception.</p><p>In contrast, the LPP is associated with top-down attentional modulation (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hietanen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). During this time range, individuals might initially direct their attention toward high arousing faces by integrating various contextual factors, including competition and self-related and social comparison-related outcomes. Among all outcomes in the competition condition, the most arousing outcome was the self-negative and social-positive outcome, where participants did not perform well but could still receive a reward. This outcome might have heightened attention to faces, thereby amplifying the effect of social comparison-related outcomes in the competition and self-negative condition.</p><p>Moreover, the current findings revealed that the effects of social comparison-related outcomes on face processing were modulated only by self-related outcomes in P100 time ranges, competition in N170 time ranges, and both competition and self-related outcomes in LPP time ranges. The findings suggest that during face processing, brains integrate social comparison-related outcomes firstly with self-related outcomes, followed by competition, and finally with both competition and self-related outcomes. In the present study, participants were instructed to make a social comparison with facial identities. This association between faces and social comparison-related outcomes might lead to the prioritization of processing these outcomes during face processing. Although self-related outcomes and competition environments are not directly related to faces, they are thought to modulate evaluations of social comparison-related outcomes (e.g. <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al. 2023</xref>, Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>), potentially influencing face processing. Nevertheless, it is possible that brains cannot initially allocate attentional resources to process both face-irrelevant contexts in early time ranges but can do so in later time ranges (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>). This could result in the effect of social comparison-related outcomes being modulated by either of the face-irrelevant contexts in early time ranges but by both contexts at later ones. Additionally, the earlier modulation of self-related outcomes compared to competition might be because self-related outcomes are crucial for evaluating the performance of facial identities, thus becoming associated with relevant faces.</p><p>The current findings align with our previous study (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">2024a</xref>), which found no effect of social comparison-related outcomes on LPP responses to faces in a noncompetition setting. Different from the current findings, however, our previous study revealed that negative social comparison-related outcomes amplified N170 responses to the faces of others. This investigation focused on the distinction between negative and equal social comparison-related outcomes, perceived as negative and neutral, respectively. Negative social feedback compared to neutral ones has been linked to heightened N170 responses to subsequent faces (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Krasowski et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Schindler et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>). However, our present study investigated the contrast between unequal positive and negative outcomes. The extent of the N170 response difference between these two outcomes is dependent on the specific experimental design.</p><p>Additionally, behavioural findings revealed that faces in the social-positive condition were rated as more likeable than those in the social-negative condition. This effect of social comparison-related outcomes was more pronounced in the competition condition compared to the noncompetition condition. Theories and empirical studies on evaluative conditioning have suggested that neutral stimuli (e.g. faces) can acquire emotional meanings even though they are merely paired with relevant emotional stimuli (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;tter 2022</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Moran et&#x000a0;al. 2023</xref>). Moreover, competition is known to intensify the processing of outcomes related to social comparisons, including emotional evaluations (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2024b</xref>). Such strengths might also extend to face evaluations, resulting in more significant effects of social comparison-related outcomes on liking ratings of faces.</p><p>Overall, several studies have suggested that social feedback influences face processing (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Breton et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Krasowski et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Matyjek et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Schindler et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>). Our previous study (Lin and Liang <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">2024a</xref>) highlighted that unequal negative social comparison-related outcomes, compared to equal ones, affected early face perception in noncompetition circumstances. The current study offered new insights, revealing that both unequal positive and negative social comparison-related outcomes affected face processing in both early and late time ranges. Crucially, the present findings also provided new evidence that the effects of social comparison-related outcomes are firstly modulated by self-related outcomes, then by competition, and ultimately by a combination of both factors. These findings might further illustrate that both positive and negative social feedback can influence face processing, contingent on face-irrelevant social (e.g. competition) and nonsocial (e.g. self-related outcomes) factors.</p><p>Additionally, the current findings have implications for person-to-person interactions in real life. The current study suggested that comparisons with others can alter perceptions and evaluations during subsequent presentations of other&#x02019;s faces based on competitive circumstances. Such alternations may persist over time, potentially influencing future social interactions and attitudes toward relevant individuals (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Breton et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Krasowski et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Matyjek et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Schindler et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>). Moreover, social feedback associated with specific faces can generalize to other faces perceived as similar (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al. 2024</xref>). Therefore, the influence of social comparison-related outcomes observed in the present study might also extend to other faces that resemble those of the comparators.</p><p>Finally, we would like to mention some of the limitations of the current study and make suggestions for upcoming studies. Previous studies have demonstrated that social comparison-related outcomes influence face memory (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto et&#x000a0;al. 2021</xref>, Lin and Liang <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">2024a</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether these effects are modulated by competitive circumstances. Future studies should further explore this issue. Additionally, social comparison can also occur in cooperation situations, such as when rewards are contingent upon both individual and group performance (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Valt et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>). Future studies could investigate whether social comparison influences face processing in these cooperation contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study revealed that the P100 response was larger to faces preceded by negative social comparison-related outcomes compared to positive ones when one received a positive outcome. More importantly, the larger N170 responses to faces preceded by positive social comparison-related outcomes compared to negative ones, observed in the noncompetition condition, was absent in the competition condition. Additionally, the LPP response was larger for faces following positive social comparison-related outcomes compared to negative outcomes, only when one received a negative outcome in the competition condition. Taken together, these findings imply that social comparison-related contexts influence face perceptions in very early time ranges, irrespective of competition. Competition appears to weaken the contextual effects in subsequent time ranges and later strengthen them depending on self-related outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Huiyan Lin (Writing&#x02014;review and editing, Writing&#x02014;original draft, Methodology, Investigation, Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Conceptualization) and Jiafeng Liang (Writing&#x02014;review and editing, Investigation, Formal analysis).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s7"><title>Conflict of interest:</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Characteristic Innovation Projects in Universities in Guangdong Province (No. 2023KTSCX092), the Planned Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Guangdong Province (No. GD23XXL05), the Research Program for Humanities and Social Science granted by the Ministry of Education in China (23YJC190026), and the Key Research Platform Project for Universities in Guangdong Province (Research Center of National Finance, 2022WZJD005).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s9"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data underlying this article will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><ref-list id="ref1"><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
