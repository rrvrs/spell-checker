One of such molecules is Iristatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor from <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> that has been shown to have immunomodulatory properties. To characterize Iristatin in the relation to TBEV, we investigate whether this tick inhibitor has any capacity to influence TBEV infection. Mice were intradermally infected by TBEV with or without Iristatin and the viral multiplication was determined in skin and brain tissues by RT-PCR two and 5&#x000a0;days after infection. The viral RNA was detected in both intervals in skin and increased by time. The application of Iristatin caused a reduction in viral RNA in skin but not in the brain of infected mice 5&#x000a0;days post-infection. Moreover, anti-viral effect of Iristatin on skin was accompanied by a significant decline of interferon-stimulated gene 15 gene expression. The effect of Iristatin on TBEV replication was tested also in vitro in primary macrophages and dendritic cells; however, no changes were observed suggesting no direct interference of Iristatin with virus replication. Still, the Iristatin caused a suppression of Erk1/2 phosphorylation in TBEV-infected dendritic cells and had the anti-apoptotic effect. This is the first report showing that a tick cystatin decreases the viral RNA in the host skin, likely indirectly through creating skin environment that is less supportive for TBEV replication. Assuming, that viral RNA reflects the amount of infectious virus, decline of TBEV in host skin could influence the tick biology or virus transmission during cofeeding.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00436-024-08441-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cystatin</kwd><kwd>Flavivirus</kwd><kwd>Tick</kwd><kwd>Tick-borne encephalitis virus</kwd><kwd>Virus replication</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantov&#x000e1; Agentura &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-15678S</award-id><award-id>19-15678S</award-id><award-id>19-15678S</award-id><award-id>19-15678S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langhansov&#x000e1;</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name><name><surname>Ber&#x000e1;nkov&#x000e1;</surname><given-names>Zuzana</given-names></name><name><surname>Khanna</surname><given-names>Ritesh</given-names></name><name><surname>Lieskovsk&#x000e1;</surname><given-names>Jaroslava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Union-Next Generation EU</institution></funding-source><award-id>LX22NPO5103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palus</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of South Bohemia in &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Bud&#x0011b;jovice</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access publishing supported by the institutions participating in the CzechELib Transformative Agreement.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV; <italic>Orthoflavivirus encephalitidis</italic>) is a positive single-stranded enveloped RNA flavivirus belonging to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. TBEV is endemic to Europe and northern Asia causing infection of the central nervous system. It is transmitted by ticks of the Ixodidae family, by <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> in Europe and by <italic>Ixodes persulcatus</italic> in Asia (Kazimirova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>). The virus first replicates in skin cells, including fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and in migratory monocytes and Langerhans dendritic cells (Hermance et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>; Labuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). The latter are responsible for transporting the virus to the nearest lymphatic nodes followed by further spread to other lymphatic and non-lymphatic organs due to viremia (Ruzek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>). Afterwards, the target tissue (brain) is reached causing typical neurological pathology involving both direct virus-induced cellular damage and immune response-mediated pathology. Viral RNA replication occurs in replicative vesicles near the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Virions enter the cell by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and mature virions depart via exocytosis (Ruzek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Virus RNA molecules are sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), and RNA-dependent protein kinases (PKR), inducing the production of inflammatory mediators and interferons (Kawai and Akira <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>). Interferon action is the most potent anti-viral reaction which is mediated through numerous IFN-inducible genes, e.g., ISG15, CXCL-10, OASL2, and IFIT2. Interferon production and signaling is essential for controlling TBEV infection in the periphery as well as in the brain (Weber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">TBEV is transmitted to the vertebrate host via tick saliva that is periodically released by the tick into a feeding cavity in the host&#x02019;s skin (Nuttall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>). Tick saliva contains a mixture of bioactive molecules that support the tick-feeding process and have anti-hemostatic and immunomodulatory effects (Kotal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>; Simo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). It has been shown that tick-borne viruses, similarly to other tick-borne pathogens, exploit the immunosuppression evoked in the host by the tick (Kazimirova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>). The increase in virus acquisition resulting from the presence of tick saliva has been demonstrated for the Thogoto virus and later for TBEV (Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1989</xref>; Labuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1993</xref>). The enhancing effect of salivary gland extract (SGE) on virus infection has been demonstrated for Powassan virus (POWV), a flavivirus closely related to TBEV, by showing that the amount of virus required to produce lethal animal infection was significantly lower when tick SGE was present (Hermance and Thangamani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). The tick salivary compounds responsible for these effects are yet to be revealed and are called SAT (saliva-assisted transmission) factors (Nuttall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>). Today, no <italic>I. ricinus</italic> cystatin has been recognized to play any role in TBEV replication or infection. In the case of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including the dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), several salivary molecules supporting or inhibiting the virus replication were identified (Conway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>; Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">a</xref>; Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). The characterization of tick salivary proteins and their relation to tick-borne pathogen transmission is fuelled by a need to identify SAT factors with the potential to become a component of an anti-tick vaccine cocktail.</p><p id="Par5">Iristatin is a tick salivary cystatin from <italic>I. ricinus</italic> (Kotal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>). Cystatins are a family of cysteine peptidase inhibitors found in several organisms and have been associated in ticks with blood acquisition, blood digestion, the modulation of host immune response, and tick biology (Chmelar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Cysteine proteases that are inhibited by cystatins include cathepsins B, H, L, C, and S, and are involved in the control of various cellular processes (Turk and Bode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1991</xref>). Iristatin specifically inhibits cathepsin C and L as evidenced by both its structure and function. In addition, Iristatin is a potent immunomodulator of the host immune system which has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro (Kotal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>). Iristatin attenuates Th1 and Th2 vertebrate host immune responses and inhibit ovalbumin-induced CD4 T cell proliferation and leukocyte recruitment. It also affects nitric oxide secretion and cytokines production from activated macrophages (Kotal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that Iristatin suppresses innate immunity-dependent mannan-induced psoriasis-like inflammation through inhibition of IL-6/IL-23/IL17 axis cytokines (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2024</xref>). Due to these features, we hypothesized that Iristatin could influence the TBEV infection.</p><p id="Par6">Herein we investigated the effect of Iristatin on TBEV infection in vivo and in vitro<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cells and virus</title><p id="Par7">Bone marrow cells were obtained from the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6N mice by flushing the bones with RPMI 1640 medium.

The viral RNA was detected in the skin already 2&#x000a0;days upon infection and significantly increased in time (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016) in TBEV-infected mice.

To find out whether a decrease of virus load observed in the presence of Iristatin results in a decrease of IFN or ISGs, we measured gene expression of IFN-&#x003b2; and four interferon-stimulated genes, namely ISG15, CXCL-10, OASL2, and IFIT2 in skin tissue two and 5&#x000a0;days after Hypr infection. No IFN-&#x003b2; gene expression was detected in infected mice (data not shown). On day two after infection, only gene expression of ISG15 was significantly induced by the virus (Online Resource 1A). The administration of Iristatin did not cause significant changes; however, the non-significant decline in gene expression was seen in 3 out of 4 genes (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A, C, E). Five days after infection, the gene expression of ISG15, CXCL-10, and OASL2 was significantly induced by virus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b, Online Resource 1D). The presence of Iristatin resulted in a significant decline of ISG15 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The other genes were slightly downregulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, Online Resource 1D, F); the CXCL-10 decrease caused by Iristatin was close to statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0645). Our results demonstrate a positive correlation between a decline of viral RNA in skin of TBEV-infected mice and the decline of IFN-stimulated gene induction in the presence of Iristatin.</p><p id="Par19">To shed light on the changes in skin that could potentially lead to a decrease of virus load in the presence of Iristatin, we evaluated the presence of monocytes and gamma delta T cells in the skin of TBEV-infected mice 5 dpi. We hypothesized that due to the immunomodulatory effect of Iristatin the altered recruitment of monocytes (virus permissive cells) and/or gamma delta T cells (innate lymphocytes capable to alter cytokine environment in the skin) could be responsible for a decline of virus amount in the skin. The gene expressions of monocyte marker CD115 and gamma delta T cell marker TCR&#x003b3; were measured; however, no changes were revealed between non-infected and TBEV-infected or Iristatin-treated groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d). The results suggest that Iristatin does not alter the amounts of monocytes or gamma delta T cells in the skin of TBEV-infected mice.

We chose mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMM) and dendritic cells (DC) as they are susceptible to TBEV infection and in addition they play an important role in TBEV pathogenesis and dissemination. Macrophages and DC were infected with Hypr strain at MOI 5 and virus load was determined 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;h post-infection (hpi).

The amounts of infectious virus, determined by plaque titration, were also comparable in the presence or absence of Iristatin (Online Resource 2).

Interestingly, we consistently observed a tendency of Iristatin to negatively influence the TBEV replication and CXCL-10 gene expression; effects were more pronounced in macrophages than in dendritic cells.

Since Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 is involved in the recognition of TBEV (Etna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>), we first performed the screening of intracellular signaling pathways activated by TLR7 ligand imiquimod (IQ). The signaling pathway activation was determined in dendritic cells 3&#x000a0;h upon IQ addition using the PathScan intracellular signaling array kit (only selected kinases are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Results showed that IQ activated several signaling pathways, including kinases Erk1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 a 2), Akt, Bad, and GSK-3&#x003b2;. The Iristatin presence caused the inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation and enhancement of the phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic Akt and the kinases which are downstream of Akt, namely Bad, mTOR, PRAS40, and GSK-3&#x003b2;. To follow up this observation, we performed the analysis of Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in Hypr-infected DC by immunoblotting. DC were infected by Hypr in the presence or absence of Iristatin and cells were subjected for analysis 1, 2, and 3&#x000a0;h afterwards. The phosphorylation of Akt was gradually increased upon the addition of the virus but the effect of Iristatin was not consistent (data not shown). In the case of Erk1/2 activation, we observed an increase of Erk phosphorylation which was absent in the presence of Iristatin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Thus, the results suggest that Iristatin negatively affects the activation of Erk1/2 in virus-infected cells.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Iristatin interferes with signaling pathways activation and exerts anti-apoptotic effect in TBEV-infected dendritic cells.

We measured the active caspase-3, an executive caspase and a marker of apoptotic cells, in the TBEV-infected dendritic cells in the presence or absence of Iristatin 24 and 48&#x000a0;h post-infection. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, coincubation of DC with the virus led to a minor but statistically significant decrease in the percentage of active caspase-3 positive cells 24&#x000a0;h post-infection. More importantly, Iristatin significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells at both tested intervals independently of virus infection, pointing to the potential of this cystatin to prevent apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">Cystatins found in arthropods are associated with blood acquisition, digestion, and the modulation of host immune responses and tick immunity (Chmelar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>; Francischetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>; Kotal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>). In this work, we uncovered a novel role of tick cystatin in relation to TBEV. We have found that the presence of Iristatin, the salivary cystatin of<italic> I. ricinus</italic> tick, led to a decline of viral RNA in the skin of infected mouse. Infected cells upon recognition of viral RNA produce IFN, which exerts its anti-viral effects through induction of numerous IFN-stimulated genes. In agreement with reduced viral RNA, gene induction of chosen IFN-stimulated genes was lowered in skin of infected mice by Iristatin treatment. The effect of Iristatin on TBEV replication in macrophages and dendritic cells in in vitro condition, measured by viral RNA and viral titer, was not observed.</p><p id="Par24">If we presume that viral RNA level correlates with the amount of infectious viral particles, the inhibitory effect we observed by Iristatin in the skin may impact both the host and the tick. Ticks often feed on the same host, and TBEV can be transmitted from a TBEV-infected tick to a non-infected tick by so-called cofeeding with no detectable viremia (Nuttall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>). This horizontal way of virus transmission is quite common and the reduced load of virus in the skin may negatively affect virus spreading in nature. The importance of reduced virus load for host itself seems obvious if less virus means higher chance for host immune system to eliminate viral infection. In the case of flaviviruses, the initial dose of the virus is not so crucial for pathogenesis (Lennette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1944</xref>; Porcelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>). Indeed, the administration of Iristatin induced differences at the level of viral RNA in the skin but did not affect the virus load in the brain.</p><p id="Par25">Several studies have described the anti-viral role of vertebrate cystatin (Shah and Bano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>), and among arthropod cystatins, Aacystatin from <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was shown to have an anti-viral effect in mosquitos (Sim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). The silencing of the Aacystatin gene led to increased DENV titers and this effect was attributed partially to the modulation of apoptosis (Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">a</xref>). Among tick cystatins, only cystatin Sialostatin L2 from <italic>I. scapularis</italic> was investigated in relation to the TBEV infection. Interestingly, this cystatin potentiated TBEV replication in dendritic cells in vitro and interfered with IFN action (Lieskovska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015b</xref>). Therefore, it earned the mark as a SAT factor, though no in vivo experiments were performed. In contrast to Sialostatin&#x000a0;L2, we found that Iristatin does not influence TBEV replication in dendritic cells, so apparently, Iristatin and Sialostatin L2 work in a different manner, possibly due to differences in their substrate specificity (Kotsyfakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). The different modes of action of these two tick cystatins were also observed when investigating the anti-inflammatory effect in a psoriasis-like inflammation model (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">The interaction between vectors and their hosts is very complex and may affect vector-borne pathogens in the host. The modulation of host haemostatic and immune reactions, thanks to molecules present in tick saliva, creates in many cases a favorable microenvironment for tick transmitted pathogens (Nuttall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>). This was shown for numerous tick-borne pathogens including TBEV, Powassan virus, Thogoto virus, <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato, and <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> (Hermance and Thangamani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>; Kazimirova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>; Nuttall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>; Simo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). Though the mechanism of this supporting effect is not clear, it is believed that in general, an immunosuppression and immunomodulation is involved. Nevertheless, in the case of arboviral infection, it has been shown that the inflammatory response caused by the bite of the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is needed for the higher load of Semliki Forest virus and Bunyamwera virus (Pingen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2016</xref>). Thus, a weaker inflammatory reaction of host may be disadvantageous for virus replication and virus dissemination within the host. We hypothesized that due to the previously reported immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory features of Iristatin, the recruitment of virus-permissive monocytes to the site of virus inoculation could be negatively affected and consequently could cause a decline in virus load in the skin. Of note, the percentage of innate immune cells including macrophages was decreased by Iristatin in skin lesions and secondary lymphoid organs in mannan-induced inflammation (Kotsyfakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). However, as we found neither virus nor Iristatin cause changes in the amounts of monocytes in the skin of TBEV-infected mice so the mechanism of negative effect of Iristatin remained to be clarified.</p><p id="Par27">The effect of Iristatin on viral replication in vitro was tested as well. The early phase of TBEV infection takes place in cutaneous tissues, where several types of cells including monocytes and Langerhans cells support virus replication (Hermance et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>; Labuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). Therefore, mouse macrophages and dendritic cells were chosen for in vitro analysis of Iristatin effects. However, no changes at the level of viral RNA, the viral titer, or gene expression of IFN-stimulated genes were observed in these cells upon Iristatin treatment. In addition, the preliminary results from testing the murine keratinocytes, the most abundant cells of the epidermis, showed that there is no effect of Iristatin on TBEV replication (data not shown). We think that the lack of Iristatin effect on virus multiplication in vitro implies that Iristatin likely does not interfere with virus replication directly but rather modulates processes important for virus multiplication at the organismal level.</p><p id="Par28">One of the cellular processes which was found to be affected by Iristatin was apoptosis. The percentage of active caspase-3 positive cells out of dendritic cells was substantially decreased by Iristatin in both TBEV-infected and non-infected cells, indicating that the anti-apoptotic effect of Iristatin is independent of virus infection. Interestingly, in in vitro condition, Iristatin negatively influenced the activation of one of mitogen activated kinases Erk1/2, the kinase, which is involved in many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Cargnello and Roux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>). The relevance of Erk1/2 inhibition to the TBEV replication in vivo was not determined. However, it has been shown that MEK/ERK inhibitors AZD6244 and UO126 impair the replication of several flaviviruses (Albarnaz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>; de Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">a</xref>). The inhibition of Erk1/2 signaling by other <italic>I. scapularis</italic> cystatins, Sialostatin L and Sialostatin L2, was also observed in dendritic cells stimulated by TLR ligands or <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (Lieskovska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015a</xref>). Thus, the negative effect on Erk1/2 pathway could be a common mode of action of these tick cystatins. Nevertheless, the cellular processes that are altered by Iristatin and important for TBEV replication remain elusive.</p><p id="Par29">Finally, we evaluated the role of Iristatin in the TBEV infection of murine host; however, we do not know what impact Iristatin would have on TBEV infection in ticks. There is no information about Iristatin gene expression in TBEV-infected <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks though the study by Hart et al. revealed that one cystatin is downregulated in Hypr-infected <italic>I. ricinus</italic> (Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>) suggesting the possibility of a reciprocal interplay between cystatin and TBEV in ticks. This raises interesting questions that are the aims of our future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">We have discovered that tick salivary cystatin Iristatin acts as a negative regulator of TBEV infection since it can restrict the amount of viral RNA in the host skin. Assuming that the viral RNA correlates with the amounts of infectious viral particles, Iristatin may have an effect on virus transmission among ticks during cofeeding. Importantly, since Iristatin does not behave as a SAT factor, it should not be considered as a part of an anti-tick vaccine for protection against tick-borne pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="436_2024_8441_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 157 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank prof.
