The mechanism underlying this transition remains unclear, but metabolic adaptations to the bioenergy demands imposed by injury are plausible contributors. Here we show that peripheral injury activates AKT/mTORC1 in afferent segments of the mouse spinal cord, redirecting local core metabolism toward biomass production while simultaneously suppressing autophagy-mediated biomass reclamation. This metabolic shift supports neuroplasticity, but creates a resource bottleneck that depletes critical spinal cord nutrients. Preventing this depletion with a modified diet normalizes biomass generation and autophagy and halts the transition to chronic pain. This effect, observed across multiple pain models, requires activation of the nutrient sensors, sirtuin-1 and AMPK, as well as restoration of autophagy. The findings identify metabolic reprogramming as a key driver of the progression to pain chronicity and point to nutritional and pharmacological interventions that could prevent this progression after surgery or other physical traumas.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic pain</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>sirtuin-1</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Acutely painful injuries can transition into intractable pain states that persist long after tissue healing is complete<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Invasive surgeries are a striking example of this progression, with 30&#x02013;50% of patients who undergo thoracotomy or mastectomy still reporting pain one year after an otherwise successful procedure<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Similarly, up to 30% of people who experience accidental physical trauma go on to develop persistent neck or back pain<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Stable neuroplastic modifications associated with central sensitization underpin the emergence of chronic pain after injury<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, but the molecular determinants driving these changes are still largely elusive<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial to identify regulatory checkpoints in this transition to pain chronicity, which could be targeted by therapy.</p><p id="P5">Metabolic adaptations to the energetic challenges posed by injury are plausible contributors to the development of chronic pain. Synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) consumes a formidable amount of bioenergy, primarily generated through aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. ATP, the product of these processes, powers action potentials, fuels transmitter release and vesicle recycling, and sustains synapse maintenance and remodeling. When a peripheral organ is damaged, bioenergy demands increase markedly as neurons and glia in afferent segments of the spinal cord must allocate their finite resources to two opposing tasks: supporting enhanced neural activity while simultaneously generating the biomass needed to establish central sensitization. Three neuroplastic modifications associated with the latter phenomenon &#x02013; neuronal hyperexcitability<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, long-term heightening of synaptic strength<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and accrued dendritic spine dynamics<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> &#x02013; are, in fact, critically dependent on the production of new proteins and lipids<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. How spinal cord neurons and glia balance these conflicting demands is unclear. However, one possibility is that they reroute their core metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis &#x02013; a pathway that, while less energy-efficient than mitochondrial respiration, produces essential precursors for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and fatty acids<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Results from animal studies support the possibility that peripheral injury reprograms metabolism in spinal cord. For instance, hind-paw administration of formalin in rats and chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in mice promote central sensitization and lasting pain through a mechanism that requires activation of the metabolic controller mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its upstream regulator AKT<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, hind-paw formalin injection in mice stimulates both the expression of glycolytic enzymes and the accumulation of glycolysis metabolites in lumbar spinal cord segments ipsilateral to the lesion, suggesting an enhancement of the glycolytic flux<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Krebs&#x02019; cycle and oxidative phosphorylation components are concomitantly reduced, leading to a pronounced decrease in ATP levels. Importantly, this metabolic shift peaks 4 days after the injury and coincides with a decline in the local concentrations of various amino acids, fatty acids, and the fatty acyl derivative palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). PEA is an endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x003b1;<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, a key transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. During this critical time window, but not before or after, PPAR-&#x003b1; activation halts the progression to pain chronicity<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear whether the injury-induced metabolic shift and nutrient deficit independently drive this progression or represent an epiphenomenon.</p><p id="P7">To address this question, we examined whether preserving normative levels of amino acids, fatty acids, and PEA in the spinal cord prevents the emergence of chronic pain following injury. We found that a modified diet (MD-1) that counters the injury-induced shortfall in nutrients and PEA stops both metabolic reprogramming and chronic pain development following hind-paw formalin injection in male and female mice. Similar effects were observed in three additional models of injury-induced pain &#x02013; CCI<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, spared nerve injury (SNI)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, and surgical paw incision (SPI)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> &#x02013; but not in the complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant (CFA) model of immune-induced pain. Importantly, a nutrient-matched diet isocaloric with MD-1 but lacking PEA or a diet enriched solely in PEA was not protective, indicating that the effects of MD-1 cannot be attributed to nutrients or PEA alone, but rather to a synergistic interaction between these two factors. In mechanistic investigations, we found that, in mice fed a standard diet, hind-paw damage activates AKT/mTORC1 signaling in afferent segments of the spinal cord, enhancing biomass production and inhibiting autophagy. MD-1 normalizes both processes and simultaneously stops the development of chronic pain by engaging the nutrient sensors, sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Together, these results identify critical injury-induced metabolic alterations in spinal cord that drive the transition to pain chronicity. Importantly, our finding that pharmacological and nutritional interventions that correct these alterations prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain in mice, suggest that this approach could be adapted in the clinic to prevent the transition to chronic pain following invasive surgery or other forms of physical trauma.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Peripheral injury promotes nutrient depletion in the spinal cord and MD-1 averts it</title><p id="P8">Consistent with previous findings<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, hind-paw formalin injection induced metabolic reprogramming in the ipsilateral L4-L6 spinal cord of male CD1 mice, which peaked four days post-lesion (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Compared to saline injection, formalin administration upregulated the transcription of genes involved in glycolysis, while genes associated with Krebs&#x02019; cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were generally, though not uniformly, downregulated (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). Notable exceptions were succinate dehydrogenase (<italic toggle="yes">Sdhb</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Sdhd</italic>) and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (<italic toggle="yes">Ucqrq</italic>), whose transcription was elevated (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S1B</xref>) possibly due to their contribution to other consequences of injury, including suppression of autophagy and stimulation of apoptosis<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> (see below). Furthermore, levels of glycolysis metabolites were higher (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S1C</xref>) and Krebs&#x02019; cycle metabolites were lower relative to vehicle-injected controls (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S1D</xref>). Prior work has shown that this metabolic shift is associated with a substantial reduction in the local concentrations of 12 amino acids, 2 monounsaturated fatty acids [oleic acid (18:1&#x00394;<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>) and erucic acid (22:1 &#x00394;<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>)], and the endogenous PPAR-a agonist PEA<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. To determine whether this depletion independently contributes to pain chronification, rather than constituting an epiphenomenon, we formulated a modified diet (MD-1) enriched with the depleted substances (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Firstly, to assess the diet&#x02019;s bioavailability, we fed male CD-1 mice MD-1 for 25 days and analyzed blood samples using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Compared to mice on a standard diet (SD), mice fed MD-1 showed significantly higher serum concentrations of most supplemented compounds, including 8 amino acids, oleic acid, erucic acid, and PEA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The concentrations of serine and phenylalanine remained unchanged, likely due to biotransformation, as indicated by higher levels of their catabolites, glycine (from serine) and phenylpyruvate (from phenylalanine) (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S2A</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). Elevated serum concentrations of various tryptophan and tyrosine catabolites confirmed that MD-1 components were integrated into core metabolism (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S2C</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>). The absence of detectable cysteine, along with unaltered cysteine catabolites, methionine, and methionine catabolite cystathionine (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S2E</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">F</xref>), may reflect incorporation into proteins or conversion into compounds not targeted in our analysis. Other serum metabolites influenced by MD-1 exposure are listed in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S2</xref>.</p><p id="P10">We next examined whether MD-1 prevents the injury-induced nutrient deficit in the spinal cord. CD-1 mice were fed MD-1 or SD for 21 days before receiving hind-paw injections of formalin in saline (1%, 20 &#x003bc;L) or saline alone. This model is commonly used to study acute pain<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> but also produces a lasting pathological state that mirrors key aspects of severe chronic pain in humans<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, including bilateral hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, heightened anxiety<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, cognitive impairments<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, and structural CNS alterations<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Four days post-formalin injection, we harvested the ipsilateral L4-L6 spinal cord and quantified metabolites by LC/MS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). As previously observed in C57Bl6 mice<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, formalin- treated, SD-fed mice exhibited lower spinal cord levels of various amino acids, oleic acid, erucic acid, and PEA, compared to uninjured (vehicle-injected) controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). No such decline was observed, however, in formalin-treated, MD-1-fed mice, where levels of these substances were either stable or slightly elevated compared to uninjured mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). In the latter, MD-1 increased spinal cord concentrations of PEA and 4 of the 12 amino acids supplemented by the diet (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S3</xref>). Other metabolomic changes elicited by MD-1 in the L4-L6 spinal cord of uninjured mice are detailed in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S3</xref>. MD-1&#x02019;s ability to avert nutrient depletion in the spinal cord encouraged us to utilize this diet to investigate the relationship between injury-induced metabolic alterations and chronic pain development.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MD-1 prevents injury-induced metabolic reprogramming in the spinal cord</title><p id="P11"><xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the effects of MD-1, alone or in combination with formalin treatment, on the expression of genes associated with energy metabolism in L4-L6 spinal cord. In uninjured mice, MD-1 enhanced the transcription of glycolytic enzyme genes, including aldolase (<italic toggle="yes">Aldob</italic>), triosephosphate isomerase (<italic toggle="yes">Tpi1</italic>), and lactate dehydrogenase (<italic toggle="yes">Ldha</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ldhb</italic>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The diet also increased the expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, such as ATP synthase subunit g (<italic toggle="yes">Atp5l</italic>), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C2 (<italic toggle="yes">Cox6c2</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">Sdh (a, b</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">d)</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Ucqrq1</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, MD-1 induced a slight downward trend in the transcription of Krebs&#x02019; cycle-related genes, with citrate synthase (<italic toggle="yes">Cs</italic>) showing borderline statistical significance (P = 0.05) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, these transcriptional modifications, along with others reported in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S4</xref>, were not accompanied by detectable changes in glycolysis or Krebs&#x02019; cycle metabolites (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S4</xref>). In contrast, MD-1 effectively counteracted all molecular changes caused by formalin injection, blocking the upregulation of glycolytic genes and the downregulation of genes involved in Krebs&#x02019; cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S5</xref>; see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S4</xref> for <xref rid="S49" ref-type="sec">statistical analyses</xref>) as well as the shifts in glycolysis and Krebs&#x02019; cycle metabolites (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, MD-1 preserved normative ATP levels in formalin-treated mice without altering them in controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Changes in other purines, which were variably affected by the lesion, were also blocked by MD-1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The results suggest that MD-1 has limited impact on bioenergy production in uninjured mice but averts metabolic reprogramming after injury.</p><p id="P12">The serine/threonine kinase AKT and its downstream target mTORC1 are pivotal regulators of energy metabolism<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.

To determine whether AKT and mTORC1 are involved in chronic pain development, we treated SD-fed mice with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 (240 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, IP)<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> or the mTORC1/2 inhibitor Torin-1 (20 mg/kg, IP)<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> once daily on days 2, 3, and 4 post-formalin (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S7A</xref>).

Accordingly, the transcription of numerous genes involved in the production of neuroglial biomass was enhanced in the ipsilateral L4-L6 spinal cord of SD-fed, formalin-treated mice relative to uninjured controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>; see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S5</xref> for <xref rid="S49" ref-type="sec">statistical analyses</xref>).

In SD-fed mice, CCI and SNI caused lasting (&#x0003e;3 weeks) ipsilateral hypersensitivity, while MD-1-exposed mice were substantially protected (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Moreover, SNI mice exhibited long-term memory deficits, which were also prevented by MD-1 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S24</xref>). Similarly, SD-fed mice subjected to SPI (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>) developed ipsilateral hypersensitivity, although of shorter duration (&#x0003c;2 weeks) than CCI or SNI (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). This painful state was markedly attenuated by MD-1 exposure (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). MD-1 also normalized the nocifensive response to prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) administered on post-surgical day 14 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>), indicating that nociceptive priming<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> was blocked.

Firstly, our molecular and pharmacological studies elucidate the metabolic cascade connecting injury-induced AKT/mTORC1 activation to the establishment of chronic pain. They demonstrate that peripheral injury stimulates biomass production and inhibits autophagy-mediated biomass reclamation in afferent segments of the spinal cord, thus creating a resource allocation crisis that depletes vulnerable pools of amino acids and fatty acids. This crisis is exacerbated by the concomitant activation of the PEA-degrading enzyme N-acylethanolamine acid amidase<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>, which lowers PEA-mediated signaling at PPAR-&#x003b1;<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>, aggravating mitochondrial dysfunction<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> and promoting neuroinflammation<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. Secondly, experiments with the modified diet MD-1 reveal that the combined depletion of nutrients and PEA drives pain chronification, rather than being a by-product of metabolic reprogramming. This finding carries significant translational implications as it suggests that targeted nutritional interventions could be used to prevent chronic pain following invasive surgeries or other forms of physical trauma. Thirdly, mechanistic studies indicate that activation of SIRT1 and AMPK&#x02014;two nutrient sensors typically recruited under conditions of energy scarcity<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>&#x02014;and the consequent restoration of autophagy mediate the protective effects of MD-1.

They demonstrate that AKT/mTORC1 signaling promotes the transcriptional upregulation of glycolysis-related genes, increasing the levels of glycolytic metabolites, which provide fuel for protein and lipid biosynthesis in support of neuroplasticity<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Concomitantly, SIRT1 and AMPK activities are downregulated, autophagy is suppressed, and critical amino acids, fatty acids, and PEA become depleted. Two key observations underscore the functional impact of this depletion: firstly, correcting the nutrient/PEA deficit with MD-1 stops the molecular cascade initiated by injury and interrupts pain chronification; secondly, inhibiting autophagy negates the protective effects of MD-1 and allows minor injuries to transition into lasting pain. These results emphasize the central role of core metabolism in chronic pain development, while raising several critical questions for future research, including: Which extracellular signals initiate injury-induced metabolic reprogramming? Which cell types release these signals and which ones respond? and How does metabolic reprogramming reshape neuroglial structure in the spinal cord, to consolidate a painful state? Answering these questions will illuminate critical mechanistic aspects of the transition to pain chronicity and facilitate therapeutic discovery.</p><p id="P28">We designed MD-1 to augment the daily intake of specific amino acids, fatty acids, and PEA, which are depleted in the spinal cord following peripheral tissue damage. Pharmacokinetic studies show that MD-1 is systemically bioavailable and prevents this depletion. Replenishing the reduced nutrients normalizes energy metabolism and biomass generation, reinstates autophagy, and stops chronic pain development. Mechanistic investigations reveal three significant features of these effects. Firstly, the effects exhibit dose- and time-dependence, indicating that MD-1 interferes with specific steps of the molecular cascade triggered by injury. Secondly, the effects rely on a synergistic interaction between MD-1&#x02019;s constituents: neither an isocaloric diet enriched solely with amino acids and fatty acids (MD-4) nor one supplemented exclusively with PEA (MD-5) provides more than partial and transient protection. Interestingly, at doses significantly exceeding those in MD-1, PEA, like other PPAR-&#x003b1; agonists, can circumvent the need for nutrient supplementation, directly inhibiting pain chronification and underscoring the pivotal regulatory function of PPAR-&#x003b1; in this process<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Lastly, MD-1 enhances SIRT1 expression and AMPK activity &#x02013; both of which are suppressed in the spinal cord of injured mice &#x02013; while pharmacological activation of SIRT1 or AMPK replicates most, though not all, of MD-1&#x02019;s effects. These findings highlight the integral role of SIRT1 and AMPK in modulating injury responses and mediating the therapeutic benefits of MD-1.</p><p id="P29">The best-understood function of SIRT1 and AMPK is to align core metabolism with energy availability<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup>. Notably, the most distinctive effects of these nutrient sensors are reminiscent of those produced by MD-1. For example, in liver and skeletal muscle, SIRT1 engages PPAR-&#x003b1; and PGC1&#x003b1;, among other targets, to suppress glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis and promote fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup>. Additionally, by interacting with mTORC1 and autophagosome component LC3B, SIRT1 represses global protein translation and enhances autophagy<sup><xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>. Similarly, AMPK downregulates anabolic processes and upregulates autophagy<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. AMPK also forms a positive feedback loop with SIRT1 in which AMPK recruits SIRT1 by upregulating the NAD<sup>+</sup>-synthetic enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase<sup><xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup>, while SIRT1 recruits AMPK by deacetylating its upstream kinase, liver kinase B1<sup><xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup>. Our studies show that activation of SIRT1 and AMPK&#x02014;achieved pharmacologically (using SRT2104 and metformin, respectively) or nutritionally (using MD-1)&#x02014;effectively prevents pain chronification following injury. Interestingly, SIRT1 activation may also account for two effects of MD-1 that appear unrelated to the correction of injury-induced alterations in the spinal cord, namely, the diet&#x02019;s ability to attenuate the acute nocifensive and inflammatory reaction to formalin and accelerate wound healing<sup><xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup>. These findings highlight a system-wide impact of MD-1 and suggest its potential applicability to a broad range of diseases, including age-related pathologies where SIRT1 and AMPK downregulation is implicated<sup><xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup>. Further studies are needed to explore these possibilities and clarify the precise mechanism through which SIRT1 and AMPK modulate the transition to chronic pain.</p><p id="P30">We conducted our mechanistic experiments in mice subjected to hind-paw formalin injection. We chose this model for three reasons. Firstly, while typically employed to study acute nociception<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, it also produces a lasting phenotype that replicates key features of severe chronic pain in humans&#x02014;such as contralateral sensitization and structural reorganization of the forebrain<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>&#x02014; features not fully replicated by other models<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. Secondly, the graded nature of the formalin response provides a valuable framework for investigating factors that either facilitate or repress pain chronification. Here, we leveraged this property to evaluate the roles of autophagy suppression and SIRT1 or AMPK activation. Thirdly, prior studies have identified a critical window for pain chronification in this model<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, which we selected for our transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. To evaluate the generalizability and translational relevance of MD-1&#x02019;s effects, we tested the diet in four additional pain models: SNI, which involves partial sciatic nerve transection<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>; CCI, mimicking nerve compression and inflammation via sciatic nerve ligation<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; SPI, inducing inflammation and sensitization through paw incision<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>; and CFA, characterized by immune-driven pain without direct nerve injury<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. MD-1 demonstrated robust efficacy across all models except CFA, reinforcing the external validity of our findings and identifying post-surgical pain as a plausible clinical indication for this dietary intervention. The lack of effect in the CFA model confirms the existence of mechanistic differences between injury-induced and immune-driven pain<sup><xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup>, warranting further investigation.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, our findings indicate that injury induces, via AKT/mTORC1 activation, metabolic reprogramming, biomass production, and autophagy suppression. These processes converge to cause a resource allocation crisis that depletes key nutrients and PEA in the spinal cord and drives the transition to chronic pain, most likely by disrupting normal neuroplasticity. MD-1&#x02019;s efficacy in halting this transition underscores the critical role played by core metabolism in this process. By replenishing amino acids, fatty acids, and PEA, MD-1 enhances SIRT1 and AMPK activity, re-establishes autophagy, and prevents pain chronification across multiple mouse models. Thus, the results not only reveal novel mechanistic factors driving the progression to pain chronicity but also provide a basis for pharmacological and nutritional interventions targeting this progression.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P32">This study has two main limitations. Firstly, it was conducted in mice and its results cannot be directly extrapolated to humans due to marked differences in the way these species respond to metabolic challenges (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.,</italic> exercise)<sup><xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the findings offer valuable insights to guide future clinical research: for example, MD-1&#x02019;s efficacy in mouse models of post-surgical pain, combined with its lack of interference with wound healing, highlights its potential utility in perioperative analgesia and postsurgical pain prevention. Moreover, the partial overlap between metabolomic changes in mouse serum and molecular events in the spinal cord suggests a promising strategy for identifying serum biomarkers of chronic pain progression in humans. Secondly, the study primarily focused on the spinal cord, leaving other potential target organs unexamined. Future investigations should explore the involvement of additional sites, including first-order nociceptors, immune cells, and various metabolic organs, which may contribute to the systemic response to the bioenergy challenges posed by tissue damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>STAR Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="S14"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P33">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Dr. Daniele Piomelli (<email>piomelli@hs.uci.edu</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P34">This study did not generate new unique reagents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Experimental models and subject details</title><sec id="S17"><title>Animals</title><p id="P35">We used male and female CD-1 mice (7 weeks of age upon arrival; Charles River, Wilmington, MA).

The library preparation was performed according to the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol. More specifically, the protocol is a two-step PCR that begins with the primer pair sequences for the V3 and V4 region with partial Illumina adapter handles to generate a single amplicon of approximately ~460 bp [16S Amplicon Forward (V3 region): 5&#x02019;-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACG GGNGGCWGCAG-3, and 16S Amplicon Reverse (V4 region): 5&#x02019;-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAA TCC-3&#x02019;].

This hypothetical model illustrates how injury-induced alterations in spinal cord metabolism may contribute to chronic pain development. Peripheral tissue damage activates AKT/mTORC1 in afferent segments of the spinal cord, initiating a molecular cascade (red arrows) that simultaneously enhances aerobic glycolysis and biomass production while suppressing mitochondrial respiration, SIRT1/AMPK activity, and autophagy. These metabolic changes create a resource allocation crisis, depleting a local pool of amino acids and fatty acids essential for the maintenance of normal synaptic plasticity. At the same time, increased expression and activity of the enzyme N-acylethanolamine acid amidase lower PEA levels, impairing PPAR-&#x003b1; signaling, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction, and promoting neuroinflammation. These events cooperate to foster the progression to pain chronicity. MD-1 administration (blue arrows) blocks this molecular cascade and prevents the transition to chronic pain by restoring SIRT1/AMPK signaling and reactivating autophagy. Whether neuronal apoptosis contributes to pain chronification is an open question for future investigation.</p><p id="P126">Supplemental Table S1.</p><p id="P127">(A) Composition of standard diet (SD) and modified diets (MD) used in the present study.
