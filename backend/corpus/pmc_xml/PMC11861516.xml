However, it remains unclear whether the strength of this association varies with the severity or level of treatment resistance of the depressive episode.</p></sec><sec id="sec5809"><title>Objectives</title><p>
To assess the risk for IJD in patients with severe depression and TRD compared to population comparators and patients with non-severe and non-treatment resistant depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec5810"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted parallel cohort studies among 600,404 patients with a depressive episode identified in Swedish nationwide administrative registers. The prospective risk for IJD, both overall and per IJD condition, in patients with depression of any severity was compared to matched population comparators. Additionally, we assessed the same associations comparing patients with depression to those with severe or treatment-resistant depression. Analyses were adjusted for comorbidities and sociodemographic covariates.</p></sec><sec id="sec5811"><title>Results</title><p>Overall, patients with depression were at increased risk for later IJD compared to population comparators (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for any IJD 1.34 [95% CI 1.30-1.39]; RA 1.27 [1.15-1.41]; PsA 1.45 [1.29-1.63]; AS 1.32 [1.15-1.52]). The associations were not significantly different for patients with severe depression or TRD.</p></sec><sec id="sec5812"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
Patients with severe and treatment resistant depression are at higher risk for inflammatory joint disease than population comparators. This association does not seem to be stronger than for patients with non-severe or non-resistant depression. Severity and treatment resistance of a depressive episode as identified in register data may not be valid depressive phenotypes for predicting risk for inflammatory joint disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec5813"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>
