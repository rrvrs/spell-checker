I will briefly explore how young adults use social media content to learn, experience and criticise their lived experiences, care for and treatment of mental health and illness. Arguing that these new developments in language and social practices around mental health and illness via social media need to be further explored, acknowledged and addressed in social science and this can be supported by work in the field of psychiatry.</p><p>To illustrate this, I will share empirical data from interviews conducted in 2021 and 2022 with young adults who speak about their mental health and illness online and have engaged with psychiatric services, for example, in-patient settings. Instagram and Tiktok have become important arenas for young adults because of the informative role they play in young adults&#x02019; understanding of what a healthy person looks like, or their ideas of <italic toggle="yes">the mentally healthy self.</italic> A concept I introduce in my research of which I will explain and explore through the presentation. In young adults&#x02019; understandings of mental health and illness there is a movement towards social practices that are intended to achieve (an idea of
) mental health and this is created in a powerful digital environment that is affected by capitalism, neoliberal discourse and exists in a context of multiple political and health crises in the U.K and globally.&#x000a0;Overall, the presentation argues that these mental health and illness social practices have transformed young adults&#x02019;s experiences by responsibilisation in self-care that both isolates and empowers their experiences.</p></sec><sec id="sec9662"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
