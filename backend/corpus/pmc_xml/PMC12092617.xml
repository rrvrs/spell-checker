Despite advances in early diagnosis and treatment, a significant proportion of patients eventually progress to advanced or treatment-resistant disease, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and strategies. In this study, we systematically analyzed transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and performed Venn analysis to identify genes associated with PCa progression. Among the intersecting candidates, SLC25A10, a mitochondrial carrier protein, emerged as a potential key regulator of ferroptosis. Further expression analyses revealed that SLC25A10 is significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and correlates with poor prognosis. Functional gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that SLC25A10 promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction and impairing autophagic flux. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays confirmed a direct interaction between SLC25A10 and P62, implicating this interaction in the suppression of autophagy and the promotion of ferroptotic vulnerability. Moreover, disruption of the SLC25A10/p62/KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling axis reactivated autophagy and inhibited PCa cell growth. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel oncogenic role of SLC25A10 in PCa and suggest that targeting the SLC25A10-mediated regulatory network may offer a promising therapeutic avenue for patients with advanced prostate cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Genetics research</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Cancer genetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82002707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100007219</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai Municipality)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22ZR1437300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Guopeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Cell Death Differentiation Association (ADMC) 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Among men worldwide, prostate cancer (PCa) is highly prevalent and ranks as the primary cause of cancer-related deaths in the male population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Patients typically present with localized or advanced diseases, and routine diagnostic methods include prostate-specific antigen testing, prostate biopsy and analysis, digital rectal examination, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, or health check-ups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Research indicates that factors such as family history, ethnicity, age, obesity, and other environmental elements contribute to the risk of PCa occurrence and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, within the prostate organ, multiple distinct tumor foci may exist, resulting in varying degrees of spread and treatment resistance due to tumor heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The heterogeneity of potential cancer-driving genes complicates the understanding of clinical characteristics of PCa and future choices for targeted therapies. Currently, treatment options for PCa include active surveillance, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, surgery, and cryotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, existing treatment regimens are often cost-prohibitive and frequently lead to severe adverse reactions. Therefore, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PCa and the development of novel therapeutic targets are of paramount significance in enhancing the quality of life for patients.</p><p id="Par3">Ferroptosis represents a form of programmed cell death triggered by the intracellular accumulation of lipid peroxidation and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Ferroptosis is associated with the pathophysiological processes of various diseases, including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Notably, the high burden of ROS and distinctive metabolic characteristics render tumor cells more susceptible to ferroptosis, thereby serving as a natural barrier to tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that drug-resistant cancer cells are susceptible to inhibition of GPX4 and induction of ferroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the induction of ferroptosis can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells may emerge as a novel strategy for cancer treatment.</p><p id="Par4">While the current research has already demonstrated the crucial role of ferroptosis in the cascading reactions of tumor metastasis and progression, the analysis specifically attributed to ferroptosis regulation in PCa remains limited. This study aims to explore how SLC25A10 promotes the progression of PCa by regulating ferroptosis and elucidate the associated molecular mechanisms. This provides potential benefits for clinical practitioners in devising more effective treatment strategies. By introducing a novel therapeutic target for PCa, this research holds the promise of improving the prognosis of PCa patients and actively transforming clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SLC25A10 is upregulated in PCa and associated with poor prognosis</title><p id="Par5">Firstly, we collected data of PCa patients and normal samples from the TCGA database. We then performed a differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis and the DEG functional annotation results showed significant correlation with the following GO and BP terms: &#x0201c;mitochondrial genes&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ferroptosis&#x0201d; (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Through an intersection analysis of the mitochondria, ferroptosis, and DEGs, we ultimately identified genes that may be involved in inhibiting ferroptosis in the progression of PCa, namely SLC25A10, which is significantly upregulated in tumors compared to normal samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B&#x02013;D</xref>). Importantly, survival analysis indicated that patients with high SLC25A10 expression had a poorer prognosis, suggesting that elevated SLC25A10 expression may be a key factor in promoting the development of PCa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>SLC25A10 is upregulated in PCa and related to a poor prognosis.</title><p><bold>A</bold> The top 10 Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO and BP) terms that DEGs are significantly enriched. <bold>B</bold> Volcano plot shows the differential expression of ferroptosis-related genes in PCa. <bold>C</bold> Venn diagram shows the correlation of the DEGs in PCa, DEGs associated with ferroptosis, and genes related to mitochondria. <bold>D</bold> Differential expression of SLC25A10 in PCa and normal tissue samples. <bold>E</bold> The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curve illustrates the survival prognosis of PCa patients with high and low expression levels of SLC25A10.

The results clearly demonstrated a significant overexpression of SLC25A10 in the PCa tumor tissues compared to the normal samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). This finding was further supported by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, which also revealed a marked overexpression of SLC25A10 in the PCa tumor tissues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>SLC25A10 promotes cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness in PCa</title><p id="Par7">To further investigate the function of SLC25A10 in PCa, we established cell lines with SLC25A10 knockdown (PC-3 and 22RV1) for subsequent studies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Colony formation assays indicated that the depletion of SLC25A10 significantly suppressed the colony-forming and migratory abilities of PCa cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Additionally, we also observed that the knockdown of SLC25A10 promoted necrotic (Annexin V<sup>+</sup>/PI<sup>+</sup>) in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). And the transwell assay demonstrated that the lack of SLC25A10 significantly inhibits the metastatic ability of PCa cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). The migration of tumor cells is closely associated with the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, prompting us to explore the relationship between EMT and SLC25A10. The results demonstrated a negative correlation between SLC25A10 and E-cadherin, while showing a positive correlation with N-cadherin and Vimentin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Notably, the reintroduction of SLC25A10 into PCa cells with silenced SLC25A10 significantly reversed the tumor-suppressive effects it mediated (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that SLC25A10 promotes the progression and metastasis of PCa.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>SLC25A10 promotes PCa cells proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Western blot detection of SLC25A10 knockdown efficiency in PCa cells. <bold>B</bold> The proliferation of PC-3 and 22RV1 cells was detected by colony formation assays. <bold>C</bold> The apoptosis of PC-3 and 22RV1 was detected by flow cytometry. <bold>D</bold> The invasive capability of PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without silencing SCL25A10 was evaluated by Transwell assays. <bold>E</bold> The protein expression levels of EMT-related proteins in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without silencing SCL25A10.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41420_2025_2528_Fig2_HTML" id="d33e366"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>SLC25A10 inhibits ferroptosis in PCa cells</title><p id="Par8">To explore the link between SLC25A10 and ferroptosis, we first evaluated the ferroptosis levels of SLC25A10 high-expressing samples and SLC25A10 low-expressing samples based on the dataset. The results showed that the ferroptosis levels of SLC25A10 high-expressing samples were significantly reduced compared with those of SLC25A10 low-expressing samples. Similarly, we also observed that the ferroptosis levels of SLC25A10 high-expressing samples were lower (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Furthermore, subsequent Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GESA) provided additional confirmation that SLC25A10 may play a role in PCa through the ferroptosis pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). To explore the role of SLC25A10 in ferroptosis, we further examined characteristic indicators associated with ferroptosis. We observed that knocking down SLC25A10 led to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Moreover, biochemical characterizations suggested that SLC25A10 inhibition led to an increase in intramitochondrial Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Given that alterations in mitochondrial morphology are a hallmark of ferroptosis, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate mitochondrial structure. The results revealed that cells with SLC25A10 silenced exhibited smaller and fewer cristae in their mitochondria. Intriguingly, we further observed that knocking down SLC25A10 led to an increased number of autophagosomes within the cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Therefore, our results indicate that the suppression of SLC25A10 expression can induce mitochondrial damage, activate autophagy, and promote ferroptosis in PCa cells.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>SLC25A10 inhibits ferroptosis in PCa cells.</title><p><bold>A</bold> The level of ferroptosis in high SLC25A10 expression and low SLC25A10 expression samples (left); the expression level of SCL25A10 in high ferroptosis and low ferroptosis samples (right). <bold>B</bold> GSEA-based REACTOME analysis-enrichment plots of representative gene sets: Ferroptosis. <bold>C</bold> The representative images and statistical graphs of Mito-DEEP red staining in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without SLC25A10 silencing. <bold>D</bold> The intramitochondrial Fe<sup>2+</sup> of PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without SLC25A10 silencing were detected by flow cytometry using Mito-FerroGreen. <bold>E</bold> Mitochondrial morphology of PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without SLC25A10 silencing was observed by transmission electron microscope.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41420_2025_2528_Fig3_HTML" id="d33e413"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>SLC25A10 mediates autophagy inhibition through interaction with p62</title><p id="Par9">To delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of SLC25A10 in PCa, we performed single-cell sequencing to analyze the comprehensive scRNA-seq dataset of the entire cell population. Based on the expression of marker genes, we successfully identified eight different lineages, including T cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, monocytes, smooth muscle cells, NK cells, B cells, and macrophages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The proportion of the 8 immune cell types in tumor and benign samples revealed that the tumor samples displayed significantly higher proportions of T cells, NK cells, and monocytes compared to the benign samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). And Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> showed the distribution of SLC25A10 in 8 cell types.

Previous studies have highlighted the significance of p62 as a crucial substrate in autophagy, and ferroptosis is an autophagy-dependent cell death program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We also observed that the high expression of p62 in tumor samples compared to the normal samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Consequently, we selected SQSTM1 (p62) as the potential interacting protein of SLC25A10 in PCa for further analysis. What&#x02019;s more, the Co-IP experiment revealed that endogenous p62 could be precipitated by SLC25A10, and reciprocal Co-IP further confirmed that SLC25A10 could also be precipitated by p62 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). And the interaction between SLC25A10 and p62 was validated by transfecting Flag-tagged SLC25A10 and Myc-tagged p62 into HEK 293 T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). The further analysis of p62 expression in each cell subtype and its correlation with SLC25A10 allowed us to pinpoint the role of p62 (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Molecular docking results revealed three binding sites between SLC25A10 and p62 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>). To further investigate the binding region, we employed full-length and a series of truncated mCherry-tagged SLC25A10 constructs, along with HA-tagged p62, to determine the binding region in HEK 293T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Co-IP results showed that the S3 domain containing the amino acid 191-287 fragment in SLC25A10 could effectively bind to p62 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Based on these findings, we further investigated the impact of the SLC25A10-p62 interaction on p62-mediated autophagy. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in the conversion rate of LC3B I/II and a marked decrease in p62 expression in cells with reduced SLC25A10 levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>), indicating enhanced autophagosome formation, consistent with our previous observations using TEM. To further assess autophagic flux, we infected PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with GFP-mRFP-LC3 adenovirus. The results showed that SLC25A10 depletion significantly increased the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes within the cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4M</xref>), an effect that was reversed by the addition of chloroquine (CQ) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4N</xref>). Collectively, our findings indicate that SLC25&#x02009;A10 suppresses autophagy through its interaction with p62.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>SLC25A10 inhibits ferroptosis through p62/KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathway</title><p id="Par12">Through the STRING database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>), we further confirmed the interaction between SLC25A10 and p62. Interestingly, we also observed interactions among KEAP1, Nrf2 (NFE2L2), and p62 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). And SLC25A10 exhibited a positive correlation with p62, KEAP1, and Nrf2 as determined through IHC analysis of tissue microarrays (TMAs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Studies have revealed that p62 participates in the regulation of ferroptosis by activating Nrf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, the E3 ubiquitin ligase KEAP1 ubiquitinates Nrf2 and promotes its degradation. However, p62 begins to competitively bind to KEAP1 when the levels of p62 increases, which promoting the stable expression of Nrf2, ultimately protecting cells from ferroptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that the high expression of SLC25A10 in PCa induces the upregulation of p62 and further promotes the stability of Nrf2 within the cells.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>SLC25A10 inhibits ferroptosis through p62/KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.</title><p><bold>A</bold> PPI network between SLC25A10 and p62. <bold>B</bold> Representative IHC images of SLC25A10, p62, KEAP1, and Nrf2 from TMA in normal tissues and PCa tissues. <bold>C</bold> The PC-3 and 22RV1 cells were treated with 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL CHX for varying durations, followed by immunoblotting. <bold>D</bold> The Western blot showed the ubiquitination levels of Nrf2 in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without SLC25A10 silencing. <bold>E</bold> Western blot was performed to assess the levels of Nrf2, GPX4 and GCLC in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without SLC25A10 silencing. <bold>F</bold> Western blot representative images of HO-1, GCLM, and NQO1 protein expression in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without SLC25A10 silencing. <bold>G</bold> IF representative images and statistical data of lipid peroxidation levels in PC-3 and 22RV1 cells with or without SLC25A10 silencing, detected using BODIPY 581/591 C11.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41420_2025_2528_Fig5_HTML" id="d33e575"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">To validate our hypothesis, we treated PC-3 cells transfected with shSLC25A10 or control small hairpin RNA (shRNA) (shCtrl) with cycloheximide (CHX) and monitored NRF2 protein levels over time using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>, the initial amount of NRF2 was significantly lower in shSLC25A10 cells compared to shCtrl cells. Over the course of 2&#x02009;h, both shCtrl and shSLC25A10 cells showed a gradual reduction in NRF2 levels. However, the relative reduction in NRF2 levels was more pronounced in shSLC25A10 cells, indicating that the knockdown of SLC25A10 enhances the sensitivity of NRF2 to CHX-induced degradation. Furthermore, the ubiquitination levels of Nrf2 were increased following SLC25A10 knockdown (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Simultaneously, the loss of SLC25A10 downregulated the protein levels of NRF2, GPX4, and GCLC, inducing sensitivity to ferroptosis in PCa cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Subsequently, we measured the protein expression levels of several well-characterized downstream targets of NRF2, such as HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>, the expression levels of these proteins were significantly decreased in PCa cells following SLC25A10 knockdown. To further investigate the induction of ferroptosis, we measured the lipid peroxidation levels in PCa cells transfected with shNC and shSLC25A10 using the BODIPY 581/591 C11 probe. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>, the lipid peroxidation levels were significantly higher in cells with SLC25A10 depletion compared to the control cells. This increase in lipid peroxidation supports the notion that the knockdown of SLC25A10 induces ferroptosis in PCa cells. The elevated lipid peroxidation levels are consistent with the downregulation of SLC7A11, a critical antioxidant regulator, as observed in our previous experiments.</p><p id="Par14">We also observed that the loss of Nrf2 in PC-3 cells overexpressing SLC25A10 significantly suppressed PC-3 cells proliferation and migration, while ameliorating mitochondrial damage and autophagy inhibition within the cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A&#x02013;C</xref>).

Specifically, compared to the control group, tumors from SLC25A10-overexpressing mice exhibited significantly larger volumes and weights (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A&#x02013;D</xref>). Additionally, HE staining revealed that the tumors in SLC25A10-overexpressing mice displayed a more compact tissue structure, suggesting enhanced tumor proliferation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>).

However, PCa exhibits a relatively short duration of response to these treatments, leading to a lack of substantial improvement in the 5-year disease-free survival rate for patients. In our study, through in vivo and in vitro functional experiments, we have affirmed the role of SLC25A10 in promoting the progression of PCa. This potential mechanism may involve SLC25A10&#x02019;s disruption of ferroptosis in tumor cells through the regulation of the p62/KEAP1/Nrf2 pathway, thereby promoting the survival of tumor cells.</p><p id="Par17">Through functional enrichment analysis of DEGs in PCa, we observed a significant correlation between these DEGs and terms related to &#x0201c;ferroptosis&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;mitochondrial genes.&#x0201d; Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that relies on iron ions and differs notably from other common cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis and necrosis. Research has shown that multiple cancer-related signaling pathways promote tumor progression and resistance to therapy by inhibiting ferroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Excessive accumulation of ROS and lipid peroxides plays a crucial role in triggering ferroptosis, underscoring the pivotal role of cellular metabolism in regulating this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Notably, the unique metabolic activity and heterogeneity of tumor cells make them particularly susceptible to the effects of ferroptosis. Current studies suggest that various cellular metabolic activities within mitochondria play a constructive role in inducing ferroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As a result, integrating the DEGs in PCa, DEGs associated with ferroptosis, and genes related to mitochondria, we have ultimately identified a key molecular player, SLC25A10, which is likely involved in the progression of ferroptosis in PCa. SLC25A10, also known as the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier, is a mitochondrial membrane protein that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. SLC25A10 is primarily responsible for transporting certain dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates, among other compounds, from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria, where they participate in the process of mitochondrial energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, while the exact role of SLC25A10 in tumor cells remains unclear, an increase in SLC25A10 expression has been confirmed in various types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In line with these findings, our data reveal a notable overexpression of SLC25A10 in PCa patients, which is correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, heightened SLC25A10 levels foster tumor cell proliferation and migration while inducing disturbances in mitochondrial morphology and inhibiting autophagy within the cells, ultimately driving the progression of PCa.</p><p id="Par18">In the immune microenvironment, various types of immune cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, etc. exist in different functional states, including activation, inhibition, and tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The changes in these states can affect the ability of immune cells to recognize and attack tumors, thereby influencing tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Single-cell sequencing can reveal the diversity and heterogeneity within the same cell type, further elucidating the function and characteristics of cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Moreover, single-cell sequencing can be used to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development, identifying gene expression changes, cell type distribution, and the presence of subpopulations related to the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. By analyzing single-cell data of PCa and employing marker genes, we classified cells into 8 distinct types, including T cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, monocytes, smooth muscle cells, NK cells, B cells, and macrophages. Notably, SLC25A10 exhibits significant expression in epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are well-known as a critical cell type constituting the prostate. The development of PCa involves complex interactions between tumor cells, surrounding epithelial cells, and stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This implies that SLC25A10 may play a regulatory role in mitochondrial function and substance transport within epithelial cells, thereby promoting tumor progression.</p><p id="Par19">While mitochondria are closely associated with ferroptosis, the role and mechanisms by which mitochondria regulate ferroptosis in tumor progression remain elusive. Some studies have reported that upregulation of Nrf2 expression in tumor cells can safeguard mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of Nrf2 are not fully elucidated. In this study, mass spectrometry analysis and Co-IP identified an interaction between SLC25A10 and p62, resulting in autophagy inhibition and upregulation of p62 expression. Prior research has indicated that KEAP1 mediates the ubiquitination of Nrf2, leading to its degradation, while p62 competitively binds to KEAP1, promoting the stability of Nrf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our research suggests that inhibiting SLC25A10 expression facilitates Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, knocking down Nrf2 expression in cells overexpressing SLC25A10 significantly suppresses tumor cell proliferation and migration. We further assessed the in vivo role of SLC25A10-Nrf2. Consistent with the in vitro findings, knocking down Nrf2 markedly inhibits the tumor growth induced by the upregulation of SLC25A10. Our study indicates that the elevated expression of SLC25A10 in PCa cells inhibits ferroptosis by maintaining the intracellular redox balance, thereby promoting PCa progression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par20">In summary, our study provides evidence of elevated SLC25A10 expression in PCa, correlating with an unfavorable prognosis.
