databases
due to the need for sequenced genomes and the difficulty in obtaining
high-quality protein extracts. Olive (<italic>Olea europaea</italic>), a key species in Mediterranean flora known for its rich biochemical
content, presents additional complexity due to its lipidic structure
and high levels of inhibitory compounds that hinder protein extraction.
Consequently, various studies have focused on optimizing the protein
extraction methods for olives. While different extraction protocols
exist for leaf proteome analysis, their compatibility with LC&#x02013;MS/MS
has been scarcely studied. This work was carried out to compare three
protein extraction protocols for LC&#x02013;MS/MS analysis using olive
(<italic>O. europaea</italic> L) leaf tissue. Denaturing
SDS (Method A), physiological CHAPS (Method B), and phenolic TCA/acetone
(Method C) were evaluated with LC&#x02013;MS/MS data. The quantitative
comparisons of the three extraction methods revealed that Protocol
A gave the greatest yields. According to the results obtained, Protocol
A uniquely identified 77 proteins, Protocol B identified 10 unique
proteins, and Protocol C identified 19 unique proteins. Similarly,
the peptide sequence analysis showed that Protocol A uniquely identified
208 peptide sequences, Protocol B identified 29, and Protocol C identified
36. Moreover, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) results suggest that Method A may be more efficient in removing
and retaining hydrophobic proteins. Overall, Protocol A demonstrated
greater sensitivity, efficiency, and reproducibility in LC&#x02013;MS/MS
analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Olea europaea</kwd><kwd>proteomic</kwd><kwd>protein extraction

a wide genetic heritage
that includes more than 1200 varieties as well as many wild varieties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Adaptation to different abiotic stresses over
centuries has enabled such a great genetic diversity. With the increasing
requirement for table olives and olive oil with high quality standards,
the characterization of olive genetic resources has become an important
issue. Agronomic, morphological, and biochemical characteristics have
been widely applied to distinguish between olive varieties, determine
the origin of varieties, and also to study genetic diversity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p><p>The improvement of DNA molecular techniques has been accelerated
by the development of effective genetic markers for the characterization
of olive varieties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> For the identification
of olive varieties, SSR markers were able to discriminate varieties
and are considered a suitable technique. However, SSR markers are
limited for appropriate identification due to the low number of polymorphisms.</p><p>&#x0201c;Chemometric approaches&#x0201d; based on analytical data
have recently gained importance for the characterization of olive
varieties. Analyses were accomplished on olive tissues such as leaf
or olive fruit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> There are studies in which the
differences between olive tree varieties in the same geographical
region are determined depending on chemotaxonomic markers, such as
secondary metabolites. The studies were carried out as a result of
detailed examination of the phenolic profiles obtained by chemometric
LC&#x02013;MS/MS that allowed discrimination between various types
of olives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup></p><p>Proteomics is defined
as the in-depth investigation of different
proteins expressed by the organism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Its
purpose is to characterize as many proteins as possible structurally,
physico-chemically, and biologically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Proteomic
studies conducted for this purpose allow simultaneous examination
of the total proteome, its quantitative abundance and qualitative
presence, diversity, and localization within a population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Recently, the field of proteomics has evolved
toward more functional approaches whose priority is aimed at elucidating
molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular activities rather than
identifying protein or post-translational modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Proteomic include techniques based on mass
spectrometry (MS) as
the core platform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Quantitative proteomics
using liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
represents the preferred cutting-edge technological approach for proteome
characterization and quantitative analysis of the diversity of post-translational
modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Since protein synthesis
and regulation are directly altered by many environmental factors,
this method is necessary to effectively identify plant phenotypic
changes, especially against biotic and abiotic environmental stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Genomic and transcriptomic studies, which are
widely used today, cannot monitor post-transcriptional processes,
leading to increasing interest in proteomics in comprehensive studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> The liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry
(LC&#x02013;MS) technology has become the ideal method for the localization
and subcellular level dynamics of proteins. The capability of measuring
the complex protein mixtures has made it one of the recently used
methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> It can show the quantitative
state of a proteome and support the resolution of the cellular signaling
networks and protein&#x02013;protein interactions. This technology
is also useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of different
biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Nonetheless, proteomic analyses are also challenging
due to the
significant complexity of the proteome, which includes various post-translational
modifications, different protein interactions, and complex features
such as protein folding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> In addition,
the limited database because of the lack of sequenced plant genomes
is one of the biggest problems encountered when working with plant
proteins. The accuracy and efficiency of the proteomic study depend
on the effective choice of methods used in the protein analysis steps
(isolation, digestion, separation, identification, and quantification
of proteins).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Protein extraction is one
of the most critical steps in the proteomics workflow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> In particular, compounds contained in plant
tissues that affect the advanced stages of protein analysis, such
as phenolics, organic acids, pigments, and polysaccharides, prevent
the production of high-quality samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In recent
years, new methods have begun to be developed to improve and streamline
the sample preparation process and integrate sample preparation and
fractionation. In this way, it has been reported that experimental
time is reduced, efficiency is increased, and repeatability is improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p><p><italic>Olea europaea</italic> L. has significant
effects on health owing to its richness in a wide range of phenolic
compounds such as flavonoids, secoiridoids, tyrosol, caffeic acid,
and ferulic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Although <italic>O. europaea</italic> has a rich compound content, it faces
a lack of proteomic research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Proteins
in olives have yet to be investigated in detail, probably due to the
complexity of working with such phenolic and lipid compounds and,
therefore, it is tough to detect the amount of protein in this biological
material. One of the most important reasons is that the olive plant
contains phenolic and lipid compounds that lead to low-quality extracts,
reducing protein extraction efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup></p><p>Protein extraction from olive leaf tissues has several difficulties
because of the low level of protein content and the presence of high
levels of polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids, etc.) and secondary
metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Binding of polyphenolic
compounds to proteins interferes with protein extraction, causing
precipitation and inhibiting enzymatic activity.</p><p>To increase
the amount of protein extraction, optimization of extraction
protocols and the use of appropriate protein quantification assays
are important. Olive leaf tissues include endogenous enzymes that
can degrade proteins during extraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> The addition of protease inhibitors to extraction buffers prevents
enzymatic degradation and preserves protein integrity. The protein
content of olive leaves may vary depending on factors such as variety,
age of the leaf, and environmental conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> To accomplish consistent and reproducible protein extraction
between different samples, detailed standardization of the extraction
protocols is required. In spite of these difficulties, with careful
optimization of extraction methods and the use of suitable buffers
and inhibitors, it is possible to effectively extract proteins from
olive leaves for different downstream applications.</p><p>The dynamic
range of protein concentrations in olive leaf extracts
can fluctuate broadly, with some proteins present in high abundance,
while others are low in abundance. Accurate quantification of this
range requires the careful optimization of instrument parameters and
data acquisition methods. Proteins in olive leaf extracts are prone
to degradation during sample preparation, storage, or analysis, causing
the generation of nonspecific peptides or loss of protein coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> For that reason, appropriate sample handling
and storage are crucial to obtaining reliable LC&#x02013;MS/MS data.
LC&#x02013;MS/MS data analysis of olive leaf extracts comprises complex
data processing and interpretation steps. Database searching, peptide
identification, and protein quantification steps require the correct
bioinformatics tools to obtain meaningful biological understanding
from the data.</p><p>The primary purpose of this study is to develop
an effective protein
extraction method that can identify the highest protein content in
the olive plant with high efficiency for LC&#x02013;MS/MS. Studies
in this field are also important in terms of the characterization
of olive proteins, the discovery of new bioactive molecules, and understanding
the value of olive products. For this purpose, three protein extraction
protocols were tested, and LC&#x02013;MS/MS data were compared in olive
plant leaf tissues.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental Design</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Sample Preparation</title><sec id="sec2.1.1"><title>Plant Material</title><p>Olive leaves were collected from TUBITAK

to a fine powder with liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar. For

C, TCA/acetone), which was performed using phenolic conditions, differed
from those of the other two. For extraction C, based on the work of
Wang et al. (2006), the procedure was performed by adapting the TCA/acetone

by using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software with the Sequest HT search

of Sequest HT screening, 2259 protein groups, 5751 peptide groups,

Each protein sample was analyzed three times, and peptides identified

the incorrect results resulting from technical errors were eliminated.
Base peak chromatograms (BPCs) from each method displayed similar

that more hydrophobic

the same gradient was used for all three protocols, the differences
observed can be attributed to the variations in the protein content

peptides based on hydrophobic interactions, indicates that Protocol
A is more efficient in extracting hydrophobic proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>).</p><p>To further understand
the differences in protein extraction efficiency
among the protocols, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted
based on normalized protein abundances (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). The PCA plot revealed three distinct clusters

in protein expression. It allows for a clear visual comparison of
protein expression across the three protocols. In Protocol A, there
are a substantial number of red regions compared to those in Protocols

Protocol A is particularly effective at extracting proteins across
a wide range of abundances, especially those with higher expression

at extracting a broader range of proteins. Although Protocol B also
shows a red region, its range is narrower than that of Protocol A,
suggesting that it extracts certain proteins effectively, but in lower
amounts. In contrast, Protocol C predominantly displays green regions,

identified 77 proteins, while Protocols B and C identified 10 and

a broader reach in extracting diverse protein species compared to
Protocols B and C. Similarly, the peptide group analysis showed that
Protocol A uniquely identified 266 peptide groups, while Protocols
B and C each identified 38. This significant difference in the number
of unique peptides detected further supports the notion that Protocol
A is more efficient in extracting and preserving a comprehensive set
of peptide groups, which is critical for in-depth proteomic analysis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>. Venn

by the abundance
of phenolic compounds, presents persistent challenges in proteomic
studies. Phenolic compounds can form covalent bonds with proteins,
altering their structure and solubility The surface hydrophobicity,
free sulfhydryl groups content, particle size, and zeta potential
of protein isolates were significantly influenced by the formation
of the phenol protein complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Consequently,
protein extraction becomes a critical step that significantly influences
the quality and quantity of the proteomic data. Studies on <italic>Spirodela polyrhiza</italic> (duckweed)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and liverworts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> have demonstrated
the importance of optimized extraction methods in overcoming the challenges
posed by plant tissues rich in phenolic compounds and secondary metabolites.
For instance, in 2-DE studies, extraction with 50 mM tris-HCl (pH
7.5), followed by 20% TCA&#x02013;acetone precipitation, was reported
to be more effective for liverworts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Conversely,
the trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone/TCA precipitation method (TAT)
provided better coverage and abundance of protein spots in duckweed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Our study&#x02019;s success in addressing these
challenges through Protocol A&#x02019;s optimized conditions aligns
with strategies proposed in the literature, such as the use of suitable
solvents and buffers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Protocol A&#x02019;s
effectiveness in our study&#x02014;particularly in extracting proteins
with high hydrophobicity and broad isoelectric point (pI) ranges&#x02014;resonates
with findings that emphasize the need for modified extraction protocols.
Phenolic compounds and other secondary metabolites, often coextracted
with proteins, pose significant challenges by interfering with downstream
analyses such as LC&#x02013;MS/MS. Protocol A&#x02019;s ability to minimize
these interferences highlights the importance of using buffers and
conditions that stabilize proteins while reducing contamination. This
approach is consistent with advancements reported by Yan et al. (2020),
exploring the impact of protein-phenolic complexes on protein solubility
and functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup></p><p>The optimized
extraction protocol in our study significantly improved
the LC&#x02013;MS/MS performance, as evidenced by higher peptide yields

contemporary research on plant protein extraction, which emphasizes
the importance of advanced methods such as TCA/acetone precipitation
for preserving protein integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> PCA

that the differentially abundant proteins extracted by Protocol A
are distributed across a wide range of MW and pI values without a
particular concentration in any specific range.</p><p>Similarly, the
differentially abundant proteins in Protocol B compared
with Protocol C also show a wide distribution in MW and pI values,
suggesting that the extraction protocols do not favor proteins with
specific MW or pI characteristics. This lack of significant clustering
or concentration in the scatter plots highlights that the observed
differences in protein abundances are not biased toward proteins of
a particular size or charge but rather reflect a broad and diverse
proteomic profile.</p><p>Additionally, the histograms in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref> represent the distribution
of pIs of the

Here, a significant number of proteins with pI values above 9.5 were
observed in Protocol A, indicating an enhanced extraction of basic
proteins. In Protocol A, a greater abundance of proteins with pI values
between 4.5 and 6.5 was observed. This indicates Protocol A is also
effective in extracting acidic proteins, which are often more easily
solubilized due to their negative charge in physiological buffers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> The enrichment of proteins with pI values above

the basic proteins suggests that it employs conditions (e.g., higher

proteins exclusive to Protocol A. When compared to the total protein
distribution, a noticeable increase in proteins with pI values between
4.5 and 7, as well as between 10.5 and 11.5, was observed. This indicates
that Protocol A uniquely captures proteins across a broad pI range,
including both acidic and basic proteins, enhancing the overall proteome
coverage.</p><p>It was shown that proteins with lower pI values tend
to be enriched
in buffers with moderate to lower pH ranges, where they remain soluble.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> Thus, the effectiveness of Protocol A in this
range implies that it optimizes conditions that allow for greater
solubility of these acidic proteins compared to Protocol C.</p><p>The broader pI range covered by Protocol A indicates that this
protocol enhances proteome coverage by effectively extracting proteins
across the acidic and basic ends of the spectrum. This reflects the
importance of using multiple conditions or optimized buffers to achieve
more comprehensive proteome profiling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> Studies show that single extraction protocols often lose proteins
with extreme pI values (either very acidic or basic), but approaches
that use altered conditions for different pI ranges can overcome this
limitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> The findings emphasize the
critical role of pI in determining the protein extraction efficiency.
Protocol A demonstrates a wider pI coverage, enhancing its utility
for comprehensive proteome analysis. This is consistent with proteomic
studies emphasizing the importance of modifying extraction protocols
to capture proteins across a diverse range of pIs to avoid biased
proteome representation.</p><p>The gene ontology (GO) database was
used to categorize differentially
expressed proteins enriched by three extraction methods. For this
purpose, three main hierarchically structured GO terms were used:
the biological process, the cellular components, and the molecular

groups within the molecular function pathways was obtained from Protocol
A. Protocol C was more effective than Protocol A in detecting proteins
in the &#x0201c;transporter activity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;signal transduction

the proteome of olive leaves. The improvement in yield and purity
of extracted protein has significant effects for downstream applications,
such as proteomic studies exploring the abiotic and biotic stress
responses of olive plants, which are essential for developing more

The identification of unique proteins suggests that the SDS Protocol

to maximize oil quality specifications, particularly in terms of fatty

However, while the study focused on olive leaves, application of the

a more comprehensive understanding of the olive proteome. Expending
the analysis to other tissues will also help comparisons between different
