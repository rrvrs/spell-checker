Methods: Immune responses in vaccinated mice and guinea pigs were assessed through ELISA assays. Results: Successful membrane anchorage and stability of the chimera were confirmed. Immune evaluations showed no enhancement from combining recombinant bacteria, indicating either bacterium suffices in a single formulation. Chimeric expression yielded immunogenicity equivalent to 10 &#x000b5;g of recombinant protein, with similar antibody titers. IgG1/IgG2a levels and Th1, Th2, and Th17 markers indicated a mixed immune response, providing broad humoral and cellular protection. Responses to BCoV, BRoVA, ETEC, and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> antigens remained strong and did not interfere with chimera-specific responses, potentially boosting NCD vaccine efficacy. Conclusions: The chimera demonstrated robust immunogenicity, supporting its potential as a viable vaccine candidate against EHEC O157:H7.

Introduction</title><p>Enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) is a zoonotic pathogen that poses a significant public health concern. The most relevant serotype to human health is serotype O157:H7, known to cause diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in humans [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HUS, a serious disease with global distribution, has a low incidence in industrialized countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan, with 1&#x02013;3 cases per 100,000 children under the age of five [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, Argentina experiences endemic levels of HUS, particularly affecting young children [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Ruminants, especially cattle, are the primary reservoir of EHEC [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with intermittent shedding of the bacteria through feces. Shedding is particularly high in young calves and around weaning the age [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Research indicates that vaccinating cattle against EHEC O157:H7 can effectively reduce colonization. A simulation based on data from the Health Protection Scotland&#x02019;s enhanced surveillance system predicts that cattle vaccination could decrease EHEC O157:H7 shedding by approximately 50% and this decrease would ultimately reduce the cases in humans by 85% [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This underscores the potential of cattle vaccination as a strategy to lower food contamination and, consequently, reduce HUS cases.</p><p>Additionally, several EHEC O157:H7 virulence factors can elicit immune responses in cattle during natural or experimental infection. Research of experimental and natural infections has shown that calves produce serological responses to proteins encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) such as Intimin (bacterial adhesin) and the type 3 secretion system proteins EspA and EspB, and the bacterial receptor Tir [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The mouse model has been instrumental in evaluating antigenicity and immunogenicity in research on anti-EHEC candidate vaccines. For example, it has been used to test newborn mice&#x02019;s protection against EHEC challenge [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], assess cytokine profile response after vaccination [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], compare immunization routes [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], explore novel EHEC vaccine formats [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and test the efficacy of bivalent vaccines such as Brucella-EHEC [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], OMV-based vaccine formulations [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], chimeric antigens [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and candidate conjugated vaccines [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, Neonatal Calf Diarrhea (NCD) is a multifactorial disease in newborn cattle, primarily caused by pathogens such as enterotoxigenic <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC F5+/K99), <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> spp., Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) and Bovine Rotavirus type A (BRoVA) [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Current NCD vaccines available on the market generally contain inactivated ETEC and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>. Based on promising findings from recombinant &#x003b3;-intimin and EspB proteins of EHEC, we aimed to use these same proteins in the ETEC pathotype and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Dublin to stimulate an immune response against these microorganisms and potentially protect calves from NCD. Additionally, antibodies produced against these EHEC proteins, may reduce EHEC O157:H7 colonization in cattle, thereby helping to minimize food contamination.</p><p>Since existing bovine NCD vaccines also contain BCoV and BRoVA, this study also evaluated the combination of the recombinant bacteria with these viral particles to ensure no interference with the vaccine&#x02019;s immunogenic properties. We assessed the immune response in mice and guinea pigs vaccinated with a recombinant chimeric protein, comprising the EspB and the C-terminal end of &#x003b3;-intimin (Int280&#x003b3;) antigens of EHEC O157:H7, anchored to the membrane of ETEC and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Dublin strains. This strategy aims to improve the efficacy of the NCD vaccine to protect calves against neonatal diarrhea while contributing positively to human health by reducing HUS transmission.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00124"><title>2.

A 250 &#x000b5;L aliquot of each culture was inoculated into 25 mL of the respective media supplemented with ampicillin and grown with agitation until reaching a OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.6&#x02013;0.8. At this point, protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) for 4 h with 200 rpm agitation at 37 &#x000b0;C. The cultures were then centrifuged (3000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>, 10 min, 4 &#x000b0;C), and the resulting pellets were retained for vaccine formulation after inactivation. This vaccine formulation was used to inoculate mice in groups 5, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the guinea pig vaccination group. Recombinant His-tagged Int280&#x003b3;, EspB and Chimeric proteins were prepared as previously described [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Moreover, the chimera sequence (2079 bp) was also amplified by PCR from the synthesized sequence performed in Genewiz. The amplicon was cloned into the His-tag expression vector pRSET-A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resulting constructs were subsequently transformed into chemically competent <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> BL21 (D3)/pLysS cells.</p><p>Protein expression was induced using 1 mM IPTG.

Previous studies have demonstrated that intramuscular vaccination with recombinant EspB and Int280&#x003b3; antigens elicits a specific humoral immune response in cattle serum [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and induces a specific mucosal secretory immune response through oral vaccination in mice [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, these specific antibodies can inhibit adhesion to epithelial cell lines, reduce T3SS-dependent red blood cell lysis, and diminish colonization and shedding in both bovines [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and mice orally challenged with EHEC O157:H7 [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These findings highlight the potential of an intramuscular vaccine containing these antigens, though optimization of the formulation is required to enhance protection and ensure commercial feasibility for cattle vaccination.</p><p>In this study, we designed a membrane-anchoring chimeric protein combining the EspB and Int280&#x003b3; antigens and evaluated its expression in two pathogens responsible for NCD: <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Dublin and ETEC. The chimera was successfully expressed in the bacterial membrane, confirming correct translation of the coding sequence for Wza-Omporf1 and the His(6X)-cMyc tag at the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. Expression analysis revealed basal chimera expression in non-induced bacteria, while induced strains exhibited consistently higher expression levels. The chimera also demonstrated stability under inactivation and storage conditions. Chimeric proteins, also known as fusion proteins, are increasingly utilized as vaccinal antigens in experimental and preclinical vaccine studies, as well as in licensed vaccines [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These proteins can encode fused antigenic domains derived either from two or more different pathogens or from distinct proteins of the same pathogen, as observed in our study [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The display of antigens on the surface of live attenuated or inactivated bacterial vaccines facilitates their recognition by the immune system, likely through the accelerated detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Surface display not only represents an attractive strategy for presenting heterologous antigens to the host immune system but also enhances the immunogenicity of these antigens. By maintaining their native or near-native conformation, surface-displayed antigens improve recognition by B cells, promoting the production of specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, these systems enable multivalency, presenting multiple copies of the antigen simultaneously, which significantly amplifies B cell activation and strengthens humoral immune responses [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The IgG responses to fimbriae and LPS observed in serum samples indicate the preservation of bacterial structures, an essential factor for future scale-up and licensing efforts. Immune responses from sera of both experimental models inoculated with individual or combined recombinant bacteria exhibited high titers of chimera-specific antibodies. These results support proper expression, anchorage, and membrane exposure of the chimera, as well as effective preservation of the vaccine antigen even after inactivation and storage. In immunization assays, no significant differences were observed between the use of individual recombinant bacteria and their combination, suggesting saturation of the immune response. This phenomenon of immune response saturation occurs when the immune system reaches its maximum capacity to respond to an antigen, regardless of additional doses. This is due to the finite availability of antigen-specific lymphocytes, receptor occupancy, and the limited capacity of antigen-presenting cells. Recognizing this phenomenon is crucial in vaccine development, as it helps optimize immunogenicity without unnecessarily overloading the system with additional antigens. In the absence of a detectable synergistic effect, a vaccine formulation containing either recombinant ETEC or <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> expressing the chimera alone would likely be sufficient. However, future studies should assess the neutralizing activity generated by both bacterial carriers against EHEC O157:H7 colonization in cattle.</p><p>Regarding chimera expression in the bacterial membrane, 1&#x000d7;10&#x02078; CFU of bacteria expressing the chimera were immunologically equivalent to 10 &#x000b5;g of the recombinant chimeric antigen. Immune responses at 21 and 39 days post-vaccination (dpv) were comparable regardless of dose in both models, suggesting that a single vaccination may suffice in a potential vaccination strategy. Furthermore, individual evaluations of the EspB and Int280&#x003b3; antigens elicited comparable immune responses, underscoring their importance in chimera construction and robust immunogenic properties.</p><p>Although no specific studies have been conducted to evaluate the lack of interference between these antigens within a single vaccine, the existence and widespread use of multivalent vaccines in veterinary practice (e.g., Bovisan Diar, Rotavec<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Corona, Fencovis, Block Neonatal) support the notion that combining these antigens is effective and does not result in significant interactions that could compromise the desired immune response.</p><p>Immunological analyses of responses to BCoV and BRoVA demonstrated that these viral particles induced strong, antigen-specific immune responses without impairing the response to the chimera. Similarly, LPS and fimbriae antigens elicited robust immune responses in both models evaluated. However, the animals may have had pre-existing specific antibodies against these bacterial antigens, or the responses might involve cross-reactivity with similar pathogens, as suggested by the basal response in controls [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00124" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Elevated levels of IgG1 and IgG2a observed in vaccine groups, along with markers of Th1 (IFN-&#x003b3;), Th2 (IL-5), and Th17 (IL-17) responses, suggest that the chimeric protein can elicit a mixed immune response to some extent enhanced by the use of the ISA50 adjuvant. This combination of humoral (IgG1 and IgG2a) and cellular (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-5, IL-17) responses indicates that a vaccine containing EspB and Int280&#x003b3;&#x02014;whether as recombinant antigens alone, fused, or anchored to the bacterial membrane&#x02014;could provide broad and effective protection against the pathogen.</p><p>This study requires validation in cattle, the target species for the vaccine.
