Although our understanding of AF&#x02019;s pathogenic mechanisms has deepened in recent years, many key questions remain unanswered, particularly regarding the epigenetic regulation of CACNA1C gene DNA methylation, which is still in its early stages of research. Previous studies have shown that changes in CACNA1C gene function are associated with various physiological states and diseases (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Assum et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Desantis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Donniacuo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2021</xref>). Although limited current research has demonstrated that DNA methylation in the promoter region of this gene shows distinct tissue specificity in rats (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>), and in humans, CACNA1C gene DNA methylation modifications have been linked to psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Penner-Goeke and Binder, 2019</xref>). However, there are few reports on whether changes in this gene&#x02019;s DNA methylation are associated with AF. Therefore, understanding the relationship between this gene and AF from the perspective of DNA methylation will not only aid in disease diagnosis but also provide potential therapeutic targets for related drug development.</p><p>Decitabine (5-Aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, AZA) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that can cause DNA demethylation, thereby activating gene expression. It is primarily used in cancer treatment clinically (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dhillon, 2021</xref>). Research has shown that AZA treatment of different cells can determine whether target genes are related to DNA methylation (Habano et al., 2011). In our previous work, we treated HepG2 cells with AZA and found that the CYP3A4 gene was affected by DNA methylation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we similarly treated HepG2 cells with AZA to observe the effects of DNA methylation on CACNA1C gene expression.</p><p>Using original microarray and sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, many disease-related epigenetic markers can be identified (Palou-Marquez et al., 2021). The omics datasets used in this study are all from this database, including expression profiles, DNA methylation, ChIP-sequencing, and RNA-sequencing data.</p><p>In summary, based on the fact that AZA intervention reversed CACNA1C gene expression in HepG2 and T47D cell lines, combined with clinical samples and multi-omics statistical analysis, we identified that DNA methylation at three CpG sites in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene is associated with AF status, and potentially regulated by ATF7IP and KAT2B. We hope to provide new perspectives and clues for epigenetic research in AF while also providing scientific evidence for the development of AF prevention and treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Cell culture and processing</title><p>The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was provided by the Shanghai Cell Bank, and the MycoEasy Rapid <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> Test Kit for <italic>mycoplasma</italic> contamination was provided by Beijing Cellapybio. The experimental process was conducted according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. HepG2 was cultured in high-glucose medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin streptomycin mixture in DMEM at 37&#x000b0;C with a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 5.0%.

The SYBR GREEN method was used, with GAPDH as the internal reference gene, and the StepOnePlus&#x02122; system (applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States) was used for fluorescence signal capture. The reaction system volume was 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, and the reaction temperature conditions were 95&#x000b0;C for 120&#x000a0;s, 95&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;s, and 60&#x000b0;C for 60&#x000a0;s, for a total of 40 cycles. The relative gene expression level was calculated using 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup>. Statistical analysis was performed using Student&#x02019;s t-test.

Sequential analyses including quality control, normalization, filtering, annotation, and differential expression were performed on the raw data to verify whether the expression of CACNA1C gene mRNA was affected by AZA. The fold change threshold was set at |log2(FC)| &#x0003e; 1.58, with an adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value (adj<italic>P</italic>) &#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p>The DNA methylation microarray dataset GSE62727 related to AF was downloaded (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), and potential DNA methylation sites associated with the CACNA1C gene were identified following the analytical workflow published by Jovana et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Maksimovic et al., 2016</xref>). Given the close relationship between DNA methylation and histone modifications, histone modification signatures were investigated within the regions of identified DNA methylation sites using seven built-in UCSC Browser datasets and their corresponding 13 datasets. These findings were then validated with ChIP-sequencing data from the GEO dataset GSE78113 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Platt et al., 2016</xref>) and two RNA-sequencing datasets (GSE153557 and GSE85353). Furthermore, a SE prediction analysis was conducted using a sample from GSE78113 through the ROSE software (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Loven et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>), potentially providing valuable insights for future mechanistic studies.</p><p>The AF-related RNA-sequencing dataset GSE138255 was downloaded (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Franco et al., 2021</xref>), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the RNA-sequencing data were identified based on the optimized workflow published by <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Sahraeian et al. (2017)</xref>. In this study, as our focus is on genes related to DNA methylation, we have customized a gene set named EpiGeneSet, which encompasses genes associated with DNA methylation, histone methylation, and histone acetylation, for subsequent data mining. The inclusion of the latter two is based on the fact that histone methylation and acetylation interact with DNA methylation. This custom gene set was selected from the C5 collection of the MSigDB database (c5. all.v2023.2. Hs.symbols.gmt). The GSVA package was utilized to observe the enrichment of pathways related to DNA methylation, histone methylation, and acetylation, and to explore the co-expression patterns with the CACNA1C gene. The fold change threshold for both differential gene expression analysis and GSVA analysis was set at |log2(FC)| &#x0003e; 0.58, with adj<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.

The multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was carried out, following the probes filtered out (including with low-quality probes, located on X/Y chromosomes, with mutations in CpG sites, and where a single CpG site aligns to multiple locations in the genome). An intra-group clustering tendency was observed for the two groups, particularly after the exclusion of sample AF6 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).

Potential collinearity was observed among Site_1, Site_2, Site_3, and Site_M (collinearity is commonly reported among neighboring CpG sites [31078719 2020 4.4]). This collinearity was confirmed using variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis from a logistic regression model, with all four variables having VIF values greater than 10 (<xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Consequently, subsequent multivariable logistic regression analyses modeled individual CpG sites separately with covariates (Age, Sex, Drink, and Smoke).

Genome Browser, we examined three enhancer-enriched histone modification tracks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3) across seven cell lines (HSMM, HUVEC, NHLF, GM12878, K562, NHEK, and hESC). We observed a high enrichment of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 signals in the intron 30 region of the CACNA1C gene in the first three cell lines, which also overlapped with three CpG sites. This suggests that the region may function as a gene enhancer or super-enhancer element (see <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom three panels). Next, we explored the expression of CACNA1C using RNA-sequencing data from these three cell lines (downloaded from GEO) via the geo2r tool. Results showed that CACNA1C expression (TPM &#x0003e; 0.1) was consistent across all nine datasets (three for each cell line), as illustrated in the bottom panels of <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>. In contrast, no H3K27ac enrichment was found in the remaining four cell lines (see <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, top panels), where CACNA1C expression was either absent or minimal (TPM &#x0003c; 0.1), except in hESC (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, top panels). This observation led us to hypothesize that this enhancer element could be involved in regulating CACNA1C expression. To further investigate, we identified a dataset from GEO (GSE78113) that includes ChIP-sequencing results for multiple enhancer markers (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and CTCF) in the Breast Cancer Cell Line-MCF-7, both under normal and hypoxic conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>RNA-sequencing expression data shows a positive correlation with the enrichment of the enhancer marker H3K27ac near the three CpG sites in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene. <bold>(A)</bold> The UCSC Genome Browser shows the enrichment of histone markers H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 across seven different cell lines.

As shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, there are clear enrichment peaks for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 signals at three CpG sites in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene, highlighted by red and green tracks. These peaks are more prominent in the hypoxia group compared to the normal group, suggesting that this change may be associated with increased gene expression. Since gene expression data was not available in this dataset, we used two other MCF-7 datasets (GSE85353 and GSE153557) to investigate expression differences between the normal and hypoxia groups. The PCA plots from the cleaned data of both datasets show clear group separation, with strong intra-group clustering (see <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). A radar plot revealed significantly higher CACNA1C expression in the hypoxia group in dataset GSE85353 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, adj<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), while GSE153557 also showed a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 difference, though adj<italic>P</italic> was not significant. Both datasets demonstrated a high fold change between groups, approximately 0.8 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, we propose that the activation of this enhancer may positively regulate CACNA1C expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Genomic analysis of enhancer markers H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and CTCF protein near three CpG sites in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene. <bold>(A)</bold> Analysis of ChIP dataset GSE78113 using Integrative Genomics Viewer to observe the enrichment signals of the four markers near the three CpG sites.

To investigate whether this enhancer could form a super-enhancer, we selected the M_H3K27ac_N1 sample and used the ROSE super-enhancer prediction tool to analyze the intron 30 region of the CACNA1C gene. The results indicate that while the position did not meet the super-enhancer threshold (9353.0164), it exhibited a strong TE signal with a score of 3,242 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, blue track and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The raw ROSE data is shown in <xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. These findings suggest that this region is a key regulatory element with potential pathophysiological and pharmacological significance, and further experiments are required to determine if it plays a role in the progression of AF and whether it can form a super-enhancer.</p><p>In summary, the enrichment of enhancer markers H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and CTCF at three CpG sites in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene supports its role in gene expression. This also implies that changes in DNA methylation in this region may influence these histone modifications, potentially regulating CACNA1C expression. Furthermore, to further explore potential regulatory genes, we screened an EpiGeneSet (comprising 447 genes, see <xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) related to these epigenetic regulations from the C5 dataset of the MSigDB database for downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>3.6 Epigenetic regulatory genes potentially related to the CACNA1C were identified based on RNA-sequencing</title><p>The RNA-sequencing dataset GSE138255 comprises four groups of sheep in different states: Transition group (self-sustaining AF without conversion to SR, lasting 13.75 &#x000b1; 4.50&#x000a0;days), Chronic group (self-sustaining AF without conversion to SR, lasting 289.25 &#x000b1; 50.29&#x000a0;days), Sham group (sham-treated, SR), and Control group (unoperated animals, SR). Due to the limited statistical power caused by the Control group containing only two samples, it was excluded (the latter two groups were merged in the original article). Heart sampling from sheep involved both tissue and cellular levels: tissues included LAA and right atrial appendage (RAA); cells included cardiomyocytes from LAA (cmLAA) and cardiomyocytes from RAA (cmRAA).

In addition, the first four rows of <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> show the number of DEGs between each group (Transition-Sham or Chronic-Sham) for the eight datasets. The results indicate that in LAA, cmLAA, and cmRAA, the overall gene expression level in the Chronic group was significantly higher than in the Transition group, while in RAA, it was reduced, likely due to the tissue&#x02019;s heterogeneity of cell types (e.g., cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts).

Although the mining methods used in this study differ from those in the original literature, many of the pathways mentioned in the original literature were replicated.

In this study, HepG2 cells treated with AZA showed increased CACNA1C expression, and this result was further validated in T47D estrogen-resistant cell lines. Analysis of DNA methylation array data revealed significant differences in methylation at a CpG site in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene between AF and SR groups. Pyrosequencing was used to assess methylation at three CpG sites in this region from human left atrial appendage tissue, confirming their association with AF. Based on ChIP-sequencing data, we observed that this region is enriched for enhancer markers such as CTCF, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1, suggesting that methylation changes in this region could influence CACNA1C gene expression. Using functional annotation data from the MSigDB database, we customized an EpiGeneSet containing genes related to epigenetic regulation. Subsequent analysis with GVSA helped define the EpiPathwaySet, which, together with CACNA1C co-expression patterns and methylation data, suggested that ATF7IP and KAT2B may participate in the epigenetic regulation of intron 30 of CACNA1C. In this study, the selection criteria and process for the cell lines and datasets used are detailed in <xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary File S1</xref>.</p><p>AZA is an adenosine analog of natural 2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, which reduces DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is used clinically to treat leukemia, as it prevents tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance, targeting the S-phase of the cell cycle (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Jabbour and Kantarjian, 2022</xref>). In research, it is widely employed as a tool in DNA methylation studies. Animal studies have shown that AZA can reverse hypermethylation in the Pitx2c promoter region in a rat heart failure model, alleviating heart failure symptoms (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, long-term administration of AZA has been shown to improve ECG arrhythmia and reduce left ventricular fibrosis in a rat model of spontaneous hypertension (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Donate Puertas et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, AZA treatment in HepG2 and T47D cells significantly increased CACNA1C expression, indicating that AZA may regulate CACNA1C through the DNA methylation pathway, offering insights for the development of epigenetic drugs related to AF.</p><p>The human CACNA1C gene is located on chromosome 12p13 and has multiple transcription start sites and transcripts. Among these, transcript 15 is expressed most abundantly in cardiomyocytes, consisting of 47 exons and encoding a protein of 2,138 amino acids. Studies on epigenetic modifications related to AF have shown that the regulation of CACNA1C expression is primarily associated with microRNA interference (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Binas et al., 2020</xref>), while research on DNA methylation remains scarce. A study by Zhao et al. using chip data identified a CpG site in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene as being associated with AF, though further validation was not performed (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, we reanalyzed the chip data and discovered two additional CpG sites near the previously identified one. Further analysis showed that the methylation levels of these three sites exhibited collinearity, and their association with AF was confirmed in human left atrial appendage tissue. Moreover, the Framingham Heart Study previously reported several DNA methylation sites associated with AF (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>), but these did not overlap with the sites identified in our study, potentially due to differences in sample types (blood vs. tissue) and population heterogeneity (Caucasian vs. Asian).</p><p>Through ChIP-sequencing in MCF-7 and other cell lines, we identified strong enhancer signals, including H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and CTCF, enriched in this region. The ROSE software predicted the presence of a TE at this location. Third-party datasets confirmed the association between this enhancer&#x02019;s activity and CACNA1C expression. We hypothesize that this TE may similarly regulate CACNA1C expression in AF, influenced by the three identified CpG sites. Studies have shown that TE are special regulatory regions in the genome that can significantly activate gene expression. They typically enrich histone modification markers such as H3K27ac and H3K4me1, which are commonly used to identify active enhancer regions, while H3K4me3 primarily marks active promoter regions. Additionally, CTCF protein helps enhancers interact precisely with target genes by regulating chromatin structure and forming topological domain boundaries. Furthermore, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 can promote recruitment of various transcription factors in enhancer regions, thereby initiating the formation of macromolecular complexes&#x02014;SE&#x02014;which regulate downstream genes in a condensed state, while CTCF protein, as a regulatory factor, also participates in the formation and maintenance of SE (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kravchuk et al., 2023</xref>). Although this site in MCF-7 cells was only classified as a TE, further research is needed to determine whether it functions as a super-enhancer in AF, requiring additional biological exploration and experimental validation.</p><p>In this study, we identified ATF7IP and KAT2B as potential contributors to the epigenetic regulation of the CACNA1C gene within intron 30 by analyzing differentially expressed epigenetic genes and pathways in conjunction with their Pearson correlation coefficients with CACNA1C. Earlier research found that the ATF7IP gene (also known as MCAF1) functions as a partner gene of the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, stabilizing H3K9me3 and thereby promoting heterochromatin maintenance or gene repression (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Timms et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies suggest that ATF7IP may inhibit cardiac reprogramming initiated by transcription factors like Mef2c, Gata4, Tbx5, and Hand2, which convert cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Knockdown of ATF7IP in this context was shown to improve acute myocardial infarction outcomes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Missinato et al., 2023</xref>). We hypothesize that the downregulation of ATF7IP during the chronic phase of AF may act as a cardioprotective mechanism. The gene KAT2B (also known as PCAF) encodes a protein that interacts with p300/CBP and belongs to the GCN-5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. It exhibits significant histone H3 acetylation activity and is involved in apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2011</xref>). One study found that downregulation of KAT2B reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, thus protecting against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Koutelou et al., 2021</xref>). Another study linked KAT2B variants rs3021408 and rs17006625 with an increased risk of coronary artery disease in the Han Chinese population (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2020</xref>). These genes are known to be associated with DNA methylation, and in our study, ATF7IP and KAT2B exhibited strong co-expression with CACNA1C in both LAA and cmLAA tissues, suggesting a significant epigenetic regulatory role. The specific mechanisms through which these genes influence DNA methylation at the three CpG sites of CACNA1C require further investigation. Nonetheless, the identification of these DNA methylation biomarkers in the AF model may provide insights for future drug development. Additionally, it is noteworthy that while DNMT3A expression did not meet the defined threshold, it was close and showed a strong similarity to CACNA1C expression, suggesting that a reduction in this enzyme may directly lead to decreased DNA methylation at the three CpG sites of the CACNA1C gene.</p><p>Additionally, in the left atrial appendage tissue and cardiomyocytes of sheep AF model, the expression of the CACNA1C gene was reduced in the Chronic group compared to the Sham group. Based on other findings from this study, we propose the following mechanism: prolonged AF leads to calcium overload in cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased calcium binding to calmodulin and recruitment of calcineurin. This complex promotes dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic NFAT, which subsequently translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoter region of CACNA1C, reducing its expression (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Nattel et al., 2020</xref>). The prolonged reduction in the expression of this gene may result in a feedback mechanism that also decreases the regulatory genes ATF7IP, KAT2B, and DNMT3A. This, in turn, leads to DNA demethylation at the three CpG sites in the region, which increases the activity of the TE/SE elements at this locus. Consequently, this boosts the relative expression of the gene, although its overall expression remains lower. The mechanism is illustrated in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>. This regulatory pathway might play a limited role in reversing the downregulation of CACNA1C during AF. However, targeted pharmacological interventions that enhance this reversal effect could provide a therapeutic approach to mitigate the persistent state of AF. In summary, CACNA1C is a critical housekeeping gene subject to epigenetic regulation, as well as other factors like transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, drugs, hormones, and disease states (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Jiang and Zhang, 2023</xref>). While no previous studies have investigated the regulatory role of this region as a TE or SE in AF, our limited data suggest this possibility, but further experimental validation and larger datasets are needed. Moreover, other genomic approaches (e.g., single-cell sequencing, ATAC-seq), proteomics, and metabolomics were not addressed in this study due to the current scarcity of AF-related data in public databases.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>FIGURE 9</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the regulatory mechanism by which the DNA methylation of three CpG sites in intron 30 of the CACNA1C gene influences the reduction of Cav1.2 protein during atrial fibrillation (AF).
