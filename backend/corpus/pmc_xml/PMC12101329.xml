After an ischemia event, RA reduces the effects of blood&#x02013;brain barrier disruption by blocking the apoptotic signaling pathway. However, the effect of RA on smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which are crucial to maintaining blood perfusion, has never been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of RA on the vasoactive response of middle cerebral artery SMCs in normal and ischemic contexts (O<sub>2</sub> and glucose deprivation, OGD). For this purpose, SMCs cultures were incubated with RA, and the vasoactive response was evaluated in both conditions (OGD and non-OGD). To simulate OGD, co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes were made and incubated with RA to analyze the effect of the secretome released by these cells on SMCs contractility. In non-OGD conditions, RA induced rapid relaxation of SMCs and, in the long term (24 h), promoted cell contraction. In OGD conditions, SMCs contractility patterns were different when pre-incubated with RA. In these conditions, NA loses its contractility effect, and SNP seems to revert its relaxant effect. However, SMCs pre-incubated with 5 uM RA show the vasorelaxant pattern typical of SNP, despite the OGD condition. These effects demonstrate an effect of RA on the vasoactive profile of SMCs, with therapeutic potential in OGD conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cerebral blood flow</kwd><kwd>neurovascular unit</kwd><kwd>retinoids</kwd><kwd>neurovascular diseases</kwd><kwd>middle cerebral artery</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>CICS-UBI</funding-source><award-id>10.54499/UIDB/00709/2020</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>CICS-UBI programmatic</funding-source><award-id>10.54499/UIDP/00709/2020</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>FCT&#x02014;Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia, I.P</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>European Regional Development Fund through the &#x0201c;Programa Operacional Regional do Centro (Centro 2020)&#x02014;Sistema de Apoio &#x000e0; Investiga&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Cient&#x000ed;fica e Tecnol&#x000f3;gica&#x02014;Programas Integrados de IC&#x00026;DT&#x0201d; (Project Centro-01-0145-FEDER-000019&#x02014;C4&#x02014;Centro de Compet&#x000ea;ncias em Cloud Computing)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Ph.D. fellowship</funding-source><award-id>2020.06616.BD</award-id><award-id>10.54499/2020.06616.BD</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funds from the CICS-UBI base grant with DOI 10.54499/UIDB/00709/2020 (<uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.54499/UIDB/00709/2020">https://doi.org/10.54499/UIDB/00709/2020</uri>) and from the CICS-UBI programmatic grant with DOI 10.54499/UIDP/00709/2020 (<uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.54499/UIDP/00709/2020">https://doi.org/10.54499/UIDP/00709/2020</uri>) with national funds registered in the budget of the FCT&#x02014;Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia, I.P.

Introduction</title><p>The brain is the most complex organ in the human body and is characterized by its constant energy demand [<xref rid="B1-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, the energy supply is crucial for correct brain activity, since combined with the high energy need, this organ has a limited capacity for energy storage [<xref rid="B1-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The supply of oxygen and nutrients through blood flow is, therefore, a continuous and extremely organized process, since small changes can culminate in pathological conditions affecting not only the brain but the entire body [<xref rid="B1-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To satisfy energy requirements, changes in blood flow are controlled by a set of cells that comprise a structure called the neurovascular unit (NVU) [<xref rid="B1-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The NVU is comprised of neurons, glial cells (astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes) and vascular cells [smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and pericytes], playing an important role in maintaining the integrity of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB) and the control of cerebral blood flow (CBF) [<xref rid="B4-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>At an arterial level, cerebral blood vessels are composed of three layers. The inner layer includes ECs, which form a physical barrier to isolate the central nervous system (CNS), helping transport substances to the brain and prevent toxins and pathogens in the brain environment [<xref rid="B6-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, these cells play an important role in the regulation of blood flow through the production of vasoactive factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), which then act on the SMCs [<xref rid="B7-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the media layer, SMCs are mainly responsible for CBF, controlling the blood vessel diameter to ensure that adequate blood pressure is maintained. Moreover, SMCs are also responsible for the distribution of blood flow, thus contributing to the basal vascular tone [<xref rid="B8-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, these cells are also necessary to preserve other functions related to the remodeling of the vasculature after injury. Finally, the most superficial layer, the tunica adventitia, is mainly made up of collagen fibers and fibroblasts [<xref rid="B10-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The interruption of blood flow leads to severe neuronal death, since, as mentioned earlier, the brain is highly dependent on a permanent blood supply. This neurological deficit due to inadequate blood perfusion is defined as stroke [<xref rid="B11-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Stroke can be described as ischemic (occlusion of the blood vessel) or hemorrhagic (rupture of the blood vessel), with the first type being the most prevalent [<xref rid="B11-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ischemic strokes affect roughly 13.7 million people per year and are one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide [<xref rid="B7-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During a stroke, several mechanisms are activated, including inflammation, activation of glial cells, increased intracellular calcium levels, and increased permeability of the BBB [<xref rid="B11-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Treatment options for an ischemic stroke are essentially based on the fibrinolysis of the clot responsible for blood vessel occlusion [<xref rid="B7-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, these treatments have a narrow therapeutic time window, benefiting only a small number of patients, highlighting the need to find safer and more inclusive therapies [<xref rid="B7-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B14-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A possible reason for the delay in developing more inclusive therapeutic strategies may lie in the fact that they focus, essentially, on neuron rescue. Nevertheless, vascular cells are also subject to ischemia and play an important role in the development of brain damage, especially SMCs, which are essential in maintaining adequate blood perfusion [<xref rid="B7-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As previously mentioned, the NVU ensures cerebral blood flow control, so the development of therapies must consider the different cellular elements that comprise this unit.</p><p>In an ischemic context, astrocytes release several mediators essential for neuron protection and survival [<xref rid="B15-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as harmful factors that compromise BBB integrity and neuron viability [<xref rid="B16-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, a few minutes after the injury, the injured brain cells produce proinflammatory mediators, cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) [<xref rid="B18-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="B19-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, it has recently been reported that upon ischemia, factors released by glial cells mediate the vasoactive response of SMCs [<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Retinoic acid (RA) is the active derivative of vitamin A and regulates gene transcription through the activation of two nuclear receptors, namely the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoic X receptor (RXR), playing an important role in neuronal differentiation, as well as in the development and maturation of the vasculature [<xref rid="B20-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, RA also appears to modulate the astrocyte-mediated inflammatory response by decreasing the release of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B16-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this sense, several articles have also suggested that this compound is important for optimal functioning in the detoxification system (of xenobiotics or endogenous compounds), where retinoid actions are required to detect, detoxify, and eliminate these compounds. Thus, it has been discussed that RXR (RXR&#x003b1;, RXR&#x003b2;, and RXR&#x003b3;) and RAR (RAR&#x003b1;, RAR&#x003b2;, and RAR&#x003b3;) can modulate the concentration of some cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, whereby RXR possibly leads to an increase, while RAR leads to a decrease, in the responses of detoxification systems [<xref rid="B22-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, it has also been shown that RXR can dimerize with the xenobiotic-sensitive receptors CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) and PXR (pregnane X receptor) and promote an increase in CYP levels related to a decrease in toxic effects on the body [<xref rid="B24-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, RAR seems to be related to the inhibition of these CYP levels, and several xenobiotics have been shown to have RAR agonist activity [<xref rid="B22-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this sense, the study of the effect of RA should always be analyzed from an integrative perspective between physiology, toxicity, and pathology. After an ischemia event, RA reduces the effects of blood&#x02013;brain barrier disruption by blocking the apoptotic signaling pathway [<xref rid="B21-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, its impact on smooth muscle cells (SMCs), crucial to maintaining blood perfusion, has never been investigated. Although the effects of RA on other NVU cells have been studied, research on SMCs is still needed.</p><p>Therefore, to evaluate the effect of RA on the cerebral vasculature, particularly on SMCs, we analyzed how the use of this vitamin A derivative affects the vasoactive response of SMCs from the middle cerebral artery. Furthermore, we also evaluated how this molecule modifies SMC functionality in an ischemic environment by exposing these cells to the secretome of neuron and astrocyte co-cultures, previously supplemented with RA and subjected to hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jox-15-00069"><title>2.

Smooth Muscle Cell Culture</title><p>Wistar Han IGS males (n = 10&#x02013;15) aged 12&#x02013;16 weeks (Charles-River, Barcelona, Spain) were used to perform the SMC cultures. The anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries are the main arteries that supply the brain. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the most frequently occluded by ischemic stroke. Therefore, the culture of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the MCA is very important to establish a model to study ischemic stroke. In this sense, cultures of smooth muscle cells were performed according to Cairrao research group [<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B25-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, Wistar males were anesthetized with ketamine (87.5 mg/Kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/Kg) and then decapitated. The brain was removed and placed in a petri dish with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mM NaCl, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO, 2.7 mM KCl, and 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). Both MCAs were removed using the proper surgical technique and put in a well of a 6-well culture plate (Orange Scientific, Lisboa, Portugal) that had been previously coated with collagen (5 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>).

Thus, understanding how the adverse environment alters the vasoactive function of MCA-SMCs, as well as developing mechanisms capable of controlling vascular tone, are of utmost importance [<xref rid="B25-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Thus, this study&#x02019;s first objective was to evaluate SMC response to RA. It has already been shown that retinoic acid guarantees the integrity of the physiological structure of the neurovascular unit, reducing the development of neurological disorders, and also can modulate the physiological function of the cells of the neurovascular unit, which is crucial for the maintenance of this physiological structure. Moreover, Kang, Park [<xref rid="B28-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have previously demonstrated that RA reduces the effects of BBB disruption, following the occurrence of an ischemic event, by inhibiting the apoptosis signaling pathway, which is relevant to its influence on stroke. In this sense, the pharmacological use of this compound is under intense investigation, and its effect on SMCs has never been studied [<xref rid="B21-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B28-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The culture method used to obtain SMCs, previously described by Quelhas, Baltazar [<xref rid="B25-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], promotes SMC growth in a synthetic phenotype which does not correspond to the phenotype present in blood vessels&#x02014;the phenotype responsible for vascular tone control. In this way, 48 h before the experiments, SMCs were exposed to a serum-free medium, for a period of 24 h, in order to promote the phenotype switch to the contractile state [<xref rid="B8-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B25-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B29-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Through the PCSA technique, the rapid effect of RA on SMCs was first investigated, and vasodilation induced by RA was evidenced. Moreover, to analyze the genomic effects of RA on SMC vasoactive response, these cells were pre-incubated, for 24 h, with different concentrations of RA (0.1 &#x000b5;M, 1 &#x000b5;M, 5 &#x000b5;M, and 10 &#x000b5;M), previously described by Santos, Ferreira [<xref rid="B30-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, in this study, the concentration spectrum was amplified, and the concentration of 10 &#x000b5;M was used as the highest concentration, since in the article mentioned above, the distribution of RA was performed with nanoparticles, so the distribution was more local, and 10 &#x000b5;M was the limiting concentration with no cytotoxicity effects for cells [<xref rid="B30-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The vasoactive response of SMCs was evaluated with the use of NA as a contractile agent and SNP as a relaxing agent. The choice of NA and SNP was based on studies previously performed in this type of cell, where changes in the vasoactive response were demonstrated in the presence of these two agents [<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B25-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, in SMCs, NA acts on adrenergic receptors (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;), of which &#x003b1;-1A is the most abundant in the brain. The &#x003b1;-1A receptors are associated with Gq proteins, leading to an increase in PLC activity and subsequent formation of DAG and IP3, causing an increase in calcium, resulting in contraction. Regarding &#x003b2;-receptors, these are coupled to Gs protein, which promotes adenyl cyclase activation, leading to an increase in cyclic adenosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-monophosphate (cAMP), which induces vasorelaxation. Regarding SNP, this vasorelaxant agent was used because the NO/sGC/PK/cGMP pathway is the main mechanism associated with the vasorelaxation of these cells and, consequently, with the regulation of blood pressure. As an NO donor, SNP induces activation of sGC, which causes an intracellular increase in Guanosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) production [<xref rid="B10-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our data demonstrated that the incubation of the cells with serum-free medium did not compromise the vasoactive response of SMCs, since these cells contracted, in the presence of NA, and dilated, in the presence of SNP, as previously demonstrated by Quelhas, Baltazar [<xref rid="B25-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Mariana, Roque [<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Regarding the incubation of SMCs with the different concentrations of RA, the addition of SNP did not enhance the relaxation of these cells, indicating that incubation with RA altered the vasoactive response of SMCs, possibly through inhibition of NO action, which may impair the blood vessels. Such results suggest that perhaps RA has two effects&#x02014;the rapid effect, which is non-genomic, and a long-term effect, which is genomic&#x02014;enhancing SMC relaxation only in the first scenario. The RA treatment led to a loss of the ability of the SNP to induce vessel dilation in the presence of NA-induced contraction. However, the contractile action of NA was not increased for all NA concentrations tested. Indeed, a double dose-dependent effect was obtained, with incubation with RA 1 and 5 &#x000b5;M inducing an increase in contraction with NA, and concentrations of 0.1 and 10 &#x000b5;M inducing a decrease in the contractile stimulus. Typically, when contractions are less evident, the effect of the relaxing agent applied subsequently is always less. This may explain the effects observed for concentrations of 0.1 and 10 &#x000b5;M. However, in cases where RA incubations promoted an increase in NA-induced contractile stimulation followed by SNP-induced contraction, there appears to be a more complex mechanism to explain, and molecular mechanisms should be studied in more detail in future studies.</p><p>As previously mentioned, several types of cells can adapt to these conditions during the ischemia period and release several factors that protect the neuronal networks affected by the decreased blood flow [<xref rid="B15-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this sense, to analyze the prophylactic effect of RA on the modulation of the vasoactive response of SMCs by neurons and astrocytes, reperfusion media of co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes, previously incubated with different concentrations of RA and subjected to OGD for 4 h, were used. The period of time that the co-cultures were subjected to an ischemic environment was previously defined by Roque and Baltazar [<xref rid="B15-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], who observed that exposure of these co-cultures to 4 h of OGD did not produce a significant decrease in cell viability when compared to other ischemic times [<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Our data demonstrated that factors released into the medium, from co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes, not incubated with RA and not subject to ischemic injury, did not compromise the expression or the activity of adrenergic receptors on SMCs, as previously published by Mariana, Roque [<xref rid="B13-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the incubation with RA, the PCC secretome causes a decrease in the NA contractile response, and since the adrenergic receptors mostly involved in the contractile response are the &#x003b1;1-adrenergic receptors, these may be involved in the RA response. However, the action of &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors in this response cannot be ruled out either.</p><p>Afterwards, the contractile response of SMCs was evaluated when exposed to the PCC secretome submitted to the ischemic lesion. Considering that co-cultures were subjected to 4 h of OGD, there would be expected to be an increase in SMC contractile response. However, instead of what was expected, the SMCs&#x02019; contractile response was significantly lower compared to their response after exposure to the PCC secretome not subjected to ischemic lesions. Such results contradict previously published data, which demonstrated that the ischemic environment promoted an increase in SMC contractile response [<xref rid="B31-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These differences suggest that the factors released by PCC cultures, when subjected to ischemia and followed by reperfusion, appear to alter the adrenergic response of SMCs via &#x003b1; or &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors. Under similar conditions (OGD group), incubation of the co-cultures with RA seems to promote the release of mediators that condition adrenergic activity. This fact produced not only a suppression of the contractile response but also a slight relaxation of the SMCs.</p><p>As previously mentioned, SMCs are the main regulators of blood flow. Therefore, these cells can constrict and relax in order to effectively control vascular tone [<xref rid="B10-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this way, after the evaluation of the contractile response, the ability of SMCs to relax when exposed to the vasodilator agent, SNP, was evaluated. The addition of SNP to SMCs, when previously exposed to reperfusion media conditioned by PCC cultures submitted and not submitted to an ischemic lesion, showed that SMCs remained viable and responsive, since after exhibiting a contractile response to NA, these cells were able to relax upon the addition of SNP. Nevertheless, after exposure of the SMCs to the secretome of PCC previously incubated with RA and not subjected to ischemic lesion, the mediators released by these co-cultures triggered a contractile response in SMCs after the addition of the vasodilator agent. In OGD conditions, their reperfusion medium altered the release of mediators from PCC cultures to the culture medium, conditioning the SMC response to SNP, possibly through the inhibition of NO action. Several studies report that the anti-inflammatory action carried out by RA triggers mechanisms that inhibit NO production either directly [<xref rid="B32-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or indirectly, through the action of other factors induced by the action of RA, particularly in cultures of astrocytes [<xref rid="B16-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, at a concentration of 5 &#x000b5;M RA, SNP-induced relaxation was observed, similar to the control. Indeed, it has recently been shown that in situations of OGD, there is a transient loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which is induced by transient occlusion. This event permanently damages mitochondria&#x02013;endoplasmic (ME) reticulum contacts and disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in SMCs, the driving force behind spontaneous myogenic vasomotion. In addition, the binding of mitochondria and ER by the specific overexpression of ME-Linker in SMCs restores cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, remotivates spontaneous myogenic vasomotricity, achieving optimal reperfusion, and improving neurological injury [<xref rid="B33-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, we can hypothesize that this is the mechanism involved in the action of 5 &#x000b5;M AR. On the other hand, at the highest concentration of RA (10 &#x000b5;M), this effect is not observed, possibly due to a maximum effect exerted by RA at a lower concentration, which does not allow the described effect to be realized. Future studies should be carried out to identify the effect of RA on ME-Linker in SMCs and in the restoration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</p><p>In addition, several studies have shown that RA can both increase and inhibit detoxification pathways following exposure to various xenobiotics or endogenous compounds released during ischemia, including ROS and proinflammatory cytokines. This contradictory effect of RA is apparently due to the activation of RXR or RAR, with RXR activation appearing to benefit the detoxification system and RAR appearing to potentiate harmful effects [<xref rid="B22-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the selective modulation of RAR and RXR isoforms may explain the contradictory effects observed in different tissues during fundamental physiological or pathological processes, especially during retinoic acid supplementation [<xref rid="B22-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The use of selective agonists for RAR&#x003b1; isoforms (such as AM 580 and AM 80), RAR&#x003b2; (such as AC 261066 and CD 2314), RAR&#x003b3; (such as AGN204647, CD 437, and BMS 961), and RXR&#x003b1; (such as CD 3254), as well as mixed agonists, such as Adapalene (RAR&#x003b2; and RAR&#x003b3; agonist) and Bexarotene (potent and selective RXR agonist), has been explored in order to modulate these effects. In addition, selective antagonists, such as LY 2955303 (selective RAR&#x003b3; antagonist), HX 531 (potent RXR antagonist), and BMS 493 (pan-RAR inverse antagonist), are important tools for investigating which isoform is involved and how the specific effects of the compound are manifested, particularly when ROS or xenobiotics are present, released during ischemic events, or capable of inducing them [<xref rid="B23-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B34-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The retinoid system plays a crucial role in regulating fundamental physiological processes such as embryonic development and neurodevelopment, and disturbances in this system can lead to unexpected results, such as increased toxicity after ischemia, rather than the expected reduction, highlighting the complexity and challenges in understanding and managing the toxicity associated with retinoid compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-jox-15-00069"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>With this investigation, we can conclude that RA produces different effects depending on how it is administered. The rapid effect of RA potentiated the relaxation of SMCs, while the incubation of these cells with RA, for 24 h, promoted SMC contraction when exposed to the action of NA and SNP. Moreover, given that SNP is not only an NO donor (nitrosylating agent) but also releases cyanide, future studies should also include the use of pure NO donors such as MAHMA NONOate, since this undesired release of cyanide together with NO can cause serious adverse effects when used as a drug for the treatment of hypertension or stroke [<xref rid="B35-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this sense, the combined use of RA and other pharmacological agents, particularly nitrosylating agents, should be carefully considered and better studied.</p><p>Furthermore, the observed results further demonstrate that RA modulated the effect of neuron and astrocyte co-cultures&#x02019; secretome on SMCs, altering their response to the vasoactive agents. In summary, the rapid effect of RA appears to have benefits through the relaxation of SMCs, which allows a greater supply of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. Indeed, synthetic forms or analogs of retinoic acid have long been used in the treatment of various diseases, including numerous forms of cancer. RA has also been called a promising target for neuroprotective therapy of intracerebral hemorrhage [<xref rid="B37-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For this reason, RA needs to be more widely studied as a neuroprotective drug, including in the prevention of ischemic stroke. However, continued supplementation of RA shows negative effects on SMC response after the occurrence of an ischemic stroke, similar to what happens in other parts and pathologies of the human body [<xref rid="B37-jox-15-00069" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the use of this agent as a drug for the treatment of stroke should only be considered as a treatment immediately after the event, and its prolonged use may be a good method for neuroprotection, namely the constriction of SMCs, which may be beneficial for the prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage events. However, future studies on RA are urgently needed for safe therapeutic use.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the technical staff of CICS-UBI Animal Facilities (Covilh&#x000e3;, Portugal) and, particularly, to Maria Jos&#x000e9; Pinto and Maria Jo&#x000e3;o Silva for the daily treatment and care of the animals.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
