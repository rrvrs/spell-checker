Both sexes are obligatory blood-feeders throughout all life stages, feeding in their natural environment on a wide range of terrestrial and arboreal mammals (especially didelphids, edentates, and rodents), birds, and bats [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In domestic settings, triatomines feed on domestic animals and humans [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], posing a significant public health concern as vectors of trypanosomatids, including <italic toggle="yes">Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> Chagas, 1909, the etiological agent of Chagas disease [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], one of the most important parasitic diseases in Latin America [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The subfamily Triatominae comprises around 157 described species, grouped into 18 genera, with 66 species occurring in Brazil [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although all triatomine species are considered vectors of <italic toggle="yes">T. cruzi</italic>, their vector competence varies depending on biological and behavioral factors.</p><p>In general, scientific literature shows that the feeding performance of triatomines differs between species due to factors such as size and nymphal stage, type of blood, mating status, host physiology, insect&#x02019;s feeding apparatus, and ambient temperature, among other factors [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, a fundamental requirement for successfully rearing these insects in insectaries is a thorough understanding of their biology [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Rearing triatomine colonies in insectaries is a labor-intensive task. While some species that are better adapted to artificial conditions (temperature and humidity) can be managed relatively easily, others pose significant challenges, as they require not only environmental conditions similar to their natural habitat but also specific food sources. In this regard, not all triatomine species adapt well to insectary conditions, and specific modifications may be necessary to meet the unique requirements of each species [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although there is extensive literature on the biology of triatomines [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], little is known about the biology of species fed artificially&#x02014;using artificial apparatus rather than live animal hosts&#x02014;over several generations and reared in insectaries. This knowledge gap largely stems from the varying rearing methodologies, which complicate data comparison [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the effort required to rear triatomines, it is also necessary to maintain the blood source animals. While there is a perception, not yet fully documented in the scientific literature, that triatomines develop better when fed on live animals, this method is not always considered viable or ethical. In response to these concerns, ethical committees are increasingly demanding alternative feeding methodologies to replace the use of live animals.</p><p>Ideally, physiological and biological parameters related to the developmental cycle of insects should remain unaffected by alternative feeding methods, such as artificial feeders, facilitating the routine replacement of live animals in insectaries. In this context, we tested the hypothesis that feeding triatomines with an artificial system, rather than a live animal host, would not impact physiological and biological parameters related to the developmental cycle of two triatomine species: <italic toggle="yes">Panstrongylus megistus</italic> Burmeister, 1835, and <italic toggle="yes">Triatoma infestans</italic> (Klug, 1834). <italic toggle="yes">Panstrongylus megistus</italic> is a native species widely distributed across Brazil and commonly associated with high infection rates of <italic toggle="yes">T. cruzi</italic>. It is currently the primary species of epidemiological importance in the country [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic>, although exotic, was the most significant species until the 2000s, responsible for about 80% of Chagas disease cases in Brazil during the 1970s and 1980s [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> is now virtually controlled in Brazil, it continues to be the primary species of epidemiological importance in various Latin American countries [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Despite the existing knowledge about the biological cycle of some triatomine species fed artificially in the laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], gaps remain in the scientific literature concerning specific physiological parameters of insects raised through artificial methods that need to be better documented, especially because previous studies have not analyzed some physiological parameters together. In this scenario, we aimed to compare the biological aspects of the developmental cycle of <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> when fed on live animal hosts versus an artificial feeder. Here, an in-depth study encompassing and analyzing several critical physiological development parameters in triatomines is conducted using robust mathematical models and analyses. Through the findings, it is possible to predict the long-term impact of artificial feeding on the biological cycle of two of the most important triatomine species in the context of Chagas disease transmission in Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>All experiments involving live animals were conducted in accordance with animal experimentation guidelines and were approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Laboratory Animals (CEUA/FIOCRUZ) under protocol number LW 10/18.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Insectary description</title><p>The Triatomine Insectary at the Ren&#x000e9; Rachou Institute (IRR) currently rears 30 species of triatomines, meeting the research demands of various institutional research groups, training and qualification of healthcare professionals within Brazil&#x02019;s Unified Health System (<italic toggle="yes">Sistema &#x000da;nico de Sa&#x000fa;de</italic>&#x02014;SUS), and the enhancement of specimens for the Cole&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Vetores de Tripanosomat&#x000ed;deos [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In this facility, semi-controlled conditions are maintained with a temperature range of 26&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C and relative humidity of 60&#x02013;70%, which align with the optimal levels known for most species [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

The lid was made of cotton fabric to permit the insect&#x02019;s mouthparts to pass through for feeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Experimental conditions</title><p>Three groups of 50 triatomines of each species were established and fed using different methods: Group A received blood from anesthetized chickens (ketamine&#x02009;+&#x02009;detomidine), Group B was fed using an artificial feeder with citrated rabbit (<italic toggle="yes">Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>) blood, and Group C was fed alternately&#x02014;one week on chickens and the next week on the artificial feeder. Each pot was labeled with an individual code corresponding to the experimental group to facilitate tracking in a spreadsheet. Insects remained in their assigned group and pot until reaching the adult stage.</p><p>The first feeding for the insects of each instar occurred five days after egg hatching, with Groups A and C feeding on chickens and Group B on the artificial feeder. If insects did not feed on this initial day, they were offered food daily until they fed. Following this initial feeding, subsequent meals were provided weekly, with each insect allowed to feed for 30 minutes. During the first feeding, the insects were allowed to consume blood to their full capacity.</p><p>All groups of insects were maintained under semi-controlled conditions with a temperature of 27&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x000b0;C and relative humidity of 50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20%. Insects belonging to the same species were fed on the same days. Daily checks were conducted to record occurrences of molting and deaths. An insect was considered dead if it did not respond to external stimuli and remained immobile on the pot or the surface of the filter paper.</p><p>Although the sex of triatomines can be determined starting from the first instar, we opted to sex them only at the adult stage to minimize excessive handling of the specimens.</p><p>The blood used in the artificial feedings was 10% citrated rabbit blood (25g P.A. citrate, 8g citric acid, and 24.5g glucose). This blood is collected, prepared, and sterilized at the Institute of Science and Technology in Biomodels (ICTB)/Fiocruz. It is packaged in an autoclavable glass bottle with a rubber cap, sealed, and distributed chilled on dry ice to the laboratories. In the laboratory, the blood is immediately stored at -20&#x000b0;C and used within 10 days of being collected.</p><p>The artificial feeding device used consisted of a glass apparatus, made by a craftsman in the shape of a baby bottle, with an external compartment for circulating water heated by an attached water bath and an internal compartment containing the blood. The water temperature was set at 40&#x000b0;C, and the blood temperature in the bottles remained at 39.5&#x000b0;C. The membrane used to cover the feeding bottle was a latex membrane. These were obtained from natural latex gloves, which were cut into 10x10&#x02009;cm pieces and washed with Type I water to remove dust. The dried latex membrane was used to seal the mouth of the glass apparatus with the help of an elastic band, simulating the skin of a live animal that was pierced by the insect&#x02019;s mouthparts during feeding [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The following physiological parameters were evaluated for both the triatomine species at each developmental stage: the effect of different blood offerings (treatments A, B, or C) on the insects&#x02019; developmental time, the association between treatments and insect mortality rate, and survival time between sexes. Exclusively for <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic>. the number of feedings required to trigger molting was recorded for each blood treatment. Additionally, weight changes before and after feeding were measured, and weight gain was analyzed in relation to sex. The specimens were weighed on a precision scale (AGZN200) before and after feeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>In this study, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) modeling, Cox modeling, and parametric model analyses were processed using R software (version 4.2.1). Graphs were created with Prisma (version 8.02), and survival curve statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 18.5). Regardless of the model or test used, a significance level of 5% was adopted in all statistical analyses performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Effect of different blood offerings on the developmental time of <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic></title><p>For each instar and species, the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to illustrate the percentage of insect survival days across the three treatments (A, B, and C). This analysis was also applied to the entire life cycle of each species, from the first instar nymph to the adult stage molting. Mortality data at each instar were censored at that stage and excluded from subsequent analyses. For the total lifespan of the insects (from all instars until molting to the adult stage), data were compiled from all individuals, summing the days of life from the first instar to either the point of death or reaching the adult stage.</p><p>The Log-rank (Mantel-Cox), Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon, and Tarone-Ware tests were used to compare the development curves across the three treatments. The Log-rank test is a hypothesis test for comparing the survival distributions (considered here as the developmental time of insects) of two or more treatments, assigning equal weight to the event (instar molting) at all time points. The Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test gives more weight to events (instar molting) that occur at earlier time points and does not assume a consistent hazard ratio; instead, it requires that one group has a higher risk than the other. The Tarone-Ware test is more sensitive to differences at the end of the curve related to the event.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Survival time according to sex in <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic></title><p>This analysis aimed to compare survival time between sexes, defined as the time until the insect reaches adulthood. Direct survival measurements could not be used because one of the basic assumptions of this methodology is that the covariates must be measured at baseline. However, determining the sex of the insects at the nymphal stage is not possible. Therefore, the gamma regression model was adjusted for this evaluation, and the non-parametric Wilcoxon test was performed. In these analyses, the variable &#x02018;time until the insect becomes an adult&#x02019; was entered into the model on a logarithmic scale. However, the interpretation should be based on the original scale, as shown in the results.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Association between treatments and mortality rate in <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic></title><p>To evaluate the effect of different blood presentation methods on the insect mortality rates (group-by-group comparison), the Cox model was used if the assumption of proportional hazards was met, as assessed by the Schoenfeld residual test. In the absence of proportional hazards, parametric models were employed as alternatives. In this latter case, Weibull, Log-normal, and exponential distributions were tested, and the best-fitting models were selected. Unlike the Cox model, these parametric models assume a specific probability distribution for survival time, with interpretations based on median times. To assess the adequacy of the Weibull model, the survival of Cox-Snell residuals estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was compared to the estimates obtained from the Weibull model.</p><p>The interpretation of the Cox model relies on the hazard ratio, which is always a positive number. When this ratio was less than 1, we inverted the value of the baseline category for interpretative purposes to better illustrate the effect size.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Comparison of the number of feedings required for molting in <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> across the three treatments</title><p>The GEE approach, the most suitable modeling method for analyzing longitudinal data with repeated measurements of the same samples, was adopted to evaluate the number of feedings required for molting in <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> across the three treatments. Previous measurements of insects that died during the experiment were included in our analyses. A detailed description of the test can be found in the supplementary material (<xref rid="pone.0323090.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref><xref rid="pone.0323090.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Text</xref>).</p><p>A comprehensive range of GEE models assuming different distributions and covariance matrices was tested for each variable. The best-fitting model was selected based on the lowest quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion (QIC). In this analysis, Poisson regression via GEE was used, with the outcome (data used in the analyses) being the count of feedings needed for an insect to molt from one instar to the next. The study was unbalanced due to insect mortality over time. The artificial feeder group was used as the reference category for the experimental group, based on the hypothesis that this feeding method affects insect development, and the first instar (N1) served as the reference stage.</p><p>In the model interpretation, we considered the interaction between the instar stage and the feeding group. Due to significant interactions, differences between the groups could not be interpreted without accounting for each instar stage. Consequently, the analysis involved comparing group A vs. B and group B vs. C, with results adjusted by adding the estimated values from these comparisons to those obtained from the interactions specific to each instar stage and feeding group.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Weight gain in different instars of <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic></title><p>The GEE model was adjusted using a normal distribution and the identity link function for all analyses, including each instar and the entire developmental cycle. The model was run twice: in the first run, the artificial feeder group served as the reference category, and N1 was used as the reference for the instar. In the second run, while N1 was kept as the reference for the instar, the reference category for the experimental group was changed to the alternately fed group. For model interpretation, the estimated values from comparisons between group A vs. B or group B vs. C were used, and these were combined with the estimates obtained from interactions specific to each instar and group.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Weight gain based on sex in <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic></title><p>The sex of the triatomines was determined only at the adult stage.

There is a consensus that the experimental use of animals has enabled and facilitated advances in several fields of science, and continues to drive discoveries, particularly in medical and biological sciences. In contrast, several ethical, legal, moral, and even philosophical aspects permeate the discussions, raising the question of the need to replace animal use with alternative resources or strategies [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In line with these issues, brazilian legislation is increasingly demanding the replacement of live animals used to feed triatomines with artificial feeding methods. This shift aligns with <strike>the</strike> national and international laws based on the universal doctrine proposed by Russell and Burch (1959) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] known as principle of the 3 Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement). The Brazilian &#x02018;Arouca Law&#x02019; is a milestone in legislation regarding the use of animals in research, as it established the &#x02018;National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation&#x02019; (CONCEA), which addresses legal and ethical issues related to the use of experimental animals in scientific research and other related activities [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The Brazilian scientific community is committed to adhering to these ethical standards, demonstrating a strong dedication to the responsible conduct of research. In fact, this commitment permeates the entire global scientific community, which is increasingly focused on replacing or reducing the use of animals with techniques such as human cell lines, the use of cadavers for studies, computer simulations, mathematical models, and nanotechnology, for example [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>From this perspective, reducing the reliance on live animals as blood sources, refining their use, and exploring suitable replacements is essential. This study tested these efforts for triatomines. Our findings demonstrate that the species studied, despite belonging to different genera, exhibited similar responses to the type of blood offering.</p><p>We observed significant differences between the experimental groups in both species across all evaluated parameters: developmental time, the number of feedings required to trigger molting, and weight gain. The only parameter with inconsistent and minimal differences between the species was the survival rate of the insects.</p><p>Therefore, our results underscore that artificial feeding presents significant challenges. It requires a greater number of blood feedings, leads to lower weight gain, and consequently extends the developmental time of the insects at each nymphal stage and throughout their life cycle.</p><p>Based on our findings, we conclude that feeding triatomines via artificial blood sources may limit or even prevent the successful sustainable rearing of these insects over time, thus hampering research on this group. Additionally, this method of blood offering may be inadvisable when introducing and establishing new colonies of insects captured in the field.</p><p>In such cases, the number of specimens is usually limited, and replicating bioclimatic conditions similar to their natural habitat in a laboratory setting is extremely challenging. Triatomines can be highly sensitive to variations in temperature and humidity [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, using artificial feeders for field-captured insects would introduce another complicating variable, further hindering the colonization of triatomines in an insectary environment.</p><p>We did not observe differences in survival rates or weight gain of the insects according to sex. In this regard, sex does not appear to influence the developmental dynamics of the two triatomine species studied. This result is consistent with expectations, as in triatomine biology, the only source of protein for all individuals comes from blood, regardless of sex.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Effect of different blood offering methods on insect development</title><p>Parameters such as life cycle duration and mortality are critical variables that directly affect the population size of vectors and play a key role in the dynamics of rearing triatomine colonies in insectaries [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Colonies with excessively long developmental cycles can impede the execution of experiments and the distribution of samples to scientific collections, among other challenges.</p><p>A relevant aspect is that the life cycle of triatomines can vary based on species, environmental conditions, and the type of blood source used [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

The source of the blood meal (chickens in this case) does not seem to be problematic, as birds are frequently used hosts for <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> in artificial environments, and these insects are often captured in chicken coops [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The high mortality observed in <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> may be related to their heightened sensitivity to handling, as they were weighed before and after feeding to monitor blood intake dynamics. Additionally, the high inbreeding within the colonies of both species studied, which have been maintained in the institutional insectary for over two decades without introducing new wild specimens, could be a contributing factor.</p><p>The highest mortality rates for both species occurred in the first two instars, although this mortality extended throughout the developmental cycle in artificial feeding. These findings align with previous studies, which reported mortality rates from 10 to 20% for the first instar in species of <italic toggle="yes">Triatoma</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Panstrongylus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Dipetalogaster</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Cavernicola</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> fed on chickens showed mortality rates of 11.5% during the N1 instar and 30.7% from N1 to adulthood<sup>38</sup>. In <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic>, mortality rates of 16.7% for the entire cycle have been reported. Additionally, mortality rates as low as 4.8% were observed in three populations of <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> fed on mice and provided food twice a week [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Perlowagora-Szumlewicz (1953) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] emphasized the importance of the duration of the first blood meal for successful molting. In our study, variations were minimized by exposing all first-instar nymphs of different species and experimental groups to feeding for the same period&#x02014;30 minutes on the fifth day post-egg hatching. Studies have also reported that <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> N1 is ready to feed from the fourth day of life [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Factors such as the fragility of the mouthparts, difficulty in reaching the host, and capillary access in the first instar pose challenges for N1 to take their first meal. These factors are not present in artificial feeding, so this method should reduce physical difficulties for the insects. As such, lower mortality rates would be expected in the group fed artificially, but this was not observed in our trials. We suggest that the higher mortality of insects fed via artificial feeders might be due to an initial &#x02018;rejection&#x02019; of the blood offered or the type of anticoagulant used. It is also important to note that <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> have a wide range of dietary sources [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and have been reported to use rabbit blood as a food source in both natural and laboratory environments.</p><p>The anticoagulants used in the blood and their storage conditions affect the blood engorgement response of triatomines [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, the optimal anticoagulant for artificial feeding may depend on various factors, including insect species, anticoagulant concentration, and blood storage conditions [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>While the literature provides numerous short-term trials using artificial feeding of triatomines [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. N&#x000fa;nez &#x00026; Lazzari (1990) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] found that citrated bovine blood was more suitable than heparinized blood for feeding <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> nymphs, with citrate being an efficient blood preservative. According to these authors, the superiority of citrate is due to the stability of cellular structures and phagostimulant molecules, while heparin has a weak blood preservation capacity, potentially producing deleterious compounds over time.</p><p>Buralli et al. (1980) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] studied <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> populations fed on citrated, heparinized, defibrinated, and EDTA-added human blood. The authors achieved better results with citrated blood, with 85% imaginal molting. Niel (1980) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] studied the behavior of <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> fed artificially on bird blood with citrate, fluoride, heparin, and oxalate anticoagulants, finding better results with heparinized blood. Ubiego et al. (1982) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] compared the development of <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> fed on live chickens and citrated and defibrinated chicken blood, demonstrating that anticoagulants influenced species development, with live animal host feeding being superior to artificial feeding. The literature consistently shows that while <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> can feed on citrated blood, their development is constantly better with blood from live animal hosts.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Number of feedings required for <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> molting in the three treatments</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Panstrongylus megistus</italic> requires more contact events with the artificial feeder to reach the next developmental instar than insects fed on live animal hosts or alternately. This significant difference was observed for most molts except from N4 to N5.</p><p>Barbosa et al. (2001) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] analyzed three <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> populations from different localities, feeding them on mice throughout their developmental cycle, with averages of 15, 16, and 18 feedings per population. In the present study, we observed that <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> fed on live animal hosts needed an average of 14.9 feedings to reach adulthood, while those fed alternately required 21.7 feedings, and the ones fed on artificial feeders needed 34.5 feedings. These findings reinforce that artificial feeding results in poorer developmental performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Weight gain in different instars of <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic></title><p><italic toggle="yes">Triatoma infestans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Rhodnius prolixus</italic> display the highest blood intake rates among triatomines [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Naturally, the amount of blood ingested influences the duration of each instar and the overall developmental cycle [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Blood intake rates are higher in the early nymphal instars, with insects able to ingest eight to nine times their body weight in blood [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Females ingest more blood than males, though both sexes ingest less at the N5 stage [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This greater blood investment by N5 is likely related to the development of anatomical structures and physiological changes during molting to adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. At the adult stage, the volume of blood needed decreases, and insects increase their weight by two to four times. Schofield (1994) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] argues that this process is related to the fact that adults have completed their development, and all ingested food is directed solely toward maintenance, survival, and reproductive activities.</p><p>Barbosa (1998) [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] studied three <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> populations and did not observe higher blood intake in females than in males. In the present study, females and males also ingested similar volumes of blood. However, this finding may be related to the small number of insects that reached adulthood in all experimental groups.</p><p>Overall, we found that the average weight gain of <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> fed on chickens increased throughout development and was significantly higher than that of artificially fed insects in most nymphal instars. However, in N1 and N5, no significant weight gain differences were observed between the groups. These findings correlate with the other results of the present study: insects ingesting larger volumes of blood complete the developmental cycle more quickly, as was the case for insects fed on live animal hosts.</p><p>Our results showed that despite operational ease, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> feeding for both <italic toggle="yes">T. infestans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> did not yield the expected success. Developmental time, weight gain, and fewer feeder contacts were more efficient in insects fed on live animal hosts (chickens) than in those fed artificially. For insects fed alternately, physiological parameters reached intermediate values and positions between the other two blood-offering methods.</p><p>Finally, we conclude this paper by emphasizing that, in experimental research involving animals, responsible scientists&#x02014;anywhere in the world&#x02014;do not wish to use animals or cause them unnecessary suffering if it can be avoided [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, there are situations in which animals must continue to be used, because replacement practices and resources prove difficult to accurately reproduce what is intended, such as in the case of imitating the complex physiological systems of entire living organisms, as in the research presented here. Additionally, the scientific community generally accepts the use of animals only within an ethical and protective framework. A series of independent surveys were conducted in the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2006 to understand society&#x02019;s perception of the use of animals in scientific experiments [<xref rid="pone.0323090.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Interestingly, these surveys indicated that the general public accepts the use of animals in research for the benefit of human health. We concluded that the artificial feeding of triatomines, particularly the species studied does not represent a sustainable strategy for use in insectaries that require rapid production and a high number of triatomine specimens, and total feed replacement in vivo is not advisable. Furthermore, while anticoagulants may be suitable for laboratory experiments, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> feeding does not meet the objectives of full insect development. Finally, we conclude by highlighting that additional studies on other triatomine species are required to further explore this controversial topic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec026" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>GEE concept.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323090.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Average developmental time (in days) of triatomines fed on chickens, artificial feeder, or alternating feeding methods across different instar stages.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323090.s002.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Number of insects reaching adulthood in <italic toggle="yes">Triatoma infestans</italic> according to sex.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323090.s003.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Number of insects reaching adulthood in <italic toggle="yes">Panstrongylus megistus</italic> according to sex.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323090.s004.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Model of interaction between the different experimental groups and developmental instars when comparing the number of blood feedings required to trigger molting in <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus.</italic></title><p>Interaction fixed at N1 and the artificial feeder group.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323090.s005.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Descriptive measures of weight gain by developmental instar of <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus</italic> across the three feeding methods.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323090.s006.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s007" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Weight gain of N1&#x02013;N5 nymphs in <italic toggle="yes">P. megistus.</italic></title><p>Interaction between group and stage.

</p><p>PONE-D-24-41986Impact of artificial feeding on the developmental cycle of two triatomine speciesPLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Ferreira,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>As there was some difficult in securing two reviews for your paper, I decided to go further with this single review. As you will see, the reviewer felt that the paper contributes to the field, but needs relevant changes pointed out in his review. One point that could help improve the paper's impact would be going further than just stating, as mentioned in the review, that in vitro is not the best&#x000a0;way for triatomine rearing. In this sense, the review has several sound suggestions. Also, specific comments 4 and 6 are particularly critical,&#x000a0;as methodological correctness is an essential for acceptance in PLos One.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jan 23 2025 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#x000a0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email> . When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p><p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link> .

Optimising the effort and cost of such a demanding task is essential in order to supply large numbers of insects on a regular basis.</p><p>In vitro feeding is a technique that has been used for several decades to rear haematophagous arthropods, with varying degrees of success depending on the species.</p><p>In the case of triatomines, much work has been done to find the most appropriate conditions and the method has been successfully adopted for rearing small to medium sized laboratory populations. Large-scale rearing as required, for example in reference centres or diagnostic units, usually involves feeding bugs on live hosts, which requires specific infrastructure and personnel. Modern ethical guidelines on animal care and welfare require the search for alternatives to feeding insects on live hosts.</p><p>The aim of the present manuscript is to provide a comparison of biological parameters that could be relevant for mass rearing, in bugs reared in vivo, in vitro and alternating both conditions.</p><p>Even though, the study has been conducted at a small scale, the data collected could be of interest; yet, some points deserve further attention by the authors.</p><p>The aim of the present manuscript is providing a comparison on biological parameters, in bugs reared in vivo, in vitro and alternating both conditions.</p><p>Specific points</p><p>1) Line 56 &#x0201c;Vinchuca&#x0201d; is not the only vernacular Spanish name given to triatomines. &#x0201c;Chinche besucona&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chinche&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pito&#x0201d; and also employed, depending on the country. Please, check and complete.</p><p>2) Lines 60-61. The feasibility of rearing triatomines in vitro has long been demonstrated. Please rephrase to make it clear that you are interested in large-scale rearing.</p><p>3) Lines 68-70. Please rephrase, it seems impractical for your needs and under your conditions, but it has been used successfully for decades.</p><p>4) Lines 169-175. As indicated in several cited references, it is crucial to precise the treatment and conditioning of the blood used for in vitro feeding. Parameters as how long after extraction blood was proposed to bugs, how was it stored in between, the exact composition and amount of anticoagulant solutions, the exact nature and treatment of latex membranes, the type of artificial feeder used, the exact temperature of the blood (and not that of the water bath) are just some of them.</p><p>5) The authors repeatedly point out that previous reports on in vitro feeding of triatomines do not follow the bugs over several generations, as an argument to justify the need for their study. However, the manuscript only presents what happens along a single generation, so the previous criticism applies to them. My advice would be to provide solid arguments justifying the rationale for a study in 2024 that is not much different from many others done decades ago.</p><p>6) A major inconsistency that seems unjustified in the current version is why the authors chose to use different species as blood donors and for live host feeding. Why not use the same blood? This would have revealed differences in the methods, whereas in the present experiment the effect of donor and method cannot be distinguished. This reason is probably practical, but needs to be explained.</p><p>7) Some sections of the manuscript are inappropriately long. The detailed description of the statistical treatment of the data is interesting, but can be presented in supplementary material. The results section is also unnecessarily long, but for a different reason: there is redundancy in the information presented in the tables and in the text.</p><p>8) The discussion focuses on the advantages of in vivo over in vitro feeding, which, as the authors say in the introduction, is now well acknowledged. Simply stating that in vitro is not the best and that this strategy might be potentially problematic for mass rearing is much less than most educated readers of PLoS One would expect. In the opinion of this reviewer, this study provides an interesting opportunity to discuss the trade-off that scientists face today, i.e. optimising efforts and resources to advance public health science versus animal welfare regulations. In particular in Chagas endemic countries, where the need of advances is high and the resources usually limited.

</p><p>Dear reviewers, we appreciate your suggestions and have accepted almost all of them. Below are the point-by-point responses.</p><p>1) Line 56 &#x0201c;Vinchuca&#x0201d; is not the only vernacular Spanish name given to triatomines. &#x0201c;Chinche besucona&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chinche&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pito&#x0201d; and also employed, depending on the country. Please, check and complete.</p><p>Authors: The names were added as suggested by the reviewer</p><p>2) Lines 60-61. The feasibility of rearing triatomines in vitro has long been demonstrated. Please rephrase to make it clear that you are interested in large-scale rearing.</p><p>Authors: Changes were made as suggested.</p><p>3) Lines 68-70. Please rephrase, it seems impractical for your needs and under your conditions, but it has been used successfully for decades.</p><p>Authors: Changes were made as suggested.</p><p>4) Lines 169-175. As indicated in several cited references, it is crucial to precise the treatment and conditioning of the blood used for in vitro feeding. Parameters as how long after extraction blood was proposed to bugs, how was it stored in between, the exact composition and amount of anticoagulant solutions, the exact nature and treatment of latex membranes, the type of artificial feeder used, the exact temperature of the blood (and not that of the water bath) are just some of them.</p><p>Authors: Thank you for your comments. Please note that the information has been added in lines 206-221. The blood used in the artificial feedings was 10% citrated rabbit blood (25g P.A. citrate, 8g citric acid, and 24.5g glucose). This blood is collected, prepared, and sterilized at the Institute of Science and Technology in Biomodels (ICTB)/Fiocruz. It is packaged in an autoclavable glass bottle with a rubber cap, sealed, and distributed chilled on dry ice to the laboratories. In the laboratory, the blood is immediately stored at -20&#x000b0;C and used within 10 days of being collected.</p><p>The artificial feeding device used consisted of a glass apparatus, made by a craftsman in the shape of a baby bottle, with an external compartment for circulating water heated by an attached water bath and an internal compartment containing the blood. The water temperature was set at 40&#x000b0;C, and the blood temperature in the bottles remained at 39.5&#x000b0;C. The membrane used to cover the feeding bottle was a latex membrane. These were obtained from natural latex gloves, which were cut into 10x10 cm pieces and washed with Type I water to remove dust. The dried latex membrane was used to seal the mouth of the glass apparatus with the help of an elastic band, simulating the skin of a live animal that was pierced by the insect's mouthparts during feeding (Lazzari, 2014).</p><p>5) The authors repeatedly point out that previous reports on in vitro feeding of triatomines do not follow the bugs over several generations, as an argument to justify the need for their study. However, the manuscript only presents what happens along a single generation, so the previous criticism applies to them. My advice would be to provide solid arguments justifying the rationale for a study in 2024 that is not much different from many others done decades ago.</p><p>Authors: The passage between lines 110 and 113 was moved to lines 131&#x02013;135. The sentence, 'One of these gaps involves the effectiveness and suitability of rearing insects exclusively with artificial feeders over multiple generations in an insectary,' between lines 115 and 118, was removed from the manuscript. Additionally, the aspect highlighted by the reviewer was revised throughout the manuscript (lines 573&#x02013;580; 587&#x02013;591; 594-598;764&#x02013;776), and minor changes were made to the writing of the last paragraph of the introduction. We hope these adjustments have met your expectations.</p><p>6) A major inconsistency that seems unjustified in the current version is why the authors chose to use different species as blood donors and for live host feeding. Why not use the same blood? This would have revealed differences in the methods, whereas in the present experiment the effect of donor and method cannot be distinguished. This reason is probably practical, but needs to be explained.</p><p>Authors: We understand the reviewer's questions and hope to clarify this point. It is important to note that working with live animals has not been an easy task in the scientific environment, particularly in Brazil. This work is the result of various questions and recommendations from the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals. The license obtained from CEUA to keep triatomines in an insectary, after a 2.5-year process, does not allow us to breed rabbits at our institution to be used as a source of blood for the triatomines. For this reason, we use the license granted to ICTB/Fiocruz (as mentioned in question 4). ICTB is the technical-scientific unit of Fiocruz responsible for studies, development, and production in Laboratory Animal Science. They prepare and supply blood from other animals, such as rodents and lagomorphs, to other Fiocruz units. Although we have a license to use chickens to provide blood for feeding triatomines kept in the institutional insectary, we lack the expertise and equipment at our institution to prepare the blood, monitor the health of the animals, and carry out pre-clinical analyses on animals bred to ensure quality control of the blood for use in the artificial feeder. Therefore, for practical reasons, the same blood donors were not used in the tests in this study.</p><p>7) Some sections of the manuscript are inappropriately long. The detailed description of the statistical treatment of the data is interesting, but can be presented in supplementary material. The results section is also unnecessarily long, but for a different reason: there is redundancy in the information presented in the tables and in the text.</p><p>Authors: We appreciate your suggestions. Regarding the statistical analyses, we have removed the paragraph describing the GEE test from the manuscript. However, due to the complexity of the analyses and models employed, we believe that the details and description of the criteria used in decision-making should remain in the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the results section, we completely agree with the reviewer and have removed the redundant information.</p><p>8) The discussion focuses on the advantages of in vivo over in vitro feeding, which, as the authors say in the introduction, is now well acknowledged. Simply stating that in vitro is not the best and that this strategy might be potentially problematic for mass rearing is much less than most educated readers of PLoS One would expect. In the opinion of this reviewer, this study provides an interesting opportunity to discuss the trade-off that scientists face today, i.e. optimising efforts and resources to advance public health science versus animal welfare regulations. In particular in Chagas endemic countries, where the need of advances is high and the resources usually limited. This problematic goes beyond Brazilian legislation and triatomine rearing.</p><p>Authors: We appreciate your comments. We have expanded the discussion, addressing the points highlighted by the reviewer. A paragraph was added between lines 573 and 580, and a sentence was added between lines 587-591 and 594-598. Finally, in the last paragraph, lines 774-776 were added, and the ending of this paragraph was rewritten. We hope that these additions are sufficient, as we do not intend to engage in discussions that involve, including, philosophical aspects, which would be more appropriate for another type or format of manuscript.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323090.s010" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323090.s010.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0323090.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323090.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Pedro L.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Pedro L.
