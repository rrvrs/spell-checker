Even though there is a wide range of non-clinical support and services available in German communities, which can potentially meet the needs of the affected patients, there are no formalized connections between these services and primary care. One potential solution is social prescribing (SP) providing general practitioners (GPs) with a non-medical referral option, which can accompany existing treatments to improve health and well-being. The goal of this trial is to test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial and potential benefit of SP in the primary care setting in Germany.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This trial is designed as a multi-center, two-armed, open, exploratory, individually randomized (2:1) controlled, pragmatic, feasibility trial. 300 adult patients presenting with one or more non-medical health-related social needs will be recruited in GP practices in Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany. Participants in the intervention group will receive a referral to a link worker. The link worker assesses the social needs, agrees on a goal and sets up an action plan together with the patient. The link worker then connects the patient to suitable non-clinical support and services in the community (e.g., volunteering opportunities). The GP is informed about the actions taken through a feedback form. Participants in the control group will receive treatment-as-usual plus a brochure with information about local offers of non-clinical support and services in the community. Follow-up per patient is 6 months with measurements at 3 and 6 months. Primary endpoint is the feasibility of the trial measured by (1) proportion of participants who have at least one appointment with the link worker (intervention arm only), (2) proportion of participants that drop out of the trial before the 6-month follow-up (both arms). Secondary endpoints include further feasibility endpoints (acceptability, practicality, demand), clinical endpoints such the health status and wellbeing, and a goal-based outcome for the intervention group. The trial is accompanied by a process evaluation, including qualitative episodic interviews with patients and stakeholders. Furthermore, a description of selected economic consequences of SP and its intervention costs will be conducted.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will assess the feasibility of implementing SP in the German primary care setting and will provide information and data necessary to plan a confirmatory trial.

They can significantly influence the incidence of mental and somatic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but can also be caused by (chronic) diseases. They are associated with relevant economic costs, such as sick leave and long-term absence from work [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Non-medical health related social problems are operationalized through the International Classification in Primary Care 3nd Edition (ICPC-3) in chapter ZC &#x0201c;Social Problems&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and include problems such as loneliness, problems in the family and at work, as well as financial difficulties [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These problems disproportionally affect people with a lower socioeconomic status and increase health inequalities [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Although non-medical health related social problems are common in general practice, General Practitioners (GPs) can target only a few problems during their consultations [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although there is an extensive range of non-clinical support and services available in the communities in Germany, there are no formalized connections between these services and primary care [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, it is difficult for both GPs and patients to choose the right point of entry when problems arise. This calls for low threshold, cooperative solutions [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Several potential solutions have been suggested, including integrated primary care centres, provision of social work in primary care, and social prescribing (SP) [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SP equips GPs with a non-medical referral option, which can accompany existing treatments to improve health and well-being [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. SP was developed in the United Kingdom and has become widely established in the National Health Service in recent years. Globally, SP schemes have been implemented in several countries such as Canada and Singapore, but also Austria and the Netherlands [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In a recent survey we could show that there is a high interest in Social Prescribing among German GPs [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>From the existing evidence, the need for randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy of SP - especially outside of the United Kingdom, is evident [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, as there is limited experience with establishing SP in Germany, a feasibility study is a necessary first step to clarify aspects for a future randomized trial. Important aspects are the acceptability of the trial by potential participants, loss to follow-up, the number of appointments between patients and link workers needed, the feasibility of endpoint measurements as well as the acceptance of the link worker role in the German health care system. This evidence is essential before implementing Social Prescribing into routine care in Germany [<xref rid="pone.0322372.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Objectives</title><p>The goal of this trial is to test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial and potential benefit of SP in the primary care setting in Germany.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Trial design</title><p>The trial is designed as a multi-center, two-armed open, exploratory, individually randomized controlled, pragmatic, feasibility trial.

In this feasibility trial, study centers are GP practices in Berlin and Brandenburg.</p><p>We decided to perform individual randomization in a 2:1 allocation ratio (intervention:control). A randomized design was chosen to assess the feasibility of individual randomization in the primary care setting. We decided for a 2:1 allocation ratio to ensure that enough participants are in the intervention arm for the main feasibility endpoints. A control group is needed to provide information on the feasibility of the proposed control group design and trial processes especially regarding loss to follow-up in the control group. Cross-contamination will be analyzed in the qualitative process evaluation to assess the feasibility of individual randomization compared to cluster randomization.

The aim of this is, on the one hand, to examine the acceptance of the survey instruments on well-being (ICECAP-A), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and resource utilisation (PECUNIA RUM/EHIS-GeDA). In addition, the documentation of the link workers is used to extract which services were provided to patients and to determine parameters concerning the patient-link worker interaction (e.g., number and duration of meetings). The recorded service utilisation is also evaluated in a group comparison in order to identify service areas with a significant group difference. The exploratory analyses use the 5% and 10% significance levels. The findings will be used to revise the survey instruments for a follow-up study, i.e., to remove aspects of the PECUNIA RUM instrument that are less significant in the &#x02018;social prescription&#x02019; application context and to include the range of services provided outside the healthcare system for standardised documentation and determination of standard costs.</p><p>In addition to these research process-related results, the data collected on service utilisation, quality of life and well-being are evaluated in terms of content. For the monetary evaluation of resource utilisation, the standard costs for all (privately purchased or prescribed) services and goods are calculated in euros. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is determined using the net benefit approach. The statistical analysis of the data will be carried out using parametric or non-parametric methods, depending on the distribution of the data.
