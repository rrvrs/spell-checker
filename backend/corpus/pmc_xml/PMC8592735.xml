However, low solubility and poor bioavailability of TanIIA limit its clinical application. Similarly, gene therapy with GPC3-shRNA, a type of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) capable of silencing the glypican-3 (GPC3) expression, is seriously limited due to its susceptibility to nuclease degradation and high off-target effects. In the present study, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-PEG) were used as a drug carrier. By encapsulating TanIIA into MSN-PEG, we synthesized MSN-TanIIA-PEG nanoparticles and observed the involved characteristics. This was followed by exploration of antitumor activity on the HepG2 cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>. Meanwhile, in order to construct GPC3-shRNA plasmids, a shRNA sequence targeting GPC3 was synthesized and cloned into the pSLenti-U6 vector. Accordingly, the performance of MSN-PEG as a gene transfer carrier for GPC3-shRNA gene therapy of HCC <italic>in vitro</italic> was evaluated, including transfection efficiency and DNA binding biological characteristics. The results indicated successful encapsulation of TanIIA in MSN-PEG, which had satisfactory efficacy, favorable dispersity, suitable particle size, and sustained release effect. The <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-HCC effects of nano-TanIIA were greatly improved, which outperformed free-TanIIA in terms of proliferation and invasion inhibition, as well as apoptosis induction of HCC cells. As expected, MSN-PEG possessed excellent gene delivery capacity with good binding, release, and protection from RNase digestion. Using MSN-PEG as a gene carrier, the plasmids were successfully transfected into HepG2 cells, and both the mRNA and protein expressions of GPC3 were significantly downregulated. It was thus concluded that a sustained release TanIIA delivery system for HCC treatment was synthesized and that MSN-PEG could also serve as a gene transfer carrier for gene therapy. More interestingly, MSN-PEG may be a potential delivery platform that combines TanIIA and GPC3-shRNA together to enhance their synergistic effect.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809">National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>81571797</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Social Development Plan of Taizhou, China</funding-source><award-id>TS202004</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007956">Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine</funding-source><award-id>XZR2020093</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Taizhou People's Hospital Medical Innovation Team Foundation, China</funding-source><award-id>CXTDA201901</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as a malignancy characterized by high incidence and mortality, harms people's life and health in a tremendous manner. Seriously, its mortality and morbidity have been steadily increasing over the last few decades [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date, chemotherapy remains the most common treatment for all stages of carcinoma patients. However, several potential chemotherapeutics that can treat HCC still show limitations such as severe adverse reactions and drug resistance [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, the intricacy of the molecular pathogenesis poses great difficulties on seeking cure. Enormous endeavors have thus been made to develop high-efficacy multitarget antineoplastics with less adverse effects.</p><p>Several effective plant constituents, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine with insignificant adverse actions, have aroused a wide range of interest as an adjuvant therapy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among them, TanIIA, an effective component extracted from the <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> roots, features high efficacy, natural source, and low toxicity [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on the existing studies on TanIIA, it exerts a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in a variety of human carcinoma cells by suppressing proliferation and migration, triggering autophagy and apoptosis, and reversing the multidrug resistance [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, TanIIA has a synergistic effect in combination with other chemotherapeutics commonly used in clinics, which makes its application in the cancer and adjuvant therapies promising and offers a new insight into diverse cancer treatments as well [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Unsatisfactorily, being a lipophilic constituent, TanIIA is poorly bioavailable, which limits its further application [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to poor water solubility, it exhibits robust hepatic elimination after oral medication and can be easily eliminated from the circulatory system after intravenous medication [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hence, diverse delivery systems (nanoscale) have been proposed for controlled release of TanIIA, in order to overcome its disadvantages and to elevate its bioavailability [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Amongst various nano-based drug delivery platforms developed, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have attracted a considerable attention owing to their good biocompatibility, monodispersity, feeble toxicity, tunable pore size, and large pore volumes, among other characteristics [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite being in part a potential solution to the foregoing problems with TanIIA, it still cannot escape the influence of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Rapid elimination by the RES will inevitably hamper the nanosized drugs' absorption efficiency in tumor regions, leading to reduced bioavailability [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Being highly hydrophilic and positively charged, PEG is commonly used to decorate nanoparticles [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which has been proven as one of the most effective methods to improve nanoparticle biodistribution and reduce opsonization by the RES [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Studies over the last decades have demonstrated that GPC3 is highly and specifically expressed in HCC, revealing its potential from an encouraging biomarker for the early HCC detection to an effective epitope for targeted HCC treatment. Past several years have witnessed the exploration of the GPC3-targeting gene therapies [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As promising as it looks, their applications are severely limited because of the physicochemical traits of nucleotide drugs, including high molecular weight, susceptibility to nuclease degradation, easy missing of target, and anionic charge [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This has necessitated carrier design as the gene therapy advances in order to achieve highly efficient drug delivery to the target cells. ShRNAs, the small molecules of RNA, have specific function of gene silencing, which can be delivered to the targets via the support of nanoparticles [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, nanostructured carriers such as PEG and PEI or inorganic nanoparticles have shown multiple advantages concerning RNA interference (RNAi) delivery [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. PEI, as one of the most classic nonviral vectors, is the most broadly applied polycation transfection reagent owing to its high stability and transfection performance, while PEI-25k has been considered the gold standard for nonviral vectors [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, PEI combined with PEG could improve the systemic circulation and prolong the treatment time [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Based on the aforementioned theory, this study aims to construct an intelligent nanoplatform to improve the water solubility and bioavailability of TanIIA, which also serves as a vehicle of GPC3-shRNA. Herein, we propose a facile method, where TanIIA was physically adsorbed by mesoporous silica and then surface-modified with PEI-PEG to make it positively charged. In this way, the stability of the complex can be improved, which is conducive to loading GPC3-shRNA plasmids. The physicochemical property elucidation of the complex was accomplished, <italic>in vitro</italic> antitumor activities were investigated, and the feasibility of MSN-PEG as a GPC3-shRNA carrier was explored. Finally, we found that this novel drug delivery system is promising for HCC treatment. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 1</xref> is a schematic illustration of the preparation of MSN-PEG nanoparticles and their delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

In this study, TanIIA-loaded MSN-PEG nanoparticles were prepared, as described previously. The DL and EE of MSN-TanIIA-PEG nanoparticles were 9.32% and 93.13%, respectively.</p><p>Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(h)</xref> display the size distribution of the particles, as well as the zeta potential of the MSN, MSN-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA-PEG, and MSN-PEG. As suggested by the results of DLS assessment, MSN has a hydrodynamic size of 78&#x02009;nm and a zeta potential of &#x02212;36.0&#x02009;mV. With the gradual modification of the MSN nanoparticles with TanIIA and PEI-PEG, the MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG exhibited increases in the hydrodynamic size separately to 90&#x02009;nm and 117&#x02009;nm. Besides, the surface charges of MSN and MSN-TanIIA were &#x02212;36&#x02009;mV and &#x02212;30&#x02009;mV, indicating negative charges. Interestingly, both MSN-TanIIA-PEG and MSN-PEG had positive charges with values of 43.2&#x02009;mV and 47&#x02009;mV, respectively. This verified the negative-to-positive changes in the surface charges of nanoparticles. The foregoing results imply the successful modification of nanoparticles. Moreover, the positive charges enabled formation of an electrostatic complex by the carrier with shRNA, thereby protecting it from nucleases and facilitating its cellular uptake [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>TEM analysis was performed to elucidate the morphology of the nanoparticles. According to the TEM micrographs in Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(i)</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2(l)</xref>, the majority of the nanoparticles, regardless of modified or not, was about 50&#x02009;nm in particle size, which had a regular spherical shape, uniform particle size, and good monodispersity. The surface-modified particles maintained the basic morphology. Additionally, it was obviously observed that the surface mesoporous pores became blurred, and there was a white halo on the nanoparticle periphery, which corresponded to the surface modification with the polymer layer. It has been reported that nanoparticles with a size of 100&#x02013;200&#x02009;nm can be quickly eliminated from the blood by macrophages in the RES after entering the circulation. In contrast, the nanoparticles 50&#x02013;100&#x02009;nm in size are capable of entering liver cells and target drugs to the liver [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the EPR effect, nanoparticles with particle size less than 100&#x02009;nm can easily pass through the interstices of the tumor tissue and thus remain in the tumor tissue [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

For effectiveness validation of the nanoparticles in drug delivery, the <italic>in vitro</italic> release of TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was employed at various time intervals (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24&#x02009;h), and the curve of TanIIA release was plotted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(m)</xref>). According to the <italic>in vitro</italic> TanIIA release curve, both MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG showed a typical pattern of two-phase release. The TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was initially released at a rapid rate with 71.89% and 59.7% in the first 6&#x02009;h, which was denoted as incubation period. From 7 to 24&#x02009;h, the sustained release phase, the cumulative release of the drug gradually increased. After 12&#x02009;h, the release gradually decreased, which was followed by the smooth release until 24&#x02009;h. The sustained release reached 97.27% and 97.95% at 24&#x02009;h for MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG, respectively. It was obviously seen that the percentage of TanIIA release in MSN-TanIIA was higher than that of MSN-TanIIA-PEG. The high burst release of MSN-TanIIA may prevent drugs from reaching to the target tissues or cells, thus making it less effective.

When the mass ratio was 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;20, no band could be observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(b)</xref>), indicating that GPC3-shRNA plasmids could be completely loaded onto the nanoparticles, so that the optimal binding ratio was 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;20.</p><p>Electrophoresis of release assay revealed that no DNA band was observed at 1, 4, 8, 12, or 24&#x02009;h. Nevertheless, the brightness of the electrophoretic band increased within 48 and 72&#x02009;h, and there was no significant difference between the 3rd and the 4th day, indicating that MSN-PEG was capable of protecting the pDNA from degradation and reasonably releasing pDNA under appropriate conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(c)</xref>).</p><p>In order to observe the stability of the nanoparticle/pDNA complex, the DNase-I digestion experiment was performed. After the complex of MSN-PEG/GPC3-shRNA was added with DNase-I enzyme, the brightness of the electrophoretic band remained stable in the first 1&#x02009;h. On the contrary, after digestion with DNase-I enzyme, the naked pDNA was almost completely digested within 1&#x02009;min, and no bands could be seen on the electrophoresis lane, verifying that nanoparticles could effectively protect the pDNA from nuclease digestion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(d)</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. Evaluation of MSN-PEG Gene Transfection Efficiency</title><p>Using MSN-PEG as a carrier, the GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells for the transfection efficiency observation of GPC3-shRNA plasmids under a fluorescence microscope. As the EGFP expression indicated, no obvious difference was observed in transfection efficiency between MSN-PEG and Lipo2000 in the HepG2 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Besides, the transfection efficiency of MSN-PEG was 34.37&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.06% as analyzed by flow cytometry, with no significant difference from the liposome group's 31.78&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.30% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(b)</xref>). As suggested by the foregoing findings, MSN-PEG has an encouraging potential as a gene-transferring carrier in gene therapy.</p><p>HepG2 cells were transfected with GPC3-shRNA via MSN-PEG for 24&#x02009;h, and then GPC3 gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR combined with Western blotting. It was found that GPC3 mRNA expression in the untransfected (control) group differed indistinctly from that in the negative control (NC) group, although they were both higher than that in the GPC3-shRNA plasmid-transfected group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(c)</xref>). Correspondingly, the expression level of GPC3 protein was reduced after GPC3-shRNA plasmid transfection, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(d)</xref>. This further confirms the successful establishment of GPC3-shRNA plasmids and the workability of using MSN-PEG to transfer target gene in gene therapy. In a word, it offered a new idea of using MSN-PEG as a vector to carry TanIIA and GPC3-shRNA for comprehensive treatment of HCC in clinics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>In this study, MSN-TanIIA-PEG with favorable dispersity and biological characteristics was successfully prepared. The antitumor efficacies of nano-TanIIA on HCC <italic>in vitro</italic> were greatly improved, which outperformed free-TanIIA in terms of proliferation and invasion inhibition, and apoptosis induction of HCC cells. Capable of releasing TanIIA into carcinoma cells in a sustained manner, this formulation may be an appropriate candidate for pharmacological application. Nonetheless, the specific mechanism still needs to be further explored, and its efficacy and safety deserve more <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations before clinical trials. Additionally, GPC3-shRNA plasmids were successfully constructed, and MSN-PEG showed an excellent gene transfection efficiency and may thus serve as a carrier for gene therapy. The findings of this study also offer a novel idea for HCC treatment, where MSN-PEG is used as a carrier to combine TanIIA together with GPC3-shRNA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81571797), the Social Development Plan of Taizhou, China (TS202004), the Natural Science Foundation of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, China, (XZR2020093), and Taizhou People's Hospital Medical Innovation Team Foundation, China (CXTDA201901).</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The graphics and quantitative data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1" content-type="article"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author">
