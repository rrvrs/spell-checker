This study forms part of a larger project to design an evidence-based wellbeing protocol for young elite musicians at a pre-professional music training institute. Recommendations from the health, education, performance science, behavior change, and occupational and public health literature provided theoretical and practical foundations for the project. The aim of this study was to identify barriers to wellbeing and strengths of an existing health protocol, and provide recommendations for change from the student perspective. Four in-person focus groups were held on the same day, attended by 68% (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;45) of the student cohort. Semi-structured discussions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically. Barriers to wellbeing and recommendations for change were collated from the data and distributed to the student body to be rated in priority order. Participants appreciated the existing program for its holistic approach delivered by a range of skilled practitioners. Barriers to wellbeing included constraints in finances, leave allowances and time, pressure from interpersonal challenges and unhealthy norms in the music performance culture. Recommendations for change included updating the financial policy; having more flexible leave conditions to allow higher earnings and better access to performance opportunities; having reliably scheduled time off; collaborative planning with staff around playing rosters; more activities for musician enhancement and social bonding; exercise opportunities in-house; addressing pervasive cultural norms around practice and breaks; education regarding respectful and professional conduct; an effective complaints procedure, and more practical wellbeing sessions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>health promotion</kwd><kwd>performance-related problems</kwd><kwd>music student</kwd><kwd>musician</kwd><kwd>conservatoire</kwd><kwd>tertiary music</kwd><kwd>wellbeing</kwd><kwd>qualitative</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Mental health studies have reported over 75% of professional musicians and around 70% of tertiary music students have at some time experienced anxiety or depression (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Gross and Musgrave, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Koops and Kuebel, 2019</xref>). A systematic review of prevalence and risk factors for musculoskeletal pain in musicians reported lifetime prevalence ranging between 46 and 90%, and point prevalence ranging between 9 and 60% depending on study methodology (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Gude et al., 2022</xref>). Symptoms arising from playing an instrument or singing can appear as early as childhood, with higher prevalence estimates reported in musicians with more playing experience (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Ackermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Cruder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Ranelli et al., 2015</xref>). The extent of playing-related problems and investigation into contributing risk factors has received considerable attention, with music and health experts recommending multifaceted approaches to musicians&#x02019; health promotion and education (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo and Spahn, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Chesky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Ginsborg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Phillips, 2023</xref>). The expansion of work in this area has raised awareness of playing-related problems and led to interdisciplinary health initiatives tailored for musicians, including Healthy Conservatoires UK, the NASM requirements for music schools in the US, and specialist musicians&#x02019; clinics in Germany (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Healthy Conservatoires, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">NASM 2019-2020, n.d.</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Rosset et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Zalpour et al., 2021</xref>). However, studies on health programs with musicians have delivered mixed results (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Rotter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Stanhope et al., 2020</xref>), and there is no gold standard approach to preventing playing-related problems. The success of public health and occupational health initiatives in improving population health and wellbeing and reducing workplace injury suggests that these and allied disciplines may offer perspectives or processes that could be useful for improving the health status of musicians. This article presents a discussion of multidisciplinary frameworks and interventions that informed development of a health protocol design for young elite musicians, and enlarges on the stakeholder engagement phase of the protocol development to present student perspectives on wellbeing and recommendations to help them to thrive.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>The problem</title><p>Musicians experience more psychological and physical problems than the general population (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Loveday et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Vaag et al., 2016</xref>), while also delivering higher scores in positive psychology and emotional regulation (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Ascenso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Athalia and Kilis, 2020</xref>). In a pre-COVID study with over 2,000 UK professional musicians, 71% reported anxiety or panic attacks, and 69% reported depression resulting from precarity of employment opportunities and tenure, income uncertainty, and challenges related to damaging industry cultural norms and working conditions (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Gross and Musgrave, 2016</xref>). In terms of physical health, up to 90% of professional and 89% of tertiary musicians report physical symptoms related to music performance (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Ackermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ioannou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Steinmetz et al., 2015</xref>). These statistics represent unacceptably poor levels of occupational health among musicians that are accompanied by substantial personal and social costs.</p><p>Ideally, healthy performance principles would be integral to music education from the outset and underpin a professional musician&#x02019;s work (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Rosset et al., 2022</xref>). As the primary contact and source of advice for students experiencing music-related health issues, music teachers are concerned about students experiencing music-related health issues (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Norton, 2016</xref>). However, other than in countries such as Austria, Germany or Switzerland where music physiology training for music teachers is well-established, teachers&#x02019; knowledge of wellbeing and playing-related problems may be guided more by personal experiences of symptoms and symptom management rather than on a working knowledge of the complex factors that contribute to playing-related problems (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Norton, 2016</xref>). Consideration of wellbeing and playing-related problems is not generally included in elementary music instruction, at least partly due to teachers&#x02019; limited knowledge of playing-related problems and due also to the focus being on acquiring music skills and on performance rather than the musician&#x02019;s condition.</p><p>Higher education offers a structured environment where students&#x02019; playing health can be influenced positively while they are still in an active learning context (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Rosset et al., 2022</xref>). Student wellbeing programs are more common in universities and conservatoires now than they were in the past, but many music faculties are yet to include wellbeing initiatives that cater for the specific needs of musicians (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Wijsman and Ackermann, 2019</xref>). Where they are present, health initiatives offered by tertiary music faculties typically comprise information and advice, optional involvement with wellness activities, symptom treatment through student services, and perhaps musicians&#x02019; health as an elective rather than a core subject. With few exceptions, musicians&#x02019; health education programs provide information but do not actively facilitate behavior change, even though information on its own is not sufficient to change behavior and does not necessarily improve health status (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Kelly and Barker, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Rosset et al., 2022</xref>). Additional influences on music students&#x02019; health are the conservatoire environment itself, and that music students appear to exercise low responsibility for self-care (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While the higher education setting is well-placed to improve musicians&#x02019; health in the long term, the overarching work environment is likely to exert a stronger influence on health and health behavior than individual knowledge or skills (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Oakman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Weale et al., 2022</xref>). Psychosocial as well as biomechanical hazards at an organizational level have a higher impact on psychological and physical health than education or protective equipment for individuals in the work environment (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Oakman et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this is known or how much it is acted upon in professional or educational music settings, where for the most part health initiatives are implemented only at the musician level rather than also working with organizational structures and expectations.

Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 1986</xref>, p. iii). The WHO&#x02019;s biopsychosocial concept of wellbeing encompasses the spectrum of health promotion, problem prevention, early intervention, and treatment of psychological and physical conditions in a given socio-cultural context. Therefore, the terms &#x0201c;health&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;wellbeing&#x0201d; are used interchangeably in this article.</p><p>In keeping with the WHO&#x02019;s definition of wellbeing, the <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Healthy Conservatoires (2020)</xref> Fit to Perform eight-factor framework captures the multidimensional nature of performer wellbeing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Music performance demands high physical and emotional engagement with appropriate levels of fitness to meet those demands. It is not enough to be injury-free; musicians need to have the resilience to perform at their best under considerable pressure (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Healthy conservatoires wellbeing framework.

Self-Determination Theory specifies three core psychological needs that determine wellness: <italic>competence</italic> (the desire to feel effective); <italic>relatedness</italic> (the need to feel connected to others), and <italic>autonomy</italic> (sense of choice or personal control). Growth and psychological wellbeing result when these core needs are fulfilled; conversely, psychological illbeing arises when these needs are not met (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Interdisciplinary perspectives</title><p>In view of the ongoing prevalence of playing-related problems despite several decades of research into musicians&#x02019; health, we expanded on emerging directions in performance science (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Gross and Musgrave, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al., 2017</xref>), to source perspectives from disciplines that have invested significant resources over time in reducing costs associated with injury and ill-health, including public and occupational health. In keeping with the recognition that health literacy requires behavior change as well as education (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Kelly and Barker, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nutbeam, 2019</xref>), additional perspectives were sought from the behavior change and health promotion literature. This shifts the focus of musicians&#x02019; health, usually centered on biomedical constructs, to recognizing contextual and choice elements in addressing the problem of playing-related problems.</p><sec id="sec5"><title>Behavior change</title><p>Behavior change involves working with behavioral determinants to bring about constructive change (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2008</xref>). There is a growing realization that if health outcomes are to improve in the music environment, education must move beyond providing information to changing behavior (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Ajzen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo and Spahn, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Ginsborg, 2022</xref>). <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Ajzen et al.&#x02019;s (2011)</xref> Theory of Planned Behavior proposes that behavior arises from a complex mixture of attitudes, subjective norms and perceptions of behavioral control which are affected by context but not reliably by information, while <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo and Spahn (2022)</xref> concluded that as well as appropriate information, healthy behaviors in musicians require healthy musician-centered settings that foster healthy decision-making and practices. <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Ginsborg (2022)</xref> reported positive engagement with health and increased adoption of healthy behaviors in some participants following a 5-month health module. However, other participants identified a number of barriers to engaging practically with the course material, some of which were that they felt the program did not apply specifically to their situation, or was not sufficiently practical or solution-focused, or was partially redundant.</p><p>According to <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al.

The COM-B model of behavior change elaborates on these drivers to provide a framework to achieve positive changes in individual health behavior within a psychosocial environment applicable across individual, institutional, and legislative domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Resistance to change at one level can affect factors lower in the hierarchy, effectively locking in a chain of systemic attitudes or behaviors, positively or negatively. The COM-B model moves beyond the customary focus on knowledge and behaviors of individual musicians to include the institutional and social layers that actively influence behavior. Musicians&#x02019; health has previously been considered through the lens of the COM-B model (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Norton, 2020</xref>) and used to effect changes in health behavior as part of the Music Impact study (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Ginsborg, 2022</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>COM-B: The Behaviour Change Wheel.

Canada&#x02019;s guidelines specify three &#x0201c;strategic pillars&#x0201d; for psychological health and safety: prevention of harm, promotion of health, and resolution of incidents or concerns.

A combined top-down and bottom-up approach is held to be more effective than the top-down approach usually taken. Wellbeing initiatives must be designed and tested in context if they are to be effective (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Weale et al., 2022</xref>). Stakeholder consultation and program review are especially critical in view of the point that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to wellbeing.</p><p>Evidence-based interventions are considered to be the gold standard for health initiatives.

Although numbers derived from linear research methods provide a valuable picture of the extent of playing-related problems and any changes to that picture in response to intervention, they do not capture the complexities that drive health behavior, including the dynamic psychosocial environment that influences minute-to-minute behavior choices.

There has been a shift in education over the last two decades from traditional top-down approaches focused on inputs to more active student engagement in the learning process (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Biesta, 2020</xref>). Contemporary educational theory argues that higher education should be transformative, not merely involve transmission of information and skill acquisition (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Paul and Quiggin, 2020</xref>). In line with educational theory, health education needs to move beyond learning about healthy behaviors and aim to change beliefs, attitudes, and the choices people make (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nutbeam, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Health literacy as a goal of health promotion is seen as building skills and abilities across the lifespan to adopt healthy behaviors in the face of complex changing circumstances. Context is important to the exercise of health literacy; people with high levels of health literacy can make unhealthy decisions under the pressure of environmental influences that make it difficult to choose in favor of one&#x02019;s own wellbeing (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Kelly and Barker, 2016</xref>). The teaching of personal skills and strategies must be supported by attention to the social, economic and cultural environment (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nutbeam, 2019</xref>). The shift away from the top-down model in educational theory echoes the shift from early concepts of health education centered on personal risk exposure and lifestyle choices to the WHO&#x02019;s adoption of a health promotion paradigm that includes five strategies: &#x0201c;build healthy public policy, create supportive environments for health, strengthen community actions, develop personal skills and reorient health services.&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nutbeam, 2019</xref>, p. 706).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Health protocol design</title><sec id="sec9"><title>Consultation and engagement</title><p>The success of a workplace health protocol depends on stakeholder engagement at every stage from the design phase onward (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2016</xref>).

Additional obstacles to effecting positive changes in workplace health include health practitioners or others offering advice on the basis of cultural values or beliefs rather than on evidence, and service provision based on health care interests rather than appropriately fitting workers&#x02019; needs (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Cherniack and Lahiri, 2010</xref>). A further complication can arise for musicians trying to recover from injury who receive conflicting advice from health practitioners. Musicians already having difficulty accessing appropriate treatment, trying to make sense of the array of options on offer, and trying to balance injury and a playing schedule can be confused by having to navigate contradictory advice from different professionals (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Price and Watson, 2011</xref>).

However, as scoping reviews are designed to capture key concepts rather than evaluate the quality of the evidence, the reliability of results from the included studies is unclear.

To address limitations, these studies recommend understanding the needs of music students as essential for developing effective courses and support measures from the onset of education. Consulting best-practice literature and employing iterative processes with rigorous investigations, including pilot studies and a range of validated measures, is crucial. Methodological improvements such as larger sample sizes, stratification by instrument sub-group to enhance targeted interventions and assist in meta-analyses, and longer follow-up periods are recommended.

The first step was to conduct the literature review as described above to provide an evidence base for best practice in implementing a health protocol for musicians. The second step was to conduct a quantitative online health and wellbeing survey to map students&#x02019; psychological and physical health status. For the third and fourth steps of the project reported here, we conducted focus groups with student participants to gain a contextualized understanding of the survey results, and from the focus group results we synthesized barriers to wellbeing and recommendations for change to guide improvements to the institute&#x02019;s existing wellbeing protocol.

<italic>In semester 1 my friend did not have a single Saturday off. That was 13 Saturdays in a row and there were going to be 4&#x0202f;weeks where she did not have a Saturday or a Sunday off.

<italic>I would say the no days off&#x02026; because from a physical health point of view it&#x02019;s unsustainable.

I think that&#x02019;s a bit of a limiter because even though it&#x02019;s such a positive environment, such a great place to study, and everybody here is really positive and a great influence - it&#x02019;s just still the industry itself is competitive I think.

systemic practices around finances, time, leave, and pressure as main themes affecting student wellness at an elite pre-professional music training institute. The focus group discussions from which these themes were drawn centered around cultural and institutional attitudes and policies, which reflected the multilayered frameworks that formed the theoretical background for this study (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Healthy Conservatoires, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 1986</xref>). In contrast to the more usual situation of wellbeing initiatives in music faculties either being optional or not offered at all (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Wijsman and Ackermann, 2019</xref>), an unusual feature of this institute is that all students are expected to engage with its comprehensive wellbeing program. A similar study conducted elsewhere may have yielded results that focused on the need for wellbeing offerings to be made available, but as these were already in place, this study moves to the foreground the crucial role of institutional policies and cultural mores in musicians&#x02019; health.</p><p>Previous studies have discussed the need to address the conservatoire culture and its structures and processes (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo and Spahn, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Ginsborg, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al., 2017</xref>), however, this is the first study to our knowledge to formulate a design process for a musicians&#x02019; health protocol using recommendations from occupational and public health as well as behavior change perspectives. Where efforts in improving the health status of musicians have historically been focused on conveying knowledge and skills, with more attention over the past 5&#x0202f;years given to behavior change (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Ginsborg, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Norton, 2020</xref>), this study shifts that focus to addressing organizational systems and attitudes as a priority as emphasized in occupational health (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="sec28"><title>The institute</title><p>The institute where this study was conducted is committed to equipping its students for successful music performance careers. This has included dedicating significant resources to student health and wellbeing. Philanthropic funding and the administration&#x02019;s attention to wellbeing means that it is arguably better-resourced than most music faculties and able to provide a content-rich wellbeing program, including many of the aspects proposed in <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Phillips (2023)</xref> (see also <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Rosset et al., 2022</xref>). At the time of the study, the institute&#x02019;s wellness protocol addressed all eight domains of the Healthy Conservatoires UK Fit to Perform framework (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Healthy Conservatoires, 2020</xref>), in contrast to the widespread lack of health knowledge and skills available at most tertiary music faculties (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Wijsman and Ackermann, 2019</xref>).</p><p>While participants expressed appreciation and gratitude for the wellbeing program and for the opportunity to study at the institute itself, they noted the dislocation between what they had learned and been advised to do, and the absence of time, opportunity and energy to do it due to financial and time constraints and practice and performance demands. This dislocation between stated policy and achievable practicality has been previously signposted by <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Ginsborg (2022)</xref> and <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo and Spahn (2022)</xref>. The situation where participants felt they were not thriving but struggling to survive (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Keyes, 2009</xref>) illustrates the application of <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH (2016)</xref> hierarchy of control and <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al.&#x02019;s (2011)</xref> COM-B model, suggesting barriers to health at the level of organizational policy and culture can make it difficult if not impossible for individuals to practice effective health literacy.</p><p>Music students have been reported as exercising low responsibility for their own health (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo et al., 2017</xref>), however, perhaps part of the reason they do not exercise adequate self-care is because of the logistic and cultural environments in which they operate. The established approach of directing health interventions toward the behavior of individual musicians without addressing the overarching policies and the cultural environment could be an explanation of why the prevalence of playing-related problems has remained persistently high. However, it remains to be seen whether the health of musicians improves in healthier music study and work environments. It seems easier to place full responsibility for exercising health literacy on musicians by providing them with information and strategies, than to face the formidable challenges of institutional and cultural change. However, the interdisciplinary literature suggests that unless those needed changes are addressed, strategies aimed at increasing the knowledge and skills of individuals are unlikely to bring about sustained improvements in wellbeing (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Kelly and Barker, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Lowe, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nutbeam, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Weale et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec29"><title>Barriers to wellbeing and recommendations for change</title><p>Among the four main themes of finances, leave, time and pressure derived from the focus group data, barriers most often prioritized in the student ranking fell into the finances, time and leave themes, whereas the most frequently prioritized recommendations for change included fitness and exercise and social connection. This flags the importance of returning to stakeholders for consideration of issues that may initially have been nominated by a minority in one format, as these issues may come to the fore when presented back in another format.</p><p>Three of the four main themes: finances, time and leave, were all discussed by participants in terms of instability and insufficiency. Conflict between financial and time constraints and practice and performance demands compromised participants&#x02019; self-care even though they were well-informed and possessed a good understanding of wellbeing. Participants did not regard the problems as unsolvable, putting forward clear recommendations to allow more flexibility in the schedule (See <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and <xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material 3</xref> for the full list of recommendations). However, the strain around finances leading to problems with mental health echoed <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Gross and Musgrave&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> findings that the leading cause of mental health difficulties in professional musicians in the UK was financial and vocational precarity.</p><p>A willingness to negotiate flexible solutions was more prominent in focus group discussions than were requests for more services or less work, reflecting participants&#x02019; interest in constructive engagement with problem-solving when it came to barriers to wellness, and their desire for more autonomy. For example, when discussing factors contributing to pressure, participants spoke of sometimes being required for 2 or 3&#x0202f;weeks&#x02019; performing without a day off, during which time other aspects of life banked up. When days off did arrive, participants used them to try to catch up on earnings and other commitments, causing snowballing fatigue. To help counteract these unsustainable conditions, participants requested more input into rehearsal and performance scheduling, introducing the possibility of being able to swap with someone else if logistics allowed it. The request for active participation in scheduling is consistent with the appreciation participants had for everything the institute had to offer while increasing their autonomy within it. Autonomy is named as one of three core psychological aspects of wellness in Self-Determination Theory (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2015</xref>).</p><p>One way of analyzing focus group discussion data is noting how long the group spends on a topic or how many people speak on it. However, that has the potential to underplay the importance of topics that might be more difficult to bring into a group discussion. This includes issues that came under the theme of internal pressures. Isolation from family and friends, and limited opportunities to socialize with fellow students due to packed schedules compromised relatedness, which is one of Self-Determination Theory&#x02019;s three essential components for wellbeing (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2015</xref>). While many participants were happy with the support structures the institute provided, several had experienced repeated difficulties with feeling unheard and felt they were regarded as the problem, instead of the problem being the one they were trying to bring forward. Similarly, there was some discussion around unprofessional behavior and bullying that gave rise to recommendations for training in ethics and emotional intelligence. Though the voices were few on these matters, there was intense silence through these parts of the discussion, which raises the question of how many others felt the same but were reticent to speak about it. Bullying and micro aggression can potentially play into the perfectionism prevalent in this population and undermine a sense of competence, which is another component of wellbeing.</p><p>Several participant barriers and recommendations were similar to those put forward in <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Matei and Ginsborg&#x02019;s (2022)</xref> analysis of a 5-month wellbeing course with UK conservatoire students, for example, participants felt that lack of specificity to their situation and too much overlap in the material was a waste of their time; they wanted more sessions with high-level musicians telling their stories and offering guidance, and they wanted more &#x0201c;hands-on&#x0201d; practical sessions that applied directly to playing their instrument. In addition, participants in this study reflected that health protocol content would be easier to absorb if it was more structured and the topics progressed logically.</p><p>This study supports public and occupational health statements that even in the presence of a comprehensive, well-resourced wellbeing program, playing-related problems arise in the context of personal, institutional, and social practices and attitudes that can influence health behavior more strongly than health literacy (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nutbeam, 2019</xref>), and that psychosocial as well as other health determinants need to be addressed at the organizational level (CSA Group and BNQ 2013/2018; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Oakman et al., 2018</xref>). The inclusion of cultural and organizational factors in participants&#x02019; perception of factors contributing to playing-related problems shows the utility of the multiple levels in the COM-B behavior model when considering prevention and management of playing-related problems, and illustrates the congruence between the COM-B model and occupational and public health frameworks for use in the tertiary music context.</p></sec><sec id="sec30"><title>Author recommendations for revised health protocol</title><p>At the time the overall project ended at the end of Step 4 of the 7-step process, and subject to potential adjustments in response to further data collected in Steps 5&#x02013;7, the working plan was to apply the following principles, design and content delivery to the existing protocol:</p><sec id="sec31"><title>Principles</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Engaging curricula and learning experiences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Supportive social, physical and digital information exchange environments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Community awareness and actions involving all levels of the organization.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Development of students&#x02019; mental health knowledge and self-regulatory skills.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Access to effective services.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ongoing evaluation at institutional and individual levels, with responsive policy and program adjustment.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec32"><title>Design</title><p>Provision of early detection and intervention for mental and physical health symptoms progressing through the following four levels with levels 1 and 2 addressed in the education program:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Preventative or &#x02018;foundational&#x02019; components;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Indicated (at-risk) prevention components;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Early intervention;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Access to musician-specific health care.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec33"><title>Education program content delivery</title><p><italic>Modularized</italic>: Modules to cover each element of the Healthy Conservatoires 8-factor wellbeing framework (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Scaffolded</italic>: To clarify content structure across the year-long program, each module begins with an introductory session, for example for a mental health module, Emotional WB 1.0 Introduction, which expands and develops in complexity in subsequent modules, for example Emotional WB 2.0 Mindfulness; 2.1 Mindfulness for Optimal Performance; Emotional WB 3.0.

The music industry has a long history with established traditions and priorities that can make it challenging to integrate wellbeing as a key factor in music performance. However, traditions and priorities can be examined and tested over time to establish which must be constructively managed and which can be modified or discarded to achieve enhanced wellbeing as well as improved performance.</p><p>To move in the direction of cultural change, this study supports the use of multidimensional theoretical frameworks for designing and testing health initiatives for musicians, for example the Healthy Conservatoires Wellbeing Framework (2020) the COM-B behavior change model (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2011</xref>), and occupational and public health principles (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">CSA Group and BNQ, 2013/2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nutbeam, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec35"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of this study were that it was theoretically grounded across an array of disciplines; the two researchers are qualified in several music, health and education-related areas between them and thus brought a broad range of views and expertise to the project; participation rate in the focus groups was high; and unusually, the study was conducted with a multidisciplinary health protocol already in place at the institute. Synthesizing focus group results and returning them to students for rating in order of importance elicited a good response rate and provided triangulation of results, helping to offset researcher bias. Additional rigor was added to the study by the researchers working together in real time throughout project planning and data analysis, reflecting on assumptions we had made from our professional backgrounds, and contrasting study results with those we had expected.</p><p>Limitations of this study include that it is based on a single institution so the results are not necessarily generalizable, and the study was conducted by researchers with experience as healthcare practitioners and educators, but with no experience of working as professional musicians or music administrators. In addition, asking participants to prioritize their top five barriers to wellbeing and recommendations for change had the unintended effect of screening out potentially equally important barriers and recommendations suggested by a minority. These should be held over for reconsideration during future program reviews.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec36"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Barriers to wellbeing in the context of elite pre-professional music training, and proposed recommendations for change to improve student wellbeing related mostly to institutional policy and culture. Psychosocial, organizational and cultural factors contribute to psychological and physical playing-related problems, and need to be addressed using a structured, integrated approach, with risk control implemented at the highest possible organizational level. Successful health promotion programs need to be theoretically sound and contextually appropriate; operate across every level of the institution; possess the committed support of managers and teachers; involve ongoing collaboration with all stakeholder representatives; build healthy environments; strengthen community action around wellbeing; improve individual health literacy, and prove to be effective in achieving specified wellness outcomes. Evaluation of the effect of wellbeing programs on the health of musicians and program adjustment in response to continual feedback and changing conditions is key to success.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors extend their grateful thanks to the music institute for providing the opportunity to carry out this valuable research; to the participants for their time and thoughtful contributions, and to Hamish Jamieson, Noah Lawrence, and Laura Panther for making this publication possible.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec37"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because ethics approval for this project does not permit sharing the collected data.
