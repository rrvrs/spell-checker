Recent studies conducted across higher education institutions have reported prevalence estimates ranging from 19 % to 56 %<sup>(<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup>. FI is defined as a lack of access to healthy, nutritious, culturally appropriate and affordable foods<sup>(<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>. This issue has been increasingly studied in high-income countries, with contributing factors including the recent pandemic, cost of living pressures and increasing privatisation of campus food outlets in higher education settings<sup>(<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>As a result, students are more likely to skip meals and compromise the nutritional quality of their food<sup>(<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup>. In recent years, this has led to a growth in research efforts to understand the complexity of student FI and develop solutions.</p><p>Commencing higher education is a key transitional period, particularly for international students and those living out of home for the first time<sup>(<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>. Students are often faced with academic and financial pressures associated with tuition and accommodation, sometimes compounded by a lack of family support and knowledge gaps in food preparation<sup>(<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>. Evidence indicates FI among students is linked with poorer mental and physical health outcomes including higher BMI and depression<sup>(<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup>. Studies have identified that student food security barriers are often related to time scarcity, insufficient money for adequate, healthy foods<sup>(<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup> and a lack of access to culturally appropriate foods, particularly for international students<sup>(<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup>. This can lead to the sacrifice of nutritional quality for meals that are more accessible, increasing obesogenic behaviours<sup>(<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)</sup>. Campus food environments are also influential in determining student dietary choices, and there is often a lack of healthy and affordable food options available on higher education campuses<sup>(<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup>. FI in students has also been associated with poorer academic outcomes including lower grade point averages and class attendance<sup>(<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Patterns of FI amongst students are often tied to social and economic inequities. Several studies have shown how FI disproportionally affects students because of factors such as race<sup>(<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup>, international enrolment<sup>(<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</sup>, gender<sup>(<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</sup>, socio-economic status<sup>(<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)</sup>, living away from home<sup>(<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)</sup> and existing household FI<sup>(<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup>. Recent research has also demonstrated that food-insecure students may simultaneously experience other insecurities related to basic needs and housing<sup>(<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Increased awareness of this issue has prompted higher education institutions to develop programmes that attempt to meet students&#x02019; food needs. The most common solutions offered by higher education institutions include campus food pantries, student meal plans and financial assistance programmes<sup>(<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>. Whilst these efforts play an important role in increasing access to food, the persistently high prevalence of FI among students, suggest they may not fully meet the needs of students. Most food security programmes are food relief-centred<sup>(<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)</sup>, which can risk perpetuating the stigmatisation of already marginalised food-insecure students<sup>(<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)</sup>. There is also evidence that existing food-relief programmes often do not meet nutritional needs<sup>(<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)</sup>. This points to the need for more multidimensional strategies including those at an institutional governance level to support and prioritise FI<sup>(<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>. Such strategies may include policies and procedures, that allow for monitoring, investments and infrastructure to support effective and sustainable programmes<sup>(<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Although there is burgeoning research in this area, there tends to be a strong focus on identifying the extent of the problem through passive forms of engagement with students rather than in the development of solutions. Despite being key stakeholders and end users of the FI initiatives, students&#x02019; voices, perspectives and lived experiences are often underexplored<sup>(<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)</sup>. Effective engagement with a variety of stakeholders, including end-users, in the design and development of solutions may offer more inclusive and sustainable strategies<sup>(<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)</sup>. This approach may also strengthen student agency, a pillar of food security recently defined by Clapp et al. as &#x02018;the capacity of individuals to contribute meaningfully to the processes that govern their food systems&#x02019;<sup>(<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup>. By engaging with students who are directly affected by FI, through participation in research and decision-making processes, institutions can better tailor initiatives to address specific needs and barriers.</p><p>Research methodologies that emphasise participation are becoming increasingly popular in addressing public health issues<sup>(<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</sup>. Participatory research is a broad term describing research designs, methodologies and frameworks used to elicit &#x02018;direct collaboration with those affected by the issue being studied for the purpose of action or change&#x02019;<sup>(<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</sup>. Participatory research methods can vary, from conventional surveys and focus groups to more involved methods such as community-led research<sup>(<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)</sup>. Participatory research methods can allow for co-design, where stakeholders collaborate with researchers to design and develop solutions or interventions that meet the needs of the population being studied, ensuring outcomes are relevant, effective and tailored to their specific context.</p><p>With the increasing recognition of student FI, higher education institutions are poised to integrate new strategies and institutional policies, that should embody students&#x02019; experiences of FI and their perspectives of effective solutions. This scoping review aims to describe and evaluate evidence of student participation in research and identifies strategies related to FI in the higher education setting. The following research questions guided this scoping review: (1) Is there evidence for the integration of co-designing methodologies in research aimed at addressing student FI? (2) What strategies and outcomes have resulted from utilising these methodologies? (3) Are there any barriers to student participation in collaborative research methodologies?</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><p>A scoping review was selected due to its capacity for broad exploration of the existing literature, particularly given the nascent nature of research on campus FI, as evidenced by the lack of comprehensive reviews. This scoping review follows Arksey and O&#x02019;Malley&#x02019;s six-stage methodological framework<sup>(<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)</sup>. The review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist (see Supplementary File <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980025000485">1</uri>)<sup>(<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)</sup>. There was no quality appraisal as per scoping review guidelines<sup>(<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)</sup>. A title and abstract review were conducted by one reviewer (T.S.), and articles that did not meet the defined inclusion criteria were excluded. Full-text review was then undertaken by three reviewers (T.S., N.F., G.G.). In the case of disagreement, reviewers discussed eligibility and came to a collective agreement. A protocol further detailing the study&#x02019;s methodology and search strategy is publicly available through Open Science Framework, doi: <ext-link xlink:href="10.17605/OSF.IO/573NT" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/573NT</ext-link>.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="s1-1"><title>Search strategy and study selection</title><p>A preliminary literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE and Google Scholar to identify key search terms.

</p><p>A grey literature search plan was developed for Google and Google Scholar. The advanced search feature was used to enter search terms and limit the search from January 2010 to May 2024. To further narrow the search, filtering for English language and PDF file types was applied. The search strategy included the following search terms: (university OR higher education OR college OR campus) AND (food security OR food insecurity OR food access OR food environment) AND (engagement OR participatory action OR engagement OR co-design OR co-develop OR participatory research). Due to the complexity of screening all retrieved results from Google and Google Scholar, the relevancy ranking in these search engines brought the most relevant results to the top. Then, the first ten pages of each search hit (&#x0223c;100 results in total) were screened, including the title and if provided, the summary or abstract. The search strategies including the filters applied, number of hits and search terms were recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. After screening, potentially eligible grey literature was uploaded into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet before undergoing a full-text review. Grey literature was in the form of policies, strategic plans and reports that met the criteria in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and was from English-speaking countries including but not limited to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom and United States.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s1-2"><title>Key terms and definitions</title><p>Studies were assessed for their inclusion of key concepts related to the research questions. Such concepts are outlined here along with their definitions and the approach used for assessment.</p><p>The United Nations Committee on World Food Security describes food security as &#x02018;the physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&#x02019;<sup>(<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>In this scoping review, studies addressed any aspect of food security associated with the six pillars of food security &#x02013; availability, access, utilisation, stability, sustainability and agency<sup>(<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup>. Recognising that food and nutrition security often overlap, studies involving nutritional interventions were considered in the review process.</p><p>Higher education, also known as post-secondary education or tertiary education, refers to any form of education that takes place after the completion of secondary education. The structure of higher education may vary by country; however, it generally includes institutions such as universities and colleges that offer academic, professional or vocational qualifications.</p><p>Co-designing can promote meaningful participation evoking individuals&#x02019; or groups&#x02019; perspectives, insights and ideas, with their input being taken into account in shaping outcomes, actions or policies<sup>(<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>)</sup>. The level of participation is often proportional to the degree of influence students have in the research and decision-making process<sup>(<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)</sup>.

Data extracted from the literature included the following information: author, publication year, title, document type, country, study design and methods, study objective(s), setting, participatory model or framework, stakeholder involvement or partnerships, student demographic characteristics, outcome(s), student mode of participation, stage of research cycle, study findings (key strategies), student perceptions and limitations and barriers to student participation. Data were assessed based on the participation level (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and the step of the research process where participation occurred. The five-step research process was based on the National Health and Medical Research Council&#x02019;s research cycle<sup>(<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>)</sup>. Additionally, the themes, tools and features of participatory methods were organised into the domains specified by Duea et al. (2022): (1) Engagement and capacity building; (2) Exploration and visioning; (3) Visual and narrative; (4) Mobilisation and (5) Evaluation<sup>(<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)</sup>. A simple content analysis approach was used to categorise the strategies and solutions identified in the included studies<sup>(<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>)</sup>. Using Microsoft Excel, one author (T.S.) repeatedly read the extracted text and inductively created descriptive codes that described the type of strategy or solution. Categorisation of strategies and solutions was primarily inductive; however, the socio-ecological model was considered during this process, as the resulting categories loosely aligned with its recognition of multiple levels of influence affecting students. Given the interpretive nature of this analysis and the author&#x02019;s familiarity with the topic of FI, which may have influenced the interpretation of strategies identified, academic researcher reflexivity was considered to account for the author&#x02019;s familiarity with the topic and academic background. There was regular consultation with co-authors (N.F. and G.G.) who acted as secondary reviewers to this coding and categorisation process. This helped with potential uncertainty and bias around interpretation, supporting the grounding of findings in the data rather than being influenced by one author&#x02019;s perspective.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>As shown in Figure <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, there were 528 results generated from the primary search strategy in three academic databases and citation searching.

After excluding 648 articles, the remaining 166 underwent full-text review by three reviewers (T.S., N.F. and G.G.). There were 138 articles excluded with reasons documented, resulting in twenty-eight studies included in the review.

The majority of studies were conducted in higher education settings in the United States (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 22, 79 %), and the remaining in Australia (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 4, 14 %) and Canada (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 2, 7 %). The publication dates of included studies ranged from 2017 to 2023, with the majority of studies conducted between 2020 and 2024 (93 %). The study designs were classified as either qualitative (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 19, 68 %) or mixed methods (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 9, 32 %). The included grey literature was in the form of reports, strategic plans and panel summaries where co-design methodologies were utilised. Of the studies included, the majority were situated in the university setting (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 26), and the remaining were in a community college (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1) and a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute setting (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1). There were eleven studies that specifically screened students for FI who were involved in the identification of solutions in some way (39 %) and five that explicitly involved students who had been identified as food insecure (17 %). The measures used to screen food security status varied across studies. These included the United States Department of Agriculture Six-item Short Form Food Security Survey Module (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 4), United States Adult Food Security Survey Module (10 item) (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 2), Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1), self-identified food insecurity (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 2) and one study where the measure was unclear (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1).</p><p>

</p><p>The objectives of all studies were similar in that the purpose of student participation was to identify and utilise students&#x02019; experiences, perspectives and ideas for solutions. An additional reason for student involvement was that the study involved student-led interventions and programmes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 4). In twelve of the twenty-eight studies, students participated in the research process for the purpose of evaluating or reflecting upon existing solutions to student FI (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 12).</p><p>There were three distinct student subpopulations explicitly involved in three studies: international students<sup>(<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>)</sup>, military-connected students<sup>(<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>)</sup> and students identifying as LGBTQIA+<sup>(<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)</sup>. For demographic characteristics, 39 % of the studies had a majority female (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 11) and 54 % undergraduate students (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 15) reported. Many studies provided evidence of student participation; however, there was still a significant amount of unreported data on gender (46 %), education level (35 %) and enrolment status (71 %).</p><p>Ten studies specified a participatory model or framework in the study design. This included participatory action research (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 3), community-based participatory research (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 3), feminist action research (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1), socio-ecological model (<sc>s</sc>em) (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1), &#x02018;Mobilize, Assess, Plan, Implement and Track&#x02019; (MAP-IT) framework (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1) and an &#x02018;Evidence, Insight, Action&#x02019; framework (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 1).</p><p>For the level of participation, seventeen out of twenty-eight studies had involved students in more than one step of the research cycle. However, only three studies reported student participation across all five steps, indicating continuous engagement. Evidence of co-design and co-development was found in thirteen of the twenty-eight studies. There were six studies that had evidence of student participation from the first step: identification of a solution, to the fourth step: the dissemination of results.</p><p>Regarding the four participation levels, the most common was the minimum, consultative, identified in thirteen of twenty-eight studies. The highest level of participation, student empowerment, was identified in nine of twenty-eight studies, with three of these studies specifically noting student-led research.</p><p>Three of the twenty-eight studies had the second lowest level of participation which was involvement, and eight of twenty-eight studies had the second highest level of participation which was collaborative. There were five studies that had more than one level of participation recorded. This was because the study was led by student researchers who had conducted research processes on other students, for instance, student-led interviews or focus groups. For conventional participatory research methods, studies included utilised surveys (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 13), focus groups (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 8) and individual interviews (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 6) to collect student&#x02019;s experiences, opinions and ideas towards solutions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s2-3"><title>Stakeholders, partnerships and collaborations</title><p>The types of partnerships, collaborations and stakeholders also varied across studies. Ten of the twenty-eight studies included only students and researchers in the research cycle. Whereas most of the studies had evidence of collaboration and partnership among multiple stakeholders (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 18, 64 %). These stakeholders included student co-researchers (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 7), student organisations and groups (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 3), university staff including administrators and faculty (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 8), sustainability coordinators (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 2) and food programmes staff and volunteers (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 3). Three studies also showed evidence of engagement with clinical and public health staff including practitioners<sup>(<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>)</sup>, health promotion specialists<sup>(<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>)</sup> and registered dietitians<sup>(<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>)</sup>. As shown in Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, some studies had evidence of engagement with stakeholders through specific organisational structures or groups such task forces<sup>(<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>)</sup>, coalitions<sup>(<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>)</sup>, group seminars<sup>(<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>)</sup>, panels<sup>(<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>)</sup>, working advisory groups<sup>(<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)</sup> and steering committees<sup>(<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s2-4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The most common outcomes were recommendations for strategies including policy and programme development (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 23), evaluation of existing programmes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 5), increased awareness of student FI among the university community (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 11) and enhancing advocacy efforts (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 5). For studies with higher levels of student participation, particularly, collaboration, empowerment or student-led, there was often more than one outcome reported.

Barriers to student participation were identified in nineteen of the twenty-eight studies. One of the barriers was related to social desirability bias linked to the stigma of being identified as food insecure, which affected participation in the research<sup>(<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>)</sup>. Conformity bias was also noted particularly in focus group settings, where students may have refrained from sharing unpopular individual experiences, resulting in potentially homogenised suggestions on solutions<sup>(<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>)</sup>. Both types of bias hindered open communication, leading to lower participation rates, less meaningful participation and results that were potentially not representative of the actual experiences and needs of food-insecure students<sup>(<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>)</sup>. Co-researcher students in one study also felt uncomfortable seeking out food-insecure students for interviews due to fear of further stigmatising their food-insecure peers<sup>(<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>)</sup>. Although 43 % of studies (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 12) screened students for FI, one study avoided this process to specifically reduce the risk of stigmatising student participants<sup>(<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Student-led research studies (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 3) noted that barriers to sustained engagement and project task completion were most likely due to a lack of student availability, busy schedules, high student turnover rates and long-term communication issues<sup>(<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>)</sup>.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This was the first review to explore evidence of co-design approaches in research addressing FI in the higher education setting. Overall, the findings suggest that methodologies incorporating these approaches can promote more meaningful participation with students who may be affected by FI which can lead to more unique and inclusive solutions.</p><p>This review explored the field of FI research in higher education settings, noting that 95 % of articles were published in the last 4 years. This surge of recent publications indicates a growing recognition of the issue and increased research focus on understanding and addressing FI among students. All included studies were from higher-income countries, predominantly conducted in the United States, where the prominence of campus food security research may be linked with the country&#x02019;s mainstream food movements supporting food justice and sovereignty<sup>(<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>)</sup>. Food justice movements emphasise the need for more just food systems, where healthy, sustainable and equitable food is recognised as a human right, while also addressing the root causes and structural inequities that contribute to FI<sup>(<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>)</sup>. Some advancements in food security research and policy in the United States have led to developments in organisations such as Swipe Out Hunger and the federal food access programme known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program<sup>(<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>The degree of student participation in research and decision-making processes varied across studies included in the review. Results found students were mostly engaged in the formative stages of the research cycle involving the identification of potential solutions and need assessments. There was also variation in the level of student participation across the studies. The most commonly reported level of student participation was consultative, which was the lowest level of participation. Consultative participation often involves traditional qualitative research methods such as focus groups, interviews and surveys where students participate in the research to provide their opinions, experiences and feedback on potential strategies and solutions<sup>(<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>)</sup>. Conversely, 32 % of studies had students engaged in the highest level whereas 11 % of these were student-led.</p><p>Nevertheless, evidence of co-design and co-development was present in 46 % of the studies where 11 % had evidence of student participation in all five steps of the research cycle. Continuous engagement with stakeholders throughout each research cycle phase can characterise co-designing and co-producing processes, constituting co-creation<sup>(<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>)</sup>. Co-creation which involves active engagement at all stages of the research cycle, promotes continued dialogue, power-sharing and reciprocity between stakeholders<sup>(<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>)</sup>. Although, as revealed in this review, there are some challenges associated with achieving a high level of collaboration. Continuous engagement with students can be difficult to achieve because of a lack of student availability due to busy schedules, high student turnover rates and long-term communication issues. Some collaborative and student-led studies were found to utilise alternative visual and narrative methods for data collection, analysis and interpretation including journal entries, concept mapping and digital storytelling. These methods can adopt strong collaboration with students by aligning with their interests and empowering them to actively engage in the research process<sup>(<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>The utilisation of participatory research frameworks can guide researchers in co-creating interventions and strategies<sup>(<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>)</sup>. There were ten studies in this review (36 %) that utilised some form of participatory framework. These frameworks were often incorporated into course curriculums and student research projects where students were trained to use them to perform research on their food-insecure peers. These methodologies can provide the basis for effective engagement but can also facilitate community capacity building<sup>(<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)</sup>. Participatory research frameworks can facilitate individual&#x02019;s understanding of the problem and its manifestations in their communities, whilst also providing opportunities for skill and knowledge development to create new solutions<sup>(<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>)</sup>. Community engagement and agency are essential for food justice, decision-making and transformative food system changes<sup>(<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>)</sup>. This involvement in research processes can also have lasting impacts on community members including empowerment<sup>(<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>)</sup>. Brand (2023) highlights how participatory action research motivated students to pursue food justice beyond the scope of the study, creating a sustained interest in addressing social justice issues<sup>(<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>)</sup>. Similar outcomes were observed in a study utilising the community-based participatory research methodology, where student involvement in the Food Dignity Project led to improved values and attitudes towards the food system and enhanced students&#x02019; ability to effect change in the local community<sup>(<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Developing strong partnerships was found to be critical for long-term collaboration and the development of sustainable solutions<sup>(<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)</sup>. Rousseau&#x02019;s study<sup>(<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)</sup> included a 4-month relationship-building period where students could collectively express their experiences in confidence during regular meetings, leading to a sense of mutual support and empowerment. Unlike traditional research methods where participation is often one-off, effective co-design can prioritise relationship and trust-building, particularly when working with marginalised communities and addressing sensitive topics<sup>(<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>)</sup>. Partnerships with students and university stakeholders were often solidified through working groups, task forces and committees which could provide an ongoing communication channel and representation of key stakeholders. Creating these partnerships requires the identification of relevant stakeholders, creating a shared vision and developing a set of values and goals<sup>(<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>)</sup>. Findings from this study show that this process can be facilitated through exploration and vision strategies such as group planning processes, stakeholder priority setting, asset mapping and comprehensive needs assessments<sup>(<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)</sup>. At the University of California, Fanshel and Iles (2021) utilised foodscape mapping with student collaborators, a strategy which led to the development of advocacy projects and changes in the campus food system policy<sup>(<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>)</sup>. Furthermore, collaborations across academic faculties and disciplines including nutrition and dietetics, public health, agricultural, environmental and social sciences are key to ensuring a comprehensive approach to supporting health and well-being, sustainability and the campus food environment. One key multidisciplinary strategy involved engaging media and creative arts students in promoting and advertising FS programmes, resources and information developed by students and staff from health and nutrition-related facilities<sup>(<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Successful coalitions form relationships between internal (i.e. relationships between students and researchers) and external entities<sup>(<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>)</sup>. The review found evidence of partnerships with local expertise such as established food security coalitions, agricultural groups, local community members, non-profit organisations and other universities to be beneficial in sharing knowledge and increasing capacity for solutions. Community-university partnerships have proven valuable in driving social change within food systems, building community skills and forming a community of practices<sup>(<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>While collaborative efforts were found to be important, the power to enable systemic changes lies with institutional leaders, who can allocate resources and infrastructure and enforce policies and procedures that shape and support student food security<sup>(<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup>. Several strategies were identified at a policy and institutional support level. Some of these include regular monitoring of FI risk among students, educating institution staff and incorporating comprehensive FS policies into existing health and well-being and food service procurement policies. Some of the studies found student suggestions around having trained and dedicated university staff members who could lead initiatives, drive policy changes for the campus food environment and support students experiencing FI. Findings from this review also suggest that student-led research may have a greater impact on institutional governance by enhancing the capacity of student co-researchers to engage in advocacy processes. Students involved in disseminating results through presentations, workshops and meetings with university stakeholders could help leverage the social justice issue to the forefront of the institution&#x02019;s agenda.</p><p>Recent qualitative work has shown how students are often unaware of their own food security status and the resources and support available at their institution<sup>(<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>)</sup>. Consequently, they may lack an understanding of how FI manifests and the wide-ranging implications. This lack of awareness may explain why studies at the consultative level of student participation with limited representation of food-insecure students, generally identified existing, surface-level solutions to address FI. Examples of these solutions found in some of these studies include implementing campus food pantries and distributing grocery vouchers and emergency food aid. Despite the importance of these solutions, they are typically short-term, addressing immediate needs rather than the root causes of FI<sup>(<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>)</sup>. This highlights the strength of collaborative research methods which can provide opportunities for mutual learning and encourage participants to think critically about the problem, how it affects individuals and how to facilitate effective, systemic changes<sup>(<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>)</sup>. An additional benefit is the increased awareness and normalisation of FI in the university community, which has also been outlined as a key recommendation for creating more supportive campus environments<sup>(<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>One of the barriers to student participation was ensuring a diverse representation. This is particularly challenging given the complexity of food security, which is often intertwined with various other inequities among students. There was a high representation of undergraduate students involved (54 % of the studies), aligning with recent evidence which indicates undergraduate students were at least three and a half times more likely to be food insecure than postgraduate students<sup>(<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup>. There was a focus on some vulnerable groups with increased risk of FI in this review such as LGBTQIA+, military-connected students and international students. Empirical research has also identified other at-risk groups including housing-insecure<sup>(<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup>, disabled<sup>(<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>)</sup>, parents<sup>(<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>)</sup> and first-generation students<sup>(<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>)</sup>. Participatory research methodologies with marginalised communities can promote relevant, appropriate and inclusive strategies and solutions<sup>(<xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>)</sup>. Therefore, future student FI research should adopt similar collaborative methodologies to address the needs of other student groups at risk of FI.</p><p>Participatory research methods offer an approach to amplifying the voices of vulnerable and marginalised groups in higher education settings, particularly for FI<sup>(<xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>)</sup>. These methods can create supportive environments for developing non-hierarchical relationships and effective collaboration between researchers and participants<sup>(<xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>)</sup>. Studies in this review with higher levels of student participation, for instance, student-led research, often reported less demographic and FI screening. This likely stems from the stigma associated with FI in higher education environments, where explicit screening for FI and demographic characteristics may inadvertently cause students to feel inferior or further stigmatised, especially in group settings like focus group discussions and workshops. To address this challenge while maintaining diverse representation, one effective strategy that was identified was to integrate participatory research projects, campaigns and task forces with existing student organisations and societies that represent diverse student populations. This approach allows for engagement with diverse groups, potentially reducing stigma whilst capturing a range of experiences and perspectives on campus FI.</p><p>This scoping review is not without limitations. Firstly, although this review aimed to explore literature from all countries, findings were exclusively from higher-income nations, predominantly the United States, which limits the generalisability of the findings to other regions particularly, lower- and middle-income countries. Although most studies focused on universities, the broad inclusion for any type of higher education institution, such as community colleges, may also limit the generalisability of the findings to unique institutions which often differ between countries. Given the early nature of this research area, the review sought to capture all potential literature by including three academic databases and two grey literature sources. However, since it involves the higher educational setting, the review is unable to capture any internal institutional efforts that are not published or available online. A potential strategy to address this limitation would be to consult with relevant university stakeholders, though this was not feasible within the scope and capacity of this review. We also acknowledge that a more directed content analysis could have been applied to support deductive coding and improve consistency, thereby reducing potential bias in the categorisation process. Future research could consider adopting a more systematic coding framework when exploring solutions to FI in higher education. Furthermore, scoping reviews have innate limitations associated with having a broader scope, meaning that included studies had some degree of heterogeneity in terms of study design and methodologies. This meant that identifying similarities between studies was often challenging. Despite the use of broad search terms and a systemic search strategy, there is a possibility some studies were also missed in this review.</p><p>The findings of this review reinforce how integrating co-design research methodologies can ensure that strategies are grounded in communities&#x02019; experiences and needs, in this case, for addressing student FI in the higher education setting. This review uncovered a variety of strategies that researchers, students and university stakeholders can adopt in their respective institutions. Co-design approaches can bring about additional benefits such as enhanced student capacity, improved advocacy efforts, long-term partnerships and a deeper understanding of stakeholders&#x02019; priorities and needs. Empowering students to be actively involved in the research and decision-making processes concerning their food environments is critical for achieving equitable, healthy outcomes and long-term systemic changes. The review also identified several barriers associated with utilising such methodologies in higher education settings. As research in this field progresses, future studies should prioritise collaborative co-design approaches when exploring solutions to FI and similar social justice issues affecting students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="secNaN"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="sm01" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Scutts et al. supplementary material</title><p>Scutts et al. supplementary material</p></caption><media xlink:href="S1368980025000485sup001.docx" id="d67e3937" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Mr Jeremy Cullis, the clinician librarian at Macquarie University, for his assistance with planning the search strategy for database searches.</p></ack><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s8"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>For supplementary material accompanying this paper visit <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980025000485">https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980025000485</uri>
