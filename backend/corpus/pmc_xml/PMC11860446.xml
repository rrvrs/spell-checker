Introduction</title><p>The primary drivers of piscine orthoreovirus genogroup 1 (PRV-1) virulence are largely unknown. Despite the establishment of a causative link between PRV-1 and the disease of farmed Atlantic salmon known as heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], infection with PRV-1 does not always result in disease [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, the virus is relatively commonplace across countries with Atlantic salmon farming, but the occurrence of HSMI is not [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, in Norway&#x02014;where PRV-1 and HSMI were first identified [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]&#x02014;PRV-1 is ubiquitous among farmed Atlantic salmon and HSMI poses a significant and widespread production concern for the industry (e.g., 150&#x02013;180 farm-level HSMI cases per year across &#x0003e;600 active farms) [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, in Pacific Canada, PRV-1 is also ubiquitous across the Atlantic salmon industry, reaching high viral loads, while the occurrence of HSMI-like disease is rare (e.g., typically 0 or occasionally 1 farm-level HSMI-like case per year across &#x0003e;70 farms) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Differential disease outcomes of PRV-1 infection have also been observed across controlled laboratory exposure studies with similar environmental parameters where the universal establishment of high load systemic infections have produced varying amounts of heart inflammation [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Current data indicate that PRV-1 virulence is at least partially driven by genetic variation within the virus. This is supported by a side-by-side controlled laboratory comparison of six PRV-1 genetically unique isolates which differed in their ability to induce HSMI-like heart inflammation in a European stock of Atlantic salmon [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically, isolates categorized in the PRV-1a genotype based on S1 genome segment phylogeny were demonstrated to have lower virulence than two PRV-1b isolates, and this has been supported by HSMI field observations [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additional consideration of other genome segments has further led to the hypothesis that viral reassortment of two ancestral genotypes in Norwegian aquaculture gave rise (and may continue to give rise) to virulent phenotype(s) of PRV-1, and that genotypic variation in segments beyond S1 are required for increased virulence [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One current unexplained caveat is that the PRV-1 genotype is not always explanatory of disease&#x02014;as evidenced by occasional farm-level diagnoses of HSMI or HSMI-like disease with PRV-1 infections that are considered to be &#x0201c;low-virulence&#x0201d; genotypes [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Host and environmental factors also implicitly influence disease outcome; yet fewer data are available for implicating either host or environmental conditions in the establishment of HSMI. This disease appears to be associated with an adaptive cytotoxic T cell response by Atlantic salmon to PRV-1 antigen (reviewed by [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) and, thus, modulation of salmon T cell responses would be expected to impact disease outcomes. This is supported by investigations involving the dietary modulation of Atlantic salmon immune responses that may at least partially mitigate HSMI [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, some Atlantic salmon stocks may inherently be more (or less) predisposed to PRV associated disease, as suggested by the development of a strain of Atlantic Salmon in Norway that has been claimed to have less heart damage and higher survival in association with HSMI yet is equally susceptible to PRV-1 infection [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Laboratory vs. field observations for HSMI severity also clearly indicate an environmental component associated with this disease [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], yet the particular mechanisms in field environments that enhance HSMI outcomes are unknown. Although &#x0201c;stress&#x0201d; associated with production environments has been commonly hypothesized to contribute to HSMI, application of maximal glucocorticoid, forced transition to saltwater, or viral coinfection stressors in laboratory environments have been insufficient to recreate equivalent disease [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the degree to which host genetic differences affect PRV-1-associated disease and compare the influence of host Atlantic salmon strain directly to PRV-1 genotype to see which factor had a greater impact on PRV-1-associated disease. We hypothesized that both the host strain of Atlantic salmon and the viral genotype would influence disease severity following the disease triangle principle [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but that viral genotype would have a greater influence based on currently available data that suggest at least some PRV-1b isolates appear to be more strongly associated with disease in both the laboratory and field.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00285"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-17-00285"><title>2.1. PRV-1 Isolates</title><p>Three PRV-1 isolates were used in this study: BC-16-005ND, NOR-2018NL, and NB-2018-128 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The first isolate, BC-16-005ND, originated from a commercial farmed Atlantic salmon from the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Canada [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Viral particles for this isolate were purified from infected whole blood as previously described [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Briefly, sonicated and clarified blood homogenate was combined with Vertrel XF (DuPont Chemicals, Wilmington, DE, USA) was layered onto a 1.22&#x02013;1.45 g/mL cesium chloride gradient and centrifuged using a SW 40 TI rotor in an Optima LE 80k Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at 40,000 rpm for 20 h. Viral particles were collected from the 1.22/1.45 interphase by needle puncture and dialyzed at 4 &#x000b0;C against fresh Dulbecco&#x02019;s PBS for 1, 3, and &#x0003e;12 h using a 7K Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) before 15% glycerol was added prior to freezing and storage at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. The next isolate, NOR-2018NL, was obtained as cesium chloride-purified particles from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences with demonstrated virulent potential in experimental challenge trials [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The third isolate, NB-2018-128, was obtained from a commercially farmed Atlantic salmon in New Brunswick, passed through Atlantic salmon (n = 6) by intraperitoneal injection of a 0.1 mL homogenized blood cell pellet, and harvested from whole blood via needle puncture of the caudal vein 6 weeks later. Although cesium chloride purification methods were attempted for NB-2018-128, the low viral load (as measured by qPCR) resulted in insufficient recovery of purified particles to conduct subsequent challenge trials. Therefore, sonicated and low-speed centrifuge-clarified blood homogenate diluted in PBS was used directly as the inoculate for challenge trials for this isolate, as previously described [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For each PRV-1 isolate, a 10 &#x000b5;L sample immediately prior to challenge was used to quantify genomic material by qPCR (see <xref rid="sec2dot4-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="sec">Section 2.4</xref>). All viral isolates were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C prior to use.</p><p>Challenge inoculates were prepared the day of challenge from either cesium chloride-purified (BC-16-005ND&#x02014;Challenge 1 and 2; NOR-2018NL&#x02014;Challenge 2) or clarified blood homogenate (NB-2018-128, Challenge 2) frozen stocks by diluting each to a final concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> PRV-1 genome copies per mL in refrigerated phosphate-buffered saline with a final concentration of 0.01% glycerol. Control inoculate was identically prepared without virus. For clarified blood homogenate inoculate (NB-2018-128), blood homogenate made up less than 10% (10 uL) of the total volume.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-17-00285"><title>2.2. Atlantic Salmon&#x02014;Sources and Husbandry</title><p>Atlantic salmon were sourced from four independent hatcheries representing four regionally distinct genetic strains that generally encompass the major stocks used in commercial production globally (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All fish were transported by 2-day courier directly to Onda, in Souris, Prince Edward Island. One strain was sourced as ~10 g parr from a commercial hatchery on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. These Atlantic salmon were of a Pacific-adapted Mowi-McConnell strain from British Columbia with at least 30 years isolation from the originating European stocks [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The second stock was sourced as ~10 g parr from a commercial hatchery in New Brunswick, Canada, of a St. John River strain that have been selectively bred for aquaculture production for more than 16 years [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The third stock of fish was obtained as ~10 g parr from Mactaquac Biodiversity Facility, New Brunswick, Canada, where hatchery-spawned wild-caught salmon from the Tobique River [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] were manually crossed to produce the F1 generation used in this study. The fourth stock of fish was obtained as eggs from a commercial aquaculture facility in Scotland, UK, rearing the domesticated Mowi Atlantic salmon strain heavily used in Norway and Scotland for commercial production. All stocks were of a mixed-sex, mixed-family composition.</p><p>Once at Onda, fish were maintained in UV-treated flow-through fresh well water (7&#x02013;12 &#x000b0;C) for 3&#x02013;6 months. Upon reaching approximately 40&#x02013;50 g mean body weight, each stock was progressively acclimated over a 20-day period to UV-irradiated brackish well water (10&#x02013;12 &#x000b0;C, 25 ppt NaCl). A 12 h light&#x02013;12 h dark photoperiod was used except during saltwater acclimation, when a 24 h light cycle was temporarily employed. Fish were fed dry pellets (EWOS) at 2&#x02013;5% body weight per day prior to the challenge. During both challenge trials, fish were maintained in UV-irradiated brackish well water (11 &#x000b1; 1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 25 ppt) and fed a ration of EWOS pellets at 1% body weight per day in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-viruses-17-00285"><title>2.3.

An intraperitoneal injection of 100 &#x003bc;L was administered individually to 50 fish per tank at a targeted dose of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> BC-PRV reverse-transcribed L1 genomic copies per 100 &#x003bc;L inoculate to duplicate tanks of either BC or NB-SJR salmon. Inoculate without virus was identically prepared and administered to duplicated tanks for each salmon strain to act as vehicle saline control (SC). All fish were anesthetized in 75 mg per L tricaine mesylate (MS-222) prior to intraperitoneal injection. Following injection, 6 fish per treatment from one replicate tank were immediately sampled following an overdose of MS-222 (200 mg per L). Subsequently, every two weeks post-challenge (wpc) 6 fish per treatment were sampled for a period totaling 14 weeks. Whole blood (100 &#x003bc;L) was collected via caudal vein puncture and immediately frozen at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for PRV screening and host gene expression analysis by qPCR. Hearts were bisected longitudinally, and one half preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology while the other half was immediately frozen at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for PRV screening and host gene expression (qPCR) analyses.</p><p>Challenge 2 utilized three PRV-1 isolates&#x02014;BC-16-005ND (BC-PRV), NOR-2018NL (NOR-PRV), and NB-2018-128 (NB-PRV)&#x02014;that were administered to three strains of Atlantic salmon: BC Mowi-McConnell (BC salmon; mean weight 59.5 g), New Brunswick Tobique River (NB-TR salmon; mean weight 44.5 g), and European Mowi (EU salmon; mean weight 70.7 g) from Scotland (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Immediately following injection, four fish per treatment were lethally sampled (two from each duplicate tank) and every 2 wpc, eight fish per treatment were lethally sampled (four from each duplicate tank) for a period totaling 14 weeks. A portion of whole blood (100 &#x003bc;L) was collected via caudal vein puncture and immediately frozen at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for PRV screening by qPCR. A second portion of whole blood (up to 900 &#x003bc;L) was collected and spun at 2000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C in a lithium&#x02013;heparin-treated vacutainer (BD) from which 100 &#x003bc;L plasma was transferred to a fresh 1.5 mL tube and frozen at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for PRV screening. Approximately 200&#x02009;mg section of red/white skeletal muscle was excised from the left lateral line at approximately the mid-body and preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). Hearts were bisected longitudinally, and one half was preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin while the other half was immediately frozen at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for qPCR analyses.

Additionally, cumulative heart endocarditis (but not epicarditis) was elevated in BC-PRV-infected BC salmon, but not in BC-PRV-infected NB-SJR salmon relative to strain-matched SC fish (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>H). These data indicate that although BC-PRV was recognized in infected hearts of both salmon genotypes, cytotoxic T cell presence and/or differentiation as well as activation of T cell-specific killing pathways were enhanced in BC salmon and not in NB-SJR salmon, and this T-cell activation in BC salmon was associated with elevated endocarditis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-17-00285"><title>3.3. Challenge 2: PRV-1 Infection Dynamics Can Be Affected More by PRV-1 Isolate than Atlantic Salmon Strain</title><p>PRV-1 infection dynamics can be generally categorized into three temporal phases: early entry and dissemination, peak systemic replication, and long-term persistence [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We confirmed this general temporal pattern of systemic viral load in all challenges performed in this study, although the exact timing of each phase slightly varied based on host&#x02013;virus combinations (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>).

This revealed that the peak PRV-1 L1 RNA load in whole blood&#x02014;a presumptive measure for intracellular systemic PRV-1 replication&#x02014;was similar in fish administered with either BC- or NB-PRV genotypes (mean peak blood loads of 6.7 &#x000b1; 0.6 SE and 5.3 &#x000b1; 0.5 SE &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> copies/mL, respectively; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.59), but was 4&#x02013;5 times lower for fish administered NOR-PRV (1.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 SE &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> copies/mL; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) when assessed cumulatively across the three salmon strains (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A).

The maintenance of higher BC-PRV plasma loads (at least relative to NOR PRV) was putatively suggested in the persistent phase of infection as well (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03); however, non-detections and relatively low quantities of RNA were observed for all three PRV-1 isolates, suggesting that these putative variations may be of limited biological relevance (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C).</p><p>In considering Atlantic salmon strain rather than PRV-1 isolate in these challenges, similar PRV-1 loads were recorded between the three salmon strains in the whole blood, heart, and plasma samples, at peak and persistent phases of infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Cumulatively, these data suggest that PRV-1 isolate had somewhat unique infection dynamics in this study, whereby BC-PRV and to a more limited extent NB-PRV showed a higher capacity for viral replication, dissemination, and persistence than NOR-PRV. Conversely, these data demonstrated that variations in host Atlantic salmon strain had limited to no impact on PRV-1&#x02019;s capacity for replication, dissemination, and persistence.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-17-00285"><title>3.4. Challenge 2: Atlantic Salmon T Cell Responsiveness Can Be Affected by Both PRV-1 Isolate and Atlantic Salmon Strain</title><p>A previous study has indicated that activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells is associated with heart inflammation during PRV-1 infections (reviewed by [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]).

We identified that during PRV-1 infection, <italic toggle="yes">cd8a</italic> transcription was highly correlated (r = 0.86; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) with <italic toggle="yes">ifng</italic> cytokine transcription (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A), indirectly indicating that CD8+ T cells were likely becoming locally attracted/activated and generating gamma interferon in response to PRV-1 recognition. Expression of <italic toggle="yes">cd8a</italic> appeared to further be correlated, although to a lesser degree, with general cellular antiviral responsiveness within heart tissues, as measured by <italic toggle="yes">ifna</italic> transcription (r = 0.41; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).</p><p>In considering CD8+ T cell involvement in PRV-1-associated heart inflammation, <italic toggle="yes">cd8a</italic> transcription&#x02014;and by implication CD8+ T cell involvement&#x02014;was highly associated with heart inflammation in this study.

Cumulatively, these data support previous findings that recognition of PRV-1-infected cells by CD8+ T cells is likely the main driver of PRV-1-associated heart inflammation in Atlantic salmon and that HSMI is associated with an adaptive immune response. We further identify that PRV-1 activation of CD8+ T cells likely initiates interferon gamma signaling cascades, and is affected to some degree by both PRV-1 and host genotype, whereby BC-PRV was associated with lower CD8+ T cell responses relative to NB- or NOR-PRV, while EU salmon showed higher CD8+ T cell sensitivity than either BC or NB-TR Atlantic salmon during the peak to early persistent phases of infection (6&#x02013;10 wpc).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-17-00285"><title>3.5. Challenge 2: PRV-1-Associated Heart Inflammation Can Be Affected More by Atlantic Salmon Strain than PRV-1 Isolate, Whereas Skeletal Muscle Inflammation Is Influenced Similarly by Both Salmon Strain and PRV-1 Isolate</title><p>Regarding heart inflammation, the three PRV-1 isolates had similar cumulative impacts on heart inflammation across the three strains of Atlantic salmon used in this study, with approximately 40&#x02013;50% of sampled fish showing some degree of heart inflammation within the 14-week study for all three PRV-1 isolates administered relative to approximately 3% in SC fish (<xref rid="viruses-17-00285-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A).

Discussion</title><p>In two laboratory challenge trials with strict environmental control, we identified that both Atlantic salmon host genetics and PRV-1 genotype influenced disease severity; however, our hypothesis for viral genotype being the main driver of heart inflammation was proved incorrect in this instance&#x02014;variations in host Atlantic salmon genotype had a stronger influence on the occurrence and severity of heart inflammation than the PRV-1 genotype in these experimental investigations. Similar observations of a strong host phenotypic influence on disease outcomes have also been observed in other reovirus infections of teleost fish (e.g., during Grass Carp reovirus infections) [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>The distinct phylogenetic ordinations for the three PRV-1 isolates used in this study with high bootstrap support are corroborated by previous Bayesian analyses conducted using virtually the same data set [<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] as well as more broadly in PRV-1 phylogenetic investigations [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These data cumulatively lend strong support for a clear phylogenetic distinction between all Northern Pacific PRV-1a isolates sequenced to date including the BC-PRV isolate from PRV-1a isolates obtained or originating from the Atlantic Ocean or coastal Chile, including NB-PRV [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These data further support the well-established distinctions between PRV-1a and PRV-1b genotypes, as determined by S1 and whole genome sequencing [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], for which NOR-PRV is clearly classified as PRV-1b and BC-PRV and NB-PRV is clearly classified as PRV-1a.</p><p>Given the robust support for separate phylogenetic classifications of the three PRV-1 isolates in this study, it can be presumed that these genetic differences would be mirrored at least to some degree by phenotypic variations as well. We confirm this to be the case&#x02014;both PRV-1 infection dynamics as well as virulence were at least partially dependent on the genotype of the PRV-1 isolate. Specific to Challenge 2 trials, BC-PRV had the highest capacity for replication, dissemination, and persistence across the three Atlantic salmon strains, while NOR-PRV had the lowest capacity. In a previous study comparing BC-PRV and NOR-PRV infection dynamics within a single strain of European Atlantic salmon [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it was similarly observed that BC-PRV (i.e., CAN 16-005ND) reached higher systemic blood loads than NOR-PRV (i.e., NOR-2018NL). However, in that study, PRV-1 RNA reached equal if not slightly higher quantities in both the plasma and heart of NOR-PRV-infected fish relative to BC-PRV fish which was the opposite to what was observed in our current study. This suggests there are likely additional factors that influence PRV-1 infection dynamics beyond PRV-1 genetics, which requires further exploration.</p><p>In our present study, NOR-PRV demonstrated higher virulence for inducing heart and/or skeletal muscle inflammation relative to BC-PRV, which was consistent with previous challenges comparing these two genotypes [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In both previous challenges as well as the challenges conducted here, heart inflammation persisted longer, and median (or mean) heart inflammation scores reached the highest levels in NOR-PRV-infected salmon, although the present study identified this to be confounded to some degree by host genetic factors. Nevertheless, the fact that BC-PRV was able to reach 4&#x02013;5x higher systemic loads relative to NOR-PRV and still be associated with less cytotoxic T cell responsiveness and heart inflammation in our study strongly supports the supposition that BC-PRV is less virulent than NOR-PRV, and that NB-PRV preliminarily appears to be somewhere in between. We also identified, for the first time, a differential association for generating skeletal muscle inflammation between PRV-1 isolates where both NOR-PRV and NB-PRV were associated with increased red skeletal muscle inflammation (20&#x02013;25% prevalence), whereas BC-PRV did not notably induce skeletal muscle inflammation beyond control levels (e.g., &#x0003c;8% prevalence). This observation appears to be at least partially supported by field observations in British Columbia vs. Norway, where in BC, skeletal muscle inflammation has been rarely associated with PRV infection [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] whereas in Norway skeletal muscle inflammation has been considerably more common (i.e., common enough to be included in the disease name) [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This may be an important factor to consider in assigning PRV-1 disease pathology in different regions with distinct PRV-1 genotype occurrences.</p><p>Cytotoxic T cells have been shown to be highly associated with PRV-1b heart inflammation during HSMI [<xref rid="B43-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which has also been observed in PRV-1a with milder heart inflammation [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], implying that disease and inflammation associated with PRV-1 infections are generally a result of cytotoxic T cell signaling and directed killing rather than viral egress or pattern recognition receptor activation by infected cells [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We confirm that cytotoxic T cells appear to be highly associated with both PRV-1a and -1b heart inflammation in this study, as evidenced by increased <italic toggle="yes">cd8a</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">gzma</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ifng</italic> transcriptional signaling, and that this recognition is generally independent from systemic intracellular recognition of the virus by infected cells, as evidenced by a mild systemic and heart-specific <italic toggle="yes">infa</italic> transcriptional response. Thus, the main virulence factors for PRV-1 in Atlantic salmon appear to be how robustly host cytotoxic T cells recognize and respond to the virus in local tissues and not the degree to which tissue or blood cells intracellularly recognize infection. Further, variations in host salmon genotype appeared to be a primary driver of adaptive cytotoxic T cell recognition, where EU salmon mounted a more robust adaptive response to PRV-1 exposure than either BC or NB-TR salmon, indicating that something in the adaptive response of EU fish resulted in better virus recognition, or that viral dissemination into heart tissues and cells was more prevalent in this salmon strain.</p><p>Although we saw evidence in this study that PRV-1 genotype can influence cytotoxic T cell recognition and response, variations in viral genetics were clearly outweighed in this instance by genotypic variation in host Atlantic salmon strain. EU Atlantic salmon clearly generated more heart inflammation in response to PRV-1 than either BC or NB salmon, and NB salmon showed the lowest inflammatory responsiveness to PRV-1. These findings appeared to be at least partially consistent across both Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 experiments&#x02014;BC salmon showed more heart inflammation relative to either of the closely related New Brunswick Atlantic salmon stocks used in this study (NB-SJR in Challenge 1 and NB-TR in Challenge 2). This finding is also consistent with multiple previous challenge trials using BC salmon and BC-PRV that generated less heart inflammation compared to similarly conducted trials that used NOR-PRV in domesticated EU salmon [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Assuming that this large host effect on determining PRV-1-associated heart inflammation and HSMI can be confirmed through further investigations, host genetics will be important to consider in designing future studies exploring PRV-1 virulence. Specifically, genetic assessments have the potential to identify markers in salmon for establishing resistance to HSMI, thereby reducing production-associated losses in areas where HSMI is problematic. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comparing genetic differences between salmon phenotypes for PRV-1 resistance may also be useful in evaluating risks associated with PRV-1 exposure. GWAS studies have shown promise for clarifying the host genetic role and defining risk factors for rheumatic heart disease occurrence in humans [<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] with similar epidemiological patterns, which may prove advantageous in Atlantic salmon where GWAS are already relatively common within cultured populations and PRV-1 prevalence is high. Epigenetic factors, particularly relating to past exposure to pathogens, may also prove interesting avenues for investigation for explaining differential responses to PRV-1 by different salmon strains [<xref rid="B45-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Interestingly, the body of disease prevention work relating to PRV-1&#x02014;including this present study&#x02014;indicates that GWAS and other strategies have promise in reducing HSMI-like disease but will likely have little effect on systemic PRV-1 infection dynamics (reviewed by [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]).</p><p>Environmental factors are also implicitly important for disease to occur [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although the environment was tightly controlled in this study to allow us to focus on host and virus factors, we nevertheless observed that heart inflammation generated by BC-PRV in BC salmon in the two challenge trials of this study conducted at the Onda Prince Edward Island facility appeared anecdotally more severe when compared to previous challenge trials using the same or similar BC-PRV and BC salmon conducted at a Fisheries and Oceans Canada facility on Vancouver Island [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00285" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This would indicate that there are indeed potential differences in environment, even under controlled laboratory conditions, that can impact PRV-1 virulence and which warrant further exploration. Investigations to untangle how environmental impacts might or might not be synergistically tied to host or viral factors may also help to clarify the generally discrete field observations for minimal PRV-1-associated disease in Pacific and Atlantic Canada relative to coastal Norway.</p><p>In conclusion, this study identifies that host genetics can exert a majority influence on PRV-1 virulence and associated heart inflammation in controlled laboratory environments, demonstrating that the presence of either PRV-1a or PRV-1b alone is not sufficient to reliably predict disease. This finding also highlights host genotyping and putative genetic selection of Atlantic salmon may prove effective avenues for reducing HSMI disease severity in areas where it is problematic. This study also confirms variation in virulence potential and viral replication between PRV-1 genotypes, particularly regarding replication and an association with generating skeletal muscle inflammation, which may be important to consider in assessing PRV-associated disease or disease risk across geographic landscapes. Lastly, this study reiterates the importance of a host-generated cytotoxic T cell response as a major source of PRV-1-associated disease when it is observed, and, therefore, further research aimed at minimizing and better understanding this response will likely prove useful in mitigating disease in the areas or populations which appear to be at higher risk.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank &#x000d8;ystein Wessel and Espen Rimstad from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences for donating the purified NOR-PRV used in this study, and Mowi Global, Mowi Canada West, and the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Mactaquac Biodiversity Facility for donating eggs and/or fish.
