Studies to date on the issue of Meth-associated depression and anxiety are focused on the brain, however, whether peripheral homeostasis, especially the &#x0201c;microbiota-gut&#x0201d; axis participates in these adverse outcomes, remains poorly understood. In the current study, with the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) assay, the mice received microbiota from Meth withdrawal mice displayed marked depression and anxiety behaviors. The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that Meth withdrawal contributed to a striking reduction of <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Faecalibaculum, Desulfovibrio, and Anaerostipes</italic>, which are known to be associated with tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. Noteworthily, the substantial decreases of the indole derivatives from the TRP metabolic pathway, including IAA, IPA, ILA, IET, IArA, IAld, and TRM were observed in the serum of both Meth abusing humans and mice during Meth withdrawal with the UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. Combining the high and low TRP diet mouse model, the mice with high TRP diet obviously impeded Meth-associated depression and anxiety behaviors, and these results were further strengthened by the evidence that administration of IPA, IAA, and indole dramatically ameliorated the Meth induced aberrant behaviors. Importantly, these protective effects were remarkably counteracted in aryl hydrocarbon receptor knockout (AhR KO) mice, underlining the key roles of microbiota-indoles-AhR signaling in Meth-associated depression and anxiety. Collectively, the important contribution of the present work is that we provide the first evidence that peripheral gut homeostasis disturbance but not limited to the brain, plays a key role in driving the Meth-induced depression and anxiety in the periods of withdrawal, especially the microbiota and the indole metabolic disturbance. Therefore, targeting AhR may provide novel insight into the therapeutic strategies for Meth-associated psychological disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Depression and anxiety</kwd><kwd>methamphetamine</kwd><kwd>indole derivatives</kwd><kwd>aryl hydrocarbon receptor</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

As a typical representative of amphetamine-type drugs, Meth (commonly known as &#x0201c;ice&#x0201d;) is highly addictive and neurotoxic, with an average elimination half-life approximately to 10&#x02009;hours in individuals. Compared to the traditional drugs, Meth abuse is more prone to causing severe psychological disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, and the depressive symptoms often emerge during Meth withdrawal period.<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A cross-sectional study reported a depression prevalence rate of 39.5% among 1,277 participants,<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> while another cohort study indicated that 157 out of 243 participants (64.6%) exhibited depressive symptoms during Meth withdrawal, with 74 (30.5%) experiencing moderate and 83 (34.1%) experiencing severe depression.<sup><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Meth abuse inflicts severe physical and psychological harm, such as self-harm and suicidal behaviors, posing significant challenges to public health. Therefore, alleviating Meth withdrawal-related depressive symptoms and deciphering the underlying mechanisms is imperative.</p><p>For Meth-induced depression and anxiety, more attention is paid to the central nervous system (CNS), while few studies have tried to unravel the cellular basis of Meth-induced psychological disorders from peripheral systems. As a &#x0201c;second brain,&#x0201d; the gut and its interactions with microbiota are implicated in CNS activities, including mood, stress response, and cognitive function through neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways,<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref></sup> therefore, targeting gut microbiota for the treatment of psychological disorders might be a promising therapeutic approach. The gut-brain axis is a complex bidirectional communication network that links the gut microbiota to the CNS. Tryptophan (TRP), one of the nine essential amino acids, plays a crucial role in coordinating gastrointestinal function and CNS activities. TRP is primarily metabolized through three pathways: the kynurenine pathway, the serotonin pathway, and the microbial metabolic pathway (Indole metabolic pathway).<sup><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> For the microbial metabolic pathway, the gut microbiota metabolizes TRP into several indole derivatives, such as indole-3-aldehyde (IAld), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), indole-3-pyruvate (IPYA), etc.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In recent years, accumulating reports pointed to the influence of the TRP metabolic pathway far beyond the traditional focus on the study of the serotonin and the kynurenine pathways, the TRP microbial metabolic pathway has gained more and more attention since the metabolites indole and its derivatives are recognized as the essential signaling molecules within the microbiota-gut-brain axis, capable of influencing brain function and behaviors.<sup><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In depression patients, the levels of indole and its derivatives have been shown to correlate closely with the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.<sup><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> For instance, <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025</italic> effectively alleviates depression and related gastrointestinal disorders in patients, concomitant with the increased levels of IPA,<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> which has been demonstrated to inhibit CNS inflammation.<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, whether the microbiota and (or) the corresponding metabolites participated in driving the Meth-induced depression and anxiety, to date, remain largely unknown.</p><p>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcriptional factor expressed in immune cells, microglia, intestinal epithelial cells, etc., can be activated by specific small molecules from diet, microbial metabolites, and environmental pollutants.<sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Upon binding with its ligands, AhR translocates to the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with ARNT to regulate CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 expression,<sup><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> a negative feedback loop that is crucial for indole and its derivatives degradation. A study reported that by colonizing <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> modified for indole metabolism and TRP metabolism-deficient <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, indole, a TRP metabolite of intestinal flora, and its derivatives can activate neurogenesis through the AhR pathway.<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Additionally, intermittent fasting may promote axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in mice by enhancing IPA production by gut Gram-positive bacteria.<sup><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Indole has been found to harbor the neuroprotective properties both in vitro and in vivo,<sup><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> since supplementation with indole and its metabolites such as IS, IPA and IAld significantly reduces CNS inflammation in germ-free mice.<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Nonetheless, whether the indole metabolic pathway is involved in Meth-induced depression and anxiety remains ambiguous. Thus, deciphering the roles of indole derivatives and AhR signaling in Meth-induced neurobehavioral changes is of significant importance.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, the Meth withdrawal mouse model was established to evaluate the effects of Meth on gut microbiota composition, TRP metabolic pathways, and the interaction with AhR. Additionally, a Meth mouse model supplemented with indole derivatives and AhR agonist, in combination with AhR KO mice were used, aiming to elucidate the critical roles of the AhR, which may serve as a bridge between the gut microbiota and the CNS, particularly in the regulation of microglial morphology and neurogenesis. Moreover, the levels of the indole metabolites in the serum of the Meth withdrawal individuals were also evaluated, which may provide solid support for the disturbance of the indole metabolic pathway in Meth-induced depression and anxiety.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0002"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002-s2001"><label>2.1.</label><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Methamphetamine (purity over 99%) was provided by the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (Beijing, China).

To this end, the microbiota changes and the psychological behaviors induced by Meth were examined. With the daily intraperitoneal injection of Meth (5&#x02009;mg/kg) for 10&#x02009;days and the following 14-day withdrawal, the mouse fecal samples were collected on day 10 and day 24, then by behavioral testing (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a)</xref>). During the Meth exposure and withdrawal periods, mice exhibited a significant decrease in body weight compared to the control group (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(b)</xref>). In parallel, the withdrawal mice displayed significant depression behaviors, with increased immobility states in both of the TST and FST. Additionally, the mice spent less time in the center arena in OFT and open arms in the EPM test, characterized as anxiety behaviors (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(c&#x02013;f)</xref>). To gain a more comprehensive knowledge of the behavioral changes induced by Meth, the composition of the gut microbiota was analyzed. The alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Ace, Chao, and Shannon indices at the OTU level. It showed that the Ace and Chao indices of the WD 0d and WD 14d groups were significantly higher than those of the control group, and the Shannon index of the WD 14d group was higher than that of the control groups albeit the WD 0d group exhibited no obvious changes (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(g)</xref>). According to principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), the beta diversity of the gut microbiota differed among the control, WD 0d, and WD 14d groups (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(h)</xref>). For microbiota abundance, the relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Firmicutes</italic> significantly increased whereas the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Verrucomicrobia</italic> dramatically decreased in the WD 0d and WD 14d groups (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(i)</xref>).

Furthermore, the Random Forest analysis ranked the importance of the microbiota on WD 14d and the control group at the genus level. Tax4Fun was employed to evaluate the functional changes in the gut microbiota. The analysis revealed that the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, as well as the tryptophan metabolism (highlighted in red), exhibited significant differences between the WD14d and control groups, with a notable reduction in activity observed in the WD14d group. Additionally, pathways such as ABC transporters, other glycan degradation, and degradation of aromatic compounds also demonstrated significant variations between the two groups (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(k)</xref>).

To verify whether the aberrant indole metabolism was also displayed in humans, the levels of indole metabolites in the serum of human healthy controls (HC) and Meth abusers were examined (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(d)</xref>). Consistently, the levels of indole derivatives, including IAA, IPA, ILA, IArA, IAld, TRM and IET were strikingly decreased in Meth abusers (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(e)</xref>).

Herein, the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was performed. <xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(a)</xref> presents the experimental timeline, dividing the mice into two groups: Donor and Recipient mice. The donor mice were treated with either Meth or saline, followed by behavioral testing and fecal sample collection on the last day of withdrawal (WD14d). For recipient mice, the gut microbiota was depleted with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX), then received FMT from the donor mice. To address the potential concern regarding residual Meth or its metabolites in donor fecal material, we performed UHPLC-MS/MS analysis to detect Meth levels in fecal samples at different time points post-injection. Meth was detectable in the feces 2&#x02009;hours after injection. However, no residual Meth was detected in feces collected at 1 day, 3&#x02009;days, or 14&#x02009;days post-injection. These results confirm that the effects observed in FMT-WD 14d mice were not attributable to residual Meth in donor fecal material but rather to changes in the gut microbiota composition (Figure S3). To further explore the mechanisms underlying Meth-induced gut dysbiosis, we conducted supplementary experiments focusing on intestinal barrier integrity and mucus production. Our results revealed that Meth withdrawal (WD 14d) significantly increased serum LPS levels, indicating compromised gut barrier function (Figure S4(a)). Tight junction-related genes (<italic toggle="yes">ZO1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Occludin</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Claudin5</italic>) were significantly downregulated in WD 14d mice, consistent with barrier dysfunction (Figure S4(b)). Additionally, goblet cell numbers were markedly reduced (Figure S4(c)), accompanied by a significant decrease in MUC2 expression and mucus layer thickness, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and Alcian blue staining (Figures S4(d) and S4(e)). These disruptions in the mucus layer are particularly relevant to the observed reduction in <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic> abundance, as this bacterium depends on mucin as its primary nutrient source. The reduction in mucus production and goblet cell numbers likely deprives <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic> of its ecological niche, leading to its decline during Meth withdrawal. This loss of <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic>, in turn, may exacerbate gut barrier dysfunction and further contribute to gut dysbiosis. Behavioral assessments indicated that the WD 14d donor mice and the recipient mice (FMT-WD 14d) exhibited significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, characterized by reduced time spent in the open arms of the EPM and the center of the OFT, decreased total distance traveled in the OFT, and increased immobility in the FST and TST (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(b&#x02013;d)</xref>). Furthermore, the indole derivatives in the serum and feces of recipient mice significantly reduced (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(e,f)</xref>), indicating that Meth-induced behavioral changes might be partially ascribed to the microbiota dysbiosis. Since the impairments of the intestinal integrity were linked to the psychiatric disorders, the histological analysis of the intestinal structure in both donor and recipient mice was conducted. It showed that the pathological scores were significantly increased and the villus length was notably reduced in the WD 14d and FMT-WD 14d mice (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(g&#x02013;i)</xref>), further supporting the critical role of gut microbiota and the corresponding metabolites in Meth-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors.

The high TRP diet (1.9% TRP) was pretreated and maintained until Meth withdrawal for 14&#x02009;days, and the low TRP diet (0.09% TRP) was applied here for positive control aiming to decipher the roles of the reduced indole metabolites in affecting behaviors. It showed that mice in the low TRP diet group and the WD 14d group exhibited significant anxiety-like changes, manifesting as the reduction of open-arm residence time in the EPM, and a decreased residence time in the center area accompanied by a decreased total trajectory length in the OFT test. Meanwhile, the low TRP diet stimulated pronounced depression like changes due to the increased immobility time in the FST and TST. Agree with our assumption, the high TRP diet substantially ameliorated the Meth induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(b)</xref>), in parallel, it retarded the Meth-induced decreased levels of IAA, IPA, ILA, IArA, IET, IAM, IPYA, IAld and TRM. Particularly the levels of IPA, IAM, IPYA, and TRM (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(c)</xref>), suggesting a salutary role of TRP metabolites in alleviating Meth-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors. To further substantiate the causal link between the reduction in indole derivatives and AhR pathway activity, we performed qPCR analysis of AhR-related genes.

Importantly, supplementation with the high TRP diet reversed this suppression, restoring gene expression levels to those comparable to the control group (Figure S2). These findings confirm that the reduction in indole derivatives observed in vivo contributes to AhR pathway dysregulation and suggest that dietary TRP supplementation mitigates these effects by restoring indole derivative levels and AhR signaling activity.

Therefore, the psychiatric disorders induced by Meth may not only limit to its direct impact on the brain, and the microbiota-gut axis may presumably be the major target. Studies have shown that Meth exposure alters the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; diversity of gut microbiota in mice, increasing the relative abundance of pathogenic microbiota and reciprocally decreasing the beneficial ones.<sup><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Additionally, microbiota abundance changes in Meth-exposed mice were significantly correlated with depression-like behaviors and neurotoxicity.<sup><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In recent years, the roles of gut microbiota and the corresponding metabolites in regulating host behaviors and brain function have garnered considerable attention, particularly the TRP microbial metabolites, which are considered crucial to the regulation of the gut-brain axis. Thus, the current study aims to address the alterations of gut microbiota and the corresponding metabolites, especially the potential roles of indole derivatives in Meth-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. In line with our assumption, Meth withdrawal significantly altered the microbiota composition in mice, and transplantation of the gut microbiota from Meth-exposed mice to recipient mice induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, providing evidence for the involvement of microbiota in the pathology. Intriguingly, Meth withdrawal resulted in a marked reduction in the levels of the indole metabolite-producing microbiota, thereby inhibiting the TRP microbial metabolic pathway and decreasing the indole derivative levels in serum and feces. Reciprocally, a high-TRP diet, which facilitates the restoration of indole derivative levels, significantly ameliorated the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in Meth withdrawal mice. Importantly, we corroborated these findings in a population of Meth abusers, whose levels of indole derivatives were obviously reduced, suggesting the involvement of the gut microbiota and its indole metabolites in the Meth withdrawal period in humans.</p><p>TRP, an essential amino acid and the only amino acid containing the indole structure, is primarily obtained from diet.

These changes were particularly pronounced in the microglia and were closely linked to depression-like behaviors.<sup><xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Similarly, during the Meth exposure period, microglial cells displayed a persistent activated state, characterized by enlarged cell bodies and shortened, thickened dendrites, then the microglia transitioned into a dystrophic morphology, marked by reduced cell size, decreased branches, and even fragmentation, deciphering a shifting from an initial &#x0201c;surveillance state&#x0201d; to a &#x0201c;dystrophic&#x0201d; state. Consistent with our findings, a study on Meth-exposed rats exhibited significant morphological changes in microglia within the nucleus accumbens core 31&#x02009;days after Meth withdrawal, characterized by a reduction in microglial cell numbers and decreased branch lengths,<sup><xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> similarly, the microglia injury is confirmed by another study that decreased survival microglia in the hippocampus induced by Meth.<sup><xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p>After Meth exposure, the reduction of indole metabolites profoundly impacts the gut-microbiota-brain axis, a complex bidirectional communication system that relies on the AhR to transmit TRP metabolic signaling to the brain via immune response, peripheral metabolic circulation, and the vagus nerve.

Compared to other studies, our research for the first time, revealed the microbiota in Meth treated mice but not limited to the neural injury can ignite depression and anxiety-like changes.

To further explore the specific role of AhR in the neuroprotective effects of indole derivatives, the AhR KO mice were exploited. Intriguingly, the protective effects of indole derivatives against Meth induced microglial dystrophy and neurogenesis defects were ablated in AhR KO mice, underpinning the specific salutary roles of indole derivatives in the regulation of microglial activity and neurogenesis via AhR, placing a unique role of AhR in Meth induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.</p><p>In conclusion, this study, for the first time, deciphered the peripheral mechanisms by unrecognized Meth-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors via the disturbance of microbiota and the corresponding metabolites, particularly the indole derivatives. In this process, Meth withdrawal induced decrease of indole metabolite-producing microbiota, contributing to the striking reduction of indole metabolites, which in turn, decreased AhR expression and impacted microglial morphology and neurogenesis, and finalized the anxiety and depression-like changes in mice (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). Therefore, the present study provide novel biological insights into the anxiety and depression symptoms associated with Meth withdrawal and offer potential targets and strategies for Meth abuse. Restoring the balance of the gut microbiota, particularly by promoting the synthesis of TRP metabolites such as indole derivatives, may serve as an effective intervention to alleviate Meth withdrawal symptoms. For example, the use of probiotics, dietary adjustments (e.g., high-TRP diets), or microbiota-targeting strategies to restore gut function may help reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in Meth-addicted individuals. Therefore, future drug interventions may be developed based on the regulation of the TRP microbiota metabolism and AhR receptors, like AhR agonists, which may provide innovative strategies for Meth associated neurotoxicity.

Firstly, due to certain constraints, we were unable to conduct systematic anxiety and depression assessments in Meth-abusing individuals, nor were we able to obtain fecal samples from this population for further analysis of indole metabolism. Secondly, although our study demonstrates that indole derivatives confer neuroprotective effects through AhR activation, the precise mechanisms of interaction among these molecules remain unclear. AhR signaling is highly complex and context-dependent, with its effects varying across tissues and cell types. Further research is needed to elucidate the cell-specific and tissue-specific roles of AhR activation in the gut-brain axis. Thirdly, our experiments primarily relied on a mouse model to investigate Meth withdrawal and its effects on the gut microbiota and behaviors, however, they cannot totally represent the toxic effects of Meth abuse and the characteristics of mental disorders in humans. Translational studies in non-human primates or Meth-abusing human populations will be essential to confirm the clinical applicability of our findings. Fourthly, although a reduction in <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic> and its potential link to mucus layer disruption were confirmed, we did not directly demonstrate the functional contribution of this bacterial species to Meth-induced gut dysbiosis and behavioral abnormalities.

Lastly, our study focused on the role of indole derivatives and AhR activation in Meth withdrawal-related anxiety and depression. However, the development of these behaviors is multifactorial, involving other neurotransmitter systems, immune pathways, and environmental factors.
