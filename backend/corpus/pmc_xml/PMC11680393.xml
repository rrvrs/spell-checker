RSV-specific vaccines have been launched recently but there is no antiviral medicine commercially available. RSV polymerase (L) protein is one of the promising antiviral targets, along with fusion and nucleocapsid proteins. During medicinal chemistry campaigns, two potent L-protein inhibitors (PC786 and PC751) were identified. Both compounds inhibited the RSV A/B-induced cytopathic effect in HEp-2 cells equally, but PC786 was more potent than PC751 in bronchial epithelial cells. Repeated treatment with escalating concentrations on RSV A2-infected HEp-2 cells revealed both inhibitors led to a Y1631H mutation in the L protein, but only PC786 induced a mutation in the M protein (V153A). By L protein fragment and M protein binding analysis, we showed that the M protein interacts with the 1392&#x02013;1735 amino acid region of the L protein, where PC786 potentially binds. In addition, PC786 treatment or PC786-induced mutant RSV was found to increase M-protein nuclear localisation later in infection, concomitant with delayed fusion protein localisation at the budding viral filaments. As M protein is known to play a key role in virus assembly and budding late in infection, our data suggests that disrupting the interaction between the M and L proteins could provide a novel target for antiviral development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>respiratory syncytial virus</kwd><kwd>L protein</kwd><kwd>M protein</kwd><kwd>air liquid interface culture</kwd><kwd>bronchial epithelium</kwd><kwd>nuclear translocation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>University of Canberra Honours Scholarship</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Australian Postgraduate Award scholarship</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Introduction</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe respiratory illness globally, with infants under 5 years of age and the elderly (&#x0003e;65 years of age) being most impacted [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The recent development of vaccines for adults and long acting monoclonal antibody for infants (guidelines vary with country) [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], has been a major development that is forecast to have a significant positive impact in the high-income countries where they have been deployed [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Unfortunately, the main medical impact of RSV illness is felt in low- and middle-income countries, which mostly cannot afford the new RSV prevention measures [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There are no antivirals currently available to treat RSV [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in the general population and primary treatment options are limited to supportive care [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>RSV is an enveloped, non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus. The ~15 kb RNA genome codes for eight structural proteins (F fusion glycoprotein, G attachment glycoprotein, SH small hydrophobic protein, M matrix protein, M2-1 transcription processivity factor, N nucleocapsid protein, P phosphoprotein, and L large polymerase), two nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2), and the M2-2 regulatory factor. The polymerase complex is responsible for both transcription and replication, includes L and P proteins, and is guided by the N protein that binds directly to RNA.</p><p>Viral polymerase complexes are central to virus replication and are hence a major target for the development of antivirals, along with the virus surface proteins that are key to infection [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. PC751 and PC786 are two benzothienoazepine derivatives that have potent anti-RSV effect in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PC786 is a nebulised non-nucleoside RSV polymerase (L protein) inhibitor with demonstrated antiviral effects in a human challenge study and in cell culture [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. PC751 is a fluorinated derivative effective at suppressing RSV replication when administered intranasally in a rodent model of RSV infection [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanism that underlies its antiviral effects and to confirm that it indeed targets the L protein, we undertook an escape mutant analysis using sequential passaging of the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of PC786. As expected, we found that PC786 induced a mutation in the L gene. Interestingly, PC786 also induced a mutation in the M gene, suggesting an interaction between L and M proteins. This was unexpected as an interaction between the polymerase and matrix proteins of negative-strand viruses had not been described in the literature.</p><p>In the current study, we use in vitro, infection, transfection systems and mini-genome analysis to show an interaction between RSV L and M proteins that does not impact L protein polymerase functions but does impact M protein localisation and may impact RSV assembly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01881"><title>2.

In a washout arm, compounds and DMSO as vehicle were added to the appropriate wells (1 &#x000b5;L/well) to give a final concentration of 0.5% DMSO across the plates. The plates were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 h, the media was removed and replaced with 100 &#x000b5;L of fresh LHC-8 media and subsequently incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for approximately 24 h.

For non-washout plates, the compounds and DMSO (1 &#x000b5;L/well) were applied immediately after infection. On day 3 post-infection, supernatant was aspirated and the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (100 &#x000b5;L in PBS solution) for 20 min at room temperature (RT), washed three times with washing buffer (WB) (200 &#x000b5;L: PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20), and incubated with blocking buffer (100 &#x000b5;L: 5% BSA in wash buffer) for 1 h.

After washing, cells were incubated with an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (50 &#x000b5;L/well: 1:2000, Abcam) for 1 h. Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (50 &#x000b5;L) was then added after washing twice with WB and once with PBS, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of aqueous sulphuric acid (2N; 50 &#x000b5;L/well). The resultant signal was determined colorimetrically (OD at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm) in a microplate reader (Multiskan FC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, ThermoFisher Scientific, Abingdon, UK). Cells were then washed, and 0.5% crystal violet solution (50 &#x000b5;L/mL) was applied for 30 min. After washing with PBS (200 &#x000b5;L) twice, 1% SDS (100 &#x000b5;L) was added to each well, and the plates were shaken lightly for 1 h prior to reading the absorbance at 595 nm as an indicator of cell number in each well.

PC786 Directly Impacts M Protein Localisation</title><p>We expressed a GFP-tagged wild-type M protein (GFP-M) in transfected cells followed by treatment with PC751, PC786, or vehicle (DMSO) for 12 h. Localisation of GFP-M was assessed by live cell CLSM, followed by quantitative image analysis of digital confocal images. The relative localisation of M in the nucleus and the cytoplasm is denoted by Fn/c, which represents the fluorescence in the nucleus relative to the fluorescence in the cytoplasm, corrected for background fluorescence [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the absence of any treatment (NT), or when treated with the vehicle (DMSO), GFP-M was clearly cytoplasmic (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Fn/c~0.40). Treatment with PC786 resulted in a significant change in the localisation of GFP-M, becoming almost equally distributed in nucleus and cytoplasm (Fn/c~0.80). In contrast, there was no effect of similar treatment with PC751. These data correlate perfectly with the forced mutation analysis, wherein PC751 treatment results in a mutation in L protein only, while PC786 treatment results in mutation in the L as well as M protein.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-viruses-16-01881"><title>3.6. PC786-Induced Mutations Affect RSV Assembly and Budding</title><p>Infectious viruses with mutations in either L alone (Y1631H; A2-751) or in both L and M (Y1631H, V153A; A2-786) were compared with wild-type RSV (A2) for the subcellular localisation of F and M proteins through the lifecycle. F and M proteins are major structural proteins and drive the infection (F), assembly (M), and budding (F, M) of RSV.</p><p>In cells infected with A2, F protein was present at the cell surface at 18 h post-infection (p.i.), with clear association with filamentous RSV at 30 h p.i. (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A,C, top row), as previously described. M protein was present in characteristic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs) and in cell surface protrusions from 18 h p.i. (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, top row), becoming associated with filamentous RSV at 30 h p.i. (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D, top row). A similar trend for F and M localisation was observed in cells infected with A2-751 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> compare images in the middle row, labelled A2-751, with images in the top row, labelled A2). Of note are the clearly distinct filamentous RSV particles at 30 h p.i. in cells infected with both viruses, strongly suggesting comparable replication kinetics.</p><p>In contrast, A2-786 had a clearly delayed lifecycle, with filamentous RSV becoming visible only at 42 h p.i. (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D, images labelled A2-786, and E). At 18 h p.i., a minimal expression of F and M proteins was observed, which increased at 30 h p.i., forming some filamentous RSV at 42 h p.i. Interestingly, clear IBs could not be seen, although M localised to cytoplasmic puncta, resembling the previously identified cytoplasmic assembly granules observed late in infection [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that M protein localises to the nucleus of infected cells in order to inhibit host cell transcription [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Importantly, a recombinant RSV with a mutant M unable to inhibit host transcription is significantly attenuated [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hence, we next investigated whether the impaired nuclear transport of M in A2-786 may underlie the observed delay in replication kinetics (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F).</p><p>The subcellular localisation of M protein in cells infected by A2, A2-751, or A2-786 was assessed by quantitative image analysis of digital confocal images probed for M, such as those shown in <xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;E. In cells infected with A2, M protein was distributed equally in the nucleus and cytoplasm at 18 h p.i. (Fn/c~1.0), becoming clearly cytoplasmic (Fn/c &#x0003c; 1.0) at 30 h p.i., as expected (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F, black columns, labelled Mwt) [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In cells infected with A2-751, M protein was localised equally in nucleus and cytoplasm at 18 h p.i., exactly like that in A2-infected cells (compare black columns with light grey columns, labelled 18 h). At 30 h p.i., M became relatively more cytoplasmic (Fn/c &#x0003c; 1.0); however, this change in localisation was not significantly different from that at 18 h p.i., suggesting that the mutation in L protein is associated with impaired cytoplasmic localisation of the M protein. The M protein in A2-786-infected cells was clearly cytoplasmic (Fn/c &#x0003c; 1.0) at 18 h p.i. (dark grey column), suggesting that the mutation in M impairs its ability to localise to the nucleus. It remained cytoplasmic at 30 h p.i.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-viruses-16-01881"><title>3.7. RSV L Protein Associates with M Protein In Vitro</title><p>Given the small size of PC786 (715.83 Da) and that it impacts both L and M proteins, we hypothesised that there may be an interaction between RSV L and M proteins which brings the proteins close together, enabling PC786 to bind to both. In the first instance, we tested our hypothesis in vitro, using bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. The large size of the RSV L protein presents a challenge for recombinant expression in bacteria and was instead expressed as seven sequential fragments/peptides that had overlapping ends (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Each L peptide was present in both insoluble and soluble fractions of transformed BL21DE3 cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Full-length RSV 6xhis-M bound to the L peptide 6 (L(6)) in the insoluble fraction (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C), with some low-level binding observed with the soluble fraction. This is interesting, as the PC751- and PC786-induced mutation in L (Y1631H) is present within the sequence encoded by L(6) peptide (see schematic, <xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>To determine if the observed L6-M interaction is sustained in the cellular context, we co-expressed the selected mCherry-tagged L peptides with GFP-tagged full-length M protein, followed by live cell confocal microscopy (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Clear co-localisation of mCherry-L6 and GFP-M was observed in perinuclear puncta, with some co-localisation also observed between mCherry-L5 and GFP-M (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A upper images, note that only some of the puncta positive for GFP-M are also positive for mCherry-L5).

All mCherry-L peptides were present in the nucleus and cytoplasm, with some localisation in perinuclear, cytoplasmic punctate structures (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A, first column, labelled mCherry). GFP-M was present mostly in the cytoplasm, with significant localisation in perinuclear, cytoplasmic punctate structures (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A, middle column, labelled EGFP).</p><p>We next investigated the impact of the observed PC751 (Y1631H)- and PC786 (Y1631H, V153A)-forced mutations on the mCherry-L6 and GFP-M interaction (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). In contrast to its wild-type counterpart, mCherry-L6m localised primarily to the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic punctate structures (compare the top row of 6B with the first column of 6A). No co-localisation was observed between mCherry-L6m and GFP-M, with both proteins localised in separate cytoplasmic punctate structures (<xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B, top row, image labelled &#x02018;merge&#x02019;, note the green and red puncta and the absence of yellow-coloured puncta). In contrast to its wild-type counterpart, GFP-Mm was present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm, and in cytoplasmic punctate structures (compare middle row of <xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B with the middle column in <xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Some localisation of GFP-Mm was observed with mCherry-L6m in cytoplasmic puncta (note that some, not all, GFP-M positive puncta are also positive for mCherry-L6m, as demonstrated by the yellow colour in the image labelled &#x02018;merge&#x02019;). No clear co-localisation could be observed between mCherry-L6 and GFP-Mm (bottom row, <xref rid="viruses-16-01881-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>Co-localisation analysis using the Coloc2 plugin within Fiji (ImageJ) confirmed the observations. mCherry-L6 co-localised with GFP-M (Pearsson&#x02019;s coefficient, PC = 0.62 &#x000b1; 0.03). There was a reduced co-localisation of mCherry-L6m with GFP-M (PC = 0.42 &#x000b1; 0.5) but no change in the co-localisation of mCherry-L6m with GFP-Mm (PC = 0.63 &#x000b1; 0.05).

Discussion</title><p>During a targeted anti-RSV medicinal chemistry campaign, two potent L-protein inhibitors (PC786 and PC751) were identified [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Both compounds were equally potent in inhibiting RSV replication in HEp-2 cells and monolayer bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, as well as inhibition of polymerase activity in minigenome analysis. Both compounds were also confirmed to have persistent effects on BEAS-2B cells. However, PC786 was more potent than PC751 on ALI-cultured primary human bronchial epithelium that closely replicates the human airway wall. Virus rebound was observed during PC751, but not PC786&#x02014;treatment without induction of mutation&#x02014;suggesting that PC786 has additional anti-RSV mechanisms compared to PC751. The rebound was not due to the poor duration of action of PC751 as we proved both compounds have a long cell residency, using BEAS-2B cells. Repeated treatment with escalating concentrations of RSV A2-infected HEp-2 cells revealed both inhibitors led to a Y1631H mutation in the L protein, but only PC786 induced a mutation in the M protein (V153A). By L-protein fragment and M-protein binding analysis, we showed that the M protein interacts with the 1392&#x02013;1735 amino acid region of the L protein, where PC786 potentially binds.</p><p>In addition, the PC786 treatment of RSV-infected cells or infection with PC786-induced mutant RSV was found to increase M protein nuclear localisation, concomitant with delayed fusion protein localisation at the budding viral filaments. These data support our previous finding that the efficient cytoplasmic localisation of M protein is required for optimal RSV assembly [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The data from the current study suggest that a direct interaction between L and M proteins has at least some effect on M&#x02019;s cytoplasmic retention. As M protein is known to play a key role in virus assembly and budding late in infection [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], our data suggests that disrupting the interaction between M and L could provide a novel target for antiviral development.</p><p>The L&#x02013;M interaction identified in this study is intriguing, as previous work has shown that M associates with viral ribonucleocapsid complexes (vRNP) in IBs to inhibit transcriptase activity [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], raising the possibility that M can directly influence L&#x02019;s activity [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Electron microscopy of purified and cell-associated RSV suggests that M is present in close proximity to RNA and that its presence influences the organisation of RNP [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], providing some evidence for the possibility that M influences L&#x02019;s activity.</p><p>Although the N&#x02013;RNA, N&#x02013;P, and P&#x02013;L interactions have been resolved individually, the 3D structure of the full vRNP is not known, making it difficult to predict the location of M. Limited 3D structures of the RSV vRNP have found that the genomic RNA is present in a surface groove around the N-protein core [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The association of the L-P polymerase with this structure has been hypothesised [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] but not yet resolved structurally. Understanding the role of the L&#x02013;M interaction in RSV infection awaits further structural understanding of the M&#x02013;vRNP interactions.</p><p>High-resolution microscopy images from cells infected with a recombinant RSV with a flag-tagged L protein show that L protein is present throughout the IBs [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], presumably, along with the P protein. The location of N, M, M2-1 in IBs is not yet known; however, antibody-based investigations suggest M is present on the outside of IBs. If true, this would suggest that only a sub-population of L protein is accessible for interaction with M, which argues against a direct effect of M on L&#x02019;s activity.</p><p>Given our previous study showing that M protein interacts with microfilaments in RSV-infected cells [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and that vRNPs associate with microfilaments only in the presence of M [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01881" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], could the L&#x02013;M interaction on the periphery of the IBs facilitate the movement of the vRNPs to areas of RSV assembly?</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. First, as the 3D structure of the full L protein has not been resolved, we are unable to show the in silico docking model of PC786, especially at the binding site between L and M proteins. Second, M&#x02013;L protein binding was only demonstrated in submerged cell culture, and future studies should be conducted in primary bronchial epithelium. The immunoprecipitation of the L and M proteins can be the way to prove the association of these two proteins only if specific antibodies against L and M proteins are available. Third, if the M protein mutant virus (V153A) is produced by genome engineering, it would be a powerful tool to analyse the role of M protein further. Future work in this collaboration is aimed at unravelling some of the questions raised by this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-16-01881"><title>5.
