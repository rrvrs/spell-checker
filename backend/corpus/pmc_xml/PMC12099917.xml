Aim of the present study was to compare the reaction of N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;33 patients with Crohn&#x02019;s disease that either participated in a multimodal stress management and lifestyle modification program (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19) or not (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14) to the induction of acute stress after the day-clinic by using the validated instrument of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). A mixed-methods approach using self-reported stress perception (questionnaire, qualitative interviews), diary records, and blood samples was applied. Immune and endocrine measures of stress were collected before and repeatedly after stress exposure. Analysis of the blood samples indicated changes in leucocyte and platelet levels only in the intervention group. Differences in the reaction to acute stress might be explained by a significant reduction in perceived (chronic) stress levels in the intervention group compared to baseline (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.004), whereas there was no change in the control group (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.472). Diary records (during the day-clinic) showed a notable increase in the number of relaxation techniques (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001) and meditative movements (p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.001) performed in the intervention group compared to the control group. In the qualitative interviews (of the intervention group), patients reported a reduction in stress in their daily lives and in acute stressful situations as a result of using the newly learned specific stress management techniques. The observed improvements in stress management (questionnaire, qualitative interviews), indicated by the reduction in perceived stress, and immune function, suggested by the blood sample results, highlight the potential of integrating multimodal stress management and lifestyle changes into the treatment approach for Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term effects and the multiple mechanisms underlying these observed changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Crohn&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>TSST</kwd><kwd>Immune function</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Integrative medicine</kwd><kwd>Mixed-methods</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0015">Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of unknown etiology characterized by periods of activity and remission, often accompanied by an impaired immune response and a reduced quality of life (QoL). Stress has been shown to negatively impact the severity and course of IBD, potentially triggering flares (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Langhorst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Torres et al., 2016</xref>). Stress occurs when environmental demands exceed an individual's adaptive capacity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>), leading to physical, psychological, or social dysfunctions (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">European Foundation for the Improvement of L and Working, 2010</xref>). It can be classified as distress (unpleasant) or eustress (motivating) (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Selye, 1976</xref>), and it can manifest itself as acute (short-term) or rather chronic referring to a long-term response to the pressures of life (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">American Psychological, 2018</xref>). Acute stress triggers physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and sweating, while chronic stress can lead to long-term health issues such as immune suppression, negative impact on memory, and digestive disturbances (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yaribeygi et al., 2017</xref>). Chronic stress modifies the sympathetic, neuroendocrine, and immune responses to acute psychological stress in humans (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 1997</xref>). Psychological stress significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. It is crucial to understand that an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory T cell responses plays a key role in CD, since recent studies suggest that psychological stress can influence T cell differentiation and function, thereby affecting this balance (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2022</xref>). Stress also modulates the gut-brain axis, for example by increasing intestinal permeability and decreasing immune reactivity, which can worsen IBD (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brzozowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Labanski et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to short-term stress, high long-term stress triples the risk of exacerbation in ulcerative colitis (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Levenstein et al., 2000</xref>). The optimal methods for managing stress remain uncertain (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Black and Slavich, 2016</xref>), but therapy approaches for stress reduction play an important role in non-pharmacological treatment approaches (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Labanski et al., 2020</xref>). Managing stress is crucial for IBD patients, as about 91&#x000a0;% of them report that stress significantly influences their disease progression (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2018</xref>), and 85&#x000a0;% say that effectively managing stress improves their condition (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Langhorst et al., 2005</xref>). High levels of perceived stress, which focuses on patients&#x02018; subjective perception of feelings and emotional responses (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al., 2017</xref>), is closely linked to diminished QoL in IBD patients (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Mind-body medicine (MBM) focuses on stress reduction and lifestyle changes. It is shown that mindfulness and stress regulation techniques like yoga, qigong and tai chi have diminished perceived stress in persons with IBD (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al., 2020</xref>), thereby improving their overall quality of life. Audio relaxation-training sessions were also able to have an effect on stress levels and achieve an improvement in mood and quality of life (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Mizrahi et al., 2012</xref>). <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Langhorst et al. (2007a)</xref> had shown, that the use of relaxation techniques was a significant predictor of improvement in the psychological sum score after three months of therapy, measured by the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. Lifestyle modification programs (LSM) include different aspects of mind-body medicine and intend to improve patients&#x02019; health and QoL by teaching e.g. coping strategies for stress (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Elsenbruch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Langhorst et al., 2007b</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Coping is considered effective when it reduces or eliminates distress. Even if the stressor, like an illness, is still there, the person feels less upset emotionally, socially, or physically. Therefore, multi-modal non-pharmacological approaches with focus on lifestyle modifications seem to be an effective tool in prevention and therapy of IBD (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Torres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Labanski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Black and Slavich, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al., 2021</xref>). According to patient reports (interviews), they can be helpful in reducing psychological stress and physical symptoms, and as a consequence improving patients&#x02019; overall well-being and QoL (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Schlee et al., 2022</xref>). The focus on mindfulness and self-care could be one key factor.</p><p id="p0025">Based on these findings, the primary objective of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) by <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2022</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>, of which this sub-study was a part, was to investigate whether our multi-modal comprehensive lifestyle-modification day-clinic program could improve the quality of life and reduce disease activity of patients with CD as shown in previous studies with IBD. After 10-weeks of the program, patients showed improvements in health-related quality of life (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kirschbaum et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schlee et al., 2024</xref>) and in relevant fecal markers (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2024</xref>). Based on these promising initial results, this sub-study aims to clarify the role of stress management in this context.</p><p id="p0030">Can such a program including teaching them adequate stress coping strategies also significantly change the way CD patients handle acute stress and perceive their chronic stress? We hypothesized that the difference in amount of activities learned during the day-clinic might contribute to a better acute stress management in the intervention compared to the control group. We also hypothesized that patients&#x02019; own perception of stress could be changed for the better, like already shown for ulcerative colitis (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al., 2021</xref>). After the day-clinic intervention (at week 12), patients participated in the <italic>Trier Social Stress Test</italic> (TSST) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kirschbaum et al., 1993</xref>), which is a standard procedure for inducing acute psychosocial stress under laboratory conditions (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2017</xref>). The aim was to analyze the effects of the TSST especially regarding perceived stress and physiological stress, using blood parameters to compare the intervention and control group. We hypothesized that patients of the intervention group would overall report less perceived stress as a result of the 10-weeks program, and that they can apply the acquired stress management strategies during TSST. This might be reflected in immune cell counts and cortisol levels, indicating a balanced regulation of psychological stress on both.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and day-clinic program</title><p id="p0035">The present study presents results of stress-related outcomes of an RCT (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2022</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). A trial with parallel groups randomized allocation of patients with CD in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (day-clinic program) or control group and two follow-up assessments at 3 and 9 months after the baseline assessment was conducted between July 2020 and October 2021.

During day-clinic, all patients must write a diary regarding their stress coping activities (amount of conducted relaxation techniques, meditative movements, and endurance training). At baseline and after the day-clinic program, patients&#x02019; perceived stress levels were measured. In week 24, qualitative interviews were conducted with the intervention group regarding implementation of strategies learned during their day-clinic visits in their daily lives.

Meditative movements focus on activities that combine movement with mindfulness, such as yoga, tai chi, or qigong. Endurance training comprises physical activities aimed at building endurance and resilience. This could involve activities like jogging, swimming, cycling, or walking (fast walking/Nordic walking).

In the first part, participants are asked to put themselves in the role of a job applicant and to explain in a 5-min free speech to a selection committee consisting of two psychologist (actors in doctor's coats) which personal characteristics make them suitable for this field of work. Participants are informed that the observers will also focus on their nonverbal behavior and that a video camera and a tape recorder will record their speech. To prepare for their speech, the subjects are given 5&#x000a0;min to take notes, which may however not be used during the speech. The selection committee will remain as neutral as possible throughout the participants' speech and, if necessary, will indicate in a standardized manner any time remaining if the participants speak for less than 5&#x000a0;min. After this simulated job interview is finished, a second challenge follows for the participants: they are asked to count down from the number 1022 in increments of 13 as correctly and as quickly as possible. Each time they make a mistake, participants have to start again from scratch. Participants will be interrupted after 5&#x000a0;min and an experimenter informs the participants about the aim and purpose of the study and assures them that neither the video nor the tape recording of the speech given will be analyzed (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kirschbaum et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p id="p0085">Besides vital signs such as blood pressure and pulse, at four timepoints of TSST (Baseline/minute 0, Stress/minute 25, Recovery 1/minute 35, Recovery 2/minute 70, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), blood samples were taken to determine immune and endocrine parameters.

Mediation analysis has shown that no measure alone, for example &#x0201c;meditative movements&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;relaxation&#x0201d;, can reduce stress to this extent. In addition, only the amount of time spent was recorded in the diaries. It can be assumed that there were also qualitative differences in implementation due to the instructions in the program as opposed to the short training course (CG). The changes in perceived stress were brought about by the guided overall program with a variety of self-care strategies.</p><p id="p0155"><italic>Diary records</italic> in our study display a significantly higher amount of relaxation techniques among the IG compared to the CG.

By participating in an LSM program, participants have acquired effective strategies for managing stress (Schlee et al.) and consistently report a heightened sense of calmness in their daily lives.</p><p id="p0160">As it is known, techniques like relaxation, yoga and mindfulness can have positive impact on stress regulation in patients with IBD (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Mizrahi et al., 2012</xref>). However, there were no discernible differences between the groups regarding the measure of endurance training. The control group did just as much exercise as the IG, but did not benefit as much regarding stress perception. Obviously, the extensive utilization of additional self-care techniques seemed to make the crucial difference in (chronic) stress reduction between the groups. Techniques such as meditative movements and relaxation, quantifiable here through the diary, as well as the entire modules of the LSM program influence the perception of stress as such. The reason could be that interventions that comprise acceptance and mindfulness procedures can increase psychological flexibility and reduce stress (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wersebe et al., 2018</xref>). In ulcerative colitis, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Schlee et al. (2022)</xref> described that the strong focus on personal responsibility and self-care was vital for reducing psychological stress and physical symptoms. As a result, both the patient's well-being and quality of life improved. In our main study (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2024</xref>; Schlee et al.) on CD, equivalent analyses yielded similar impact of stress management in psychological, physical, and social domains (such as improvements of quality of life and relevant fecal markers). The role of exercise, such as endurance training, as a method for stress prevention is not yet fully understood and warrants further investigation (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hashash and Binion, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0165">Our results regarding perceived stress (significant interaction) and stress reduction techniques (from diaries; clear main effects of group), indicate, that the changes in our intervention group across time are caused by our intervention.</p><p id="p0170">It is by now widely recognized that acute and chronic stress have an impact on the immune system. Acute stress may have a stimulating effect on the immune system, while in the case of chronic stress the immune system may be down-regulated. However, there is considerable individual variability in the immune response to stress. This seems to a large extent to be determined by the subject's way of dealing with stress (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Olff, 1999</xref>). In the present study, we could successfully induce acute psychological stress by TSST as reported by participants and seen at the cortisol reaction. Furthermore, there were hints to an altered immune response to acute stress in leucocytes and platelets in the intervention group in comparison to control group. Acute stress led to a significant increase of leucocytes in the intervention group compared to baseline. Human studies have consistently indicated that acute stress elevates blood immune cell counts compared to resting states (e.g. <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Schakel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al., 1995</xref>). This increase in leucocyte mobilization is part of the "fight-or-flight" response, where the body's stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, stimulate the rapid production and release of white blood cells from bone marrow and other reservoirs into the bloodstream. The immune system prepares itself for possible injuries and infections or both. Assessing the immune system's response to activating stimuli provides a reliable measure of immunocompetence, serving as a biologically valid marker of an effective immune response (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Schakel et al., 2019</xref>). The drop of leucocyte levels in the recovery phase of the TSST might represent leucocyte traffic out of the blood and into tissues (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dhabhar et al., 2012</xref>). Stress-induced leucocyte redistribution may be a crucial survival mechanism that directs leucocyte subpopulations to specific target organs during stress, significantly enhancing the speed, efficacy, and regulation of the immune response (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dhabhar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0175">The observation that an increase in leucocytes as a reaction to acute stress could only be triggered in the IG, seems to indicate that the participants are able to form efficient immune responses as a result of the LSM program. By reducing chronic stress, as shown by the decrease in perceived stress levels, responses to acute stress could possibly be modified. It is known that the immune responses of chronically stressed people to acute stress differ from those of healthy people, suggesting a disorder in the sympathetic, neuroendocrine, and immunological mediated processes (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 1997</xref>). Impairments in the regulation of those processes may directly affect, among others, receptor density and sensitivity of immune cells, their stimulability and mobility, as seen on the percentage of circulating immune cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Drago&#x0015f; and T&#x00103;n&#x00103;sescu, 2010</xref>). In contrast to acute stress, chronic stress impairs T cell function (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Drago&#x0015f; and T&#x00103;n&#x00103;sescu, 2010</xref>). All results of our sub-study referring to the efficacy of immune response, are supported by the findings regarding immunological regulation examined as part of another sub-study by Mekes-Adamczyk et al. (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mekes-Adamczyk et al., 2025</xref>) of the <funding-source id="gs2"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100014144</institution-id><institution>RCT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2024</xref>). Mekes-Adamczyk et al. (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mekes-Adamczyk et al., 2025</xref>) compared circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from CD patients (same intervention group as in the present study) with the cells of healthy blood donors in the course of the study. They observed reduced T cell frequencies in the blood of the patients and a significant correlation between the quality of life improvement and those cell frequencies. They concluded that the LSM program can potentially restore the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell profile of CD patients to levels comparable to those of healthy blood donors (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mekes-Adamczyk et al., 2025</xref>). Despite substantial heterogeneity across studies, a review by <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Black and Slavich (2016)</xref> with a specific focus on circulating markers of inflammation and number of immune cells, found evidence that mindfulness meditation can improve immune system dynamics. In their 2019 meta-analytic review, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Schakel et al. (2019)</xref> found that psychological interventions, such as stress management, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness practices, yielded a small-to-medium effect size in enhancing immune function. This effect was consistent across multiple studies, indicating that these interventions can contribute to better immune responses, though the magnitude of the improvement varies. Therefore, our results seem to be in line with the latest findings in this area of research.</p><p id="p0180">Platelets represent the major cell type involved in the regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. In addition to performing hemostatic roles, platelets can among others interact with the vascular endothelium and leucocytes and are therefore important coordinators of inflammation (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Thomas and Storey, 2015</xref>), and can influence both innate and adaptive immune responses. Laboratory stress is associated with the activation of blood platelets (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Koudouovoh-Tripp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mundal, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 1985</xref>) reflected by changes in platelet bioactivity and aggregation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bentur et al., 2018</xref>). Platelets activated in the circulation engage in a crosstalk with endothelial cells to promote the local immune response and limit pathogen invasion through immunothrombosis (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Coenen et al., 2017</xref>). Activated platelets physically interact with endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Coenen et al., 2017</xref>) and immune cells. Mental stress has been shown to increase platelet aggregability (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">von K&#x000e4;nel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Naesh et al., 1993</xref>). In order to clarify further stress-induced platelet activation with special reference to the period after the stress, healthy volunteers were studied during and for 1&#x000a0;h after a mental stress test (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Naesh et al., 1993</xref>). Platelet aggregability was unaffected during the test but decreased following the stress. The researchers concluded that platelets are activated during mental stress and that this activation involves a post-stress release of vasoactive compounds from platelets (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Naesh et al., 1993</xref>). In our study, acute stress led to a significant drop in platelet levels after stress exposure, followed by a significant increase, both in the intervention group. These observations seem also to be part of the "fight-or-flight" response. Fighting and fleeing carries the risk of injury, which can allow infectious agents to enter the bloodstream or penetrate the skin. Any skin wound is likely to harbor pathogens that could proliferate and lead to infection (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Leaper, 1998</xref>). Stress-induced changes in the immune system that enhance wound repair and prevent infections would be adaptive, likely selected alongside other physiological changes that increased evolutionary fitness (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Segerstrom and Miller, 2004</xref>). Acute stress upregulates parameters of natural immunity, the branch of the immune system in which most changes occur, which requires only minimal time and energy investment to defend against invaders (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Segerstrom and Miller, 2004</xref>). <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Schakel et al. (2019)</xref> highlighted that the most compelling evidence for optimizing immune function through psychological interventions was observed in cases of wound healing (medium effect size). Faster wound healing indicates a more effective immune response. As stressors became more chronic, the potential adaptiveness of the immune changes decreased (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Segerstrom and Miller, 2004</xref>). Research gives hint that the recovery of platelet function following an acute mental stress exposure is significantly impaired by chronic stress (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Koudouovoh-Tripp et al., 2021</xref>). Of note is, that aggregation is affected by chronic and acute mental stress. In healthy individuals, platelet-leucocyte aggregation (PLA) returns to baseline levels within 20&#x02013;45&#x000a0;min following an acute stress session. In contrast, PLA gradually increases up to 75&#x000a0;min post-stress in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Strike et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that CVD patients experience prolonged platelet activation under stress (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sandrini et al., 2020</xref>). The observed drop in platelet count in our intervention group after stress exposure in our sub-study could be explained by stress-induced activation and aggregation. The observed increase in the recovery phase could be interpreted as the rapid restoration of the basal state.</p><p id="p0185">Acute stress triggers the &#x0201c;fight-or-flight&#x0201d; response with activation of the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis and the release of the stress hormone <italic>cortisol</italic> (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rohleder, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, no physiological differences in response to acute stress were found between the groups in our sub-study. <italic>Pulse and blood pressure</italic> were not considerably different. Participants in both groups did not differ significantly in cortisol levels during the TSST. In their study on ulcerative colitis, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al. (2021)</xref> observed group differences in pulse rates, but also found no significant differences in cortisol levels. In the study of <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Rosenkranz et al. (2013)</xref> with healthy individuals, participants who received a stress-reducing mindfulness intervention showed a lower post-stress (i.e., after the TSST) inflammatory response compared to a control group, despite equivalent stress-evoked cortisol levels. So, even if the cortisol levels in our sub-study are similarly high in both groups, it can still be assumed that the regulation of immune cells may differ. Chronic stress is related to a decrease in the glucocorticoid sensitivity of peripheral immune cells (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rohleder, 2012</xref>). By reducing perceived chronic stress in our intervention group, the sensitivity could be restored.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Strength and limitations</title><p id="p0190">One can resume that our findings might indicate that an LSM program can reduce or eliminate disturbed functioning of the stress adaptation systems in CD. Our marginal significant results might be due to the fact that we did not completely achieve the required sample size. However, the Bayesian Factor and effect sizes argue at least weakly in favor of our interpretation. Therefore, our conclusions are not definitive and require further validation in larger studies.</p><p id="p0195">It is also possible that some differences between the groups were too subtle to be detected. Due to the lack of group differences in immune function, the within-group differences are not sufficient to be able to attribute the effects completely to the intervention. The effects should therefore be regarded as preliminary and further studies are needed to confirm these results. To obtain more precise information about the changes in immune response, it would be useful to take a closer look at the inflammation, such as through the intestinal profile. There is no doubt that stress has a negative impact on CD and effective interventions to reduce stress are needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0200">The findings suggest that a day-clinic LSM program can be beneficial for CD patients by improving health-related quality of life and relevant fecal markers, reducing perceived stress and possibly enhancing immune response to acute psychological stress. These improvements highlight the potential of integrating multimodal stress management and lifestyle changes into CD treatment towards a holistic care. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects and underlying mechanisms of these changes.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0205"><bold>&#x000d6;zlem &#x000d6;znur:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Methodology, Conceptualization. <bold>Sandra Utz:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Methodology, Formal analysis. <bold>Christoph Schlee:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Methodology, Formal analysis, Conceptualization. <bold>Jost Langhorst:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Supervision, Resources, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Funding sources</title><p id="p0210">This study was supported by a grant of the <funding-source id="gs1">Bavarian State Ministry for Health and Care (Germany)</funding-source>, which was administrated through the funding program Gesund.Leben.Bayern (in English: Healthy.Living.Bavaria; reference number: <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs1">GE7-2497-GLB-19-V4</award-id>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0215">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>A.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dockray</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cryan</surname><given-names>J.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dinan</surname><given-names>T.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The trier social stress test: principles and practice</article-title><source>Neurobiol.
