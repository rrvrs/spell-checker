Ischemic stroke constitutes 70% of all strokes and carries a significant risk of long-term recurrence. In 2019, ischemic stroke-related deaths totaled 3.29 million globally, representing 50.3% of stroke deaths and 17.7% of all cardiovascular disease-related deaths [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This highlights the significant burden that stroke places on healthcare systems and the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies to address this concerning health issue.</p><p>Although the incidence of ischemic stroke increases exponentially with age, cases are now emerging in younger individuals as well. About 15% of all ischemic strokes occur in adults younger than 50 years of age [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The concept of &#x0201c;time is brain&#x0201d; highlights the importance of rapid intervention in stroke cases to minimize brain damage and improve patient outcomes. The average duration of non-lacunar stroke evolution ranges from 6 to 18 hours which shows the narrow window within which interventions need to be administered to mitigate the impact of stroke on brain tissue [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Timely access to stroke treatment, such as thrombolytic therapy and thrombectomy, is crucial for minimizing brain damage, reducing the risk of disability and mortality, and enhancing patient outcomes. Triage plays a pivotal role in emergency stroke management by enabling the rapid assessment and prioritization of patients based on the severity of their condition. It ensures the allocation of resources and interventions in a timely manner [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Effective triage in stroke care can lead to reduced treatment delays, increased utilization of thrombolytic therapy, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Emergency systems of care for acute stroke rely heavily on efficient triage processes to swiftly identify, evaluate, and direct patients to the most suitable healthcare facility for prompt treatment [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Prehospital triage is critical in streamlining the stroke care pathway and expediting the delivery of appropriate interventions [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Technologies such as point-of-care testing have been identified as valuable tools in enhancing prehospital triage by enabling rapid diagnostic assessments and facilitating quicker decision-making regarding treatment strategies [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The integration of innovative technologies in prehospital stroke triage has the potential to transform the delivery of stroke care.

Interestingly, only four devices utilized email as a notification method, complemented by a web-based DICOM opener to facilitate physician communication. Regarding the data used for performance evaluation, six devices utilized data from both within and outside the United States. This indicates that these devices had access to a diverse range of data sources for evaluating their performance.</p><p>We also noticed that all 29 devices had received their approvals in the last seven years from 2018 to 2024. Among these, three devices were approved in the years 2018 and 2019 each, followed by approval of eight devices in 2020, four devices each in 2021 and 2022, six devices in 2023, and one device in 2024 (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The surge in approvals from 2020 onwards shows the increasing popularity and adoption of AI-based SaMDs in clinical settings.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Distribution of stroke triaging devices by year of approval.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0016-00000074686-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>All the devices used computed tomography (CT) as a primary modality while the primary focus of the devices varied with non-contrast CT predominantly used for hemorrhagic stroke and CT angiography for ischemic stroke. Seven devices were designed specifically to detect LVO, while three were capable of detecting both intracranial hemorrhage along with LVO. The remaining devices were primarily employed for intracranial hemorrhage triaging. Notably, only three devices were specifically designed to detect midline shifts and mass effects alongside intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p>Evaluation Metrics Descriptions</p><p>Sensitivity, specificity, and time to notification are crucial factors in the context of AI-based stroke triaging SaMD. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a diagnostic test to correctly identify individuals with a particular condition and is a measure of false negatives in medical diagnosis. High sensitivity in AI-based medical devices is essential for early and accurate disease detection for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Specificity pertains to the ability of a diagnostic test to correctly rule out individuals without a specific condition. It highlights the significance of reducing false positives. High specificity in AI algorithms contributes to reducing unnecessary interventions or treatments, minimizes patient anxiety, and optimizes healthcare resource utilization [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Time to notification is a crucial aspect of the functionality of these SaMDs, especially in time-sensitive scenarios of acute stroke care. The prompt notification of critical findings by AI algorithms can significantly impact clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Timely notifications from these SaMDs enable healthcare providers to initiate appropriate interventions promptly which can lead to improved patient care, reduced treatment delays, and enhanced overall healthcare efficiency [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Technological Capabilities</p><p>Less focus is placed on discussing the workflow for each application, instead, a holistic general-purpose diagram of these devices is given and how it fits into a normal stroke center workflow, running parallel with the standard of care (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Despite originating from different countries and having different AI/ML algorithms for image analysis, all these devices essentially share almost the same workflow of operability. All devices require the review of results by an expert clinician before the final decision. There are multiple ways these AI-enabled devices inform the clinician for prioritization purposes: (a) standalone desktop; application; (b) email notification; (c) mobile application; and (d) worklist prioritization.</p><p>The core capabilities and functioning of these SaMDs are dependent on leveraging AI for accurate and swift analysis to generate critical notifications or prioritize suspected scans (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). AI algorithms evaluate vast amounts of data and provide real-time recommendations, promising faster, more cost-effective, and more accurate diagnosis and prognosis of diseases beyond human judgment alone [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. ML is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions [<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ML-based medical devices use algorithms to analyze and interpret data and enable them to learn from patterns and make predictions or recommendations based on the information provided. Deep learning is a specialized subset of ML that involves the use of artificial neural networks to model and process complex patterns in data [<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>A schematic diagram comparing the standard of care pathway to an artificial intelligence (AI)-based parallel pathway for a non-contrast computed tomography scan of the brain. The AI-enabled device works parallel to the standard of care provided in an emergency and does not interrupt it at any level. The dotted line shows the demarcation between two pathways in the above figure.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0016-00000074686-i03" position="float"/></fig><p>Discussion</p><p>Performance Accuracy</p><p>The application of AI in healthcare has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the field of radiology. In this review, we specifically discussed only those devices that are applicable for stroke triaging. At the advent of AI applications in healthcare, physicians viewed AI as a threat, fearing that it would replace their expertise and judgment. One of the key advantages of AI in stroke triaging is its ability to achieve near-physician accuracy. As evident from our analysis, AI-based SaMDs have demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity over the years even surpassing the set goals of 80% required for their approval from the FDA.</p><p>Impact on Time to Notification</p><p>AI-based devices can analyze medical data and imaging scans to quickly and accurately identify potential stroke cases. This allows physicians to intervene promptly, provide appropriate treatment, and improve patient outcomes. Besides that, shorter notification times compared to standard care is also a big point that makes physicians recognize the potential benefits of AI in triaging stroke patients. The concept of the &#x0201c;golden hour&#x0201d; is particularly relevant in this context. The golden hour refers to the critical period after a stroke occurs, during which prompt medical intervention can significantly reduce the risk of disability or death [<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. By rapidly triaging stroke patients, AI-based devices can help ensure that they receive timely care within this crucial time frame.</p><p>Reduced Latency in Care by Workflow Improvements</p><p>ML algorithms integrated into AI-enabled SaMDs play a critical role in expediting the triaging process by rapidly analyzing patient data and identifying critical cases that necessitate immediate attention [<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These algorithms can prioritize cases based on the severity of the condition, allowing healthcare providers to promptly focus on high-risk patients. By automating the triaging process, AI-enabled SaMD ensures the timely identification and notification of urgent cases, facilitating prompt interventions and reducing care latency.</p><p>Addressing Health Inequality</p><p>AI-enabled devices are instrumental in enhancing the efficiency, accessibility, and quality of care delivery. By harnessing AI algorithms, these devices can optimize triaging, diagnosis, treatment decisions, and patient outcomes in stroke care. AI technology aids in personalized and timely interventions, ultimately improving the overall management of stroke patients. AI-enabled devices facilitate rapid and accurate stroke diagnosis, especially in areas with limited access to specialized healthcare services. Through the utilization of ML algorithms for image analysis and pattern recognition, these devices assist healthcare providers in identifying stroke symptoms, interpreting imaging scans, and making timely treatment decisions, even in resource-constrained settings [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This capability enhances early stroke detection, enabling prompt interventions and reducing the risk of long-term disability or complications.</p><p>Limitations and future directions</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This review has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the scope of our analysis was confined to data sourced from the FDA&#x02019;s database, excluding information from European or other international regulatory databases. This limitation potentially overlooks significant developments and approved SaMDs in stroke triaging outside the United States. Second, we did not delve deeply into clinical trials related to SaMDs for stroke triaging, which would have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of their real-world impact and effectiveness. Such trials are crucial for understanding the practical applications and outcomes of these AI/ML-enabled devices in diverse clinical settings. Lastly, our discussion did not include the detailed algorithms used by each device. Instead, we focused on clinically relevant measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and time to notification. While these metrics are important for assessing device performance, a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms could offer valuable insights into their operational mechanisms and potential areas for improvement.</p><p>Future Directions</p><p>Addressing the limitations of this review presents several promising future directions for further research and analysis. Expanding the scope to include data from European and other international regulatory databases will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the global landscape of AI/ML-enabled SaMDs for stroke triaging. This broader perspective could reveal additional devices and innovations that are making significant impacts worldwide. Moreover, a detailed examination of clinical trials related to these technologies is essential. Future studies should investigate the real-world impact of AI/ML-enabled SaMDs on stroke care through comprehensive clinical trial data to assess their effectiveness, safety, and patient outcomes in diverse healthcare settings. Besides that, an in-depth analysis of the algorithms underpinning each device will be valuable. Understanding the specific ML models, data inputs, and processing techniques can shed light on the strengths and potential limitations of these technologies and offer insights for further enhancement and optimization. Lastly, exploring the integration of these devices within various healthcare systems and their impact on healthcare delivery and equity will be crucial. This approach will help identify best practices and strategies for the widespread adoption and implementation of AI/ML-enabled SaMDs, ultimately improving stroke care on a global scale.</p><p>Collaborative Efforts</p><p>The successful integration of AI-enabled SaMD for stroke triaging into hospitals and broader public health systems hinges on robust collaboration between technology developers, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Each of these stakeholders plays a critical role in ensuring that these advanced technologies can be effectively and safely deployed to improve patient outcomes. Technology developers need to understand the regulatory requirements and clinical needs, healthcare providers need support and training to effectively use these technologies, and policymakers must create a framework that allows for innovation while protecting patient interests. Through ongoing dialogue and collaboration, these stakeholders can ensure that AI-enabled SaMD for stroke triaging is seamlessly integrated into healthcare systems, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes, more efficient care processes, and greater public access to cutting-edge medical technologies. Such collaboration also helps in addressing potential barriers to adoption, such as resistance to change, interoperability issues, and financial constraints. By working together, technology developers, healthcare providers, and policymakers can create a sustainable and scalable model for integrating AI into stroke care, fostering an environment where innovation thrives, and patients receive the best possible care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The transformative power of AI in stroke care lies in its ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline care processes, and improve patient outcomes.
