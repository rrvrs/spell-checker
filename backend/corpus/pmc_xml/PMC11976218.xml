A comprehensive assessment was done to determine the impact of reprocessing cycles, remaining coating and their combined effect in the final properties of the recycled polymer. Post-consumer materials are in an already-aged state, lowering their initial properties. Mechanical recycling methods showed that the reprocessing cycles have a higher impact on the mechanical performance than the amount of recycling material content. Also, the material is often coated when they are about to be recycled. The remaining coating impurities play a major role in the recycling process, losing up to 42% of the impact resistance for ABS and 28% for ABS/PC. It was demonstrated that below a 10% of remaining paint, both materials retained is performance as a neat product. Impurities was declared to be the most pernicious element on the recycling process and their elimination must be a priority regarding this objective. These results provide a better knowledge of the recycling effect and can be used to decide the potential recyclability of plastic. The ascribed project of this study (DECOAT) aims to develop efficient systems to remove coatings at the end-of-life of the part, to reduce the damage and promote the use of recycled material in high-tech applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Recyclability</kwd><kwd>plastic</kwd><kwd>coating</kwd><kwd>automotive</kwd><kwd>electronic</kwd><kwd>tensile strength</kwd><kwd>impact strength</kwd><kwd>ABS</kwd><kwd>PC</kwd><kwd>reprocessing</kwd><kwd>mechanical performance</kwd><kwd>end-of-life</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661"><funding-source>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</funding-source><award-id>814505</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study has been funded by the project &#x0201c;DECOAT&#x0201d; (Recycling of coated and painted textile and plastic materials).

These properties allow them to be used in a variety of key components for different sectors, such as construction, architecture, cushioning, electronics or the aeronautical and automotive. On top of that, the increasing use of plastic materials increases the post-consumer plastic waste produced, giving concern about their management and recyclability techniques. According to a new report of the OECD organization, only about 9% of collected plastic waste is recycled while 22% is mismanaged globally. Although, recent improvements on the reusability and recyclability of plastics had been performed, the global production of plastics from recycled or secondary plastics has more than quadrupled in the last 20 years, but this is still only 6% of the size of total plastics production, being most of the plastics in use today virgin or primary plastics, made from crude oil or gas
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>The automotive and electronic industries manufacture key products for the current market needs. They use high amounts of plastic materials, including polypropylene (PP), polyurethane (PU), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polycarbonate (PC) and many others. These sectors fulfil the demand of around a 15 % of the Europe demand for plastics materials
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup>. Among them, ABS and PC are one of the most important ones. ABS is a polymeric material that stands out for being highly resistant to impact and chemical corrosion along with a low melting point that allows an easy processability. It is widely used automotive and electronics as an impact modifier or integral part of dashboards and steering wheel covers. However, ABS has lower mechanical properties than most of the engineering plastics on the market
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup>. PC on the other hand, is a widely used amorphous plastic which has some outstanding characteristics like transparency or high impact strength but possesses poor solvent resistance and harder processability due to its high viscosity
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup>. Combining those materials in a ABS/PC blend, increases the thermomechanical resistance of ABS
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> and reduces the cost and increases the processability of PC
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup>. ABS/PC blends are commonly applied in automotive parts as well as housings of electronics and household appliances
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup>. Automotive and electronics were one of the main demanding end-users for these kinds of plastics, accounting about 9.9 and 6.2 % of the total European plastic demand in 2018
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup>. One of the main issues are the wastes generated from engineering plastics used in automotive and in electronic equipment, where ABS and PC take an important part. The waste generation of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) have increased from 8.3 Mt in 2010 to 10.4 Mt in 2021, whereas its collection has increased from 3.8 to 5.6 Mt
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup>. On top of that, the demand of recycled engineering plastics reached 2.8 Mt in 2020. This means that although recycling is experiencing and increasing demand, the increasing production and low collection rates show us that there are still plenty of work to do.</p><p>Commonly, plastic components are employed in visible applications, where design plays an important factor in the consumer&#x000b4;s decision and for that, they are commonly coated with paints or varnishes that improve their appearance and their resistance to external agents. Coatings are an additional stone on the recyclability path, as they are designed to be strongly attached to the substrate surface and resist aggressive conditions
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup>. To allow its reuse, the coating must be separated from the component, adding an additional cost than just a mere mechanical recycling. However, it is very hard to eliminate all the coating impurities before the recycling process. Several studies showed that impurities decrease the mechanical properties of the recycled materials, preventing its use on demanding applications
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</sup>. This could have implications for the industry, due to the lack of repeatability from lot to lot with recycled polymers, which would result in injury or warranty issues for the company, leading to money loss. For that reason, the highly technological sectors, such as the automotive industry, have been reluctant to use large amounts of recycled plastic, fearing a significant reduction of the material performance and thus, making, painted parts virtually not recyclable. It was reported that even 1 wt.% of a polymeric impurity in composites, causes unacceptable reductions in impact resistance and ductility
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup>. Such a challenge is of industrial importance and could lead to massive improvement in the use of recyclable materials in the automotive and electronic sectors. Besides impurities, several factors can still affect the final properties of the recycled materials. The ageing of the material at the end-of-life, the number of reprocessing cycles or the amount of recycled material can all negatively impact the performances of the material

</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, a comprehensive assessment was done to evaluate the effect of each of those factors (ageing, reprocessing cycles and coating impurities) and a cross-combination of those which showed higher impact, to provide an insight about the factors influencing the performance of a recyclable material. The results provide a better knowledge of the recycling effect and can be used to decide the potential applications of recycled plastic. The ascribed project (DECOAT) aims to develop efficient systems to remove coatings at the end-of-life of the part, to reduce the damage and promote the use of recycled material in high-tech applications. Being part of a European project with industrial application, gives clear proof about the importance of close working environments between research entities and companies, giving results that impact on the society.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The assessment was done for 2 industrial use-cases:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x02022; </label><p>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;

<bold>The mechanical recycling process itself:</bold>
</p><p>The recycling process consists of several steps of reprocessing. First, the material parts are transformed into shredded material. Then, they are mixed with virgin one at different proportions according to the desired recycled content (15, 30, 50 and 100%). Last, the material is injected to prepare the test samples according to the standards. Following this procedure, the pressure, shear, and temperature during the reprocessing can shorten the polymeric chain, affecting the mechanical properties
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup>. Since a circular approach is aimed, we evaluated the properties after five reprocessing cycles and different recycled contents (
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="f2"><label>Figure 2. </label><caption><title>Experimental procedure to evaluate the mechanical recycling effect on the properties of plastic.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="openreseurope-4-21721-g0001" position="float"/></fig><p>&#x0ffed;
<bold>The remaining coating impurities:</bold>
</p><p>Most of the recycling procedures are not perfectly efficient, therefore some coating impurities can remain in the plastic substrate, affecting its properties
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup>. In this case, mostly acrylic impurities from paint residues could be expected. To reproduce this situation, plastic pellets were coated and then mixed with virgin pellets, controlling the weight of coating that was introduced in the mixture (
<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). It was calculated that the automotive part (ABS) has 1,92 wt.% of coating and the electronic part (ABS/PC) has 0,40 wt.% respectively. Therefore, those proportions were considered as 100% coating impurities, corresponding to an untreated part.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="f3"><label>Figure 3. </label><caption><title>Experimental procedure to evaluate the effect of coating impurities.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="openreseurope-4-21721-g0002" position="float"/></fig><p>&#x0ffed;
<bold>Combined effect of reprocessing and coating impurities:</bold>
</p><p>Through the previous factors presented above, it was noted that the reprocessing of the material and the presence of coating impurities could have a big impact on the mechanical performance of the plastic product. For that reason, to study those combined effects, ABS and ABS/PC pellets were coated as in the process showed in
<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (5, 10 and 20% of remaining coating impurities) and then subjected to a five-cycle reprocessing process. The aim of this analysis is to determine the possible synergistic effect between these recycling factors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of the ageing on the mechanical properties of the material</title><p>Specimen samples were manufactured following the procedure explained in section 3 and then tested for tensile and impact strength. Five test samples were tested per material and their average was reported. As shown in
<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Aged ABS showed a significative loss of properties on both tensile modulus and impact resistance (
<bold>Figure S1, see
<italic toggle="yes">Extended data</italic>
</bold>), decreasing 12.3% and 18.8% respectively in comparison to virgin ABS. On the other hand, aged ABS/PC was also damaged by such process, with a loss of properties of 4.9% and 17.0% for tensile modulus and impact resistance, respectively (
<bold>Figure S2, see
<italic toggle="yes">Extended data</italic>
</bold>) in comparison to pristine ABS/PC. The change in tensile modulus for ABS/PC is not significant as showed by the statistical data showed in the supporting information document and in
<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. ABS suffered a higher degradation on its properties than the ABS/PC blends. This is explained by the lower UV radiation resistance of ABS due to the double bonds of the butadiene unit, whereas PC is relatively stable to the light
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup>. Also, the higher tensile performance and Tg of PC, results on a higher resistance to thermal degradation than ABS, thus improving the overall properties in the blend. On top of that, it can be observed a higher damage on the impact resistance performance than in the tensile modulus in both ABS and ABS/PC. This is due to surface degradation upon ageing, mostly on the polybutadiene phase of the polymer. Ageing leads to chain scission and cross-linking, that restricts the polymer chain mobility and decreases the free volume, resulting in an increase of the Tg upon ageing, whereas the effect on the styrene-acrylonitrile phase is less significant

<underline>Assessment of the mechanical recycling effect</underline>
</p><p>Samples were manufactured following the procedure explained in section 3.2 and then tested for tensile and impact strength. Five test samples were tested per material and their average was reported. Average values of tensile modulus are plotted in
<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and
<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> for ABS and ABS/PC respectively. For recycled ABS, the tensile modulus remains very stable and close to the reference showed in
<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (1
<sup>st</sup> cycle of 100 % recycled material), regardless of the recycled content nor the number of reprocessing cycles (
<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These results showed the excellent behavior of ABS as a recyclable material for the automotive sector. It is not statistically significant the difference in ABS tensile modulus results, as showed in the
<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Regarding ABS/PC for electronics, the effect of the recycling content and different injection cycles on the tensile strength showed a positive impact (
<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Like ABS alone, the values of ABS/PC remain close to the reference one (
<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Notably, an initial increase (about 10%) of the tensile modulus with the introduction of increasing content of recycled material was observed. It was reported that changes in the orientation of the polymeric chains at the macromolecular scale could lead to bear increasing loadings during the test
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup>. The reprocessing effect showed as well increasing values with a slightly higher impact than ABS alone. Degradation caused by several injections could produce a reduction in the mean distances and the length of the PC macromolecular chains, thus increasing the Van der Waals interactions and leading to an increasing tensile strength
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup>. Despite this, it is expected a reduction on the mechanical performance after more than 5 cycles due to the continuous degradative process

Five test samples were tested per material and their average was reported. Average values of charpy impact resistance are plotted in
<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and
<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> for ABS and ABS/PC respectively. In both materials, the impact of increasing recyclable content is almost negligible, although the presence of recyclable content decreases the performance in comparison to the reference
<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The impact resistance dropped on average by 5.9% for ABS and 14.5% for ABS/PC when recycling content is introduced. On the other hand, the impact of the reprocessing cycles is of significance. The first cycle of each recycled content for ABS keeps similar strength as the reference (
<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, after each additional cycle, the performance drops dramatically, decreasing up to 12.5% on average for the 5
<sup>th</sup> cycle (
<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In the case of ABS/PC, the loss of performance due to the reprocessing cycles is even more dramatic than in the ABS case. ABS/PC losses impact resistance from the first reprocessing cycle and drops 23 % on average after 5 cycles (
<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). On the other hand, ABS/PC seems to show higher stability on the first two reprocessing cycles regardless of the recycling content but drops abruptly after the 3
<sup>rd</sup> cycle. The loss of mechanical properties in ABS is often attributed to thermo-oxidative degradation in the polybutadiene phase only, whereas additional physical ageing can also occur in the styrene-acrylonitrile phase
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup>. The polymeric degradation of ABS is thermodynamically favorable after periods of exposure to heat and oxygen (such as after reprocessing), leading to a deterioration of the mechanical properties
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup>. Commonly, the introduction of PC leads to a higher stability upon reprocessing
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</sup>. However, it was reported that the decrement of strength with reprocessing might be attributed to the decrease of the molecular weight and chain scission. Broader chain length distribution and shorter chain induced poor chain entanglements, and consequently, the impact strength dropped with increasing reprocessing
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup>. Further studies including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques could give more information about the degradation of the material with the increasing reprocessing cycles.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="f6"><label>Figure 6. </label><caption><title>Effect of recycled content and reprocessing cycles on the impact resistance of ABS.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="openreseurope-4-21721-g0005" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="f7"><label>Figure 7. </label><caption><title>Effect of recycled content and reprocessing cycles on the impact resistance of ABS/PC.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="openreseurope-4-21721-g0006" position="float"/></fig><p>&#x0ffed;
<underline>Assessment of the coating impurities effect</underline>
</p><p>Samples were manufactured following the procedure explained in section 3.2 (
<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and then tested for tensile and impact strength. Results are showed in
<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, and
<bold>Figures S3</bold> and
<bold>S4</bold> (
<bold>see
<italic toggle="yes">Extended data</italic>
</bold>). Five test samples were tested per material and their average was reported. Regarding ABS, the tensile modulus decreases when coating impurities are present. For coating contents from 0.5 to 50%, the tensile modulus decreases 12% on average. With 100% of remaining coating, it decreases 16%. For ABS/PC, the effect of coating impurities on the tensile modulus is not clear, since there is a huge variability of data which is more evident with the higher impurity content. However, a slight decrease in the performance can be presumed. For the impact resistance, again, a clear relationship was found between the amount of coating impurities and the performance of both ABS and ABS/PC. Both ABS and ABS/PC can retain its properties when the coating impurities fall below 3% compared to the neat material. However, with full coating (100% impurities) decreases the impact resistance of ABS and ABS/PC by 42% and 28%, respectively. It can be thus noted the better performance of ABS/PC with respect to ABS. According to the trend curves, it is enough with 14.2% and 21.2% of the remaining coating impurities to lost about the 10% of the performance of the reference ABS and ABS/PC, respectively. The presence of coating impurities had a very large impact on the mechanical properties. It was reported that these impurities usually have different dimensions and produce an inhomogeneous structure with weak mechanical points, which resulted in local cavitation and higher stress for the ABS matrix that allows an easy breakage

<underline>Assessment of the combined effect of coating impurities and reprocessing cycles</underline>
</p><p>Specimen samples were manufactured following the procedure explained in section 3.2 and then tested for tensile and impact strength. Five test samples were tested per material and their average was reported. Results for ABS analysis are shown in
<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and
<xref rid="f10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> whereas for ABS/PC are shown in
<xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> and
<xref rid="f11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>. The data for the tensile modulus and impact resistance of ABS showed a general drop on the properties of the material with increasing reprocessing cycles and coating impurities. ABS decreased on average 9% and 24% for the tensile and impact strength respectively. This result implies a higher effect on the impact resistance than in the tensile modulus. Nonetheless, the combined factors showed no synergistic effect, being the effect of the coating individually, the one with probably higher contribution. In the case of ABS/PC, the performance decreased on average by 3.0% and 15% for the tensile and impact strength respectively. ABS/PC retained notably its properties in comparison to ABS. In the same way as ABS, no synergistic effect was found. One possibility to explain this lack of synergistic degradative effects could be on the impurities size and distribution. As the materials are reprocessed, the impurities could be distributed homogeneously due to the temperature and shear stress of the process, thus reducing its size. As the impurities size diminishes, the local stress increases due to the interaction between the polymer molecules, leading to a reduced effect of coating impurities on the impact strength decrease

<underline>Statistical studies for tensile strength of testing materials:</underline>
</p><p>An ANOVA test (one factor) was performed to check if the average values reported are statistically different from each other. Herein the statistical data for the tensile strength of ABS and ABS/PC testing probes will be shown. It can be seen that the F value is higher than their corresponding critical value in the cases of ABS for the ageing test (Figure S1) and in the ABS/PC for the mechanical recycling effect (
<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, the P-values are &#x0003c;0.05 in the same cases. This indicates that the averages are significantly different in these cases. In the cases where the averages are not significantly different, this could be a result of using a single screw injection machine and not using a twin screw, resulting in little chain scission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A comprehensive assessment of the mechanical properties of recycled materials was done during this, isolating different factors that can potentially damage the polymers and therefore, limit their application in high-tech sectors such as automotive and electronic industries.

<italic toggle="yes">pain</italic>t coating on recycling cycles. The writing is clear and scientifically sound. However, the reviewer believes that the literature on the effects of recycling cycles is not sufficiently covered in the introduction. There is a lack of recent, relevant studies on recycling of other types of plastics, which would help provide the reader with a clearer understanding of the current state of research in this area.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>
<bold>Suggestion 3: Figure 2 and 3 quality change:</bold>
</p></list-item></list> Thanks for the comment. Figures 2 and 3 have been included from the TIFF document in the repository (10.5281/zenodo.14999538) with higher quality. We have also included the other images in a higher quality. &#x000a0;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>
<bold>Suggestion 4: Methods: DOE table</bold>
</p></list-item></list> Thanks for the comment. According to your suggestion, we have decided to include a DOE table in the supporting information explaining how the factors and their levels affect the material&#x02019;s performance. We did not perform a full factorial design but a simple design in which we could study all the factors and their levels individually. Then, we obtained the result that coating and reprocessing could have an important effect combined. For that reason, our aim here was to evaluate a possible synergistic effect between those combined factors in one simple answer.
<italic toggle="yes">As it can seen in these tables, we could perform a simple evaluation of these factor to obtain an outcome that is consistent with our conclusion, which is that coating impurities have a very high impact on the final performance of recycling materials and so, it is very important to clean the materials prior to the start of the recycling process.</italic> &#x000a0;

<bold>Suggestion 6: Section 1.3</bold>
</p></list-item></list> Thanks for the suggestion. It was made before an ANOVA test for all the tensile tests (see supporting information) to ensure the significance of the results.

<bold>The authors write that polymers and their properties all decrease as a result of aging however this is not true.

<bold>Do the authors have the exact formulations for the 2 industrial case studies?</bold>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<bold>The post-consumer parts can/be filled with a ton of additives to prevent aging which will offset the trend there were seen. As well, the date or production and or length of service will also have a significant impact on the properties of the post-consumer parts.</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are PC and ABS compatible with one another in blending operations?</p></list-item></list> -- Results --</p><p> The results for this work are what would have been expected from this type of work. However, 2 major issues are present in this work.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<bold>The material was seemingly "recycled" in an injection molding machine which is not an adequate method for studying this. It is not adequate because this type of recycling process (post-consumer (e.g. down cycling)) typically includes a twin screw extruder which imparts greater thermo-mechanical forces such as shear and heat compared to a single screw injection molding machine. In addition, the residence time in an extruder would be different when compared to an Injection molding machine.&#x000a0;</bold>
</p><p>
<bold> Also, if blending the recycled offsets into a virgin matrix via injection molding cause the results, in general, to be questioned as the mixing of the different constituents would be poor and not efficient as single screw set-ups are used to convey material from one end (feeding zone) to the other end (die). They are NOT to mix/blend like a twin screw set-up would.</bold>
</p><p> The authors need to justify this for this manuscript to be accepted.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>The tensile strength results are not statistically significant and with the lack of mention I would assume no ANOVA was performed on these results. However, looking at the means of the results, show that these results are highly likely to all be statistically insignificant (FIG 4, 5, 8, 9). This is not bad, necessarily, as it just means the material is more stable but the results discussion needs to reflect the no significance in tensile results.</bold>
</p><p>
<bold> Please provide an ANOVA to prove your tensile results are significant.</bold>
</p><p> The lack of tensile results may be a result of "recycling" within a single screw and not using a twin screw resulting in little chain scission.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>With the last point, the ABS/PC ref to after aging electronic, I would argue is not significant. Please check with ANOVA.</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>To prove chain scission, molecular weight analysis through whatever means (GPC, DLS, rheology) should be included.</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>The authors are constantly flipping between tensile strength and modulus. I assumed this is all tensile strength but please look through the entire work and fix it.</bold>

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>I would argue high technology sector's hesitation to implement recycled compounds is due to the lack of repeatability from lot to lot with recycled polymers which would result in injury or warranty issues for the company, leading to money loss. This is opposed to just the materials' performance itself just decreasing the mechanical properties.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>ANSWER: </bold>Thanks for the suggestion, we introduced a comment highlighting this possible fact in the introduction.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<bold>The authors write that polymers and their properties all decrease as a result of aging however this is not true. If material crosslinks and branches as a result of degradation then viscosity and tensile strength increases. If the material is annealed, then the modulus and overall hardness increases. Please correct that statement on page 3 end of paragraph 2.</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
<bold>ANSWER: </bold>Thanks for the comment. We stated there are several factors that can affect the performance of the material at the EOL, ageing, impurities presence, reprocessing cycles and amount of recycled material. It does not mean they decrease; it means they &#x0201c;impact negatively&#x0201d; on the performance of the material where the modified properties resultant after they EOL could be probably not desired. -- Materials and Methods --

<bold>Did the authors dry the PC and ABS/PC blends?</bold>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<bold>ABS may be hydrophobic but PC is reported to be broadline and other papers have reported drying PC before processing.</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item></list>
<bold>ANSWER: </bold>Yes, the materials were dried before the injection procedure. Polymers where dried before injecting it with a WITTMANN DRYMAX E30and their moisture was measured with a Brabender Moisture meter AQUATRAC&#x000ae; - 3E. This comment was included in the methods section.

<bold>Do the authors have the exact formulations for the 2 industrial case studies?</bold>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<bold>The post-consumer parts can/be filled with a ton of additives to prevent aging which will offset the trend there were seen. As well, the date or production and or length of service will also have a significant impact on the properties of the post-consumer parts.</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item></list>
<bold>ANSWER: </bold>Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, the exact formulations cannot be disclosure as they are commercial products belonging to a private consortium in a European project.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Are PC and ABS compatible with one another in blending operations?</p></list-item></list>
<bold>ANSWER: </bold>Thanks for the question. For this project, the PC/ABS was selected from the commercially ones available in the market. In this case, a (PC + ABS) Lupoy HR5007A White specially used for injection molding was chosen. -- Results --</p><p> The results for this work are what would have been expected from this type of work. However, 2 major issues are present in this work.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<bold>The material was seemingly "recycled" in an injection molding machine which is not an adequate method for studying this. It is not adequate because this type of recycling process (post-consumer (e.g. down cycling)) typically includes a twin screw extruder which imparts greater thermo-mechanical forces such as shear and heat compared to a single screw injection molding machine. In addition, the residence time in an extruder would be different when compared to an Injection molding machine.&#x000a0;</bold>
</p><p>
<bold> Also, if blending the recycled offsets into a virgin matrix via injection molding cause the results, in general, to be questioned as the mixing of the different constituents would be poor and not efficient as single screw set-ups are used to convey material from one end (feeding zone) to the other end (die). They are NOT to mix/blend like a twin-screw set-up would.</bold>
</p><p> The authors need to justify this for this manuscript to be accepted.&#x000a0;</p></list-item></list>
<bold>ANSWER: </bold>Thanks for the question and explanation. We think that the reviewer is mostly right about his/her assumption. Our machine is an injection molding machine Engel Victory 350Tn. It consists of a single-screw injection molding machine. The procedure for testing the mechanical recycling effect was as follows, first, the material (recycled) was shredded into new small pieces and then mixed with virgin ones in a mixing machine. Then, they are injected again to manufacture new tests samples. We used this procedure as it was the common one for the recycling industry, being our intention to be a real simulation of the loss of properties only during this step. Although by using and extruder machine the mixing would be better, we did not use an extruder machine as we believe that this could bring additional thermo-mechanical stress to the material, making the comparison to the virgin material even harder and not aligned within the aim of the project. We introduced comments in the method section including the mixing machine we were using to obtain the pellets for injection.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<bold>The tensile strength results are not statistically significant and with the lack of mention I would assume no ANOVA was performed on these results. However, looking at the means of the results, show that these results are highly likely to all be statistically insignificant (FIG 4, 5, 8, 9). This is not bad, necessarily, as it just means the material is more stable but the results discussion needs to reflect the no significance in tensile results.</bold>
</p><p>
<bold> Please provide an ANOVA to prove your tensile results are significant.</bold>
</p><p> The lack of tensile results may be a result of "recycling" within a single screw and not using a twin screw resulting in little chain scission.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>ANSWER: </bold>Thanks a lot for the suggestions. We performed ANOVA (one factor variance) in the results from figures 4,5,8 and 9. The data from Figure 4 showed that there is not a significant variance on the results: AN&#x000c1;LISIS DE VARIANZA &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0;

According to the TDS for the coatings, these are made of an acrylic-based coating. A comment highlighting this was included in page 7. The conditions for the five cycles were similar as the ones stated before in

<bold>Suggestion 5: Mechanical tests:</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
<italic toggle="yes">Why did you not conduct other mechanical tests such as compressive, flexural, hardness, etc.,</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Answer 5:</bold> Thanks for the tests suggestions. Other mechanical tests were not included as they were not part of the project nor included into the assigned budget. Tensile and impact were chosen as the ones with higher impact and representativity for the study. Although we believe that if the study was more general with regard to the mechanical properties, the mentioned tests could be a good addition. &#x000a0;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>
<bold>Suggestion 6: Thermal Analysis:</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
<italic toggle="yes">There are no any thermal analysis mentioned in your work. Why did you not conduct DSC and TGA?</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Answer 6:</bold> Thanks for the suggestions. We believe that these techniques could bring higher insights about the degradation of the polymeric chains due to thermomechanical stress. However, in a similar way as the last suggestion, DSC and TGA were not included in the project, and it is very hard to perform them now as they are out of the assigned budget or tasks included into our work packages. Nonetheless, the objective of the article is to study the impact of recyclability on the mechanical properties, although we are aware of the relation with thermal processes. As it could be necessary to include newer tests on the study, some comments about the needs of future tests for SEM were included into the draft in page 12. &#x000a0;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>
<bold>Suggestion 7: Microstructural Analysis:</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
<italic toggle="yes">Why didn't you carry out Scanning Electron Microscope SEM?</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Answer 7:</bold> Thanks for the valuable suggestions. SEM is a very interesting technique to include that could give us deep knowledge about the microstructure of the polymers. Unfortunately, we do not have such technique into our facilities and this test was not included as part of the budget for the related European project. As there was a focus on newer tests to include more information than the current one, some comments about the needs of future tests for SEM were included into the draft in page 13.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article></article>
