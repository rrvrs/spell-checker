Persons with BPD become suicidal because the team cannot comprehend and address the cycle of dysthymia, rumination and suicide. The BPD crises start from Stage 1 (&#x003b1;), assessing the comorbidity between BPD with dysthymia, cyclothymia, autism and ADHD. Teams shall avoid overmedication as ineffective. Stage 2 (&#x003b2;) is introspection and rumination, which do not respond to pharmacotherapy. The health carers establish if rumination is present and suggest distraction techniques. Stage 3 (&#x003b3;) is when constant rumination with catastrophising leads to hopelessness. Stage 4 (&#x003b4;) is when BPD starts feeling more anxious, depressed and unable to stop rumination. We suggest thought-stopping techniques and discourage social isolation, which triggers rumination. As BPDs use external locus of control and aim for higher dosages of antidepressants and anxiolytics with minimal effect, we explain that medication is not the only solution. Stage 5 (&#x003b5;) is a crisis and panic attack because constant rumination brings back traumatic thoughts focused on the past, present and future. This is when BPDs self-refer to the hospital, attempt suicide, and feel that hospital admission is the only solution. The stages combined generated Model I. The Model II forecast &#x00394; from this study is that we will observe a higher frequency (&#x00394;) of hospital occupancy (&#x00394;bo = A), suicidal attempts (&#x00394;sa = B), and heavy service use (&#x00394;su = C) by BPDs.</p></sec><sec id="sec8900"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The predictive model algorithm has thus extracted (1) <italic toggle="yes">Model I</italic> (Analysis): [&#x003b1; &#x02192; (&#x003b2; &#x02192; (&#x003b3;&#x000a0;&#x02192; (&#x003b4; &#x02192; &#x003b5;)))] = Z; The truth density for Model I and its strength of prediction for stage progression is 96.87% in the dysthymia-rumination-suicide cycle; and (2) <italic toggle="yes">Model II</italic> (Prediction): Z implies (A And B And C), Z&#x02192;A &#x02229;&#x000a0;B &#x02229;&#x000a0;C; the truth density for the Model II is 56.25% for predicting a national shortage of healthcare resources.
