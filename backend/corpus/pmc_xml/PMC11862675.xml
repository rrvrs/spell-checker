In addition, childhood sexual abuse and violence are common in people&#x02019;s histories.</p></sec><sec id="sec1411"><title>Objectives</title><p>Assessing sexuality in patients followed for borderline personality disorder at Arrazi Sal&#x000e9; psychiatric hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec1412"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a descriptive cross-sectional study using a questionnaire including socio-demographic criteria with a questionnaire on sexual behavior in female patients followed for borderline personality disorder at the Arrazi Sal&#x000e9; psychiatric hospital.&#x000a0;Inclusion criteria: women over 18 years of age diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Exclusion criteria: psychosis, intellectual disability.</p></sec><sec id="sec1413"><title>Results</title><p>We collected 45 patients with borderline personality disorder. The average age was 22, 80% were single, 58% unemployed, 46% had dropped out of high school.&#x000a0;The majority of participants were using psychoactive substances.&#x000a0;25% had attempted suicide. 83% were victims of childhood sexual abuse. The majority were significantly more likely to engage in sexual activity at a younger age than their peers. Over 60% had never used contraception 10% had their first pregnancy at a younger age, with termination. 15% have had genital infections. 53% were attracted to both sexes, and over 66% had more than one sexual partner. Over 73% did not experience sexual satisfaction (sexual satisfaction scale less than 10).</p></sec><sec id="sec1414"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results indicate that sexuality in patients with borderline personality disorder is present early in the course of the disorder, often at a young age, with significant physical, mental and social consequences.&#x000a0;Primary care mental health, sexual health and sexual assault services need to be attentive to the clinical diagnosis of this personality disorder, as the nature of the disorder represents both a risk factor and a health threat.</p></sec><sec id="sec1415"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
