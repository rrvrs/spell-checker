Knowledge of prescribed medications can influence patients&#x02019; willingness to adhere to them.</p></sec><sec id="sec9396"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of patients with mental disorders about their prescribed medication and to evaluate their attitudes and beliefs toward treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec9397"><title>Methods</title><p>
Our quantitative descriptive study involved 52 patients hospitalized in the psychiatric &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; department of the Hedi Chaker University Hospital in Sax between the 23<sup>rd</sup> and 30 October 2023. Excluded were aggressive patients, those who were unable to communicate, and those who refused to participate. Thirty-nine patients were included.&#x000a0;For each patient, we collected sociodemographic, clinical, and disease progression data, as well as information, beliefs, and attitudes concerning the prescribed treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec9398"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of our patients was 35.49 &#x000b1; 10.24 years, with an exclusively male sample. Most patients had no occupation (69.2%). Only 10.3% were married. Over half of the patients had achieved primary school (61.5%) and lived in rural areas (64.1%). The mean duration of the mental disorder was 10.69 &#x000b1; 9.07 years. Patients were hospitalized 3.62 times on average. The most frequent diagnoses were schizophrenia (35.9%) and bipolar disorder (33.3%). More than half of the patients (61.5%) knew the color and shape of the prescribed medication, and 48.2% knew the name and dose.</p><p>The source of treatment information was mainly doctors (33.3%) and family members (15.4%). Adherence to treatment was poor in 69.2% of cases. The majority of patients denied stopping treatment and 12.8% reported that they stopped treatment because of financial difficulties. Twenty-four patients confirmed that taking the treatment made people see them differently and that they preferred not to reveal they were taking it. Two-thirds of patients reported that the treatment relaxed them (71.8%) but could be stopped when they felt better (69.2%).</p></sec><sec id="sec9399"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is essential for mental health professionals to develop and implement effective intervention strategies that maximize therapeutic impact and reduce the risk of relapse.</p></sec><sec id="sec9400"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
