(<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) GCD most commonly originates in the sigmoid colon, accounting for approximately 90&#x000a0;% of cases. (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) Though the exact incidence is unknown, approximately 200 cases have been reported, primarily in case studies or small case series. (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) Due to its infrequency and nonspecific symptoms, GCD is often misdiagnosed, leading to potential delays in appropriate treatment. The aim of this case report is to enhance clinical awareness of this rare entity and contribute to the limited body of literature on its presentation and management. The SCARE guidelines for reporting on surgical case reports were followed. (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Case presentation</title><p id="p0035">A 64-year-old self-reliant Caucasian woman was referred to the community hospital following an outpatient CT scan that suggested a contained colonic perforation, initially interpreted as locally contained perforated diverticulitis. The scan had been ordered by her primary physician due to her complaint of persistent, low-grade left flank pain, which had progressively worsened over several months. The pain was described as constant, exacerbated by physical activity, and unrelated to eating or bowel movements. She also reported a gradual increase in abdominal distention over the past few months.</p><p id="p0040">Her medical history was notable for breast cancer treated in 2004 with no recurrence, and well-controlled hypertension managed with medication. She lived independently and was fully functional in daily activities. At admission, she appeared well, with a height of 164&#x000a0;cm, weight of 64&#x000a0;kg, and a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 23.8&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Vital signs were stable, with a tympanic temperature of 36.9&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and physical examination revealed a soft abdomen without peritonitis, but with a palpable, tender mass in the left flank. Rectal examination revealed no masses or visual/occult blood in the stool.</p><p id="p0045">Laboratory investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 12&#x000a0;g/dL, a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 13.9&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 22&#x000a0;mg/L, suggestive of mild inflammation. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen identified an 11x10x14 cm well-defined, air-filled cavity near the sigmoid colon, with surrounding fat stranding but no fluid (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) The radiology report interpreted the air-filled cavity as free air outside the bowel lumen, suggestive of a contained perforation secondary to diverticulitis.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CT scan demonstrating a large, air-filled cyst adjacent to the sigmoid colon (Balloon sign). (A) Axial view, (B) Sagittal view.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1" id="lk0005"/></fig></p><p id="p0050">Given the patient's stable condition, oral antibiotic therapy with Amoxicillin (500&#x000a0;mg three times daily) and Metronidazole (400&#x000a0;mg three times daily) was initiated. A multidisciplinary team discussion between surgical and radiology teams maintained the initial diagnosis of contained perforation secondary to diverticulitis. Percutaneous drainage was considered but dismissed, as there was no evidence of fluid within the cavity. During this time, a PubMed literature search was conducted, raising suspicion of GCD as a possible diagnosis. This new information prompted reconsideration of the management plan, and the scheduled sigmoidoscopy was canceled due to concerns about the risk of perforating a dilated diverticulum.</p><p id="p0055">As conservative treatment is not recommended for GCD, the patient was taken to the operating theater five days after admission for exploratory surgery, conducted by two consultants. A midline laparotomy was performed due to the large size of the lesion, and revealed a large diverticular mass originating from the sigmoid colon, adherent to the greater omentum, with no evidence of intraperitoneal contamination (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). A Mini-Invasive approach was not considered feasible due the size of the lesion, which would require a large extraction site. After adhesiolysis, a segmental sigmoid resection with en-bloc excision of the GCD was performed, followed by a stapled, side-to-side anastomosis. The resected colon contained all visible diverticula, including multiple small diverticula (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Notably, one of the smaller diverticular openings communicated with the giant diverticulum. Upon inserting a dissection scissor into the narrow neck of this diverticulum, the trapped pressure was immediately released (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The postoperative period was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged four days after surgery.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Intraoperative image depicting the giant colonic diverticulum (Arrow) adherent to the sigmoid colon.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2" id="lk0010"/></fig><fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Resected sigmoid colon, opened along the mesenteric side, showing the large diverticulum (Arrow) attached to the colon on the anti-mesenteric side.

Although colonic diverticulosis is common, GCD is an uncommon manifestation that often goes undiagnosed until complications arise or detailed imaging and a thorough literature review lead to a more precise identification.</p><p id="p0075">GCD was first reported in the literature by Bonvin and Bonte in 1946, with the initial English-language description appearing in 1953 by Greene and Hughes. (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) Despite its association with diverticular disease, GCD is rare, affects men and women equally, and is usually identified in the seventh or eighth decade of life. (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) A systematic review by Nigri et al. in 2015 reported a mere 166 cases globally across 138 publications, emphasizing its rarity even within the context of a widely prevalent disease such as diverticulosis. (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</p><p id="p0080">The pathogenesis of GCD remains unclear, with two main theories proposed. The first is a &#x0201c;ball-valve&#x0201d; mechanism in which air becomes trapped within the diverticulum due to a narrow neck, resulting in progressive dilation of the diverticular cavity. (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) An alternative theory suggests that gas-forming bacteria within the diverticulum may contribute to its enlargement. (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) These mechanisms may operate synergistically in some cases, although further research is needed to confirm the specific processes involved.</p><p id="p0085">Histologically, GCD can be classified into three types as proposed by McNutt et al. in 1988: (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).<list list-type="simple" id="l0010"><list-item id="li0030"><label>1.</label><p id="p0090"><italic>Pseudo-Giant Colonic Diverticulum</italic>: Arises from gradual enlargement of a diverticulum without perforation and may contain remnants of muscularis mucosa or propria.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0035"><label>2.</label><p id="p0095"><italic>Inflammatory Giant Colonic Diverticulum</italic>: Develops secondary to a focal mucosal and submucosal perforation, resulting in the development of a fibrous scar cavity.

(<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</p><p id="p0140">CT imaging is the preferred diagnostic modality for GCD due to its high sensitivity and ability to detect colonic diverticula and potential complications. (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) A typical feature of GCD is the &#x0201c;balloon sign&#x0201d;, characterized by a large gas-filled rounded structure adjacent to the colon, as observed in our case (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) Plain abdominal X-rays may reveal a large gas-filled structure adjacent to the colon, (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) while ultrasound is generally unhelpful and may yield misleading reassurance. (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) Colonoscopy is contraindicated, as it may cause perforation due to increased pressure and a valve like function within the GCD. (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</p><p id="p0145">Conservative management of GCD is generally not recommended, as delayed treatment may lead to serious complications, including adenocarcinoma within the diverticulum. (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) While nonsurgical therapies, such as antibiotic treatment or percutaneous drainage, have been proposed for patients unable to undergo surgery, surgical intervention remains the standard of care.

(<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) The preferred treatment is en-bloc resection of the GCD and adjacent colon, with primary anastomosis as performed in our case. (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) In high-risk or emergency settings, a Hartmann's procedure may be performed, although the literature indicates that segmental resection with primary anastomosis has the highest success rate. (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) A simple diverticulectomy has been reported in the literature; however, it is associated with a high rate of recurrence and leaks, making it a less favorable option for management.
