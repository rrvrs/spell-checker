Rates of self-reported infection increased significantly during the first 4&#x000a0;years of treatment. Infection rates were not only associated with total immunoglobulin levels but also independently associated with age, comorbidity and female sex. We demonstrated for the first time that 29 out of 34 (87%) people on ocrelizumab with IgG in the lower normal range had sub-protective antibody responses to pneumococcus / haemophilus influenzae.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">Real-world observational studies complement open label extensions of clinical trials, often by having a more representative cohort and more complete follow-up. Our data suggest that while serious infections are rare in people on ocrelizumab, non-serious infections become increasingly burdensome.

A key challenge facing patients and clinicians in neurology is how to quantify and mitigate risks associated with the long-term use of high-efficacy immunotherapies in lifelong conditions. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are now among the most commonly prescribed DMTs for MS. Phase 3 clinical trials show a favorable efficacy and safety profile for ocrelizumab and ofatumumab in people with MS (pwMS) over 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Rituximab is used off-label in some countries on the basis of favorable Phase 2 and observational data in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], although this practice has not been adopted in the UK. However, the lack of representation of vulnerable characteristics such as age, disability and comorbidity in clinical trial cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and the non-random dropouts in open label extension studies with potential survivorship bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], mean that real-world data on anti-CD20 safety will provide important complementary information.</p><p id="Par7">Observational data on a large cohort of pwMS treated with rituximab recently showed that cumulative rituximab exposure was associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia and infection. However, low IgG explained &#x0003c;&#x02009;20% of the risk of infection associated with cumulative dosing; other risk factors included age, disability and comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ocrelizumab, ofatumumab and ublituximab are newer to the market and have been subjected to fewer real-world observational studies. Cumulative hypogammaglobulinaemia was observed in clinical trials of ocrelizumab and ofatumumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, real-world data on infection risk in people on ocrelizumab or ofatumumab are relatively scarce, and the relationship between hypogammaglobulinaemia and infection seems inconsistent across studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This discordance may reflect the relevance of other factors such as comorbidity, disability and age, and may also reflect methodological considerations such as a focus on serious versus non-serious infection, and short duration of follow-up and/or treatment exposure. An improved understanding of risks associated with DMTs will allow better prediction, detection and focused mitigation.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we report longitudinal trends of serum immunoglobulin and infections in a well-characterized cohort of pwMS receiving ocrelizumab.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design, setting and population</title><p id="Par9">A population-based MS observational study in Wales has been studied prospectively since 1999 with Research Ethics Committee approval (Ethics REC Ref: 05/WSE03/111, 19/WA/0289).

Data on BMI, smoking status and co-morbidity were taken from the timepoint closest to Dose 1 of ocrelizumab. Since 2019, all patients attending for ocrelizumab infusion were systematically questioned about infections experienced since their previous infusion (or in the previous 6&#x000a0;months at baseline) at each infusion attendance. Participants were asked to report any infective episodes, use of anti-microbials and/or hospitalization for infection. These self-reported data were then cross-referenced with primary and secondary care electronic health records.

Unlike renal and rheumatological disease where short-term anti-CD20 treatment is often used to induce remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], sustained use of antiCD20 is standard practice in MS. Here we have shown a duration-dependent effect of ocrelizumab treatment on both hypogammaglobulinaemia and risk of infection during the first 4&#x000a0;years of treatment. Our data suggest that factors including age and co-morbidity may increase the risk of hypogammaglobulinaemia, but that age, co-morbidity and immunoglobulins also have independent associations with infection risk. Respiratory and urinary tract infections accounted for most infections experienced on ocrelizumab. People with IgG in the lower part of the normal range had a high incidence of sub-protective IgG titres to community respiratory pathogens. In a small subset who had extended-interval dosing of ocrelizumab, there was a suggestion of reduced rate of IgM and IgG decline.</p><p id="Par20">Our data confirm previous reports that ocrelizumab is associated with a duration-dependent decline of immunglobulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but we have also revealed a duration-dependent increase in infection rate. Infection rates remained low overall but almost doubled from year-1 to year-4 of ocrelizumab therapy. We found that the presence of comorbidities (some of which could be modified or optimized) were associated with immunoglobulin decline, and that higher age and comorbidities also independently associated with higher infection risk. Other groups have also identified age, disability and comorbidities as risk factors for hypogammaglobulinaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], while on ocrelizumab treatment. We did not find an association between disability and infection, but this may have reflected the low disability levels in our cohort [median (IQR) EDSS 2.0 (2.0&#x02013;3.0)] The association between age and comorbidity with infection risk is relevant since our real-world cohort was older and had more comorbidity than the OPERA I and II clinical trial cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While BMI has not been widely studied as a risk factor for hypogammaglobulinaemia, one other group have reported an association between high BMI and adverse infection outcomes in pwMS on ocrelizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The importance of hypogammaglobulinaemia as a risk factor for infection in secondary antibody deficiency is increasingly being recognized in other settings such as haematologic malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Low IgG has been demonstrated by several groups to be a risk factor for infection in people receiving rituximab for MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This study provides further support for this association extending to other newer anti-CD20 s. Safety evaluation of pooled data from the pivotal ocrelizumab clinical trials demonstrated a relationship between low IgG and higher risk of serious infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recently, evaluation of a similar dataset from 13 ocrelizumab clinical trials showed an association between low IgM and rates of all (including non-serious) infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between total IgM and infection, while the relationship between IgG and infection was of borderline significance. People with selective IgM deficiency in other settings are known to be commonly susceptible to bacterial infections such as otitis media, chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, cellulitis, supporting the potential clinical relevance of acquired IgM deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], whereas people with selective IgA deficiency are usually asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The stronger association of IgM with infection may also reflect the tendency for IgM to fall earlier and more precipitously than IgG or IgA, giving us greater power to detect this early effect. This suggests that IgM may be a useful marker of functional impairment of humoral immunity, even before decline in IgA or IgG occur. There is mechanistic support for hypogammaglobilnaemia contributing to infection risk; in primary antibody deficiency, persistent/chronic (often non-serious) infections cause considerable burden and negative impact on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The lack of a discernible relationship between Ig and infection in some ocrelizumab cohorts may relate to factors including a focus on serious infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], short duration of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], or the tendency to consider IgM and IgG as binary variables (above or below the lower limit of normal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which may over-simplify humoral protection. Disease-specific IgG tires have been recommended to assess as valuable adjuncts in assessing the severity of primary and secondary antibody deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We found that people with IgG in the low normal range (6&#x02013;8 g/L) frequently demonstrated sub-protective humoral immunity to pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae.</p><p id="Par22">The most common types of infection <italic>before</italic> the onset of ocrelizumab were urinary tract infections whereas respiratory infections and skin infections had become prominent by the end of follow-up. Urinary, respiratory and skin infections all occur at higher incidence in people with MS versus age- and sex-matched non-MS controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but the change in the proportion of infection types over time suggests that humoral immunity impairment may reshape the pattern of infections experienced in MS. Interestingly, we and other groups have found higher rates of infection in women versus men with MS on ocrelizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and others have demonstrated this effect in the overall population of people with MS versus age-matched matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our cohort, this difference seemed to be driven by higher reports of respiratory tract infections in women (Supplementary Table 1).</p><p id="Par23">Extending the interval of ocrelizumab or rituximab dosing to mitigate the risk of hypogammaglobulinaemia and/or infection has been proposed, with some limited data to support a beneficial effect in people receiving ocrelizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In our cohort, a small sub-sample of patients commenced extended interval dosing in the face of either hypogammaglobulinaemia and/or burdensome infections. There was a signal that this had a favorable effect on hypogammaglobulinaemia, but sample size was too small for statistical evaluation.</p><p id="Par24">The mean rate of infections recorded in our study (171 per 100PY) was higher than reports from the long-term follow-up of ocrelizumab clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There are several reasons that could account for this difference, including our cohort being older, more disabled and with higher levels of comorbidity. However, data collection methods may also play a role. Under-reporting of adverse events is common in clinical trials; it has been estimated that only 1&#x02013;10% of adverse events are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Indeed, ocrelizumab clinical trial data show high baseline infection rates with a considerable early drop that suggests a decrease in the vigilance in the recording of infections over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our data suggest that self-reported infection rates correlate moderately with data on antimicrobial prescribing captured in primary or secondary care records. Discrepancies likely arise due to factors including lack of prescribing for presumed viral infections versus prescribing of several courses of antibiotics for a single persistent infection, and variations in the consulting and prescribing practice of patients and clinicians, respectively. While it is possible that patients in our cohort were over-reporting infections, we used an approach analogous to the symptom-diary and records review used for recording and categorizing adverse-events in clinical trials. We suspect that by focusing our 6-monthly enquiry on infections, and educating patients about the potential associations, we have been more sensitive to detecting non-serious, but potentially burdensome, community infections.</p><p id="Par25">Our data allow us to make practical suggestions to mitigate risks for pwMS receiving maintenance anti-CD20 therapies. Prior to commencing treatment, we recommend pwMS and all household contacts are up-to-date with vaccines according to appropriate national vaccination schedules. There may be a future role for expanding this to include additional individualized vaccination of pwMS at baseline based on measures of their humoral immunity to community pathogens such as pneumococcus and haemophilus. We would recommend optimizing respiratory and urinary tract function where relevant e.g., bladder emptying, underlying lung disease. In particular, based on the association of smoking with lower Ig, we recommend discussing this where relevant and offering access to dedicated smoking cessation services. We routinely check total immunoglobulins before each anti-CD20 dose in line with the Summary of Product Characteristics for ocrelizumab that suggests checking &#x0201c;the patient's immune status before dosing since severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., with lymphopenia, neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia) should not be treated.&#x0201d; Our own practice is to consider results of total serum IgG and IgM in the context of recent infection burden. To facilitate this, we have embedded monitoring of infections into routine assessment for pwMS attending for anti-CD20 treatment, mandating that healthcare professionals document any infections, antimicrobial use or hospitalisations since the previous treatment. In individuals with isolated hypogammaglobulinaemia (without a significant recent burden of infection), we consider continuing treatment but provide education for patients and primary care physicians about the need to report infections and collect relevant samples (e.g., sputum, throat swab, urine) for microbiological evaluation. We recommend providing relevant sample collection pots/swabs for people experiencing a high burden of infections to keep at home, to overcome unnecessary barriers in accessing diagnostics. In patients on antiCD20 with serum IgG &#x0003c;&#x02009;8 g/L we check disease specific serum IgG to pneumococcus and haemophilus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and recommend vaccination in the presence of sub-protective titres where vaccines have not already been performed within the last 6&#x000a0;months. In people with hypogammaglobulinaemia and burdensome infection (e.g., requiring frequent time off regular duties and/or regular courses of antimicrobials), we revisit the optimisation of underlying organ function, and consider antiCD20 interruption, extension of antiCD20 dosing interval or switching to an alternative DMT with a different mechanism of action. In the rare case of burdensome infections, hypogammaglobulinaemia and a lack of alternative DMT options, we would consider strategies such as prophylactic antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy and discussion with Immunology.</p><p id="Par26">The main limitation to this study is the relatively small sample-size, which precluded a more detailed breakdown of infection patterns within sub-cohorts. However, this is balanced by complete data on patient-outcomes (avoiding the problem of non-random dropouts in clinical trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. </p><p id="Par27">In conclusion, in this real-world cohort of pwMS on ocrelizumab we found a doubling of infection rate during the first 4&#x000a0;years of ocrelizumab treatment. Infections were mainly non-serious urinary, skin and respiratory tract infections, that were partially explained by hypogammaglobulinaemia, age and co-morbidity. These data support vigilant monitoring of infection-burden in people receiving anti-CD20 and highlights the need for further research into strategies to mitigate risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="415_2025_13133_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 212 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The complete raw dataset is not publicly available to preserve individuals&#x02019; privacy under the European General Data Protection Regulation.
