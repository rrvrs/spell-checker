A mixed methods design was applied. Patients with axSpA who visited the outpatient clinic with active disease (AxSpA Disease Activity Score [ASDAS]&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2.1), but did not receive a treatment adjustment, were identified. These patient cases were discussed in individual semi-structured interviews with the respective treating rheumatologists, and a subgroup of these patients was also interviewed. In parallel, all interviewed participants completed a quantitative survey. Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed thematically and descriptively, respectively. Twenty-three patients were discussed with 11 rheumatologists, and 16 of these patients were interviewed personally. Barriers to T2T included challenges in the measurement of inflammatory disease activity using the ASDAS, and numerous patient-related factors such as concern about treatment adaptations. The limited number of viable treatment options and scarce amount of evidence supporting T2T in axSpA, as well as logistical challenges, were additional obstacles. Facilitators included patients&#x02019; broad knowledge about axSpA, rheumatologists&#x02019; awareness of T2T recommendations, and positive doctor-patient relationships with the application of shared decision-making. Moreover, a supporting infrastructure, such as one with high accessibility to the outpatient clinic between scheduled visits, was considered necessary for the application of a T2T strategy. In conclusion, numerous barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a T2T strategy in axSpA are present, which need to be considered when applying this treatment approach in clinical practice.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00296-025-05795-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Axial spondyloarthritis</kwd><kwd>Attitude of health personnel</kwd><kwd>Attitude to health</kwd><kwd>Delivery of health care</kwd><kwd>Quality of health care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Novartis</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), the adequate management of disease activity is important to maintain the physical and psychosocial functioning of patients, and to prevent complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between persistent disease and the progression of irreversible structural damage, increased use of healthcare resources, and higher societal costs due to reduced work productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">In view of these considerations, a treatment approach that has gained increasing attention is the &#x02018;treat-to-target&#x02019; (T2T) strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This approach firstly entails determining a treatment target, typically inactive disease (ID) or low disease activity (LDA), and the swift initiation of pharmacological therapy as necessary. Subsequently, the target is regularly evaluated (&#x02018;tight control&#x02019;), and treatment is adapted until the target is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Throughout, the rheumatologist employs shared decision-making (SDM) with the patient to ensure that treatment targets align with the patient&#x02019;s preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Successful implementation of a T2T strategy therefore requires synergy between patients, rheumatologists, and the organisation of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis, T2T strategies have been effective in improving patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In axSpA, however, evidence remains inconclusive. Most notably, the Tight Control in Spondyloarthritis (TICOSPA) trial, which compared a T2T strategy aiming for LDA with usual care in patients with axSpA, did not reach its primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nonetheless, numerous secondary endpoints showed a general trend in favour of this T2T strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As such, several international recommendations endorse the application of T2T strategies in axSpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Even with the increased recognition of the potential value of a T2T strategy in axSpA, application in clinical practice is suboptimal. Illustratively, a Dutch observational study reported that while disease activity data were available for 84% of the axSpA patient population, only 38% had achieved ID/LDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, another study highlighted that agreement with T2T recommendations amongst rheumatologists in the context of RA did not necessarily translate into implementation in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Currently, knowledge about factors driving this discordance is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To facilitate successful implementation, a better understanding of elements that limit the application of a T2T strategy (barriers), and enabling factors that are already present in clinical practice (facilitators), is necessary. This study therefore aimed to explore the perceptions of patients and rheumatologists about a T2T strategy in axSpA, and to identify the barriers and facilitators associated with its implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par6">This study applied a convergent parallel mixed methods design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Both patients with axSpA and their treating rheumatologists from two Dutch hospitals (Maastricht University Medical Centre+&#x02009;and Sint Maartenskliniek) were invited for an individual, semi-structured interview, and to complete a supplementary quantitative survey immediately afterwards.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par7">Inclusion took place between October 2023 and April 2024. All patients of the participating centres who visited the rheumatology outpatient clinic were screened against the following inclusion criteria: (1) clinical diagnosis of axSpA, (2) an ASDAS indicating active disease (&#x02265;&#x02009;2.1) calculated during an in-person consultation, and (3) no treatment adaptations made by the treating rheumatologist during that consultation, despite an ASDAS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2.1. Treatment adaptation was defined as a change to the dose or frequency of existing anti-inflammatory drugs, or a switch to, or addition of, a new anti-inflammatory drug.</p><p id="Par8">Interviews were planned with both the treating rheumatologists of the identified patients and a subgroup of these patients (those who were willing to participate) at the earliest possible opportunity after the in-person consultation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Qualitative data</title><p id="Par9">Separate interview guides for patients and rheumatologists were developed (Online Resource 1 and 2). Interviews with patients focused on their individual disease characteristics, current treatment, knowledge of the T2T strategy, and views on SDM. Rheumatologists were interviewed on their (shared) decision-making process regarding treatment adaptations, centred specifically on their patients who had also been interviewed. To ensure that a sufficient number and variety of patients were covered, several additional (non-participating) patients that the included rheumatologists had recently seen at the outpatient clinic who met the inclusion criteria were also discussed. Prior to the interviews, rheumatologists were informed about the patients to be discussed to allow for adequate preparation.</p><p id="Par10">All participants were interviewed by one researcher (MS) not involved in the patients&#x02019; care. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Analysis started with the reading and re-reading of all transcripts to gain familiarity with the contents. Thematic analysis was then performed by the same researcher who conducted the interviews according to grounded theory using NVivo V.14 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Burlington, MA, USA), in ongoing collaboration with the research team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This entailed the inductive coding of key concepts, followed by the organisation of the codes into themes from which conclusions were formed. Finally, representative quotes were selected to illustrate the findings, with reference to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Quantitative data</title><p id="Par11">Separate surveys for patients and rheumatologists were composed (Online Resource 3 and 4).

[&#x02026;] But I find it difficult to switch, if you read about the side effects that other patients had&#x02026; I do not look forward to that. [&#x02026;] If you try something new and it does not work, then you have to go back to the old medication anyway.&#x0201d;</p><p>P5: &#x0201c;It is not that bad, the fluctuations [in disease activity] come every half year in the same way.&#x0201d;</p><p>P6: &#x0201c;I have had [no medication] in the last years.

In patients where the rheumatologist found the ASDAS to be falsely elevated and therefore not an indication to intensify treatment, inaccuracies in <italic>disease activity measurement</italic> was a prominent theme. Conversely, in patients where the rheumatologist agreed with the ASDAS indicating active disease and considered treatment adaptations, obstruction by <italic>patient-related factors</italic> or the <italic>limited treatment options and evidence</italic> available to support a T2T strategy in axSpA were highlighted. In addition, <italic>logistical challenges</italic> was a theme applicable to both subgroups.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Disease activity measurement</title><p id="Par21">Challenges in accurately measuring disease activity using the ASDAS were emphasised. Particularly, numerous patients reported both during the interviews and in the survey (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10/16, 62.5%) that their input on disease activity questionnaires was often influenced by comorbidities with overlapping symptoms (Quote P1). This resulted in frequent discrepancies between the ASDAS and the rheumatologist&#x02019;s clinical impression, instilling doubts on the ability of the ASDAS to discern inflammatory from non-inflammatory symptoms and provide sufficient insight into actual disease activity (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8/11, 72.7%) (Quote R1). Considering that non-inflammatory comorbidities, such as pain sensitisation syndromes, may present with symptoms that resemble axSpA manifestations (e.g. enthesitis-like symptoms), it was mentioned that using scoring instruments to make this differentiation is particularly challenging in patients with axSpA. To illustrate the magnitude of some of these discrepancies, in certain cases, a de-escalation of therapy was even considered despite an ASDAS indicating active disease due to the absence of inflammatory symptoms on clinical examination. This also relates to concerns expressed by rheumatologists in the survey on the established cut-off values (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10/11, 90.9%). Therefore, even though rheumatologists acknowledged the value of using (individual components of) the ASDAS for longitudinal monitoring and to aid treatment decisions (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8/11, 72.7%), especially in the early stages of disease management, achieving a low ASDAS was rarely the sole treatment target pursued for the patients discussed (Quote R2). Rheumatologists preferred to base decisions on their own clinical judgement instead (derived from the patients&#x02019; history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging results), and were reluctant to intensify treatment in the absence of objective manifestations or if a plausible alternative aetiology for the symptoms was present.</p><p id="Par22">An additional consideration was the temporal context of disease activity measurements. Patients reported experiencing frequent fluctuations in symptoms, making single ASDAS measurements not reflective of their overall condition. Furthermore, rheumatologists believed that treatment intensification would have been premature in patients who had recently started new drugs or were awaiting further diagnostics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patient-related factors</title><p id="Par23">The personal circumstances of patients were frequently central to the decision by rheumatologists to not intensify treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8/11, 72.7%). A common sentiment amongst patients was satisfaction with the status quo and the wish to continue with their existing treatment regimens (Quotes P2 and P3). As reflected by patients both during the interviews and in the survey, there was also concern about switching drugs, for instance due to previous negative experiences with treatment adaptations, doubts about the effectiveness of other drugs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4/16, 25.0%), or fear of side effects of new drugs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5/16, 31.3%) (Quote P4). Finally, patients often believed that axSpA flares were temporary and self-limiting (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12/16, 75.0%), making treatment intensification unwarranted (Quote P5). Overall, the majority (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13/16, 81.3%) of patients had no desire for treatment adaptations, some of whom expressed a definitive objection. Instead, several stated the preference for analgesics or non-pharmacological interventions to sustain an acceptable symptom state (Quote P6). In such scenarios, rheumatologists were inclined to follow the patient&#x02019;s lead, provided that the risks of forgoing treatment intensification were acceptable (Quote R3).</p><p id="Par24">Another obstacle was patients&#x02019; limited knowledge on the rationale of the T2T strategy and treatment goals. Rheumatologists noted that these topics were rarely discussed explicitly during consultations, and experienced challenges in educating patients on these aspects, particularly in the early stages of disease management when patients might feel overwhelmed (Quote R4). Additionally, patients with underlying learning disabilities or psychiatric comorbidities sometimes had difficulty understanding, or were less receptive to, new treatment-related explanations and instructions. As such, some patients&#x02013; especially those who considered their symptoms acceptable despite an elevated ASDAS&#x02013; found tight control unnecessary. Having infrequent follow-up appointments, combined with the possibility to contact the outpatient clinic if needed in-between, was perceived as sufficient by them (Quote P7).</p><p id="Par25">Finally, objective health-related factors, such as drug intolerances, complicated the disease management of some patients and limited the execution of a T2T strategy as well (Quote R5).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limited treatment options and evidence</title><p id="Par26">The limited number of pharmacological treatment options available for axSpA was emphasised by rheumatologists, which led to reluctance to rapidly cycle between different drugs to avoid exhausting all alternatives (Quote R6). As highlighted both during the interviews and in the survey, limited evidence available to support a T2T strategy in axSpA further reinforced this reluctance (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10/11, 90.9%), as well as scepticism about the benefits of aggressive treatment on patient outcomes (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8/11, 72.7%). Based on their previous experiences in treating axSpA, rheumatologists did not believe that deviating from T2T recommendations would necessarily lead to undertreatment or poorer outcomes (Quote R7).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Logistical challenges</title><p id="Par27">Rheumatologists reflected that time pressure and capacity shortages at the outpatient clinic led to inability to consistently apply all components of T2T, such as the regular evaluation of specific treatment goals (Quote R8). This is consistent with the survey, where rheumatologists expressed doubts on the applicability (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6/11, 54.5%), feasibility (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8/11, 72.7%) and flexibility (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7/11, 63.6%) of a T2T strategy in practice. Additionally, rheumatologists found their current electronic medical records (EMRs) unsuitable for the longitudinal monitoring of disease activity scores and the recording and tracking of treatment goals (Quote R9). Applying a T2T strategy was, therefore, not embedded in the routines of rheumatologists, and the majority expressed low motivation to do so (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6/11, 54.5%). Finally, one patient who was under treatment by multiple specialists (due to the presence of extra-musculoskeletal manifestations) found that care was not always well-coordinated, leading to difficulties in adapting treatment plans (Quote P8).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Facilitators of T2T</title><p id="Par28">Three themes pertaining to facilitators were identified, relating to patients&#x02019; <italic>knowledge</italic> about axSpA and rheumatologists&#x02019; <italic>awareness</italic> of the T2T strategy, positive <italic>doctor-patient relationships</italic>, and availability of a <italic>supporting infrastructure</italic> at the outpatient clinic.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Knowledge and awareness</title><p id="Par29">Patients expressed having broad knowledge about axSpA, particularly on manifestations indicating active disease, enabling constructive discussions between patients and their healthcare providers (Quote P9). This insight was facilitated by explanations provided by healthcare providers (often shortly after diagnosis) and the proactive attitude demonstrated by certain patients.</p><p id="Par30">Rheumatologists were largely familiar with T2T recommendations (high awareness: 45.5% [<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5/11], moderate awareness: 54.5% [<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6/11]), and the majority had trust in its developers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8/11, 72.7%). Consistent with T2T recommendations, all rheumatologists strived for clinically inactive disease in their patients (albeit not necessarily according to the ASDAS), with attention for quality of life in particular.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Doctor-patient relationships</title><p id="Par31">The robust collaboration between patients and rheumatologists was underscored. Patients experienced high involvement of rheumatologists in their care and trusted their expertise. This translated into willingness to follow their rheumatologist&#x02019;s advice, as long as sufficient justification was provided. Particularly, patients viewed compliance with professional advice as being in their own interest, and were therefore open to tight(er) control if deemed medically necessary (Quote P10).</p><p id="Par32">In addition, positive doctor-patient relationships facilitated constructive SDM. While rheumatologists reflected that not all patients were equipped or motivated to actively participate in SDM, it was still considered a necessary component of consultations (e.g. to provide explanations and discuss patient opinions) (Quote R10). Likewise, patients indicated a widespread preference for SDM over a paternalistic approach, albeit guided by the rheumatologist&#x02019;s expertise (Quote P11). In practice, both patients and rheumatologists felt that SDM had been well-implemented, which in turn contributed to further strengthening of doctor-patient relationships with time, and reassured patients that their personal concerns were taken seriously (Quote P12).</p><p id="Par33">Finally, one rheumatologist highlighted collaboration with informal caregivers in the SDM process as a pivotal supporting factor, particularly to encourage compliance (Quote R11).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Supporting infrastructure</title><p id="Par34">Certain modalities available for disease monitoring were emphasised as beneficial. Patients highly appreciated having continuity of care and the ability to contact the outpatient clinic between consultations. Additionally, some patients recognised the benefits of using disease activity questionnaires as an assisting tool, provided they were addressed during consultations. While it was mentioned during the interviews that scores were frequently biased and therefore required contextualisation with the patient&#x02019;s history (as highlighted in the theme &#x02018;Disease activity measurement&#x02019;), patients expressed in the survey that these instruments were, to a certain extent, still reflective of their current condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12/16, 75.0%). Finally, the availability of digital resources and possibility for consultations with rheumatology nurses to offer further guidance on the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, non-pharmacological therapies, and lifestyle was valued (Quote P13).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">In this study, challenges in using the ASDAS, and numerous patient-related factors such as concern about treatment adaptations, were identified as key barriers to T2T in axSpA. The limited number of viable treatment options and scarce amount of evidence supporting a T2T strategy in axSpA, as well as logistical challenges, were additional obstacles. Conversely, facilitators included patients&#x02019; broad knowledge about axSpA, rheumatologists&#x02019; awareness of T2T recommendations, positive doctor-patient relationships, and the presence of a supporting infrastructure.</p><p id="Par36">Taking into account the substantial barriers identified, it is worth reflecting on the practicality and desirability of a T2T strategy in axSpA&#x02013; a dilemma already highlighted by previous studies and certain treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In particular, the concern held by patients about treatment adjustments when symptoms were considered acceptable (despite incomplete suppression of disease activity) is a barrier that we observed which aligns with past studies on T2T implementation in rheumatology practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, the barriers posed by interfering biological or psychosocial factors noted in this study, such as drug intolerances, fear of side effects of new drugs and low receptiveness to new instructions, have been described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The limited organisational capacity to execute a T2T strategy in rheumatology practice must also not be overlooked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These challenges are further compounded by the lack of definitive evidence demonstrating that a T2T strategy is beneficial in axSpA, especially when combined with the suggestion from previous studies that aggressive treatment is not always necessary to maximise patient health. For example, the association between radiographic progression and functional impairment is unclear, inferring that a T2T strategy might not necessarily result in better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Given these fundamental concerns, it is uncertain whether the current form of the T2T strategy is optimal in axSpA, or if a modified approach, such as a dual-target strategy where symptom-guided treatment is emphasised alongside attaining biological remission, should take preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Irrespective of which strategy future guidelines endorse, it is crucial for successful implementation that all stakeholders agree on the chosen approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Another evident dilemma in the management of axSpA is determining how treatment targets should be measured. While it is logical that disease activity should be considered (with ID/LDA as the preferred target), rheumatologists acknowledged that achieving this goal as currently defined (i.e. ASDAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.1) is not always feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This is consistent with the outcomes of randomised controlled trials on bDMARDs in axSpA, which have highlighted that achieving an ASDAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.1 might be unrealistic for many patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Difficulty in achieving a low ASDAS may, for example, be attributed to the high occurrence of symptoms such as non-inflammatory pain and stiffness even after inflammation has subsided, or to activity of overlapping comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is known that patients struggle to discern inflammatory from non-inflammatory complaints, leading to inconsistent ASDAS outputs, as we also observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Consequently, in the absence of objective symptoms, or if the symptom state is acceptable in the patient&#x02019;s perspective, rheumatologists remain cautious to base decisions solely on the ASDAS and similar composite scores, as this approach may oversimplify the multifaceted and heterogeneous nature of axSpA and lead to the risk of overtreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These limitations in the ASDAS suggest the need to re-evaluate the definition and assessment of active disease in axSpA in the context of T2T.</p><p id="Par38">Reassuringly, several factors that could enable the successful implementation of a (form of the) T2T strategy in axSpA are already in place. Similar to previous findings in RA, patients&#x02019; broad knowledge about axSpA and positive doctor-patient relationships are particularly beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Interestingly, while past studies identified low familiarity with T2T recommendations amongst rheumatologists as a barrier, our results contradict this, as awareness was generally high in our cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. While this awareness may be attributed to increasing attention on T2T strategies in recent years, and the fact that this study was conducted at SpA and T2T expertise centres, this is nonetheless an encouraging finding. Overall, if a T2T strategy is to be endorsed as the way forward, these are examples of facilitators that should be leveraged.</p><p id="Par39">The primary strength of this study is that it is, to our knowledge, the first specifically designed to explore the barriers and facilitators to a T2T strategy in axSpA in clinical practice, leading to relevant and applicable findings. Furthermore, our mixed methods design included both patients and rheumatologists, allowing for diverse perspectives to be captured. Finally, the clinical setting of this study, combined with its multicentre design with comparable findings in both participating hospitals, make our results generalisable to Dutch rheumatology practice. However, several limitations should also be acknowledged. Firstly, the time between the consultation and interview was delayed by a few weeks for some participants, which may have introduced recall bias. Secondly, the mean symptom duration of the patients who participated was considerably long. It is therefore plausible that the prevalence of non-inflammatory symptoms from structural damage or degenerative disorders in our cohort was relatively high, possibly leading to an overemphasis on certain barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Lastly, as only stakeholders from the Netherlands were included, our findings may not be equally applicable to other countries.</p><p id="Par40">Despite these limitations, our results provide deeper insights into the applicability of a T2T strategy in axSpA from a real-world perspective. Our findings may also inform future research on several aspects. Firstly, it needs to be determined if a T2T strategy is effective in axSpA through additional clinical trials. Secondly, EMRs that are better suited to facilitate a T2T strategy need to be developed (e.g. with added functionality such as automated collection of patient-reported outcomes and tracking of treatment goals through user-friendly, personalised mobile apps integrated within hospital EMRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Thirdly, future studies should explore how patient education regarding the importance of adequate disease management can be enhanced, and which methods can be used to more effectively engage patients in the application of T2T strategies (e.g. in the determination of treatment goals and follow-up frequency). Ideally, such guidance strategies should also account for contextual factors which may influence the disease management process of individual patients, including factors that were not investigated in the present study such as level of educational attainment. Improvements in this regard could lead to better compliance and satisfaction with care amongst patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Finally, the subgroups of patients who face obstacles in the application of a T2T strategy, such as those with factors that interfere with disease activity assessment or patients with &#x02018;difficult-to-manage&#x02019; disease, should be investigated further to enable individualised and effective disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In conclusion, numerous barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a T2T strategy in axSpA are present. These factors need to be considered in the future when applying T2T strategies in practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
