</xref> Moreover, all the 14 national experts agreed that there is a great need for this kind of information in Egypt to support and improve the health&#x02010;care system, especially because we lack any sort of information regarding the geriatric population.

Four experts discussed how the policy&#x02010;making process could benefit from having accurate national data of the patients, their distribution, and their characteristics. They also highlighted how this information could support the planning process in terms of allocation of services, budgeting, and developing the general health plan.</p></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0200"><label>3.2.1.2</label><title>Determining the type of registry for Egypt</title><p>Dementia registries have several types that depend on the focus or objectives of the registry, including research registries, quality of care registries, and epidemiological registries.<xref rid="alz70011-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> Determining the type of registry that is most needed in Egypt is an essential step that will guide the whole planning, design, and implementation process. All the interviewed experts who discussed registry functions agreed that registries providing data on the incidence and prevalence of the disease would help initiate more research studies. Researchers should have evidence from the country that states the disease situation so that they can prioritize working on some areas and be able to predict the disease or have valid data that support their studies. Considering that will help researchers investigate the causes and determinants of the disease that led to the exacerbation of the problem in one area.</p><p>In addition, having a solid registry plays a critical role in improving the clinical care of patients and improving the quality of the services provided to them. Assessing the data of patients with dementia and tracking the outcomes of used interventions help health&#x02010;care providers identify the needs of patients and improve the services provided to them. In Egypt, the health&#x02010;care system does not depend that much on the general practitioners putting all the hectic process of identifying and diagnosing patients on the shoulders of the specialists or consultants. This, in turn, leads to the increase of non&#x02010;detection or late detection of cases. A registry is important for organizing the structure of this work and putting basic investigation measures into place that will facilitate the process of diagnosis.</p><p>Hence, all interviewed experts on this issue (20 experts) agreed that although a quality&#x02010;of&#x02010;care registry is the most needed one to benefit the patient, which is the ultimate goal of any health&#x02010;care&#x02013;related initiative, a combined model that also includes data for research would be of benefit in terms of attracting and convincing the stakeholders to participate.</p></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0210"><label>3.2.1.3</label><title>Registry data management</title><p>Conflicting opinions emerged regarding the data sources that should be used to assist the data collection process in the early stages of developing the registry. Yet, six international experts indicated the importance of depending on the network of clinicians for collecting cases, especially in the beginning to facilitate the process of the pilot's initiation while avoiding barriers. Although a comprehensive registry that includes everything about the patients might be ideal, all experts agreed that for the registry to be established, only functional and effective data should be included. This means that only data items that provide information relevant to the disease or could benefit the association with the disease diagnosis and management should be added in the beginning. Further expansion to include more data items providing more information about the patients can then occur based on the primary outcomes of the established registry. All international experts advised to consider the well&#x02010;established international registries, look at the minimum datasets they use to compare them and be able to formulate the most appropriate setting that suits the Egyptian health&#x02010;care system and culture. Yet, it is crucial to carefully design a data collection form that includes all the required data questions to be filled in as identified from the minimum data set, and the questions that should be asked to the patient or caregivers if needed.</p><p>Moreover, all experts who discussed access to data (eight experts) stressed the importance of setting up a clear data access plan to set clear policies and regulations that control the access of registry users to patients&#x02019; data in a way that guarantees the security and privacy of data. The main idea is to provide access to requesters for only specific items that satisfy their purpose. In addition, confidentiality and privacy of patients&#x02019; data were also raised during the discussions as the major ethical concerns to protect the participating patients. Five experts highlighted the ethical regulations that control data sharing and privacy and the varied ways of protecting data privacy through only releasing aggregates of data to prevent any possible identification of a patient's case and through coding the data registered to hide all the personal information that could reveal the identity of the person. Yet, establishing proper guidelines and procedures for data management will ensure the privacy of patients, and hence, it should no longer be a concern.</p></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0220"><label>3.2.1.4</label><title>Registry implementation process: piloting and expansion</title><p>There is no available perfect model of dementia registries to follow, and most of the available registries were designed to satisfy their objectives.<xref rid="alz70011-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref> In addition, implementing a national registry is a complex and expensive process. Yet, a limited database will not be sufficient for the urgent needs of any stakeholders in the dementia field. Consequently, phasing the registry to start with a small pilot will help evaluate the process and modify the protocol accordingly. Most of the national and all international experts agreed on the importance of dividing the implementation of the registry into phases, starting with a pilot on few collaborating centers and then expanding it into a national setting.</p><p>Moreover, all experts noted that researchers and clinicians should be included in the registry development process as main stakeholders and potential end&#x02010;users. The discussion was raised on who else should be involved, especially from the high authorities. Four experts agreed on the importance of involving the Ministry of Health as one of the potential partners that should collaborate as government bodies to influence the process. The Ministry of Social Solidarity is also a potential partner, as they have the mandate of providing social care for elderly individuals. Two experts also suggested the inclusion of Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics in the process, as they would be a beneficial partner when collecting population&#x02010;based data. In addition, patients and caregivers should be included in the development process to consider their input and opinions while establishing the registry plan.</p></sec></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0230"><label>3.2.2</label><title>Registry governance and operation</title><p>The proper governance structure of the registry, together with an oversight plan, are significant steps that guide the high&#x02010;level engagement of the registry and ensure the attainment of the main purpose.<xref rid="alz70011-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref> Accordingly, we raised discussions on multiple aspects related to the registry governance, including the process of initiating the registry, the governance structure of the registry that guarantees its functionality, as well as funding and sustainability issues.</p><sec id="alz70011-sec-0240"><label>3.2.2.1</label><title>Governance structure</title><p>All experts agreed that an established governance plan is necessary early in the process to ensure the development of a registry that functionally satisfies the needs. Within a governance structure, there should be a clear assignment of the overall responsibility and accountability of all stakeholders and registry personnel to fulfill the domains and competencies of the registry's functionality and operation. The majority of experts (21 out of 24 interviewed experts on this matter) stated that a board that includes stakeholders&#x02019; representatives would be the optimal structure. Yet, the registry should be housed in an academic institution or a medical authority. Although the registry structure involves many parties, the registry data and the administrative house should be placed in one institution, then the representative personnel work closely with the other partners. Hence, the adoption of the government of the registry could impose some bureaucracy into the governance structure and the whole process, which should be avoided. Instead, experts highlighted that those who developed the registry would be more enthusiastic about keeping the functionality of the registry over time. So, the consensus that emerged was that an institution should take the lead in initiating the registry, which would help the progress of the implementation process.</p></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0250"><label>3.2.2.2</label><title>Funding and sustainability</title><p>Experts have linked the availability and stability of funds to the sustainability of the registry. Most of the registries that proved successful and sustainable over a prolonged time were the ones that secured funding. Yet, although securing funding is challenging initially, establishing a registry could be done with minimum costs when starting with a few sites from the institution's network. However, funding will be required during the further steps of expansion.</p></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0260"><label>3.2.2.3</label><title>Legal and ethical considerations</title><p>All experts noted that collecting patient data will require obtaining patient consent. An opt&#x02010;in or opt&#x02010;out consent is essential to guarantee voluntary patient participation and ensure patients&#x02019; ethical regulations and privacy. Introducing patients to the purpose of the study and informing them that their data will be anonymous is a way to help convince them to participate. In addition, experts mentioned the role of caregivers in signing the consent form in the case of severely demented patients, which indicates that the process of obtaining consent is essential. However, three of the international experts highlighted that the availability of a national or legal mandate to collect data for the benefit of the health&#x02010;care system is very beneficial, as the registries that follow these jurisdictions are not required to get consent for data collection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0270"><label>3.2.3</label><title>Challenges and barriers</title><sec id="alz70011-sec-0280"><label>3.2.3.1</label><title>Disease perception and diagnosis</title><p>All the experts discussed stigma as the main obstacle for dementia management as well as developing such a registry. The negative perceptions of people toward the disease and the lack of awareness makes it difficult to accept sharing data and information about the diagnosis. Hence, most of the patients only seek help when their cases are extremely deteriorated or in severe stages, which decreases the effectiveness of management plans.</p></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0290"><label>3.2.3.2</label><title>Follow&#x02010;ups and drop&#x02010;outs</title><p>Longitudinal follow&#x02010;ups and drop&#x02010;out of patients are also a challenge.

However, the 10 international experts indicated that following up with patients regularly on a yearly or 6&#x02010;month basis brings about many drop&#x02010;outs. The experts clarified that the drop out is either due to the death of patients, especially as most of them have deteriorated conditions; the patients did not visit the clinic for follow&#x02010;ups; or because the clinic did not enter the follow&#x02010;up data even though the patient visited them.</p></sec><sec id="alz70011-sec-0300"><label>3.2.3.3</label><title>Complex regulations and limited funding</title><p>Three experts expressed their concerns regarding the complex legislative structure in Egypt, which requires many security permissions prior to collecting national data. In some cases, collecting these kinds of data are considered a national security issue, as people fear releasing national data regarding population health.

</xref> Furthermore, involving NGOs in the initiation process could be useful in terms of providing access and funds. Nevertheless, after the initiation of the first step, the government should be involved in a formal context to enable the national expansion of the registry.</p><p>Yet, developing a national registry faces many challenges in disease perception, data collection, and regulatory complexities. Stigma associated with dementia as well as the involvement of multiple&#x000a0;medical specialties that the patients visit, often leads to delayed diagnosis, making it more challenging to identify and recruit patients. In addition, communication remains a hurdle, as careful encouragement and training are required for participating patients and health&#x02010;care providers. Logistical issues like manual documentation, high drop&#x02010;out rates for follow&#x02010;ups, and complex legislative requirements further hinder progress. Experts underscore that pilot phases, clear objectives, multi&#x02010;stakeholder collaboration, and sustainable funding are critical for success, as is involving health&#x02010;care providers, decision makers, and NGOs to build support for the registry.</p><p>Globally, dementia registries in high&#x02010;income countries provide frameworks for addressing key health issues, either to improve dementia quality of care as in the case of the Swedish Dementia registry (SveDem),<xref rid="alz70011-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Adopting the learning lessons from such models could help address challenges identified in the study as standardizing the data collection process, fostering the participation of clinical practitioners from the planning phase, and so on. In addition, aligning the registry goals with existing national health&#x02010;care policies, as seen in global models, could also enhance the feasibility and acceptance of establishing such a registry.</p><p>Additionally, considering previous comparable challenges faced by other low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries (LMICs) and the efforts to solve them would also offer valuable insights for the registry. For instance, prior South African efforts highlighted the role of community health workers in bridging health&#x02010;care gaps to manage non&#x02010;communicable diseases.<xref rid="alz70011-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Yet, these comparisons to LMICs underline how these countries faced challenges similar to the Egyptian context, including stigma, resource limitations, and workforce shortages.</p><p>While the Egyptian dementia registry initiative faces significant challenges, it also holds the potential to transform dementia care in Egypt. The registry offers the opportunity to inform national dementia strategies. The availability of comprehensive data could guide resource allocation, identify priorities, and support advocacy and fundraising campaigns. Additionally, by framing dementia as a public health priority, the registry could encourage the collaboration between stakeholders and avoid resistance, especially by engaging ministries, and educational and social institutions. Furthermore, addressing raised concerns about data governance through clear policies on confidentiality and security could also enhance stakeholders&#x02019; trust and participation.

Given the current direction of the government agenda and the increased focus on aging problems as well as big data analysis, it would seem to be an appropriate time for initiating this kind of registry.</p><p>The development of a national registry for dementia in Egypt is feasible, yet with some complications. In addition, the numerous benefits and functions of the registry would make the investment worthwhile. Although the process of developing a registry entails many steps that require support and collaborative assessment activities, learning from the successful lessons and guidelines of the international registries would assist in the planning and strategizing of the registry.</p><p>Taken together, developing such a dataset is beneficial to the Egyptian health&#x02010;care system, which makes the investment worthwhile. Support and collaborative work from all stakeholders, along with suitable funding, are essential elements of the proper implementation of the project. Yet, it might seem to be an opportune time for initiating this kind of registry to address the needs and, at the same time, benefit from the strategic opportunities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="alz70011-sec-0340"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>All authors declare no financial or non&#x02010;financial competing interests.
