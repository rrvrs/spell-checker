Although high seroprevalence rates have been reported, the detection of the virus is much lower. The virus detection is often synchronized with the onset of respiratory symptoms, making the etiological testing of BRSV even more important for the prevention and control of the disease. In this study, we developed a qRT-RAA diagnostic method targeting the BRSV <italic toggle="yes">F</italic> gene based on emerging RAA technology, which allows the assay to be completed in 20 min at a constant temperature. This method is efficient and rapid, has high sensitivity and specificity, and is suitable for the clinical diagnosis of BRSV infection.</p></abstract><abstract><title>Abstract</title><p>Background: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a significant cause of bovine respiratory disease, resulting in significant losses to the cattle industry. For rapid detection of BRSV, a real-time recombinase-aided isothermal amplification assay (qRT-RAA) based on the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic> gene of BRSV was developed in this study. Results: The developed qRT-RAA assay showed good exponential amplification of the target fragment in 20 min at a constant temperature of 39 &#x000b0;C. And this assay displayed a high specificity for BRSV, without cross-reactions with Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis Virus (IBRV), Bovine Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 (BPIV3), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), and Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV). With the standard RNA of BRSV serving as a template, the limit of detection for qRT-RAA was 102 copies/&#x003bc;L. We examined ninety-seven clinical samples from cattle with respiratory disease using this method and determined a positive rate of 7.2% (7/97), consistent with results using the classical PCR method reported previously. Conclusions: A qRT-RAA assay for BRSV detection was established in this study. The method is specific and sensitive and can be completed within 20 min at 39 &#x000b0;C. These works demonstrate that the generated qRT-RAA assay is an effective diagnostic tool for rapidly detecting BRSV in resource-limited settings, which may be applied for the clinical detection of BRSV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bovine respiratory syncytial virus</kwd><kwd>qRT-RAA</kwd><kwd>specificity</kwd><kwd>sensitivity</kwd><kwd>detection assay</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>central government to guide local scientific and technological development projects of Hebei Province</funding-source><award-id>23626604G</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Hebei Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System Beef Cattle Industry Innovation Team Disease Prevention and Control and Resistance Reduction Post</funding-source><award-id>HBCT2023190201</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Hebei High-Level Talent Funding Program</funding-source><award-id>C20231014</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Technology Special Project for the Construction of Chengde National Innovation Demonstration Zones for Sustainable Development Agenda</funding-source><award-id>202302F040</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the central government to guide local scientific and technological development projects of Hebei Province (23626604G), Hebei Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System Beef Cattle Industry Innovation Team Disease Prevention and Control and Resistance Reduction Post (HBCT2023190201), Hebei High-Level Talent Funding Program (C20231014), and Technology Special Project for the Construction of Chengde National Innovation Demonstration Zones for Sustainable Development Agenda (202302F040).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-vetsci-11-00589"><title>1. Background</title><p>Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important causative agent of bovine respiratory disease syndromes [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has been widespread worldwide since its first identification in Europe in the 1970s. Presently, reports of BRSV isolation from cattle have been documented in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. BRSV infection mainly appears in newly weaned calves and young cattle in intensive farming, and the morbidity rate in calves can be as high as 60%, with a mortality rate of about 20%, causing significant losses [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2007, the first BRSV isolation in Heilongjiang province was reported in China [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BRSV infection is prevalent in cattle and cows, with a seropositivity rate of 41.2&#x02013;94.4% and a virus detection rate of 0.95&#x02013;5.3% [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], posing a significant threat to the bovine industry. BRSV mainly replicates in bronchiolar epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, causing bronchial interstitial pneumonia, necrosis of epithelial cells, exudative or proliferative pneumonitis, and the appearance of syncytial cells, which was associated with replicating BRSV [<xref rid="B6-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>BRSV is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirus, and family Paramyxovirida [<xref rid="B7-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The genome contains 10 open reading frames for encoding 11 proteins [<xref rid="B8-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The F protein is located at the surface of the viral particle and is critical for viral replication by mediating the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and the formation of syncytia. This protein contains 574 amino acids and is highly conserved among different BRSV isolates, frequently used as the target for detection methods design [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>At present, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), LAMP assay, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the major diagnostic methods for BRSV detection [<xref rid="B10-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], requiring specialized instruments and personnel. Recombinase-aided isothermal amplification (RAA) is a method for the rapid amplification of nucleic acids at a constant temperature. The core of RAA technology is its special recombinase enzyme obtained from bacteria or fungi; it is able to attach tightly to the primer DNA at a low temperature and guide it to bind to the single DNA template formed by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein and complete the replication process under the action of DNA polymerase. Compared with conventional PCR technology, the whole amplification process is more efficient and rapid and escapes from the limitations of PCR instruments. Real-time monitoring of the RAA reaction process can be realized through the introduction of probes and the analysis of fluorescence signals [<xref rid="B12-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For the characteristics of rapidity, simplicity, and high specificity and sensitivity, the real-time RAA is more favorable than other detection methods in actual pathogen detection. Here, we established a real-time reverse transcription RAA(qRT-RAA) method for BRSV by targeting the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic> gene and performed a comprehensive evaluation of its sensitivity, specificity, and effectiveness for clinical sample detection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-11-00589"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>BRSV is the major causative agent of respiratory diseases in dairy and beef cattle farming, which dramatically increases the mortality rate and cost of medication, causing significant losses in the cattle industry [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As commercial vaccines are hardly available, the present measures for BRSV control mainly rely on timely symptomatic treatment based on accurate diagnosis [<xref rid="B19-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although BRSV is capable of replicating in a variety of bovine-derived cells, this virus is difficult to isolate from clinical samples because of its fragile viral particles, poor environmental tolerance, and poor cellular adaptation, making it challenging for BRSV diagnosis [<xref rid="B20-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consequently, the establishment of a rapid, simple, and reliable BRSV detection method to eliminate positive cattle is particularly important to reduce the losses caused by this disease.</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">F</italic> gene of BRSV is highly conserved with 97% to 99% amino acid homology among different isolates and is frequently used as a target gene for the design of nucleic acid assays [<xref rid="B21-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, we also chose this gene as the target gene to design the longer primers and probes used for generation of qRT-RAA method. To improve the efficiency of primer screening, we initially screened the primers with an RT-RAA kit by electrophoresis analysis. After determining the optimal primers, we designed probes within the amplification region and established and optimized the qRT-RAA method. The advantage of qRT-RAA technology is the ability to accomplish nucleic acid amplification efficiently under constant temperature within a short time, which relies on the involvement of specific recombinases, single-stranded proteins, etc. The qRT-RAA method established in this study for BRSV detection allows completion of the reaction and obtained results within 20 min at a constant temperature of 39 &#x000b0;C, which is more convenient and faster than the established RT-PCR, fluorescence timed PCR [<xref rid="B22-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Nano-PCR [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], ELISA, and immunofluorescent antibody assays [<xref rid="B24-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the shortened reaction time did not diminish the sensitivity of the qRT-RAA assay, and the minimum detection limit of the qRT-RAA assay developed in this study was 102 copies/&#x003bc;L, basically the same as that of the Nano-PCR and real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) previously reported, but 100-fold higher than that of the conventional RT-PCR. The LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) [<xref rid="B25-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] method is another effective way of achieving constant temperature amplification, and this approach involves the synergy of multiple primer pairs, requiring high requirements for primer design. In contrast, the primer design of the qRT-RAA method is the same as that of the conventional real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) method, with only slight modifications in primer length and probe labeling positions. Moreover, the developed qRT-RAA assay showed high specificity and did not cross-react with other common respiratory viruses, such as IBRV, BVDV, BPIV3, BCoV, etc.</p><p>Constant temperature and short reaction time are the advantages of the RT-RAA method, while the extraction of viral RNA did take more time. For the interference of proteins and the instability of viral RNA, crude samples are unsuitable for use as RT-RAA templates, and we will further explore the quick method for RT-RAA template preparation.</p><p>Although the high serologic positivity rate for BRSV has been reported in many articles, the detection rate of BRSV virus is much lower, ranging from 0.84% to 32.75% [<xref rid="B26-vetsci-11-00589" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], indicating a long antibody persistence period post-infection and the necessity of etiologic testing. In this study, we collected 97 clinical samples from Hebei Province, China, for BRSV detection by the generated qRT-RAA, and seven were determined to be BRSV-positive; the positive rate was 7.2%. We noticed a perfect agreement of results from the generated qRT-RAA method in the present study and a conventional RT-PCR method previously reported. This may be due to the limited sample size and low BRSV detection rate since there were only seven positive samples. In addition, the samples we collected were all from cattle with significant respiratory symptoms, usually suggesting severe infection and high viral load. This may also have contributed to this agreement, which is consistent with the testing results used.</p><p>In summary, we have developed a qRT-RAA method for the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of BRSV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vetsci-11-00589"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we established a qRT-RAA method for the detection of BRSV. This method displays high specificity and sensitivity and can be completed within 20 min at 39 &#x000b0;C, which can be applied for clinical testing of BRSV.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would also like to thank Xinyi Sun, Chunxiao Zhang, Lili Wang and Rui An for their help with this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
