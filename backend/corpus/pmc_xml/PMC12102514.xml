Data were from 510 parents (aged 70&#x02013;97 years at baseline) who reported on their 1496 adult children in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, with seven observations over ten years. Joint care potential considered the number of children and their care potential types. Children with high care potential lived nearby, had frequent contact, and had significant emotional and instrumental support exchanges with their parent. For unpartnered parents, each additional child increased the likelihood of receiving intergenerational care. Having children with high care potential further increased this likelihood. For partnered parents, receiving care was more likely if all children had medium or high care potential; an additional child only contributed under this condition. Policies and practice should not assume that older parents will receive care solely based on having multiple children or a child living nearby.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>caregiving</kwd><kwd>family structure</kwd><kwd>intergenerational relations</kwd><kwd>longitudinal methods</kwd><kwd>care potential</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-01640275251326507"><funding-source id="funding1-01640275251326507">

The Latent Kin Matrix suggests that family members have great potential to provide care and support, even if they are not currently involved in caregiving or other direct assistance (<xref rid="bibr31-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Riley &#x00026; Riley, 1993</xref>). Family relationships are often not static but have the capacity to change depending on needs, such as the onset of illness. For example, 46% of older adults experienced a change in their child caregivers over the course of two years (<xref rid="bibr38-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Szinovacz &#x00026; Davey, 2013</xref>). Therefore, evaluating the support resources for older adults should go beyond identifying current caregivers to include those with caregiving potential that could be activated. Usually, adult children&#x02019;s availability is dormant and there is a potential to respond to parental needs (<xref rid="bibr33-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al., 1997</xref>). The study aims to examine this latent reserve as intergenerational care potential: we explore its characteristics by showing the extent to which it evolves into future care for older parents.</p><p>The Latent Kin Matrix indicates that the support that family members offer each other depends on &#x0201c;the predispositions of each individual and the continuing motivation to negotiate and renegotiate their joint lives&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr30-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Riley, 1983</xref>, p. 446). Many studies have investigated which child is more likely to provide care, focusing on the characteristics of the child and the parent using a dyadic approach. For example, <xref rid="bibr35-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Stuifbergen et al. (2008)</xref> reported that motivation of care and socio-demographic characteristics of both the child and parent correlate to caregiving. <xref rid="bibr4-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al. (2022)</xref> found path dependence: children who were previously supportive were most likely to provide care. In addition to such individual indicators, studies considered within-family dynamics by incorporating multiple intergenerational relationships and parental expectations into the analysis. <xref rid="bibr43-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Vergauwen and Mortelmans (2021)</xref> found that a child was more likely to provide care if they were closer to their parents than their siblings in terms of distance and contact and if they were daughter with brothers rather than sisters. <xref rid="bibr22-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Leopold et al. (2014)</xref> found that an individual children&#x02019;s transition in caregiving was influenced by their sibling&#x02019;s relative costs (e.g., geographic distance) and relative commitments (e.g., birth order and parental expectation).</p><p>Another body of research investigated whether an older parent received care not from an individual child, but from the group of children. According to the configurational approach (<xref rid="bibr46-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Widmer, 2016</xref>), family dynamics operate at both the level of individuals, shaped by their own opportunities (e.g. contact frequency) and constraints (e.g. geographic distance), and the structural level with mutual dependencies among family members (e.g., care division). This approach considers the family network as a whole, where individuals are nested and interdependent. It has been applied in research on intergenerational care for older adults. Parents were more likely to receive intergenerational care if they had more children and at least one daughter (<xref rid="bibr12-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grundy, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grundy &#x00026; Read, 2012</xref>). A higher proportion of children who were daughters, biological children, and had no minor children predicted a higher proportion of children providing care (<xref rid="bibr23-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Lin &#x00026; Wolf, 2020</xref>). Having more children and more daughters than sons predicted receiving care from children rather than from a partner or no care at all, and parents with only sons tend to receive formal care (<xref rid="bibr1-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Batur et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we adopted the configurational approach to examine whether older parents received intergenerational care. We went beyond counting the number or proportion of children with a specific characteristic by describing &#x02013; building on previous work &#x02013; the care potential of the group of children. First, we developed a typology of <italic toggle="yes">relational care potential</italic> within the parent-child dyad. Based on the Intergenerational Solidarity Model (<xref rid="bibr2-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Bengtson &#x00026; Roberts, 1991</xref>) and the discussion on the latent form of intergenerational cohesion by <xref rid="bibr33-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al. (1997)</xref>, we use the opportunity, association, and function dimensions to assess the strength and potential of individual parent-child ties. Then, we aggregated the types of individual parent-child ties (dyad level) to describe the <italic toggle="yes">joint care potential</italic> of the group of children (family level). The joint care potential includes the number of children as a structural characteristic, extended by the composition of the children&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">relational care potential</italic> types. Third, we used a prospective longitudinal design to determine how joint care potential affects future parental care receipt.</p><p>We defined care as any personal care or help with transportation as well as household, nursing, and administrative tasks. Although care potential may work out differently for various types of care, we combined a wide range of care types to provide a comprehensive overview of intergenerational care receipt. We distinguished between unpartnered and partnered parents when examining intergenerational care because partners &#x02013; when available &#x02013; are typically the primary caregivers (<xref rid="bibr38-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Szinovacz &#x00026; Davey, 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="sec2-01640275251326507"><title>Relational Care Potential of Individual Children</title><p>Intergenerational Solidarity Model (<xref rid="bibr2-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Bengtson &#x00026; Roberts, 1991</xref>) captures different dimensions of the strength of parent-child ties. Based on this model, developing a typology of <italic toggle="yes">relational care potential</italic> helps to reflect the potential of specific children in providing care for parents. <xref rid="bibr33-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al. (1997)</xref> distinguished five types of intergenerational relationships such as a &#x0201c;tight-knit&#x0201d; latent class (children high on closeness, contact frequency, and support exchange, and with small geographic proximity) and an &#x0201c;intimate but distant&#x0201d; class (children high on closeness but at great geographical distance). The number of indicators used varies across studies, which may be related to the number of types found; geographic proximity, frequency of contact, emotional closeness, affection or quality, and exchange of support are often included as indicators (<xref rid="bibr18-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr41-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">van Houdt, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr45-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Zeng &#x00026; Li, 2024</xref>). Typically, the latent class analysis was used to construct the typology.</p><p>In this study, we used four indicators that cover three dimensions of the Intergenerational Solidarity Model to assess a child&#x02019;s care potential. Our dataset does not allow us to explore all the indicators of care potential proposed in the literature. <italic toggle="yes">Geographic proximity</italic> represents the opportunity structure, promoting children&#x02019;s care provision by reducing the cost of time and energy for traveling (<xref rid="bibr7-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Dykstra &#x00026; Fokkema, 2011</xref>) and facilitating frequent visits. It enables children to react responsively to care needs that parents are unable or unwilling to articulate remotely, or that can only be determined visually or in person. The shorter the distance of travel, the more likely children are to provide care (<xref rid="bibr29-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Pillemer &#x00026; Suitor, 2014</xref>) and to be the primary caregiver (<xref rid="bibr38-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Szinovacz &#x00026; Davey, 2013</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Frequent contact</italic> represents the association solidarity<bold>,</bold> facilitating caring (<xref rid="bibr13-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grundy &#x00026; Read, 2012</xref>). For example, children are more likely to be aware of their parents&#x02019; needs if they call or visit their parents often (<xref rid="bibr7-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Dykstra &#x00026; Fokkema, 2011</xref>), which is related to the opportunity structure. The exchanged <italic toggle="yes">emotional</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">instrumental support</italic> reflects functional solidarity and indicates children&#x02019;s propensity for providing care due to intergenerational reciprocity (<xref rid="bibr12-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grundy, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Leopold et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, support of children is likely to continue when their parents have increased care needs due to the parent&#x02019;s path dependency and children&#x02019;s developing commitments, that is, the child who assumed the role of caregiver would feel increasingly obligated to provide care (<xref rid="bibr22-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Leopold et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The gender of children also appears to be important. Daughters generally provide more frequent, intensive, and diverse intergenerational care than sons (<xref rid="bibr32-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2012</xref>). This gender difference fits with traditional gender ideology, where the availability and aptitude of daughters is seen as greater than that of sons (<xref rid="bibr14-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grunow et al., 2018</xref>). Inequality between men and women in the division of childcare and domestic work as well as the gender pay gap persists over time (<xref rid="bibr47-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Yerkes et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-01640275251326507"><title>Joint Care Potential of the Group of Children</title><p>The joint care potential of a group of children consists of both the number of children &#x02013; not taking into account their care potential &#x02013; and the composition of children&#x02019;s relational care potential. The number of children is the first indicator of intergenerational care potential (<xref rid="bibr2-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Bengtson &#x00026; Roberts, 1991</xref>). The more siblings a child has, the less likely they are to provide care (<xref rid="bibr43-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Vergauwen &#x00026; Mortelmans, 2021</xref>). If there are other children, the need to provide care for an individual child is lower and arguments may arise between siblings over the distribution of care, which reduces the motivation to provide care. But at the family level, parents with more children are more likely to receive care, because there are simply more children that can provide care. For example, an older single-child parent may not receive intergenerational care when the child has competing tasks or is in poor health. Previous studies found a positive association between the number of children and the likelihood of receiving intergenerational care. Yet, findings varied in whether each additional child or a minimum number of children is needed to increase this likelihood (<xref rid="bibr13-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grundy &#x00026; Read, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Sun, 2002</xref>). Our first research question is: (1) Does parents&#x02019; intergenerational care receipt depend on the total number of children, and if so, what is the optimal number?</p><p>Having children who have many favorable characteristics, including living nearby, visiting their parents often, and having a history of exchanged support, may ensure that care is provided to a parent who needs it. However, it is unknown whether having a &#x02018;tight-knit&#x02019; relationship with one child (i.e., one child having all favorable characteristics) is sufficient, whether more &#x02018;tight-knit&#x02019; children are necessary, or whether their favorable attributes can be distributed across different parent-child relationships. An example of the latter scenario is a parent with one child who is high in opportunities but low in exchanging support, and another child, despite living at a distance, provides emotional and instrumental support by making calls and organizing tasks online. <xref rid="bibr38-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Szinovacz and Davey (2013)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr42-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Vergauwen (2024)</xref> examined family dynamics and found attrition and replacement among adult children who provided care over time. This may be related to a child&#x02019;s responsibilities (e.g. caring for one&#x02019;s own children), incompatibility with paid work, or an increasing care burden. This suggests that having multiple children with medium or high care potential increases the likelihood of older parents&#x02019; receipt of care. Our second research question is: (2) How does the quality (care potential) of children, combined with their quantity (number), contribute to a parent&#x02019;s likelihood of receiving intergenerational care? In answering this question, we examined a threshold model and an accumulative model (<xref rid="bibr36-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Suitor et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, we examined whether having a child with high care potential is essential, or whether medium care potential is sufficient. Additionally, we considered whether having more children with a particular (high or medium) care potential increases the likelihood of receiving care compared to having just one child with that care potential.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-01640275251326507"><title>Contextual Factors Associated with Intergenerational Care Receipt</title><p>Except the joint care potential of children, contextual factors such as norms towards informal and formal care, parent&#x02019;s care need, use of alternative care options potentially influence the likelihood of parent&#x02019;s care receipt from children.

Next, we added the number of children in each relational care potential class. To address the dependence on the total number of children, we added whether having a child (if possible, also having a second child) in specific classes one by one in the model<bold>.</bold> We tested nine Models 3, that is, different combinations of care potential classes, and retained classes that were statistically significant. In Model 4, we controlled for children&#x02019;s gender (i.e., having at least one daughter vs. only sons) and its interaction with parental gender (<xref rid="bibr11-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grigoryeva, 2017</xref>). Model 5 added parent&#x02019;s characteristics, their norms, care need, and received care from others. In a robustness check, we examined whether the predictive effect of joint care potential differed when cross-sectional data were excluded. We stratified all regression analyses by respondent&#x02019;s partner status at baseline because a partner might be the primary caregiver and might decrease the need for intergenerational care.

We observed an increase in the percentage of parents receiving care over ten years. This highlights the activation of intergenerational care potential as parents age, their health declines, and particularly after the loss of the partner. This finding underscores the role of adult children as a source of old-age security. Their care potential often remains dormant and is only activated when they perceive a clear, necessary, or urgent need for care from their aging parents.</p><sec id="sec23-01640275251326507"><title>Intergenerational Care Potential and Care Receipt</title><p>We aimed to examine the extent to which joint intergenerational care potential translated into parent&#x02019;s care receipt. Specifically, we looked at quantity (number of children) (research question 1) and quality (care potential classes) (research question 2). The answers to our research questions varied depending on whether the parents had a partner.</p><p>We first discuss parents without a partner. In answering research question 1, we found that the likelihood of care receipt increased linearly with the number of children: Each additional child increased the likelihood by 12 percentage points. Children may have complementary roles relative to siblings. For example, if a child is unwilling, unavailable, or unable to provide care at a particular time, another child may step in. Previously research (<xref rid="bibr13-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grundy &#x00026; Read, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Sun, 2002</xref>) has also indicated that the number of children affects care receipt, but results varied on the exact number needed to have the effect. In answering research question 2, our results confirmed the literature-based expectation (<xref rid="bibr7-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Dykstra &#x00026; Fokkema, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Pillemer &#x00026; Suitor, 2014</xref>) that having children with greater care potential &#x02013; the <italic toggle="yes">tight-knit</italic> &#x02013; increases the likelihood of receiving intergenerational care. Specifically, in addition to the number of children, having one or more children in the high care potential class further increased an unpartnered parent&#x02019;s likelihood of receiving intergenerational care by about 16 percentage points. However, we also found that having one or more children in a medium care potential class did not further increase the likelihood of receiving care. For a parent with limited care need, it may not be necessary to have children with all the favorable characteristics. Help with administration, for example, does not always require geographical proximity. However, if care needs are more intensive or complex, it may be necessary and sufficient to have one child with all the favorable characteristics.</p><p>Among partnered parents, having an additional child increased the likelihood of receiving care by 11 percentage points (research question 1), but this effect seemed conditional: it only held if all children have medium or high care potential (research question 2). The results highlight the importance of the idea of joint care potential, meaning that a parent is more likely to receive intergenerational care if all children have some level of care potential (<xref rid="bibr40-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Tolkacheva et al., 2010</xref>). The negative effect of having one or more children in the low care potential classes &#x02013; the <italic toggle="yes">remote and staying in touch</italic> and the <italic toggle="yes">detached</italic> children &#x02013; almost entirely offset the positive effect of having a larger number of children. When all children have high or medium care potential, the probability of receiving intergenerational care increased significantly. Specifically, it was 7 percentage points higher for having one child and 40 percentage points higher for having five or more children. On average, this resulted in 24 percentage points increase in the likelihood of receiving care compared to the unfavorable circumstance (i.e., having one or more children with low care potential). Therefore, we add to the answer to the second research question that it did not matter whether children had medium or high care potential, as long as each child had at least medium care potential. Complementarity may thus arise as different children contribute at different times, increasing the likelihood of receiving care at each time. This effect is enhanced when there are more children with the favorable characteristics.</p><p>Combining the conclusions for both unpartnered and partnered parents, we find that the care potential of children plays a significant role. Caregiving often has a voluntary aspect, particularly when multiple children are present. Thus, the strength of the parent-child bond is reflected in caregiving behaviors. In cases of clear, urgent, or long-term care needs (e.g., in the event of the loss of a partner), having at least one child with high care potential becomes critical, because they are more likely to serve as a primary caregiver&#x02014;a topic widely discussed in the parental care literature (<xref rid="bibr6-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Cicirelli, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2022</xref>). A child with high care potential is more likely to provide responsive and continuous care and be more resilient to caregiving challenges (<xref rid="bibr11-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grigoryeva, 2017</xref>). Conversely, when care needs are less obvious or urgent, caregiving tends to occur more sporadically. For parents with all children having low care potential who have distant or even broken relationships with parents, the likelihood of receiving care is significantly low. This aligns with the depiction of family in the era of an aging society by <xref rid="bibr30-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Riley (1983</xref>, p. 439): &#x0201c;Relationships are no longer prescribed as strict obligations and must instead be earned&#x02014;created and recreated by family members throughout their long lives.&#x0201d; Theoretically, we provide more insight into how the Intergenerational Solidarity Model (<xref rid="bibr2-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Bengtson &#x00026; Roberts, 1991</xref>) works: both quantitative aspects (having more children) and qualitative aspects (specific combinations of the dimensions of opportunity, association, and function) are important for the likelihood of receiving care.</p><p>Traditionally, it is mainly daughters who provide care, not sons. We observed that having at least one daughter did not increase the probability of intergenerational care significantly, which is opposite to the findings of <xref rid="bibr1-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Batur et al. (2024)</xref>. One possible reason for the small gender difference observed in this study might be gender is just a proxy for indicators of the care potential of a child such as contact frequency and emotional support. When we take these indicators into care potential, gender itself loses its impact. Another reason might be the fact that sons feel more obligated to provide care in the absence of daughters. We also found no interaction of children&#x02019;s gender composition with their parent&#x02019;s gender. From a parent&#x02019;s perspective, the norms towards intergenerational care over other forms of care (e.g., formal care) might be irrespective of the gender of the children.</p><p>The translation of joint care potential also depends on the structural and social context. For example, the presence of a partner significantly impacts the translation from joint care potential to intergenerational care receipt. Unpartnered parents were more likely to receive intergenerational care than partnered parents, with a difference of about 25 percentage points. Moreover, among the partnered parents, those who lost their partner during the course of our study were much more likely to receive intergenerational care than those who did not. <xref rid="bibr51-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Swinkels et al. (2022)</xref> previously suggested that when a partner is present, a parent tends to receive personal care primarily from their partner and very rarely from their children. This might be due to factors such as affinity, intimacy, and geographic proximity with the partner. Children of unpartnered parents may provide care because they perceive living alone as a sign of vulnerability or feel a stronger sense of responsibility towards their lone parent. Thus, examining the extent of the translation of joint care potential into care receipt must take into consideration the presence of a partner.</p></sec><sec id="sec24-01640275251326507"><title>The Relevance of Care Need</title><p>We used comprehensive indicators to reveal care need. Being older, losing a partnership during the course of the study, and physical and cognitive impairments were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving intergenerational care. This highlights the complexity of &#x0201c;care need&#x0201d; in family studies. Simply using chronological age as an indicator of care need has been criticized (<xref rid="bibr10-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Grenier, 2020</xref>), as higher age does not necessarily imply an increased need for care. Additionally, using chronological age as a measure for care need reinforces the devaluation of older age. However, in our study, chronological age correlated with various care need indicators, and a higher chronological age did increase the likelihood of receiving intergenerational care. These findings suggest that higher chronological age may indicate a care need not captured by the other indicators we used. This could imply that children perceive older age as a signal to provide care to parents, regardless of the actual need. Children may also provide unsolicited care, irrespective of care need, as a way to show love, meet filial expectations, or reciprocate the support they received from their parents earlier in life (<xref rid="bibr21-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Leopold &#x00026; Raab, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec25-01640275251326507"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A strength and novelty of this study is the integration of care potential at both the individual child and family levels in investigating parental care receipt. This approach has the advantage of demonstrating the interplay of various characteristics of individual relationships. Moreover, we were able to simultaneously describe multiple characteristics of multiple relationships within a family and to focus on the family configuration of intergenerational relationships. Finally, our study benefited from a powerful test of the (latent) nature of care potential with the prospective design, which included up to six follow-up observations spanning ten years.</p><p>We found that relational care potential indicators were on average fairly constant before and within our observation period. However, this average picture of stability masks that travel time, contact frequency, and support exchange do have the potential to change, which was visible by their own low correlations over time. Furthermore, additional indicators can be used to distinguish relational care potential. We suggest the availability of time (other care responsibilities and paid work), relational ambivalence (<xref rid="bibr8-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Fingerman et al., 2012</xref>) and care burden related relational difficulties (<xref rid="bibr27-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">Offer &#x00026; Fischer, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the cohort change requires attention. <xref rid="bibr49-01640275251326507" ref-type="bibr">van der Pas et al. (2007)</xref> showed that later born older adults had fewer children than the early born. Contact frequency and support exchange increased, but the decreased fertility rate might pose a threat to the joint care potential of the following cohorts.</p><p>We included data from phone and proxy interviews in our analyses to include frail parents, but this did come at the expense of data completeness. We lacked data on partners. A partnered parent without care need may receive intergenerational care as a by-product of their partner&#x02019;s care need. For example, in response to a partner&#x02019;s high care need, a child could do household tasks that benefit both parents. Therefore, we may have overestimated care receipt for partnered parents. However, given a partner&#x02019;s primary role in care provision and the lower likelihood of receiving intergenerational care among partnered parents compared to unpartnered parents, we do not expect this to have had a large effect on our results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec26-01640275251326507"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intergenerational care potential could be further recognized and developed by families and social care practitioners to prolong the independent living of older parents. It is not only the number of children that counts. For unpartnered parents, the combination of favorable characteristics of intergenerational relationships mattered, rather than a single characteristic. Among partnered parents, it is required that all children have at least medium caregiving potential. Policy and practice should not assume that an older parent will receive care simply because there are multiple children or because there is a child living nearby.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec27-01640275251326507"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-01640275251326507" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material - The Translation of Intergenerational Care Potential Into Care Receipt of Older Parents: A Prospective Study</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-pdf-1-roa-10.1177_01640275251326507.pdf"/><p>Supplemental Material for The Translation of Intergenerational Care Potential Into Care Receipt of Older Parents: A Prospective Study by Ying Shen, Theo G. van Tilburg, and Mariska van der Horst in Research on Aging</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="presented-by"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> All authors contributed to the design of this study.
