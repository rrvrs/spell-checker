The increasing inefficacy of current anthelmintic drugs against parasitic diseases necessitates the discovery of novel therapeutic options. This study investigated the anthelmintic properties and therapeutic potential of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins (i.e., secreted skin toxins). xWORM (xCELLigence Worm Real-Time Motility Assay) was used to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of ichthyocrinotoxins from two stonefish species, <italic toggle="yes">Synanceia horrida</italic> (Estuarine Stonefish) and <italic toggle="yes">Synanceia verrucosa</italic> (Reef Stonefish), against the infective third-stage larvae of <italic toggle="yes">Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> (Rodent Hookworm). Both toxins demonstrated potent anthelmintic effects, with <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin exhibiting greater potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 196.0 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to ichthyocrinotoxin from <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 329.7 &#x000b5;g/mL). Fractionation revealed that the anthelmintic activity of <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> is likely driven by synergistic interactions between the large (&#x0003e;3 kDa) and small (&#x0003c;3 kDa) components. In contrast, the small components isolated from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin were responsible for the majority of the observed activity, making them a more attractive therapeutic candidate. Furthermore, despite the cytotoxicity of crude <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin against human skin and bile duct cell lines, the isolated small components exhibited potent anthelmintic effects (IC<sub>50</sub> = 70.5 &#x000b5;g/mL) with negligible cytotoxicity (&#x0003c;10% decrease in survival at 100 &#x000b5;g/mL). While further research is necessary to fully characterise these compounds and assess their clinical suitability, this study highlights the potential of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins as a novel source of anthelmintic therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>novel compounds</kwd><kwd>stonefish</kwd><kwd>toxins</kwd><kwd>anthelmintic</kwd><kwd>therapeutics</kwd><kwd>ichthyocrinotoxin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Key Contribution"><title>Key Contribution</title><p>Stonefish skin toxins (ichthyocrinotoxins) may have practical applications as novel anthelmintic therapeutics.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-toxins-17-00066"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Parasitic worms (or helminths) infect almost all taxa across the animal kingdom [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is estimated that over two billion people, or a little over 24% of the global population, are currently infected with helminths [<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The highest prevalence of helminth infections in humans is found in developing countries, particularly in places with poor sanitation and limited access to healthcare [<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Different helminths cause distinct pathophysiological conditions, depending on the niches they occupy, including intestinal issues (i.e., diarrhoea, abdominal pain), organ damage (i.e., blindness, kidney disease), dermatological conditions (i.e., skin penetration, skin rashes), malnutrition, and impaired growth and physical development [<xref rid="B4-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Beyond their toll on health and wellbeing, helminths also impose substantial economic losses, particularly in agricultural and aquacultural sectors, by compromising the productivity of livestock and the market value of animal products [<xref rid="B6-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Such production losses can also affect consumers, as reduced supply can strain the market, which in turn, drives up retail prices [<xref rid="B8-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The devastating impact of helminths on health and the economy is further compounded by the emergence of singular or multi-drug resistance across numerous parasite species. It is now well-established that resistance has developed against all classes of anthelmintic drugs used against helminth species that infect livestock [<xref rid="B10-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, within the last decade, cases of drug resistance have also emerged for helminth species that infect companion animals [<xref rid="B11-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and concerningly, humans [<xref rid="B13-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Novel anthelmintic treatment options with distinct mechanisms of action are thus urgently needed to address this issue [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nature has already provided a profusion of modern therapeutics, including analgesics (i.e., penicillin, opium, and aspirin), decongestants (i.e., pseudoephedrine/Sudafed), cholesterol-lowering medications (i.e., statins), anthelmintics (i.e., avermectin), and much more [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Yet, a vast reservoir of unexplored compounds remains, some of which are likely to have therapeutic potential. Animal toxins, which include venoms and poisons, are particularly promising for biodiscovery due to their highly diverse, dynamic, and often complex composition [<xref rid="B19-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Stonefish (<italic toggle="yes">Synanceia</italic> spp.) stand out as being one of few organisms known to possess two distinct types of toxins: a potent defensive venom associated with each of their dorsal spines, and a secreted skin toxin called ichthyocrinotoxin [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While stonefish are widely distributed throughout the shallow, coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific, two species inhabit Queensland waters: <italic toggle="yes">Synanceia horrida</italic> (Estuarine Stonefish), which are primarily found inshore amongst rocky intertidal areas and estuaries, and <italic toggle="yes">Synanceia verrucosa</italic> (Reef Stonefish), which are commonly associated with coral reefs [<xref rid="B22-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Stonefish generally adopt a cryptic, benthic, and predominantly sedentary lifestyle, a strategy that likely assists with prey capture and predator avoidance [<xref rid="B22-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the intimate association that stonefish have with the benthos, combined with their lack of squamation (i.e., scales) [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], should render these animals highly susceptible to parasites, particularly those, such as helminths, that burrow through the skin.</p><p>Helminths are ubiquitous in the aquatic realm, and as such, their occurrence in fish is common and widely reported, particularly for species targeted or reared for consumption [<xref rid="B24-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Yet, members of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Synanceia</italic> (including stonefish) appear to harbour a surprisingly low diversity of internal parasite taxa [<xref rid="B26-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One hypothesis for the paucity of internal parasites in stonefish may be that their ichthyocrinotoxins afford the skin some protection [<xref rid="B27-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although the role of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins in parasite defence is currently unknown [<xref rid="B28-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], a previous study on ichthyocrinotoxic <italic toggle="yes">Gobiodon</italic> species supports the hypothesis that some ichthyocrinotoxins may aid in preventing parasitism [<xref rid="B29-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This study observed that <italic toggle="yes">Gobiodon</italic> ichthyocrinotoxins influenced the attachment sites of external parasites (gnathiid isopods), with parasites demonstrating a preference for areas, such as the fins, where the toxin glands were less abundant [<xref rid="B29-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated the broad-spectrum toxicity of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins against invertebrates. Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin was found to inhibit the cilia of invertebrates, including those associated with mussel gills, and protozoan locomotory appendages [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The toxin was also found to increase the tone of barnacle depressor scutorum rostralis muscles (i.e., the muscle that controls the scuta lips) for up to one hour after immersion [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, while ichthyocrinotoxins secreted by other fish commonly exhibit both ichthyotoxic and hemotoxic properties [<xref rid="B28-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins do not appear to follow suit. Ichthyocrinotoxins from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> were found to demonstrate negligible protease, haemolytic and haemagglutinating activity, and were only mildly toxic to mosquito fishes and blennies [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin was found to inhibit contractions in guinea pig ileum and vas deferens [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B30-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This suggests that while the toxin may have some effect on vertebrates, it appears to be more potent against invertebrates, which potentially include helminths. Moreover, the apparent limited toxicity of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins to vertebrates warrants further investigation into its therapeutic potential.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anthelmintic properties of stonefish (<italic toggle="yes">Synanceia</italic> spp.) ichthyocrinotoxins as a possible explanation for the paucity of endoparasites observed in these animals. Furthermore, this study evaluated the therapeutic potential of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins by (1) identifying the components responsible for the toxin&#x02019;s anthelmintic activity against <italic toggle="yes">Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> L3 (infective Rodent Hookworm larvae), and (2) determining the cytotoxicity of these components against various mammalian cell lines (human skin cells, human bile duct cells, as well as human and rat red blood cells) in vitro.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-17-00066"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The present study investigated the anthelmintic activity of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins and their potential applications as novel therapeutics. Stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins were found to elicit a dose-dependent toxic effect on <italic toggle="yes">N. brasiliensis</italic> L3. These findings further support the hypothesis that stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins may function, at least in part, in parasite defence. Additionally, previous research has shown that stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins also exhibited toxicity towards ciliated protozoans [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest that stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins may provide protection against a broad spectrum of parasite taxa, ranging from single-celled protozoa to more complex multicellular organisms like nematodes.</p><p>Interestingly, the potency of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins to <italic toggle="yes">N. brasiliensis</italic> L3 differed between the two species. Specifically, crude ichthyocrinotoxin from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> was found to be significantly more toxic to the parasite (IC<sub>50</sub> = 196.0 &#x000b5;g/mL) than ichthyocrinotoxin from <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 329.0 &#x000b5;g/mL). The components responsible for the anthelmintic activity were also found to differ between the two species. The anthelmintic properties of <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin were lost upon separation of its larger and smaller components. This suggests that the anthelmintic activity of <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin either arises from synergistic interactions (i.e., the combined action of multiple components of different sizes), or that the activity was lost during sample processing. In contrast, most of the anthelmintic activity of <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin was associated with its smaller components. However, it remains unclear whether this activity is due to a single active compound or synergistic interactions between compounds.</p><p>Previous research has shown that <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin has negligible protease, haemolytic, and haemagglutinating activities [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Conversely, <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin has also been shown to inhibit contractions in guinea pig ileum and vas deferens [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B30-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study provides further support for the varied cytotoxic properties of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins. Crude ichthyocrinotoxins from both <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> had little to no effect on human and rat red blood cells, even at high concentrations (&#x0003e;250 &#x000b5;g/mL). Additionally, ichthyocrinotoxin from <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> appeared to promote the proliferation of human skin and bile duct cells. In contrast, crude ichthyocrinotoxin from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> was highly toxic to human skin cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 146.3 &#x000b5;g/mL) and exhibited mild toxicity toward human bile duct cells (IC<sub>20</sub> = 274.6 &#x000b5;g/mL).</p><p>The observed interspecific differences in the anthelmintic activity and cytotoxicity of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins are consistent with previously reported compositional variations [<xref rid="B31-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It was suggested that interspecific compositional variation in stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins may be driven by differences in the ecology of these species [<xref rid="B31-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While the biological significance of the observed cytotoxicity to some mammalian cell lines remains unclear, interspecific variation in the toxins&#x02019; anthelmintic activities may be driven by differing parasite dynamics in the respective habitats of these species. For instance, the greater anthelmintic potency of <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin may reflect a higher abundance and/or diversity of parasites in estuarine habitats compared to coral reefs. Alternatively, the parasite taxa that these species encounter may be different between reef and estuarine environments, necessitating different compounds for an effective parasite defence. It is also plausible that the increased connectivity between terrestrial and estuarine environments could enhance the exposure of primarily estuary-dwelling stonefish species, such as <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic>, to mammalian-hosted parasites. This potential exposure may also contribute to the observed interspecific differences in the anthelmintic activity of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins to <italic toggle="yes">N. brasiliensis</italic> L3. However, it is important to note that <italic toggle="yes">N. brasiliensis</italic> is not a natural parasite of stonefish. Therefore, the observed differences in the anthelmintic properties between stonefish species might be an artefact rather than a reflection of true ecological scenarios.</p><p>Nevertheless, the observed anthelmintic activity of stonefish ichthyocrinotoxins towards a mammalian-hosted nematode suggests potential applications beyond their immediate ecological context, such as a novel anthelmintic therapeutic. From this perspective, ichthyocrinotoxin from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> emerges as a more attractive candidate for therapeutic development due to the small size of the active component(s). Small molecules are often preferred for drug discovery due to their ease of characterisation, lower manufacturing costs, enhanced stability, and more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties [<xref rid="B32-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In clinical settings, this may translate to greater affordability for patients and healthcare systems, oral treatment options, and simpler dosing regimens [<xref rid="B32-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, due to the potential synergistic nature of its anthelmintic activity, <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin may pose greater challenges for downstream development and clinical implementation.</p><p>The therapeutic potential of the isolated small components from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin is further strengthened by their high potency against <italic toggle="yes">N. brasiliensis</italic> L3 and reduced toxicity to mammalian cells. At a concentration of 100 &#x000b5;g/mL, these components caused less than 10% cell death in all tested mammalian cell lines but inhibited <italic toggle="yes">N. brasiliensis</italic> L3 survival by over 50%. Additionally, while the small components did exhibit some dose-dependent toxicity to human skin and bile duct cells, they were significantly less cytotoxic than the crude toxin. Nearly twice the concentration of the small component sample was required to reduce the survival of human skin cells by only 20% (IC<sub>20</sub> = 250.4 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to the concentration of crude toxin that halved cell survival (IC<sub>50</sub> = 146.3 &#x000b5;g/mL). Similar results were observed for bile duct cells, where more than twice the concentration of small components (IC<sub>20</sub> = 706.9 &#x000b5;g/mL) was needed to achieve the same effect as the crude toxin (IC<sub>20</sub> = 274.6 &#x000b5;g/mL). Furthermore, at biologically comparable concentrations, the small components demonstrated a weaker dose-dependent effect on human skin and bile duct cell survival compared to the crude toxin. This suggests that the cytotoxicity of <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin is either driven by synergistic interactions between its small and large components, or that the toxins activity was lost through fractionation. Furthermore, the components responsible for the observed cytotoxicity may differ from those active against <italic toggle="yes">N. brasiliensis</italic> L3, potentially making them ideal candidates for further in vivo evaluation.</p><p>Despite showing promise for therapeutic development, the isolated small components from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin exhibit considerably lower in vitro potency to parasites (IC<sub>50</sub> = 65.80 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to established anthelmintics like ivermectin [<xref rid="B34-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the isolated small components from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin are likely a multifarious mixture; thus, further isolation, as well as the structural and functional characterisation of the active component(s), is necessary to determine their true potency and clinical relevance. Additionally, future studies should determine the efficacy of these toxins against a wider range of parasite species, particularly medically significant hookworm species such as <italic toggle="yes">Necator americanus</italic> (human hookworm) and <italic toggle="yes">Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic> (canine and human hookworm), to evaluate their broad-spectrum potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-toxins-17-00066"><title>4.

The cholangiocyte cell line (H69), an SV40-transformed bile duct epithelial cell line derived from a non-cancerous human liver, was obtained in 2010 from Dr. Gregory J. Gores, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota [<xref rid="B40-toxins-17-00066" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These cell lines will herein be referred to as human skin cells for 1BR.3.GN, and human bile duct cells for H69. Both cell lines were cultured according to manufacturer protocols. In brief, cells were seeded in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> filter top flasks with 15 mL of an appropriate complete growth medium and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The complete growth medium for human skin cells consisted of DMEM/Nutrient Mixture F12 with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% Antibiotic&#x02013;Antimycotic (AA).

Cell adhesion, which was used as a proxy for cell survival, was monitored in real-time using an xCELLigence RTCA (Agilent) system. E-Plates were loaded with 50 &#x000b5;L of the appropriate complete growth medium and then placed on an xCELLigence RTCA single-plate (SP) instrument to undergo an initial background measurement. Then, either 100 &#x000b5;L of human skin cell suspension or 100 &#x000b5;L of human bile duct cell suspension was aliquoted in each well of a 96-well E-plate at a density of 5000 cells/100 &#x000b5;L. Eight E-plates were set up with one cell type (human skin cells or human bile duct cells), stonefish species ichthyocrinotoxin (<italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin), and sample type (crude sample or isolated small components) combination allocated per plate. All E-plates were then incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> throughout the duration of the experiment to mimic the internal thermal conditions of a mammal. Cells were left to form a monolayer on the bottom of the wells for 19 h prior to the addition of treatment. Samples of crude <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. verrucosa</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin and small (&#x0003c;3 kDa) components isolated from <italic toggle="yes">S. horrida</italic> ichthyocrinotoxin were prepared by serial dilution (1 part toxin: 2 parts complete growth medium).

Each treatment condition was conducted in triplicate. To establish a reference for 100% cell survival, three wells on each E-plate were designated as a negative control group and received 50 &#x000b5;L of the relevant complete growth medium in lieu of ichthyocrinotoxin. Following treatment, cell progression was continuously monitored over 72 hours using xCELLigence RTCA (Agilent). The system performed 50 sweeps of the E-plate at intervals of 15 s for the first hour, 2 min for the second hour, 15 min for six hours, and 60 min thereafter, generating a continuous Cell Index trace (RTCA Software Pro version 2). Pre-treatment (19 h post assay commencement) Normalised Cell Index values were used to quantify the percent change in cell adhesion in response to treatment. Percent cell survival was calculated by dividing the Normalised Cell Index values of each treatment condition by the average normalised Cell Index value of the negative control group and multiplying by 100. Percent survival data were then exported to GraphPad Prism version 10 for dose&#x02013;response analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot4dot3-toxins-17-00066"><title>5.4.3.

Rat blood was collected via cardiac puncture from two female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats that had been recently euthanised (James Cook University Animal Ethics Approval A2626). Human blood was drawn from the vein (venipuncture) of a healthy donor with human research and ethics approvals provided by James Cook University (James Cook University Human Ethics Approval H8523).
