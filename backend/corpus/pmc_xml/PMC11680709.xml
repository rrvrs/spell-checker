Various studies have shown that carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, etc. have effective antimicrobial properties. As per the literature, the bonding of bacteria with the carbon nanoparticle results in the immediate interaction between the cells and carbon nanomaterials, ultimately resulting in the death of the cell [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has been uncovered that the antibacterial activity of carbon nanomaterials is influenced by their size and surface area. Specifically, enhancing the activity in interacting with bacteria is achieved by increasing the surface area through the reduction of nanoparticle size. Carbon nanotubes damage the cell walls and membranes of microorganisms. Additionally, they can induce oxidative stress within the cell, which can result in the cell's biological death [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Carbon nanotubes are carbon structures with a nano-sized, hollow cylindrical shape, initially synthesized by Lijima in 1991 [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The initial evidence of potent antimicrobial effects on <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&#x000a0;(<italic>E. coli</italic>) by single-walled carbon nanotubes was presented by Kang et al. in 2007 [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown that individual, single-walled structures of carbon nanotubes have far superior properties than multi-walled structures [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The integrity of the cell membrane, metabolic activities, and cytology of <italic>E. coli</italic> were impacted by first-hand association with carbon nanotubes. The authors suggest that the penetration of single-walled carbon nanotubes into the cell wall is more effective compared to multi-walled carbon nanotubes due to their reduced size and diameter. Additionally, the enhanced cell-surface interaction was facilitated by the increased surface area of the single-walled carbon nanotubes [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Mechanical debridement, along with cleaning, are crucial factors that determine the favorable result of a root canal treatment. However, the intricate structure of the root canal allows certain bacteria to harbor in many areas in the canal. <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (<italic>E. faecalis</italic>), a type of anaerobic cocci with a positive gram stain, is a primary contributor to failures in endodontic treatments. A prior investigation revealed that it was present in 18% of initial infections that occur in the canal and a significant 67% of cases where endodontic procedures were unsuccessful [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> initiates the immune response of the body and hampers the lymphocyte role. It demonstrates resilience in suboptimal nutritional conditions, surviving as a singular microorganism. Additionally, it can infiltrate into the tubular structure of dentin and create biofilms. The formation of a polymeric matrix outside the cell by <italic>E. faecalis</italic> makes bacterial biofilms highly resistant to standard irrigants [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To maintain a bacteria-free environment, intracanal medicaments are employed against root canal bacteria, proving effective against microbes that persist despite mechanical instrumentation and cleaning.</p><p>Studies have shown that the growth of biofilm was reduced by 81.19% after 48 hours of incubation when exposed to 50 &#x003bc;g/ml, one of the single-walled carbon nanotubes, and the production of biofilm was completely inhibited at concentrations of 200 &#x003bc;g ml, one or higher. Single-walled carbon nanotubes exhibited greater effectiveness in inhibiting biofilm formation when present in the early phases of biofilm production [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine are the two most commonly used intracanal medicaments used in endodontic practice. Calcium hydroxide is the most frequently used intracanal medicament because its high alkaline pH appears to inhibit bacterial growth [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several comparative studies using various concentrations of chlorhexidine have shown that a 2% solution has the highest substantivity against root canal bacteria. However, in recent years, bacterial resistance to traditional medicaments has led to the failure of root canal-treated teeth [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Carbon nanotubes, with their unique structure, exhibit a range of fascinating properties that span mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Carbon nanotubes are renowned for their remarkable mechanical attributes. Their tensile strength is notably enhanced due to a senary arrangement, a testament to their robust structure. They exhibit a malleability akin to rubber, allowing them to bend and flex without losing their integrity. Their ductility is also impressive, falling within a range of 8% to 12%, which further underscores their flexibility [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Overall, their exceptional mechanical strength makes them incredibly resilient under stress. On the physical front, carbon nanotubes are characterized by their extensive surface area, which is a key feature in many of their applications. They are incredibly light, contributing to their utility in various lightweight applications. Their high thermal stability ensures that they maintain performance even at elevated temperatures, while their reduced density makes them an efficient material choice for a range of uses. Chemically, carbon nanotubes stand out for their efficient heat conduction, which is a result of their unique atomic arrangement. The superior bonding among the carbon atoms, organized in hexagonal rings, contributes to their overall stability and strength. This arrangement allows them to conduct heat effectively and maintain structural integrity. In the biological realm, carbon nanotubes exhibit properties that can be both beneficial and challenging [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They are known for their improved antimicrobial characteristics, which can be advantageous in medical applications. They possess the ability to perforate bacterial cell membranes, making them a potential tool in combating infections. However, they can also trigger inflammatory and fibrotic responses under certain conditions, highlighting the need for careful consideration in their application [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the diverse properties of carbon nanotubes make them a subject of significant interest across various fields, from materials science to medicine [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The objective of this study is to integrate single-walled carbon nanotubes with conventional medicaments. in order to improve their properties and check their effectiveness against <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The research was planned to be an in vitro assessment to ascertain the antimicrobial effectiveness of two root canal medicaments alone and when used in combination with single-walled carbon nanotubes against <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.

A total of five samples for each solution were prepared and categorized into groups.</p><p>Assessing the antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion method</p><p>After drying the streaked Petri plates, two wells, each with a diameter of 6 mm, were created on every plate. The plates were labeled and distributed in a way that each plate consisted of two solutions, one on each side, to prevent any misinterpretation or overlap due to crowding. Fifty microliters of each solution were dispensed into individual wells using a pipette in the uniformly distributed plates.

The application of intracanal medicament is required for eradicating microbial flora during the root canal treatment process. Failure to achieve this elimination may turn into a chronic periapical infection and the need for subsequent retreatment [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Research indicates that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is commonly the primary and tenacious organism responsible for stubborn endodontic infections [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The intracanal medicament is expected to interrupt biofilms and suppress any remaining bacteria till the duration it is placed inside. It should also enter the tubular structure of dentin without inducing any harm to the peri-radicular structures [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> possesses a high tolerance to harsh environments, primarily due to its resistance to alkali and the presence of different virulence elements. These elements, common to other organisms as well, contribute to the exacerbation of the overall condition. The organism demonstrates genetic polymorphism, the capacity to endure extended spans of food deprivation, and the capacity to bind to protein structures that enable it to adhere to the dentinal surface [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this study, single-walled carbon nanotubes (Group I) showed a fairly good zone of inhibition, measuring 18 mm on average among all samples (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Antimicrobial activity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (Group I) and single-walled carbon nanotubes + calcium hydroxide (Group IV)</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0016-00000074626-i04" position="float"/></fig><p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes + calcium hydroxide (Group IV) showed no clearly demarcated zone of inhibition.

This interaction further results in the disruption of the cell membrane. Additionally, these nanotubes exhibit stability and a high potential for functionalization [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The intracanal medicaments frequently employed include calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine. Some studies have raised doubts about the effectiveness of calcium hydroxide in bringing down the bacterial load due to dentin&#x02019;s capacity to act as a buffer, the resilience of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> to hydroxyl ions, and its limited dispersibility and circulating characteristics [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In earlier research, different carriers have been incorporated into calcium hydroxide to enhance its properties. The efficacy of chlorhexidine, particularly against <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, is well-established; its effectiveness is linked to its biguanide nature, which engages with the surface of the bacteria that is negatively charged [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have examined and compared the effectiveness of chlorhexidine, calcium hydroxide as a single agent, and calcium hydroxide when mixed with other intracanal medicaments.

The chlorhexidine solution also created a region of inhibition against the microorganism utilized in this research. The study indicated that the antimicrobial efficacy of the single-walled carbon nanotubes-chlorhexidine solution surpassed that of the single-walled carbon nanotubes solution and the 2% chlorhexidine used independently. The single-walled carbon nanotubes-calcium hydroxide solution group has shown better antibacterial properties if compared to the calcium hydroxide group independently, but it is still negligible.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve human participants or tissue.</p><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Kingston Chellapandian, Binita Saha</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Kingston Chellapandian, Binita Saha, Vijay Venkatesh</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Kingston Chellapandian, Binita Saha, Vijay Venkatesh</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Kingston Chellapandian, Binita Saha, Vijay Venkatesh</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Kingston Chellapandian, Binita Saha, Vijay Venkatesh</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Carbon nanotube-based surfaces: Effect on the inhibition of single- and dual-species biofilms of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis</article-title><source>Res Surf Interfac</source><person-group>
