Emerging technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) offer data-driven solutions to optimize surgical workflows, particularly when integrated with structured project planning principles. This systematic review evaluated how NLP and ML techniques, grounded in project management methodologies, can enhance OR management by improving surgical scheduling, workflow efficiency, and resource utilization. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library was conducted between January 1, 2020, and March 15, 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines.&#x000a0;Inclusion criteria focused on studies applying NLP or ML to surgical workflow analysis within a project planning framework. Primary outcomes included improvements in surgical duration prediction, post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) length-of-stay estimation, and OR scheduling efficiency. Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria, encompassing diverse surgical specialties and geographical settings. Most employed retrospective observational designs using ML models such as ensemble learning, neural networks, and regression-based algorithms. Several studies demonstrated that ML models significantly outperformed traditional scheduling and prediction approaches, while NLP, particularly ClinicalBERT, improved accuracy when analyzing unstructured clinical texts. Risk of bias assessment using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) revealed that five studies were of low risk, eight moderate risk, and six high risk, primarily due to limitations in analysis and external validation. Overall, integrating NLP and ML with project planning principles presents a promising approach to optimizing OR workflows, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving patient outcomes. However, broader clinical adoption will require cross-institutional validation, improved interpretability, and ethical artificial intelligence (AI) governance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>natural language processing</kwd><kwd>operating room management</kwd><kwd>project planning</kwd><kwd>surgical workflow</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>The operating room (OR) is one of the most critical and resource-intensive units in a hospital, requiring the precise coordination of personnel, equipment, and time to ensure efficient surgical workflows and optimal patient outcomes [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative care, OR management remains a complex challenge, often plagued by inefficiencies such as scheduling delays, workflow disruptions, and suboptimal resource allocation [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Traditionally, these processes have relied on manual scheduling, surgeon estimates, and heuristic-based decision-making. However, such approaches often lack adaptability to the dynamic nature of surgical environments, resulting in increased healthcare costs, prolonged patient wait times, and heightened staff fatigue or burnout [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as transformative tools in healthcare, offering data-driven solutions to optimize both clinical and operational workflows [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among these technologies, natural language processing (NLP), a branch of AI focused on analyzing and interpreting human language, has demonstrated considerable potential for extracting actionable insights from unstructured clinical narratives, including surgical reports and intraoperative documentation [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When combined with structured project planning principles, NLP and ML tools can enhance surgical workflow by enabling precise time estimations, streamlining documentation, and identifying potential delays or inefficiencies.</p><p>For clarity, project planning principles refer to established methods used to plan, monitor, and optimize complex workflows. Critical path analysis is a technique used to determine the longest sequence of dependent tasks, identifying the minimum completion time for a project. Resource leveling involves adjusting the schedule to ensure that resource demand does not exceed availability, helping to prevent bottlenecks. Lean management focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing value by improving workflow efficiency through continuous improvement. Integrating these concepts with AI methods provides a structured approach to predict case durations, sequence tasks, and allocate personnel or equipment efficiently [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>To illustrate, consider a hospital struggling with unpredictable surgery durations and frequent delays in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) availability. Using ML algorithms trained on historical surgical data, the system could more accurately predict how long each procedure will take, allowing for more efficient scheduling. Simultaneously, NLP can analyze operative notes in real time to flag complications that may affect PACU stay, enabling better coordination between surgical and recovery teams. Such applications exemplify the clinical relevance of these tools in improving workflow and resource allocation.</p><p>While previous reviews have explored aspects of surgical workflow optimization, they have largely focused on either phase recognition in minimally invasive surgery [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or predictive modeling for scheduling tasks [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Few have addressed the synergistic potential of NLP and ML when combined with project planning methodologies to enhance OR efficiency. Additionally, although project management frameworks like Six Sigma and Agile have been successfully applied in broader healthcare operations [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], their integration into AI-driven OR management remains limited and underexplored.</p><p>This systematic review aims to bridge these gaps by synthesizing current evidence on how NLP and ML techniques, grounded in structured project planning principles, can be leveraged to enhance surgical scheduling, reduce workflow variability, and improve overall resource utilization within the OR setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Methodology</p><p>Study Protocol</p><p>This systematic review followed the&#x000a0;Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]&#x000a0;to ensure methodological transparency and reproducibility. The study was designed to systematically identify, evaluate, and synthesize existing literature on applying NLP and ML techniques in optimizing surgical workflows through project planning principles.&#x000a0;No formal protocol was registered for this review. This is acknowledged as a limitation and may affect auditability.</p><p>Search Strategy</p><p>A comprehensive and structured literature search was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library. The search strategy combined keywords and controlled vocabulary (e.g., Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms) related to "natural language processing", "machine learning", "surgical workflow", "operating room", "project planning", and "workflow optimization". Boolean operators (AND, OR) were employed to refine the search and capture relevant studies. The detailed search strategy for each database is provided in Appendix 1. The search was limited to articles published in English from January 2020 to March 2025 to reflect the most current developments in computational technologies and clinical implementation. Reference lists of included studies were also hand-searched to identify additional eligible papers.</p><p>Eligibility Criteria</p><p>Studies were included if they (1) involved the application of NLP and/or ML techniques to surgical workflow analysis or OR process improvement; (2) explicitly discussed elements of project planning or workflow modeling such as task sequencing, resource allocation, time prediction, or process optimization; (3) were original peer-reviewed research articles; and (4) provided empirical findings based on real-world data or simulated OR environments. Exclusion criteria encompassed review articles, conference abstracts without full text, editorials, opinion papers, and studies lacking any reference to planning frameworks or algorithmic implementation in the OR setting.</p><p>Study Selection</p><p>All retrieved records were imported into EndNote X9 reference management software (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA), and duplicates were removed. Two independent reviewers (AU and PK) from the list of authors performed the initial screening of titles and abstracts based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion, and when consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted. Full-text screening was then conducted on all potentially eligible studies, with reasons for exclusion documented at each stage. The PRISMA flow diagram was used to illustrate the study selection process.</p><p>Data Extraction</p><p>A standardized Microsoft Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) sheet was developed and piloted to collect relevant information systematically from the included studies. Extracted data included study characteristics (authors, year, and country), methodological aspects (study design, data sources, and sample size), technical approaches, and outcomes. Additionally, any integration of project planning principles, such as Gantt charting, critical path method, or scheduling models, was documented and synthesized.</p><p>Quality Assessment</p><p>To evaluate the methodological rigor and internal validity of the included studies, the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was utilized. This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of bias in studies developing, validating, or updating prediction models, including those employing ML and AI techniques. Each study was independently assessed across four domains: participants, predictors, outcomes, and analysis. Each domain was rated as "low," "moderate," or "high" risk of bias based on predefined signaling questions and criteria provided by PROBAST. An overall risk of bias judgment was assigned based on the cumulative domain ratings, with special attention given to the analysis domain due to its critical influence on the performance and reliability of ML models. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through consensus discussion.</p><p>Data Synthesis</p><p>Due to the heterogeneity in study designs, algorithmic approaches, and outcome measures, a meta-analysis was not feasible. Instead, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted. Studies were grouped thematically based on the primary NLP or ML application area, such as surgical scheduling, intraoperative phase recognition, instrument tracking, or OR team communication analysis. Within each theme, findings were synthesized with attention to how project planning methodologies were operationalized, the role of predictive analytics, and the demonstrated impact on workflow efficiency or patient safety.</p><p>Results</p><p>Study Selection Process</p><p>A comprehensive literature search across five major databases, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, yielded a total of 313 records. Following the removal of 194 duplicate entries, 119 unique records were subjected to title screening. Of these, 72 were excluded for lacking relevance to the research objectives. The remaining 47 articles were sought for full-text retrieval, of which 13 could not be obtained. A total of 34 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. During this phase, 15 studies were excluded for reasons including article type (review articles or editorial letters; n = 9), lack of focus on OR environments (n = 3), or failure to meet inclusion criteria concerning ML and NLP (n = 3). The details of these excluded studies are provided in Appendix 2. Ultimately, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Literature search flow diagram based on PRISMA</title><p>PRISMA:&#x000a0;Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses;&#x000a0;IEEE:&#x000a0;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers;&#x000a0;ACM:&#x000a0;Association for Computing Machinery; ML:&#x000a0;machine learning;&#x000a0;NLP:&#x000a0;natural language processing</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082796-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Characteristics of Included Studies</p><p>This systematic review included 19 studies [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] published between 2020 and 2025, reflecting a growing interest in the application of NLP and ML to optimize surgical workflow through project planning principles.

Sample sizes varied significantly, from as few as 20 cases [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to over 124,000 surgeries [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], illustrating both pilot-scale implementations and large-scale deployments of ML models in OR settings. The primary objectives of the studies included predicting surgical duration, estimating PACU length of stay (LOS), scheduling optimization, and overall OR efficiency.</p><p>A diverse array of AI models was employed across the studies, ranging from traditional regression techniques and logistic regression to more complex models such as feedforward neural networks, random forest (RF) classifiers, support vector machines (SVMs), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), categorical boosting (CatBoost), and ensemble learning approaches [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Some studies integrated hybrid frameworks or heuristic methods, including particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], to enhance scheduling efficiency and model accuracy. Additionally, advanced NLP tools like the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Clinical Texts (ClinicalBERT) were leveraged for the improved prediction of surgical case duration based on unstructured radiology reports [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Key findings across the studies consistently demonstrated that ML models outperformed traditional statistical or experience-based methods in predicting surgical time and optimizing OR workflow. Several models achieved high accuracy and significantly reduced resource waste, overtime costs, and delays. Notably, Gabriel et al. [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that balanced ensemble models could accurately forecast surgery end times and discharge timings, supporting real-time decision-making in outpatient surgery centers. Similarly, Rozario and Rozario [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] highlighted financial and operational benefits, reporting a 21% reduction in nursing overtime and projected cost savings exceeding $400,000 over three years following ML-based scheduling interventions.</p><p>The included studies provide robust evidence supporting the integration of ML and NLP techniques in surgical workflow optimization. They collectively underscore the potential for these technologies to align with project planning principles by enabling accurate task estimation, dynamic scheduling, and data-driven resource management in complex surgical ecosystems.</p><p>Quality Assessment Results</p><p>The risk of bias assessment revealed that the overall methodological quality of the included studies was variable, with most studies exhibiting a moderate risk of bias. Among the 19 included studies, five were assessed as low risk overall, while six exhibited a high risk, primarily due to limitations in the analysis domain, such as lack of external validation, incomplete reporting of model performance metrics, and insufficient handling of overfitting. The participants and predictors domains generally showed low risk across studies, indicating appropriate cohort selection and relevant feature inclusion. However, a few studies [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] had unclear or limited participant eligibility criteria, leading to a moderate-risk rating. The outcome domain was largely well-defined but occasionally lacked standardized outcome assessment procedures. Notably, high-risk ratings in the analysis domain were attributed to inadequate statistical rigor or insufficient reporting of model calibration and validation. These findings underscore the need for greater adherence to methodological transparency and reporting standards such as transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD)-AI in future ML-based surgical workflow research (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Quality assessment of the included studies using PROBAST</title><p>PROBAST:&#x000a0;Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participants</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Predictors</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overall risk of bias</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Martinez et al.

The findings collectively underscore the transformative potential of data-driven technologies in predicting surgical durations, managing surgical demand, enhancing resource allocation, and ultimately improving operational efficiency in the surgical domain. Across diverse geographical settings, study designs, and surgical specializations, ML models consistently outperformed traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches in accuracy, adaptability, and predictive strength.</p><p>Model Performance Across Clinical Applications</p><p>A dominant theme across the studies was the successful application of ML models in predicting surgical durations, a key metric for OR efficiency. Martinez et al. [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated the superiority of bagged regression trees over conventional scheduling strategies by significantly reducing prediction error. Similarly, Jiao et al. [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] used a modular artificial neural network (ANN) framework that not only improved the estimation of surgical time but also identified overtime-prone cases. These findings are corroborated by Chu et al. [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], who implemented multiple models, including ANN, RF, XGBoost, and convolutional neural network (CNN), and found that department-specific XGBoost models yielded minimal errors, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 31.6 minutes and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.71.</p><p>Other studies echoed this trend. For instance, Lam et al. [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] validated the use of CatBoost models in colorectal surgeries across international sites, outperforming traditional moving average baselines. Likewise, Abbou et al. [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] employed XGBoost to predict the duration of stay with an explanatory power nearing 70% variance, while Adams et al. [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] highlighted the utility of incorporating medical ontological knowledge to improve the accuracy of linear regression-based predictions. These studies illustrate the multifaceted advantages of integrating structured domain knowledge and project planning methodologies into AI systems.</p><p>Studies focusing on real-time or near-real-time applications revealed similar improvements in system responsiveness and decision support. For example, Gabriel et al. [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showcased the effectiveness of ensemble models, including balanced bagging classifiers, in predicting surgery completion and discharge timings, contributing to better scheduling and perioperative throughput. In the context of specialty surgeries, Miller et al. [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Yeo et al. [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] applied ML models to otolaryngology and total knee arthroplasty, respectively, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and highlighting the relevance of demographic and perioperative variables, such as body mass index (BMI) and use of tranexamic acid.</p><p>NLP-Specific Advantages and Limitations</p><p>A noteworthy innovation in NLP was illustrated by Zhong et al. [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], who integrated ClinicalBERT with neural networks to extract predictive insights from unstructured radiology reports. This approach nearly doubled the prediction accuracy from 26.8% to 58.9%, underscoring the underexplored potential of NLP in surgical planning. This aligns with broader trends in biomedical informatics, where the convergence of NLP with electronic health records (EHRs) is being leveraged for clinical decision support.</p><p>In terms of resource and demand management, Hassanzadeh et al. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] used a wide array of ML algorithms, including XGBoost and RF, to forecast daily surgical caseloads with approximately 90% accuracy. Such predictive capability is crucial for strategic planning and can support dynamic staff allocation, inventory management, and OR utilization. This capability is further extended by Rozario and Rozario [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whose application of Google OR Tools achieved a 21% reduction in nursing overtime and projected substantial cost savings. Eshghali et al. [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] further advanced the planning discourse by integrating heuristic optimization techniques, like particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in elective and emergency scheduling.</p><p>A different but complementary focus was seen in the studies that addressed PACU LOS prediction. Schulz et al. [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Cao et al. [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and Tully et al. [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] adopted ML models ranging from least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to RF classifiers and ensemble techniques to forecast PACU LOS, which is crucial for recovery bed turnover and resource scheduling. These studies indicate that ML-driven forecasting can reduce after-hours staffing demands and improve continuity of care.</p><p>Need for Prospective Validation and Standardization</p><p>Interestingly, only one randomized controlled trial [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was identified among the included studies. Their RF-based model significantly improved surgical scheduling accuracy and reduced patient wait times without compromising surgeon efficiency. This finding emphasizes the value of prospective validation in real-world settings and calls attention to the need for higher levels of evidence in ML-based interventions.</p><p>While the results are promising, this review also identified common limitations. First, the generalizability of many models remains constrained due to single-institution data, retrospective designs, and lack of external validation. For instance, although Chu et al. [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Gabriel et al. [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] demonstrated high model accuracy, their models were trained and validated on institution-specific data, limiting their scalability. Moreover, few studies reported model calibration or sensitivity analyses or handled missing data rigorously, which are critical factors in robust model development.</p><p>Another underexplored area is the integration of project planning tools, such as Gantt charts, critical path method, or real-time rescheduling algorithms, within the ML frameworks. Although several studies implicitly applied planning logic, explicit adoption of project management software or techniques remains scarce [<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Embedding formalized planning principles could enhance the interpretability and operationalizability of ML outputs in high-stakes clinical environments.</p><p>Ethical and Interpretability Considerations</p><p>Ethical and practical considerations are increasingly central to the adoption of AI in high-stakes environments such as the OR. While many studies demonstrated technical success, few engaged deeply with the broader ethical implications, particularly around transparency, interpretability, and fairness [<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These gaps are critical, given the growing body of peer-reviewed literature emphasizing the importance of trustworthy AI in healthcare.</p><p>For instance, researchers have highlighted that opaque "black-box" models can undermine clinician trust and hinder accountability in clinical decision-making [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Ensuring interpretability is not just a technical challenge but a clinical necessity, especially in perioperative settings where decisions often carry significant risks. Moreover, fairness in model development and deployment is essential to avoid systemic biases that could disproportionately affect vulnerable patient populations [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="REF38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In addition, clinical accountability demands robust post-deployment monitoring and continuous evaluation of AI tools within dynamic surgical environments. Without transparent reporting and clinician-AI collaboration frameworks, unintended consequences may arise, such as overreliance on automated recommendations or inequitable care delivery.</p><p>This systematic review reinforces that ML and NLP technologies, when aligned with project planning principles, hold immense potential to transform surgical workflows. From predictive modeling of case durations and demand forecasting to NLP-enhanced documentation and PACU optimization, these tools offer tangible opportunities to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. However, realizing these benefits will require adherence to rigorous methodological and ethical standards, peer-reviewed validation across diverse settings, and transparent integration into clinical practice. The future of surgical operations lies at the intersection of intelligent systems, structured planning, and ethically grounded implementation, a convergence this review strongly advocates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current review provides compelling evidence that the integration of ML and NLP within the framework of project planning principles holds substantial promise for advancing surgical workflow optimization and OR management. Across diverse methodological contexts and clinical settings, the reviewed studies consistently demonstrated the superiority of data-driven approaches over conventional methods in forecasting surgical durations, streamlining perioperative logistics, and enhancing the predictability of postoperative care demands. The deployment of advanced algorithms, including ensemble models and deep learning architectures, along with the incorporation of ontological knowledge and unstructured clinical narratives, underscores the multifaceted potential of AI-driven innovation in the surgical domain. Nonetheless, the translational impact of these technologies is contingent upon rigorous external validation, the standardization of reporting practices, and the development of interpretable, ethically aligned models capable of functioning in high-stakes environments. As surgical systems evolve toward greater complexity and demand, the convergence of intelligent computational tools with structured planning methodologies emerges not merely as an opportunity but as an imperative for the next generation of evidence-based, precision-guided operative care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0;
