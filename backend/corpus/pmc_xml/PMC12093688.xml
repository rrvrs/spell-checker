Lifestyle treatment, including dietary modification, increased moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and behavioral support remains the cornerstone for obesity treatment and typically elicits 5&#x02013;10% weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A variety of individual-level, social, environmental, and other factors may influence the magnitude of weight loss during behavioral weight loss treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition to these factors, behavioral adherence is an important factor in weight management. Specifically, engagement in high amounts of bouted MVPA (i.e., MVPA accumulated in bouts&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min) has been associated with long-term weight loss maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Evidence from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) has shown that individuals maintaining a significant amount of weight loss (e.g., &#x02265;&#x02009;13.6&#x000a0;kg for &#x02265;&#x02009;1 year) engage in ~&#x02009;275&#x000a0;min/wk of objectively measured bouted MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The importance of bouted MVPA for long-term weight loss has also been confirmed in secondary analyses of behavioral weight loss interventions with individuals achieving the highest weight loss also engaging in the highest amount of bouted MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A limitation of this prior literature is that most studies examine the association between concurrent MVPA engagement and weight loss maintenance. Studies examining whether engagement in MVPA early on in an intervention is predictive of future weight loss or weight loss maintenance are lacking.</p><p id="Par8">In addition to the volume of MVPA, the timing (i.e., time of day) of bouted MVPA may influence weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Some evidence suggests that morning exercise leads to greater weight loss compared to evening exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Further, Creasy et al. found that weight loss maintainers engage in high amounts of MVPA within 3&#x000a0;h of waking up, suggesting a potential body weight regulation benefit for this time of day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, not all studies agree that MVPA at a specific time of day elicits superior weight management benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Evidence on whether the timing of MVPA affects changes in body weight, body composition, or aerobic capacity during a behavioral weight loss intervention is needed.</p><p id="Par9">The primary purpose of this secondary data analysis was to examine the association between changes in bouted MVPA early on in a behavioral weight loss intervention on long-term changes in weight loss, fat mass loss, and aerobic capacity (i.e. 6&#x02013;12 months later). In addition, we examined whether the time of day of bouted MVPA, (i.e., regular engagement in the morning vs. evening) affected changes in weight, fat mass, and aerobic capacity. We hypothesized that engaging in higher amounts of MVPA and morning MVPA would be associated with greater reductions in weight and fat mass and greater increases in aerobic capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par10">This was a secondary analysis of adults (18&#x02013;55 years) with overweight or obesity (BMI 27&#x02013;42&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who completed an 18-month behavioral weight loss intervention (NCT01985568) in the Denver metro area from 2014 to 2018. Details on the methods, participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and primary findings have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The intervention included a calorie-restricted diet (1200&#x02013;1800&#x000a0;kcal/d), provision of supervised aerobic exercise for 6 months, a recommendation to engage in bouted MVPA (300&#x000a0;min/wk), and group behavioral support. The study was originally designed to examine the effect of initiating exercise at the onset of the behavioral weight loss intervention (Standard) vs. initiating exercise 6 months later following initial weight loss from diet-only (Sequential) on long-term weight loss and aerobic capacity. All aspects of this study were approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board and participants provided written informed consent prior to engaging in study-related procedures. Individuals who passed the telephone questionnaire were invited to complete a screening visit, including a health history and physical exam by the study physician. Individuals were excluded for known cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, some forms of cancer, previous weight loss surgery, &#x0003e;&#x02009;5% change in body weight during the previous 6 months, regular engagement in &#x0003e;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;min/wk of exercise, current use of medications known to affect appetite, weight, or energy metabolism, or any medical conditions that contraindicated exercise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Behavioral weight loss intervention</title><p id="Par11">Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Standard or Sequential intervention arms. Both groups received an identical 18-month group-based behavioral weight loss program that included a 6-month supervised exercise program. The only difference between groups was the timing of initiation of the supervised exercise program: Standard initiated supervised exercise at month 0, whereas Sequential initiated supervised exercise at month 6. Frequency of aerobic exercise progressed from 3 to 5 days per week and all exercise was prescribed at a moderate intensity which was monitored using heart rate monitors (Polar Electro, Bethpage, NY). Exercise session duration progressed from 20 to 60&#x000a0;min (60&#x000a0;min/wk to 300&#x000a0;min/wk). Following the exercise ramp up, participants were recommended to complete supervised exercise 5 days per week and 60&#x000a0;min per day (300&#x000a0;min/wk) at moderate intensity (65&#x02013;75% heart rate maximum). Participants could complete supervised exercise between 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Following the 6-month supervised exercise program, participants were encouraged to continue engaging in &#x02265;&#x02009;300&#x000a0;min/wk of bouted MVPA on their own through month 18. No recommendations about exercising before or after meals (i.e., fasted vs. fed exercise) were made. Participants received complimentary access to the fitness facility from the beginning of the supervised exercise program through the remainder of the study. Participants were prescribed a calorie-restricted diet (1200&#x02013;1800&#x000a0;kcal/d) throughout the 18-month study which was individually determined based on estimated basal metabolic rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Participants also received group-based behavioral support (provided by a trained registered dietitian). Behavioral support was provided weekly for weeks 0&#x02013;20, every other week for weeks 21&#x02013;26, and monthly for weeks 27&#x02013;78.

Body composition (i.e., fat mass and fat free mass) was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic QDR Series; Bedford, MA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patterns of physical activity</title><p id="Par14">Patterns of physical activity, including sedentary behavior (SB, &#x0003c;&#x02009;1.5 metabolic equivalents), light-intensity physical activity (LPA, 1.5&#x02013;2.99 metabolic equivalents), and MVPA (&#x02265;&#x02009;3.0 metabolic equivalents) were assessed using the SenseWear armband (BodyMedia Inc; Pittsburgh, PA). Participants were asked to wear the armband for 24&#x000a0;h/d over seven consecutive days at each assessment. Physical activity data were included in the analysis if they met validity criteria (&#x0003e;&#x02009;22.8&#x000a0;h/d of weartime and &#x0003e;&#x02009;4 days of wear with &#x02265;&#x02009;1 weekend day). MVPA was calculated in &#x02265;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;min, &#x02265;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;min, and &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min bouts. Because MVPA was encouraged in bouts of &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min and due to minimal changes in the other bout categories (i.e., MVPA in bouts of &#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min), we chose to categorize participants based on changes in bouts of &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min. Participants were classified based on measured change in MVPA accumulated in bouts of &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min from baseline to the end of the 6-month supervised program (month 6 if randomized to Standard or 12 if randomized to Sequential). These timepoints were selected to correspond with the supervised exercise program when adherence to the bouted MVPA recommendation was likely the highest. Participants were categorized based on whether they increased MVPA accumulated in bouts&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min by &#x02265;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;min/wk from baseline to the end of the 6-month supervised exercise program (yes/no). When examining the time-of-day effects, only participants classified as increasing bouted MVPA by &#x02265;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;min/wk were included. Participants were classified as AM-Active if the majority (&#x02265;&#x02009;50%) of their bouted MVPA minutes throughout the week occurred from prior to 12:00 PM, and participants were classified as PM-Active if the majority of their bouted MVPA minutes occurred after 12:00 PM based on data from the SenseWear armband. This method accurately defined those who were active in the morning vs. evening. The four most active one-hour time windows for the AM group were 5 AM, 6AM, 7AM, and 8AM. The four most active one-hour time windows for the PM group were noon, 4PM, 5PM, 6PM. Other timing categories were considered; however, due to sample size, we could only dichotomize the variable. In addition, we ran sensitivity analyses to examine the whether using different AM and PM timing criteria affected our results, and we found no evidence that choosing different criteria significantly affected our results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Maximal aerobic capacity</title><p id="Par15">Maximal aerobic capacity was assessed using a treadmill protocol and indirect calorimetry. A modified Balke protocol was utilized. Participants were instructed to continue exercising until volitional exhaustion.

Similarly, linear regression was utilized to examine potential differences for change in weight, fat mass, aerobic capacity, and patterns of physical activity between participants classified as AM-Active and PM-Active. For the purposes of these analyses, all participants with complete data were included. We previously found that the intervention arm did not differentially affect diet, physical activity, weight loss, or cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, all models were run unadjusted and adjusted for randomized group. Results were similar so only those adjusted for randomized group are reported. A p-value of &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.

These findings suggest that engaging in greater amounts of bouted MVPA during a behavioral weight loss intervention that includes both caloric restriction and supervised exercise, results in enhanced long-term weight loss and fitness benefits. In addition, these findings suggest that engaging in bouted MVPA at any time of the day positively impacts weight loss and aerobic capacity during a behavioral weight loss intervention.</p><p id="Par28">MVPA is one of strongest predictors of weight loss maintenance. Jakicic et al. first showed that long-term weight loss and weight loss maintenance were associated with high amounts (~&#x02009;200&#x000a0;min/wk) of self-reported MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. More recently, Jakicic et al. found that individuals maintaining a weight loss of &#x02265;&#x02009;10% at month 18 of a behavioral weight loss program engaged in the highest amount of MVPA (200&#x02013;300&#x000a0;min/wk) accumulated in bouts of &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Consistent with those results, we found that greater increases in bouted MVPA at the end of the 6-month supervised exercise program was associated with greater weight loss and fat mass loss at month 18. This finding suggests that increasing structured bouts of MVPA (i.e., bouts&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min), which are more commonly thought of as exercise, may be important for long-term weight loss. In this study, every 30&#x000a0;min/wk increase in bouted MVPA was associated with an increase in weight loss of 3.5&#x000a0;kg. The importance of bouted MVPA is also supported by a previous study that found that individuals achieving a&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10% weight loss at 18 months had significantly greater steps accumulated in bouts of &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min (~&#x02009;3,500 steps/d) compared to individuals who lost less weight over the course of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further supporting the weight loss benefits of longer bouts of MVPA, Creasy et al. recently found that successful weight loss maintainers (i.e., individuals maintaining a weight loss of &#x02265;&#x02009;13.6&#x000a0;kg for &#x02265;&#x02009;1 year) engaged in longer bouts (&#x02265;&#x02009;10, &#x02265;&#x02009;30, &#x02265;60&#x000a0;min bouts) of MVPA compared to controls with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans have shifted to focus on total MVPA accumulation rather than bouted MVPA accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A recent cross-sectional analysis found that the manner in which MVPA is accumulated (i.e., bouted vs. non-bouted) may alter cardiometabolic profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For weight management specifically, more research is needed to understand the behavioral and physiological differences between bouted and total MVPA accumulation.</p><p id="Par29">Similar to the weight loss findings, we found that individuals with greater increases in bouted MVPA demonstrated greater increases in aerobic capacity compared to individuals with lesser increases in bouted MVPA. When examining changes in absolute aerobic capacity (L/Min), the effect was diminished suggesting the change in weight was the primary driver of the increase in relative fitness. Standard behavioral weight loss interventions which include physical activity typically result in modest increases in aerobic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], similar to what was observed in the current study. While the focus of lifestyle treatment of obesity is often on weight loss, the cardiometabolic protection from greater aerobic fitness cannot be understated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Higher aerobic capacity greatly attenuates the mortality risk associated with having a higher BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Due to the protective effects of increased fitness, lifestyle treatment of obesity should have a continued focus on strategies to increase MVPA and improve aerobic capacity. Further, future research is needed to identify the effective strategies for increasing and maintaining fitness after weight loss.</p><p id="Par30">The timing of MVPA and exercise may affect weight loss and other clinical outcomes like aerobic capacity, fat mass, and glucose control. Some studies have found that morning exercise produces superior weight loss benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] while other studies have found that evening exercise elicits greater fat mass loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Other studies have found no difference in weight change between morning versus evening exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The current results aligns with the latter, as individuals who increased bout MVPA and were more active in the morning had similar changes in weight and body composition at 18 months compared to individuals who were more active in the afternoon/evening. This is a positive message as increasing MVPA can be encouraged at any time of day for weight management. There are limitations to our analysis which may explain why we failed to observe significant differences in weight change between morning activity and afternoon/evening activity including limited statistical power, use of a dichotomous time-based variable rather than a circadian based definition of morning and afternoon/evening, lack of divergence in AM vs. PM activity stimuli between groups (i.e., contamination between groups), or lack of consistency in MVPA timing throughout the study as individuals were only classified based on MVPA timing during the supervised exercise program. Further, time of day for exercise was not specified as part of the prescription in this study, thus, other confounders, such as chronotype, may have impacted our results.</p><p id="Par31">Two recent studies by Schumacher et al. found that early morning physical activity is most prevalent in successful weight loss maintainers and that consistent timing of physical activity is associated with higher amounts of MVPA engagement among successful weight loss maintainers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, consistent timing of activity was associated with greater automaticity (i.e., greater likelihood of habit formation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Both early morning activity and greater automaticity were associated with a more stable exercise pattern over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, consistent timing of activity may be particularly important in a standard behavioral weight loss intervention when previously inactive individuals are attempting to increase MVPA. Further, consistent timing of MVPA may have beneficial metabolic effects due to underlying circadian physiology. A review by Chtourou and Souissi found that consistent training at a certain time of day improved exercise performance at that time of day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This suggests that consistent timing of MVPA day-to-day may prime the body to perform best at that time of day. To date, there have been limited investigations into the importance of consistent timing of MVPA. Future prospective studies are needed to understand how consistent timing of activity influences weight loss and other clinical outcomes during a behavioral weight loss intervention.</p><p id="Par32">This analysis does not come without limitations. This was a secondary data analysis, and the original study was not designed or powered for the present analysis. Another limitation is that the provision of supervised exercise occurring at different timepoints in the study (0&#x02013;6 months in Standard and 6&#x02013;12 months in Sequential). We controlled for this limitation by classifying participants based on bouted MVPA at the timepoint engagement in bouted MVPA would likely be highest (i.e., near the end of supervised exercise program) and we statistically controlled for randomized arm; however, there may have been other confounders that influenced our results. We also recognize that there are many other ways we could have categorized participants based on MVPA engagement. The chosen categories did identify two distinct groups (i.e., individuals who are highly active in the morning vs. individuals who are highly active in the afternoon/evening). In sensitivity analyses using different time characterization, results were similar. A larger sample is necessary to examine more discrete time windows. Using minutes per week to define MVPA engagement can result in differences in exercise energy expenditure. For example, 150&#x000a0;min of exercise may result up to 2000&#x000a0;kcal of exercise energy expenditure in larger, male subjects while 150&#x000a0;min of exercise may only result in ~&#x02009;800&#x000a0;kcal of exercise energy expenditure in smaller female subjects. These differences in exercise energy expenditure may confound our findings. Thus, it is possible that using other MVPA criteria to define these activity categories would have led to different findings. The current criteria were chosen to maximize sample size in each group while also having significant heterogeneity between groups. In addition, these criteria were chosen based on previous guidelines and recommendations for physical activity. In addition, it is possible that the measurement of MVPA used to categorize subjects was not reflective of habitual behavior as the armband was only worn for one week at each timepoint.</p><p id="Par33">Another limitation of this study is that our outcomes (body weight and cardiorespiratory fitness) could have been influenced by other factors besides MVPA engagement. For example, the behavioral intervention included recommendations for caloric restriction, and dietary adherence likely influenced weight change. Moreover, there may have been an interaction between physical activity behavior and energy intake adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, our measures of dietary behavior were limited and had significant underreporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, energy status prior to exercise (i.e., fasted vs. fed exercise) may have influenced our results, but energy status was not collected as part of this study. Similarly, changes in fitness could have been due to a learning effect, as the majority of participants had not completed a maximal aerobic capacity test prior to enrollment in this study. We are unable to discern whether changes in fitness were due to a learning effect vs. a training effect. Despite these limitations, this analysis provides further support that increasing bouted MVPA by &#x02265;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;min/wk from baseline levels improves weight loss and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">In summary, we found that individuals who demonstrated greater increases in MVPA accumulated in bouts of &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;min during the 6-month supervised exercise program lost more weight, more fat mass, and had greater improvements in aerobic capacity compared to individuals who engaged in lower amounts of bouted MVPA during an 18-month behavioral weight loss program. Amongst the highly active participants, engaging in more morning or afternoon/evening activity did not significantly affect change in weight, body composition, or fitness. Pending future evidence from randomized studies, MVPA should continue to be encouraged at any time of the day.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants of this study as well as the Colorado Clinical and Translational Research Center staff who assisted with data collection.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>VAC designed the original study and obtained funding.
