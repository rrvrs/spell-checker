Further assessment of their clinical potential requires evaluation in immunocompetent RD disease models with effective immune suppression. We characterized safety and efficacy profiles of both donor tissues and prospective immunosuppressive treatments in vitro; and in vivo in immunocompetent RD rats (strain <italic>SD-foxn1 Tg(S334ter)3Lav</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Retinal identity of ROs was validated by histology, flow cytometry and gene expression profiling, and their immunogenicity to sensitized human immune cells was measured by mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR). We measured the effect of RO exposure for 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks to therapeutic concentrations of our immunosuppressant drugs of choice on gene expression and metabolic function using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and functional and structural fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), respectively. Immunocompetent RD graft recipients were immunosuppressed by implanted tacrolimus (TAC) pellets and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in food. In vivo, LCMS aided assessments of drug pharmacodynamics. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping and assay of post-surgery cytokines were used to assess and monitor drug efficacy. Retinal transplants were imaged in situ using optical coherence tomography (OCT) at defined time points post-surgery. Visual function was assessed by optokinetic tests (OKT) and superior colliculus electrophysiology recording. At study endpoints, immune cell infiltration and donor photoreceptor engraftment into host retinal architecture was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Immunosuppressive drugs have no negative effects on RO development and metabolism in vitro; and low alloreactivity of ROs determined by MLR may be predictive to that of human graft recipients. In vivo, minimum effective dosing ranges of TAC and MMF were determined. We characterized the mechanisms and critical immune populations implicated in rejection; and subsequently demonstrated their effective suppression in our xenograft RD model. OKT measured significant visual improvement after RO transplantation. Transplants developed most retinal cell types including photoreceptors; and integrated with the host retina. However, immunosuppression induced higher sensitivity to ketamine anesthesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This study proves the concept that immunosuppression is likely tolerable in retinal transplantation and human stem cell therapy for retinal degeneration patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par5">

Specifically, RD caused by functional mutations such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) which afflicts 1 in 4000 in the U.S. and 1 in 5000 worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have relatively early onset, quick progression to vision loss, and are more intractable to preventive measures and treatments. Restorative cell replacement therapies using stem cell derived photoreceptors have been explored as an investigative model and potential treatment option for replenishing diminished PR population and function resulting from RP, thereby serving as a possible renewable source of functional, non-mutant photoreceptors that may act to preserve visual response. Many investigators have developed protocols to differentiate pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into 3D retinal organoids (ROs). ROs develop the 3 principal types and strata of phototransduction neurons of the retina, photoreceptors, interneurons (bipolar, amacrine) and retinal ganglion cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Photoreceptors (rods and cones) are enriched in spherical 3D structures and comprise the laminated outer rim of the organoid.</p><p id="Par37">Transplantation of PR enriched retinal organoid (RO) sheets has shown to improve visual function in several immunocompromised retinal degenerate animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (review: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) which produce no T-cells. &#x0201c;RN&#x0201d; rats with a rhodopsin mutation (<italic>Rho S334ter-3</italic>) and a <italic>foxn1</italic> mutation (strain <italic>SD-foxn1 Tg(S334ter)3Lav</italic>) provide a model to evaluate the regenerative capacity of the xenograft without risk of T-cell mediated immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>Rho S334ter</italic> line 3 rats, the RD rat model used in this study, express a mutation in a key terminal opsin amino acid (Serine residue 334) resulting in premature truncation of its assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This leads to loss of rhodopsin function in rods and their subsequent apoptosis by unfolded protein response mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mass rod cell death leads to corresponding diminution of scotopic phototransduction and subsequently, functional impairment and death of cone photoreceptors. Rapid vision loss occurs as result of the domino effect of non-viable rods, and cone death resulting from a combination of ROS mediated oxidative stress, metabolic burden and cytotoxic byproducts of rod necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Non-nude (NN) RN rats undergo the same retinal degeneration driven by photoreceptor loss as nude RN rats except they have fully functional adaptive immune system with T-cells. Therefore, non-nude retinal degenerate rats receiving RO xenografts require immune suppression.</p><p id="Par39">Research of clinical translational potential calls for evaluating the visual restorative capacity of RO transplants in both the context of RD <italic>and</italic> immune challenge, as the potential human beneficiaries of such retinal allografts will be immune competent and will&#x02014;at least initially&#x02014;require some degree of immunosuppressive therapy to prevent acute graft rejection. Thus, further study on the effect of immunosuppressants on retina organoids in vitro and in vivo (after transplantation) is necessary.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Immunosuppressive drugs</title><p id="Par40">In this study, we used tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression. Tacrolimus (FK-506) is among a class of drugs called calcineurin inhibitors which downregulate transcription of IL-2, the cytokine essential for both the proliferation <italic>and</italic> activation of na&#x000ef;ve T-cells. Tacrolimus diminished pan T-cell populations, most significantly T-helper and T-cytotoxic cells which are implicated in acute cell mediated xenograft rejection. Upon presentation with processed foreign antigen, naive T-cells undergo a signal transduction cascade culminating in the transcription of IL-2, whereupon the cytokine acts in both an autocrine and paracrine fashion to drive the activation <italic>and</italic> proliferation of both the secreting cell, as well as surrounding T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">By complexing with FK506-binding protein (FKBP) to inhibit calcineurin meditated activation of nuclear factor activated T-cells (NFAT), tacrolimus stops IL-2 production upstream in the signal transduction cascade, resulting in substantially impaired populations of functional antigen specific effector T-cells. As antigen specific antibody production depends on B-cell education by functional follicular T-helper cells, tacrolimus attenuates the humoral antibody mediated arm of adaptive immunity as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a guanosine inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor, which reversibly and non-competitively inhibits incorporation of purine nucleotides in a pathway largely utilized by B and T lymphocytes for mitosis. Thus, MMF is a drug that is cytostatic to B and T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. MMF is hydrolyzed into its metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA), used for in vitro drug testing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The role of microglia in Retinitis Pigmentosa</title><p id="Par43">Microglia cells play distinct and integral roles in the retina. In healthy retina, microglia are primarily active in synaptic remodeling/pruning, the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, immune surveillance, and are sparsely distributed in the inner nuclear layer (INL). Conversely, as Makabe and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] observed, the natural history of microglia in RP is characterized by a dynamic staging in retina colocalization and activation status throughout the disease course, where microglia proliferate and localize to the outer retina and outer nuclear layer (ONL) to phagocytose cell bodies of mutant non-viable rod photoreceptors undergoing apoptosis. The subsequent complement mediated microglial activation and phagocytotic activity leads to a feed forward cascade of pro inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that resulting in a neurotoxic, oxidative stress laden environment that further negatively impacts the survival and function of cone photoreceptors and RPE alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, this para-inflammatory condition in RP is the overarching context within which any subsequent ocular immune reactions in RP treatment and intervention must be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Immunodeficient <italic>foxn-1</italic> mutant</title><p id="Par44">The transcription factor<italic> foxn-1</italic> is essential for thymic development, education, and maturation of functional T-cells. Its mutation leads to immunodeficiency characterized by thymic atrophy with absence of T-cells. This renders the adaptive component of antibody-mediated humoral immunity nonfunctional, as B-cell maturation and learned development of pathogen specific antibodies is contingent upon T-cell help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Because female nude rats do not lactate, non-nude (<italic>foxn1</italic>+<italic>/&#x02212;</italic>) females are used for breeding.

Three conditions were prepared by adding drug into the organoid culture medium for the duration of the experiment: (1) 0.5 ug/mL MPA, (2) 3&#x000a0;ng/mL TAC, and (3) combination of 0.5 ug/mL MPA and 3&#x000a0;ng/mL TAC. ROs were suspension cultured in ultra-low attachment 24-well plates (Corning Costar) (Corning, Corning, NY, USA), one RO per well with 2&#x000a0;mL culture medium.

The laser excitation wavelength was 740&#x000a0;nm.

Each anesthesia related death was characterized by cardiac/respiratory arrest, due to what we identified as the lethal interactions between calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus) and ketamine/xylazine, especially at successive doses required for maintenance of anesthesia during initial transplantation surgery, and repeated successive diagnostic procedures (OCT, SC).

Because immunosuppression is necessary for most of the transplantation treatments, our next step was to test the effect of immunosuppressants on ROs in vitro and in vivo (in an immunocompetent RD animal model). Similar to our previous work, before the transplantation, the ROs were specified by high viability (~&#x02009;90%), absence of stem cell markers, high purity (mainly photoreceptor progenitors), and minimal immunogenicity to sensitized human immune cells. In vitro experiments revealed that the immunosuppressant drugs MPA (a hydrolyzed product of MMF) and TAC had no significant effects on the development of ROs. In vivo tests showed that the immunosuppressant drugs MMF and TAC helped the ROs survive in immunocompetent RD host retinas for a long time by T-cell suppression; and induced vision improvement.</p><p id="Par120">ROs are an invaluable resource for investigating retinal development, physiology and pathology toward development of potential treatments in retinal diseases.</p><p id="Par121">In the defined context of tissue transplantation, wherein ROs are engineered and maintained for harvest upon defined standards of physiological maturity for transplantation in living subjects, clinical grade, standardizable levels of quality assurance across domains of identity, functionality, immunogenicity and reproducibility are required.</p><p id="Par122">We accomplished with a reliably reproducible protocol for development of ROs whose genomic, cellular and tissue organizational functional metabolic authenticity we validated.</p><p id="Par123">We then addressed potential graft safety of ROs with respect to immunogenicity. The mixed lymphocyte reaction assay of CSC14-hESC-derived ROs co-culture with sensitized human immune cells suggests low immunogenicity. We used human PBMCs and not rat PBMCs to mimic the future allograft situation in a prospective human patient. Of course, ROs derived from hESCs would elicit a strong response from rat (or mouse) PBMCs) as we have shown in our non-IS treated immunocompetent transplant group in vivo. We acknowledge, however, the inherent limitations of in vitro recapitulations of an embodied physiologically bound adaptive immune response and propose such outcomes an adequate preliminary predictive proxy of CSC14-derived ROs ability to elicit immune response in vivo in prospective human subjects.</p><p id="Par124">The efficacy of any potential graft or cell replacement therapy is contingent upon host immune tolerance. TAC and MMF are clinical standard of care drugs with established safety and efficacy profiles routinely administered to promote tolerance of solid organ grafts in humans. Validation of their successful administration in previous stem cell xenograft tolerance animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] made them logical candidates in our preclinical study of retinal tissue grafts.</p><p id="Par125">Individual variabilities in achievable TAC blood concentrations and subsequent immune suppressive effects at given dose is observed in human subjects and has often been attributed to genetic polymorphisms in second pass drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par126">An in vitro exposure assay was used as a necessary preliminary measure to test the effect the two IS drugs at probable serum concentrations on the development or function of the ROs. The time points chosen for the drug treatment of the ROs were selected based on differentiation ages of ROs used for transplantation surgeries. Two lots of ROs were exposed to serum concentrations of IS drugs from day 68&#x02013;115. This range of differentiation ages adequately represents the ages of ROs transplanted in the surgeries of this study. In previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], our group has emphasized the rationale and utility of transplanting photoreceptor (PR) precursors as opposed to terminally differentiated late-stage PRs. PR precursors are selected at this stage for their capacity to optimally engraft and their potential for functional maturation in vivo.</p><p id="Par127">We acknowledge that direct exposure by way of immersion in culture media does not recapitulate and is not equivalent to any possible transient graft exposure to physiological serum concentrations of drugs via diffusion from peripheral circulation into the subretinal microenvironment. We reason that the diffusion and uptake profiles of direct immersion in culture favor optimal RO exposure to clinically relevant serum concentrations of immunosuppressant drugs whose outcomes may be reasonably extrapolated to a physiological environment.</p><p id="Par128">Our previous experiments in RO-grafted nude rats revealed that absence of T-cells alone resulted in long term graft survival, across all ranges of functional rescue outcomes. On the surface, such results are intuitive, in agreement with first principles of adaptive immunology and provide foundational inductive basis for hypothesizing that targeted suppression of T-cell activity is the necessary component of achieving graft tolerance in immune competent individuals.</p><p id="Par129">In our <italic>non-nude transplant IS</italic> group, the concurrent growth of each rat over time was conveniently coupled with the constant release rate of a TAC pellet and the administration of MMF chow at a fixed dose, manifesting in a gradual ramping down of dose potency (in mg/kg) throughout treatment. This mimicked the practice of weaning off immunosuppressant drug doses employed by clinicians in solid organ transplantation, where the highest doses of immune suppressant are administered throughout the critical period encompassing pre-surgery conditioning up to a defined time point post-transplantation (when the risk of acute rejection is greatest) to promote graft tolerance.</p><p id="Par130">We determined the minimum therapeutic thresholds of TAC and MMF (20&#x000a0;mg TAC at 0.74&#x02013;3.17&#x000a0;mg/kg day, MMF 300&#x000a0;mg/kg from 8 to 13.5&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;day) required to establish graft tolerance in an immunocompetent retinal degenerate rat model. We demonstrate that in immune-competent RD rats, targeted T-cell attenuation alone can reproduce an ideal immune histological profile similar to that observed in immunodeficient graft recipients without adaptive immune response, capable of facilitating survival and function of grafted photoreceptors. Conversely, acute RO graft rejection was exclusively observed in non-IS treated immunocompetent rats who maintained populations of functional, sensitized CD8+ and CD4+ effector cells not exposed to calcineurin inhibition.</p><p id="Par131">In our non-nude IS group, the degree to which CD4 and CD8+ T-cell populations were suppressed upstream by TAC&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMF treatment regimens 4&#x02013;7 (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were directly reflected in attenuation of serum IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; levels downstream. IS mediated attenuation of T-cells and serum levels of their primary proliferative and effector cytokines resulted in long term graft survival, absence of graft infiltrating T-cells, and a profile of non-reactive, graft agnostic microglia that mirrored long-term surviving grafts in immunocompromised <italic>foxn1&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> RD counterparts that have demonstrated both graft tolerance and functional improvement of visual acuity.</p><p id="Par132">As IFN-&#x003b3; is strongly implicated in activation of microglia, we propose its downregulation via absent T-cells is the inflammatory missing link responsible for the resting, agnostic microglia phenotype observed in immunocompromised<italic>/foxn1</italic> mutant <italic>and</italic> in successful IS treated RO-transplanted rats with substantially attenuated serum levels of both the cytokine and T-cells themselves.</p><p id="Par133">The <italic>non-nude sham</italic> group expressed the lowest IFN-&#x003b3; levels of all surgery groups. We speculate this may be a feature of an endogenous homeostatic immunosuppressive effect of immune competent sham surgery animals&#x02014;a recovery profile that immune competent individuals would experience from acute injury such as the initial inflammation inciting incident of invasive ocular surgery. Without persistent subsequent immune challenge of xenograft transplantation, as in <italic>non-nude transplant IS</italic> and <italic>non-nude transplant no IS</italic> groups, sham surgery would be essentially self-resolving toward a homeostatic, pre-injury baseline state. To further elucidate this hypothesis, more comprehensive cytokine profiling would be required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par134">Noteworthy is that in both immunosuppressed and immunocompromised groups, we have observed a greater proportion of myeloid and NK cells than in their age and sex matched non-IS treated immunocompetent littermates. We hypothesize that both phenotypes of T-cell deletion and ablation result in similar expansion of the myeloid and NK cell compartment as a physiological compensatory response.</p><p id="Par135">This is substantial, as IFN-&#x003b3;, a positive feedback instigator of the characteristic ramped up cellular immune response and cytokine storm accompanying acute rejection, is jointly secreted by T-cells <italic>and</italic> NK cells and stimulates phagocytic activity of microglia and macrophages. Therefore, in immune competent IS treated transplant recipients, despite apparent expansion of NK cells and macrophages as result of treatment, upstream T-cell suppression alone proved sufficient in attenuating serum levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, graft site microglial activation and preserving graft site from infiltration of peripheral macrophages.</p><p id="Par136">Regardless of immune competence status, macrophages and NK cells are inconsequential in precipitating acute rejection of subretinal grafts. This is also exemplified by the fact that not a single case of graft rejection was observed in T-cell deficient athymic nude rats despite such a robust upregulation of myeloid and NK innate immune cells.</p><p id="Par137">In <italic>foxn1&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> rats, absence of T-cells not only abolishes donor specific cell mediated graft destruction of acute rejection but also T-follicular cells that are responsible for antigen specific education and differentiation of antibody producing B-cells. Though not explicitly measured in our study, this mechanism can extrapolate to the graft tolerance we observed as consequence of successful IS T-cell suppression. T-follicular cells are among the subpopulations of CD4+ T-cells we observed undergoing global proliferative and activation suppression resulting from TAC administration. Thus, both absence and sufficient global attenuation of T-cell populations cripples the antibody mediated humoral immune response which precipitates the longer-term immune phenomenon of chronic graft rejection.</p><p id="Par138">Our results demonstrate that T-cell mediated graft specific cytotoxicity is the primary and essential upstream component of acute rejection of retinal organoid transplants. Cytotoxic lymphocytes destroyed donor cells within weeks, and via positive feedback of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2, drove their own proliferation as well as the chemotaxis and effector functions of activated microglia and peripheral macrophages in response to necrotic donor and host cells. That T-cytotoxic cells are the primary source of graft destruction demonstrates an indirect antigen recognition profile with either one of two probable mechanisms of action:</p><p id="Par139">1) Antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the subretinal space take up antigens (Ag) from graft cells and present to circulating na&#x000ef;ve T-cells via endothelial margination through either blood retinal barrier or inner retinal vasculature or 2), shed antigens from donor cells themselves exit the subretinal space initially unchaperoned by APCs to later make their way to draining lymphoid tissues for site specific APC mediated presentation to na&#x000ef;ve T-cells. Either scenario results in a T-cell education and subsequent clonal expansion into an effector population with specificity to RO grafts that are then capable of homing in on the original source of their antigen specificity in the subretinal space.</p><p id="Par140">The first APC mediated Ag presentation scenario is noteworthy as it is a sequence that requires cells traversing the often-considered immune privileged subretinal space beyond the blood retinal barrier <italic>to and from</italic> peripheral circulation and lymph nodes at least twice (Supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).</p><p id="Par141">Thus, across a continuum of immune-competence states, acute RO graft rejection is only possible with a robust population of functional, sensitized CD8+ and CD4+ effector cells. The typical graft rejection develops as a combination of acute cytotoxic T cell mediated response in case of significant HLA mismatch (including xenogeneic graft) and a delayed antibody mediated rejection in partial or minor HLA matching (i.e., partial matched allogeneic grafts). There is an additional mechanism for acceleration of immune-initiation when the quality of the transplant is low (lot of cell debris). Damage-associated molecular pattern signals are sensed by dendritic cells that will pick-up possible allo-antigens&#x000a0;from the debris and present through MHC-II for an antibody response, or by MHC-I cross-presentation to initiate a T-helper 1 (Th1) type response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Lastly, stressed and damaged cells tend to directly express damaged proteins through MHC-I even if HLA is perfectly matched, which can further educate the immune system. Thus, the better the quality of the graft (i.e., viability, lack of mutations, etc.), the more delayed the adaptive response is with better chances of tolerance induction in real-life allogeneic transplants when partial HLA matching is pursued.</p><p id="Par142">Our group and others have observed that potential synaptogenesis of transplanted photoreceptors with bipolar interneurons is associated with grafts that demonstrate functional improvements in visual acuity in optokinetic and electrophysiological assessments in RD animal models. In addition, a subpopulation of Ku80-immunoreactive transplant cells migrated into the degenerative RD host retina.</p><p id="Par143">As the restorative functional capacity of RO transplants is only possible in the context of immune tolerance, suppression of the cytotoxic lymphocyte effector functions is required to achieve successful transplant tolerance in the subretinal space.</p><sec id="Sec43"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p id="Par144">Xenograft <italic>non-nude transplant NO IS</italic> response models the worst-case scenario of RO graft rejection. Subsequent studies of this nature may expand the observation time frame of tolerant grafts to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the donor RO&#x02019;s lifespan with respect to cell proliferation, turnover, and duration of restorative capacity.</p><p id="Par145">Further studies may benefit from a more comprehensive lineage and functionality immune profiling of the upregulated CD161+/CD3&#x02212; CD8+ lymphocyte and CD68+/CD11bc+ myeloid populations we have observed resulting from T-cell suppression or deletion, respectively. This, in conjunction with expanded microglia, CD4+ T-cell and cytokine profiling would further characterize and elucidate probable mechanisms of the immunoreactivity profiles observed across each tolerance/rejection modality in this study. For example, not explicitly probing for indicators of endogenous immunomodulation such as the presence of CD4+ Tregs and suppressive cytokines (IL10, TGF&#x003b2;, IFN&#x003b2;) across surgery modalities (non-surgery, sham, and transplant RD), yields an incomplete picture of the interplay between modulation and inflammation reflective of each corresponding physiological immune environment.</p><p id="Par146">We opted to not pursue LCMS based pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling of MMF. MMF was administered as a secondary supportive immunosuppressant. However, rapid, unequivocal graft rejection in MMF monotherapy transplant cohorts (determined in vivo by OCT imaging 14&#x000a0;days post-transplant) did not warrant symmetrical investment of LCMS/MS mediated serum PK profiling. Furthermore, MMF monotherapy at highest administered dose (300&#x000a0;mg/kg) showed minimal suppression of immune cell populations after 1 and 3&#x000a0;months (data not shown). These results together with the success of 20&#x000a0;mg TAC monotherapy warranted its use at this dose as the empirical efficacy-based anchor for building and evaluation of optimal combination therapy dosing regimens with MMF.</p><p id="Par147">Although TAC and MMF are clinical standard drugs with established safety and efficacy profiles in humans, and they did not show negative effects on our in vitro culture study, they had a lethal impact (cardiac/respiratory arrest) on our in vivo study, resulting in a lower number of rats available for the function tests. The outbreak of Covid 19 pandemic made it worse. During the pandemic, people were restricted from working in the lab, which further reduced the rat number for function tests. Nevertheless, optokinetic testing showed significant improvement in transplanted rats compared to controls at 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;months post-surgery. Especially for SC, only 5 rats with transplants survived to be ready for SC recording but still 3 died in anesthesia before SC recording. Therefore, although the 2 transplant rats did not show responses as has been seen previously with transplants to immunodeficient rats, it is still possible that the other transplants would have elicited a visual response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Further considerations</title><p id="Par148">While the undisturbed subretinal niche is purported to be an immune protective environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], our retinal graft study encounters components essential for its stepwise derangement into an acute rejection phenotype of the highest order; a primed pro-inflammatory environment of retinal degeneration exacerbated by the transplantation induced tissue trauma, (and possible blood retinal barrier breach) of an invasive surgery delivering a therapeutic containing a sufficiently immunogenic foreign antigen.</p><p id="Par149">The predictive efficacy of in vitro alloreactivity of CSC14 cells is informative, but incomplete without an in vivo component. Factoring out the in vivo component of allo-immunoreactivity minimizes the systemic cumulative physiological interactions that grant an authentically embodied adaptive immune response all its potency. For example, in vitro, weak HLA I expression on hESC ROs does not guarantee immunity to allorecognition. In principle, any non-self-generated cellular antigen in vivo can elicit at least foreign-body, MHC-II based adaptive cell mediated and humoral responses, respectively, in immunocompetent individuals.</p><p id="Par150">An essential progression of these studies will be in evaluating RO allograft immunoreactivity in vivo, with a competent &#x0201c;humanized immune system&#x0201d; animal model. The humanized immune system animal model is regarded as an aspirational, functional gold standard of sorts for assessment of pre-clinical translational immunoreactivity of potential stem cell-based therapies. This said, in the context of personalized medicine, in vitro methods like HLA matching and MLR assay may yield the highest predictive value and content information in terms of direct immunoreactivity profiling of individual prospective graft recipients. We used human PBMCs in the MLR assay to mimic the allograft situation in a future patient. Such an approach gains increased relevance with optimization of iPSC-tissue derivation methods.</p><p id="Par151">The successful precedent of TAC and MMF treatment in promoting immune tolerance in solid organ transplants made an adequate choice for preliminary investigation of xenograft tolerance. Still, our drugs of choice in this study may not be the most appropriate for stem cell derived photoreceptor transplantation to the subretinal space in human subjects. Sevc et al. and others have done foundational work in exploring immune suppression in preclinical stem cell replacement-based xenograft studies in immune competent disease models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Ultimately, we acknowledge the lack of immunogenic parity between xenografts and allografts in our experiments.</p><p id="Par152">Graft tolerance therapeutic strategies based on administration of TAC and MMF were initially developed in the context of the immunogenic profiles of solid organ transplants. Such transplants have the antigenic richness of solid organs composed of multiple tissue functional units, many embedded with tissue resident immune cells, and developed within individuals with distinct HLA profiles. ROs as isolated tissue systems derived from off-the-shelf pluripotent stem cell lines in vitro inherently lack the antigenic richness of solid organs. Additionally, medical conditions behind the nature of such transplants, heart, kidney, lung, or liver, respectively, carry sufficient threat of severe impairment or of loss of life as to warrant incurred risks of drug-induced organ toxicity and/or opportunistic infection. Retinal degeneration, while detrimental to quality of life, is not a comparable class of life-or-death disease, and as such, warrants less drug-induced risk from the same drug regimen.</p><p id="Par153">The toxicity profile and vulnerability delivered by immunosuppressants must not yield more potential risk than the efficacy profile of any proposed therapeutic intervention or treatment. Other, lower risk options for attenuating cell mediated response (checkpoint inhibition, glucocorticoids, administration of exogenous immunosuppressive cytokines, anti-thymocyte globulin) may be more adequate and are worth exploring.</p><p id="Par154">The uniquely attenuated immunoreactivity profile of stem cell derived tissue and the subretinal niche, rise in optimization of iPSC derivation, and burgeoning shift in regenerative medicine and immunology research focusing on endogenous, engineered, and induced immunomodulation in advance of traditional chemical immunosuppression, render this type of treatment particularly amenable to actionable and testable refinements in domains of both safety and efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par155">Restorative capacity of this and any tissue replacement therapy is conditionally dependent upon host tolerance.
