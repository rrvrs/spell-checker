While <italic>resilience</italic> may help alleviate psychological and physical burdens in individuals with IBD, there is no disease-specific measure that currently exists to accurately quantify this construct in the context of IBD. This study aimed to psychometrically validate the new Resilience Scale for IBD (RISE-IBD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A preliminary scale was developed including 17 items generated from a qualitative study that centered on patient focus group discussions, conversations with IBD healthcare providers, and evaluation of two validated resilience measures. In this cross-sectional study, the scale&#x02019;s reliability, validity, and consistency were assessed in a sample of 91 patients with IBD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The 17-item RISE-IBD was reduced to a 14-item measure. The revised RISE-IBD, comprising four resilience domains (Disease Acceptance, Self-Reliance, Flexibility, Persistence), demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82) and excellent re-test reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91). The scale exhibited significantly positive correlations with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74) and Brief Resilience Scale (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.59), as well as with a disease-specific quality of life scale, the IBD Questionnaire (&#x003c4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.33).

IBD affect over 6&#x000a0;million individuals worldwide, with its prevalence rising in industrialized countries, including those in the United States (U.S.) and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The symptoms associated with IBD, including altered bowel movements, malnutrition, and extraintestinal manifestations, place a substantial emotional burden on patients, consequently affecting their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Individuals with IBD frequently face daily coping challenges and difficulties with performing both physical and mental tasks, which can contribute to exacerbation of their psychological burden and perception of disease-related disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Research underscores not only the heightened predisposition of individuals with IBD to anxiety and depression, but also emphasizes the likely role that psychological factors play in triggering clinical events or worsening physical symptoms in IBD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Resilience, commonly defined as one&#x02019;s ability to &#x0201c;bounce back&#x0201d; from adversity, has been recognized as a potential indicator of quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic illnesses, including cancer, hypertension, and irritable bowel syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a recent study, resilience was positively linked to mental and physical QOL in patients with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additional research elucidates the notion that resilience may mediate the relationship between depression, anxiety, and disease activity in patients with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These findings underscore the potential of resilience in improving health outcomes and managing disease-related challenges for individuals with IBD.</p><p id="Par8">While therapies aimed at enhancing resilience for patients with chronic conditions have been associated with improved physical health and overall well-being, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] only a few measures accurately quantify resilience in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, despite the widespread use of the Connor&#x02013;Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] it is crucial to recognize that generic, patient-reported resilience measures may not fully capture the unique challenges faced by individuals living with IBD. These standard assessments may overlook the intricacies of managing IBD, such as dealing with unpredictable bowel movements, navigating dietary restrictions, coping with social stigma, and addressing specific mental health barriers, such as the anxiety of finding restroom access or the stress of adhering to complex treatment regimens.</p><p id="Par9">Resilience in individuals with chronic conditions may be influenced by various factors unique to their situation, including their perception of the disease, adherence to medical and physical regimens, psychological functioning, and HRQOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given the highly heterogeneous nature of IBDs, there is a critical need for a patient-reported assessment tool that can accurately capture the nuanced experiences of individuals living with IBD to quantify this psychological construct accurately in this population.</p><p id="Par10">The aim of this study was to provide preliminary evidence for the development and validation of a disease-specific resilience measure for IBD called the <bold><italic>Resilience Scale for IBD (RISE-IBD).</italic></bold> The tool is intended for use by clinicians and researchers to assess and monitor resilience in patients with IBD. By offering insights into the dynamic nature of resilience&#x02014;accounting for its potential changes over time due to variations in disease status, medical and surgical treatments, or behavioral interventions&#x02014;the measure can help identify patients who may require more focused interventions. It can also guide the development of tailored resilience-building management strategies with the long-term purpose of improving QOL for individuals with IBD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par11">The study utilized a sequential-exploratory approach with mixed-methods consisting of two phases: (1) development of a draft of the RISE-IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and (2) psychometric validation of the RISE-IBD. The goal was to offer initial evidence for supporting the validity and reliability of a disease-specific resilience measurement tool for IBD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Development phase</title><p id="Par12">A qualitative, patient-centered research study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] was employed to explore the attributes of resilience as defined by individuals with IBD. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 15 adult patients who had been diagnosed with IBD for at least 3 months. Patients were required to achieve a rounded score of 3.00 on the BRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] indicating a moderate level of resilience. The research team developed a preliminary IBD resilience measure sequentially through 3 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with patients, and one member check discussion with 6 IBD healthcare professionals (comprising four physicians, one pharmacist, and one dietitian). All FGDs were conducted by focus groups or one-to-one interviews using an institutional HIPAA-compliant audiovisual platform and were audio-recorded.</p><p id="Par13">During FGD 1, patients responded to nine open-ended questions aimed at uncovering the emotional, physical, and mental challenges associated with living with IBD, as well as the strategies patients used to navigate these hurdles. In FGD 2, patients were introduced to two established resilience measures, the CD-RISC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the Resilience Scale (RS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and were asked to assess the relevance of the themes depicted in these scales within the context of IBD. Following FGDs 1 and 2, the research team conducted thematic analysis to construct an initial version of the RISE-IBD. The thematic analysis methodology integrated aspects of the Grounded Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] incorporating open coding to generate conceptual codes, followed by axial and selective coding. Axial coding facilitated connections among the open codes and selective coding was applied to interconnect these categories into themes that elucidated the construct of resilience. Independent and parallel coding of the transcripts was performed using the qualitative analysis software MAXQDA 2022 (VERBI Software, 2021). Following thematic analysis, a comprehensive codebook was devised containing 15 potential scale items.</p><p id="Par14">In FGD 3, the participants and IBD professionals (i.e., member check) were invited to provide feedback on the drafted measure in two separate discussions. This thorough feedback approach was adopted to establish face and content validity of the selected items. Participants were asked to evaluate each item by reflecting on their pre-existing notions of resilience concerning IBD and asked to assess the clarity of the instructions provided for the drafted measure. Participants also provided feedback on Likert scaling, with the 5-level Likert rating method emerging as the preferred choice. Leveraging their professional insights, the member check allowed healthcare professionals to provide feedback on whether items were pertinent for inclusion, identify any potential redundancies, and offer suggestions for refinement of the drafted measure.</p><p id="Par15">The feedback acquired from both groups led to considerable modifications of the scale, such as amendment to the wording of items, addition of a temporal component to the instructions, and the inclusion of two extra scale items. Consequently, the preliminary version of the RISE-IBD was comprised of 17 items organized into 3 theoretical domains: interpersonal fortitude, individual character strengths, and logistical strategies aimed at enhancing resilience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Validation phase</title><p id="Par16">The psychometric attributes of the RISE-IBD, including the validity, reliability, and consistency of the scale, were assessed among adult patients treated at an urban tertiary care IBD center in the U.S.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par17">Patients were recruited following their routine IBD clinical care visits and were contacted by phone from September 2023 to January 2024. The inclusion criteria encompassed patients who were 18 years of age or older, had an endoscopically confirmed diagnosis of UC or CD, had been living with IBD for at least 3 months, and were able to provide written informed consent in English. Participants provided self-reported demographic and clinical information regarding their condition. They were also asked to complete the initial RISE-IBD assessment along with five validated questionnaires as part of the validation process. Four weeks following the initial completion of the RISE-IBD, patients were invited to complete a re-test of the measure. A reminder email was sent after two weeks to remind participants to complete the re-test.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par18">All patients consented to participating in the study and completing all required questionnaires using an institutional HIPAA-compliant data-capturing platform. After completing each questionnaire, participants received detailed instructions via email to deter multiple responses from the same individual and ensure clarity regarding instructions. Participants were instructed to complete the questionnaires in a specific sequence, only once, and were encouraged to finish them within four weeks. To maintain patient anonymity, identifying information was removed from survey results. Subsequently, data was extracted from the data-capturing system into Microsoft Excel for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experimental measure</title><p id="Par19">The Resilience Scale for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (RISE-IBD).</p><p id="Par20">The preliminary RISE-IBD is a disease-specific self-report measure of perceived resilience consisting of 17 proposed items. The 17 items are categorized into three domains: (1) interpersonal fortitude, (2) individual character strengths, and (3) logistical strategies. Instructions on the scale ask participants to reflect on the strategies they employ to manage their IBD when responding to the measure. Participants are expected to select the option that best aligns with their experiences over the past three months. Responses are given utilizing a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&#x0201c;not true&#x0201d;) to 4 (&#x0201c;always true&#x0201d;). To mitigate social desirability bias, statements are positively and negatively worded, with reverse scoring employed for the latter. Scores on the preliminary measure range from 0 to 68, with higher scores indicating greater resilience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sociodemographic and clinical information</title><p id="Par21">Participants were asked to self-report several demographic and illness-related variables using an online survey, which included multiple-choice and specific questions that allowed for multiple selections.

Factor analysis is used to psychometrically validate instruments in methodological studies and is often conducted in two phases: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Considering the predetermined structure of the RISE-IBD and its expected factor configuration, our initial analysis employed CFA to verify the proposed structure, comprising 17 items distributed across 3 domains.</p><p id="Par35">To ensure the suitability of the data for factor analysis, the internal correlation among items in the scale were evaluated through the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure (KMO) and Bartlett&#x02019;s Test of Sphericity. A KMO of at least 0.70 and a statistically significant result for Bartlett&#x02019;s test were expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To assess the validity of the model, various indices with predefined criteria for evaluating goodness of fit were examined as indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Nevertheless, a standardized definition of resilience tailored to the IBD patient demographic has yet to be established. Psychological resilience, in the context of IBD, is certainly a multifaceted construct shaped by both internal (personal) and external (environmental) factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide preliminary evidence for the validation of a patient-centered resilience tool that could evaluate IBD-related <italic>resilience</italic> while taking such factors into account.</p><p id="Par67">A qualitative research study was employed to explore attributes of resilience as defined by 15 patients with IBD. Factor analysis was used to evaluate the internal construct validity of the 17-item RISE-IBD, where the sample-to-item ratio was expected to be at least 5:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. With this criterion, the minimum sample size required for the validation study was 85 participants. In our 91-sample study, CFA was initially used to evaluate the validity of the hypothesized archetype. Per the literature, when a CFA model does not fit well, including significantly large MI into the structure allows chi-square statistics to be reduced, thus yielding a better statistically fitted result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Despite the inclusion of 5 MI, the model continued to exhibit poor fit, prompting the utilization of item discrimination to scrutinize and reduce the scale&#x02019;s items to 14. With no predetermined assumptions regarding the number of factors, or the loading of items onto which factors, EFA was conducted on the 14-item RISE-IBD. The generated scree plot guided our research team in devising a 4-factor model. The contents of each factor were assigned appropriate names based on their constituent items (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par68">
<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Final RISE-IBD Model: A 14-item, 4-domain framework representing key attributes of resilience in individuals with IBD</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12876_2025_3971_Fig5_HTML" id="d33e1373"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par69">The results from the discriminant ability indicated variations in mean resilience scores, measured using the RISE-IBD, across demographic and clinical factors. In terms of race, resilience scores averaged higher for individuals identifying as White compared to those from Black or African American demographic groups. Furthermore, resilience scores were lower for individuals in the Unemployed group compared to those in the Employed group. Such findings reflect a potential disparity in access to resources, socioeconomic factors, or cultural influences that may impact resilience levels. Indeed, individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, or those with lesser financial stability, may have difficulty seeking and obtaining mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to not only develop community outreach programs to support resilience-building efforts for minority groups, but also to tailor such programs to individuals with IBD given their unique racial, ethnic, and financial background.</p><p id="Par70">As anticipated, participants with chronic pain and anxiety exhibited lower RISE-IBD scores compared to those without these comorbidities. Remarkably, individuals using anti-TNF medications exhibited higher resilience scores, whereas those using immunomodulators had lower resilience scores. These findings confirm previous literature suggesting that resilience might mediate the connection between perceived autonomy support and medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, it is also possible that higher resilience in anti-TNF users might reflect disease control (e.g., a state of remission) rather than treatment effect. Therefore, healthcare professionals should collaborate with patients to assess their overall well-being comprehensively, considering not only IBD-related medications but also psychological interventions alongside them to control disease status and augment resilience. While exploratory findings did not attain the conventional level of significance, adopting an alpha level of 0.10 enabled us to explore potentially significant trends. Aligning with former research findings, individuals with IBD who were dealing with depression and those using anti-anxiety medications exhibited lower resilience scores in comparison to those without these comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Overall, the results from the discriminant ability suggest that the RISE-IBD may be helpful in assessing differences in demographic and clinical factors, highlighting its potential utility in assessing various aspects related to IBD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Practical applications</title><p id="Par71">The 14-item RISE-IBD assesses resilience across four distinct domains. <bold><italic>Disease Acceptance</italic></bold> measures individuals&#x02019; acknowledgment and acceptance of the presence of IBD in their lives. <bold><italic>Self-Reliance</italic></bold> measures the degree of empowerment individuals feel in managing their disease independently and seeking personalized strategies, such as mindfulness practices, to help manage their condition. <bold><italic>Flexibility</italic></bold> evaluates the ability for patients to adapt to the uncertainties of living with IBD, as well as establishing boundaries with people, particularly during disease flares, treatment adjustments, and lifestyle changes. <bold><italic>Persistence</italic></bold> evaluates patients&#x02019; capacity to maintain optimism when pursuing goals despite setbacks posed by their IBD. Moreover, it emphasizes patients&#x02019; ability to persist in medically managing their condition and to seek aid from trusted individuals or providers when facing uncertainty related to their IBD.</p><p id="Par72">By measuring resilience across such domains, healthcare providers can comprehensively assess resilience and tailor interventions appropriately. For instance, patients scoring low in the Disease Acceptance domain may require targeted counseling to address any misconceptions about their IBD and should gradually work towards embracing their condition as an integral part of their identity. Patients demonstrating high levels of Self-Reliance are likely to adhere to treatment plans and engage in self-care or stress-reduction techniques, allowing them to carefully regulate their emotions in the face of adversity. To enhance Flexibility, healthcare providers can educate patients on the comorbidities often associated with their IBD, therefore enabling patients to adapt to changes with their health and make informed decisions. Providing guidance on effective communication is also crucial to helping patients establish boundaries in social or work settings when needed. For individuals with low Persistence, providers can assist their patients in creating S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-sensitive) goals. By implementing this technique, for personal or medical goals, patients with IBD can feel empowered to pinpoint specific tasks they should accomplish judiciously and within a specific time-frame, thus facilitating more focused efforts and increasing the probability of successful outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">The utilization of the RISE-IBD could also be used to identify patients who may be at higher risk for poor outcomes such as decreased quality of life, enhanced anxiety, increased disease activity, and more susceptibility to IBD-related surgeries (particularly for those with CD), due to lower levels of resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such patients would require more frequent follow-up visits or early intervention to prevent disease exacerbations. Likewise, the measure can be used to longitudinally monitor changes in resilience in response to medical or psychological interventions, and even life events. This information would help healthcare providers measure the effectiveness of treatments and adjust them as needed. For instance, improvements in resilience may indicate that a patient is responding well to treatment and experiencing better quality of life, whereas declines in resilience may signal the need for additional support or adjustments to therapy.</p><p id="Par74">By incorporating resilience assessments into routine clinical practice, healthcare providers can engage patients in shared decision making and empower them to play an active role in their care. Patients could also use their resilience scores as a tool to track their progress, set goals, and make informed decisions about their treatment options, following a similar framework to that of the GRITT&#x02122; method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This collaborative approach can lead to better treatment adherence, improved patient satisfaction, and ultimately, better health outcomes for individuals living with IBD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par75">The overall reliability of the 14-item RISE-IBD was excellent with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.82. Particularly, items 2,7, and 11 had mean scores above 3.0 indicating that participants felt more strongly with having a sense of confidence in their support systems, feeling a sense of purpose living with IBD, and believing they could live a fulfilling life despite the challenges their IBD posed (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These sentiments align with the positive psychology concept of optimism or &#x0201c;meaning finding,&#x0201d; traits associated with reduced stress and depression, as well as a higher likelihood of experiencing positive healthcare outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">To further assess the consistency of the construct without any added intervention, participants were administered a re-test of the RISE-IBD. In contrast to the typical duration of 4 to 6 weeks observed in most test-retest reliability studies, our participants completed the re-test on average within 7 weeks. This extended interval allowed for a more robust assessment of the measure&#x02019;s replicability, providing insights into its long-term stability. Moreover, with an ICC of 0.91 and 95% CI (0.86, 0.94), the findings suggest an excellent and significant level of internal consistency in the responses collected, supporting the scale&#x02019;s potential for assessing resilience at two distinct time points. By demonstrating convergent, concurrent, and divergent validity, we confirmed existing relationships between resilience and associated constructs in IBD. With a strong correlation to the CD-RISC, a sound psychometric tool capable of discerning between those with greater and lesser resilience, the RISE-IBD similarly demonstrates its ability to evaluate psychological attributes associated with resilience, including coping strategies and overall well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, while the CD-RISC was limited in its ability to acknowledge the nuances of resilience across different domains, such as the varied impacts of interpersonal and personal relationships on the resilience construct, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] the RISE-IBD addresses these factors explicitly.</p><p id="Par77">A statistically significant and positive correlation emerged between the RISE-IBD and the IBDQ, not only affirming concurrent validity, but also confirming previous study findings that identified positive relationships between resilience and QOL in the IBD population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Certainly, those with greater resilience may be more likely to self-manage their condition and utilize specific coping mechanisms to mitigate the impact of IBD-related stressors, therefore enhancing their QOL. Furthermore, the results of divergent validity revealed a significant and negative correlation between resilience and psychological distress, as assessed by the BSI-18. This supports previous research suggesting that resilience may serve as a protective factor against anxiety and depression. It also highlights the potential benefits of using resilience-based coping strategies, rooted in positive psychology, to enhance psychosocial well-being among individuals with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">Lastly, a statistically significant and inverse correlation was found between the RISE-IBD and IBD-specific disability, as assessed by the IBD-DI. Such finding underscores the potential applicability of resilience for individuals with disabilities in serving as a resource to help them cope positively to their disabilities when confronted with various lifestyle changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. By fostering resilience, individuals with disabilities may be able to better adapt to new circumstances and navigate the challenges associated with their conditions more effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par79">In the qualitative study, participants were selected based on moderate resilience scores to ensure that they could clearly articulate their coping strategies and provide detailed, constructive definitions of resilience in IBD. As noted in a previous study, this sampling strategy may have introduced selection bias and limited the generalizability of individuals and their resilience scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Likewise, given that half of the validation cohort had been living with IBD for more than 10 years, the psychometric properties of the RISE-IBD may differ in newly diagnosed patients. Future studies should assess the scale&#x02019;s performance in newly diagnosed patients, as resilience may manifest differently earlier in the disease course. This could shed light on whether resilience in IBD reflects a learned or adaptive process, or if it represents an innate, trait-like characteristic within this population. Moreover, correlations with depression may be stronger among individuals who are newly diagnosed, as they may not have yet developed effective coping mechanisms to manage the emotional impact of their IBD. Therefore, resilience-building interventions would play a critical role in mitigating depressive symptoms particularly during this time.</p><p id="Par80">The quantitative study also encountered several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small compared to most validation studies that follow a sample-to-item ratio of 10:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Given the limited sample size, splitting of the data for EFA and CFA did not yield splits that were perfectly consistent with one another and therefore may not have captured the diversity of the entire dataset. As such, future studies that replicate the splitting of the data should use a sufficiently larger sample size to ensure that each split maintains adequate variance. Moreover, the study&#x02019;s sample was predominantly comprised of White and Non-Hispanic females with CD, and about half of the participants had graduate or terminal degrees, affecting the generalizability of the findings. Patients seeing community gastroenterologists or those without access to an IBD-specific clinic may have limited access to specialized resources for their conditions. Future studies should include participants from more demographically diverse backgrounds and be conducted across both regional and tertiary care centers.</p><p id="Par81">Secondly, the cross-sectional design used in the validation study restricted data collection to a single point in time and prevented the assessment of temporal changes in resilience. As such, the design of the study prohibited the ability to establish causal relationships with respect to resilience. Longitudinal studies using the RISE-IBD would allow researchers to observe potential fluctuations in resilience scores and assess the association of resilience with added behavioral or psychosocial interventions to improve patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par82">Another limitation was that disease activity status was based solely on patient self-reported data. As objective clinical or biochemical markers (e.g., fecal calprotectin, CRP) were not available, future studies would benefit from incorporating clinical assessments to evaluate how resilience may be influenced by, or related to, disease activity across key resilience domains. Lastly, it is crucial to acknowledge the exploratory nature of the factor analysis that was performed, indicating that the 14-item scale may require further psychometric testing and validation by other researchers and practitioners.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par83">In summary, the RISE-IBD, consisting of 14 items across 4 domains, may be a potentially valid and reliable instrument for measuring resilience among individuals with IBD. Employing an assessment of each domain would enable practitioners to identify patients&#x02019; areas of vulnerability and suggest tailored interventions aimed at enhancing resilience to ultimately improve IBD-related outcomes. Subsequent research should focus on enhancing the psychometric robustness of the scale by administering it to different patient samples and conducting additional factor analyses to contribute to its validation. By continually refining and validating the RISE-IBD, we can reinforce its utility as a pivotal tool in the ongoing effort to optimize the resilience of individuals navigating the challenges of IBD, therefore leading to improved QOL.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study utilized REDCap, a secure web application for building and managing surveys, supported by grant UL1TR004419 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health.
