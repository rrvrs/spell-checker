Previous research has suggested a &#x0201c;final pathway&#x0201d; of tinnitus presence, which occurs regardless of the specific mechanisms that resulted in alterations of auditory predictions and, eventually, tinnitus perception. Predictive inference mechanisms have been proposed as the possible basis for this final unifying pathway. A commonly used measure of prediction violation is mismatch negativity (MMN), an electrical potential generated in response to most stimuli that violate an established regularity. This narrative review discusses 16 studies comparing MMN between tinnitus and non-tinnitus groups. Methods varied considerably, including type of deviant, type of paradigm and carrier frequency. A minority of studies matched groups for age, sex and hearing, with few measuring hyperacusis. Frequency deviants were the most widely studied; at frequencies remote from tinnitus, MMN was consistently smaller in tinnitus groups, though hyperacusis or altered distress or attention could not be ruled out as explanatory factors. Few studies have used tinnitus-related frequencies; these showed larger MMN to upward frequency deviants above the tinnitus frequency, and larger MMN to upward intensity deviants at or close to the tinnitus frequency. However, the latter appears a correlate of hyperacusis rather than tinnitus, and tinnitus groups without hyperacusis instead show larger MMN to downward intensity deviants than controls. Other factors that affect MMN amplitudes included age, attention, and the specific characteristics of the range of stimuli across a particular experiment paradigm. As such, MMN cannot presently be considered a specific biomarker of tinnitus, but showed potential to objectively characterise a number of auditory processing traits relevant to tinnitus and hyperacusis.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10162-024-00970-1.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tinnitus</kwd><kwd>Mismatch negativity</kwd><kwd>Predictive coding</kwd><kwd>Biomarker</kwd><kwd>MMN</kwd><kwd>Review</kwd><kwd>Tinnitus mechanisms</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Association for Research in Otolaryngology 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mechanisms of Tinnitus</title><p id="Par2">Tinnitus stems, at least partially, from functional changes at different levels of the auditory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The classical explanation of tinnitus appearance is that peripheral auditory damage induces tinnitus through homeostatic plasticity processes acting to preserve mean firing rates in the face of diminished input, which in turn elicit increased spontaneous firing, excessive neural synchrony and/or tonotopic map reorganisation. Other possible tinnitus-causing factors are changes in inhibitory processes, for instance in thalamic nuclei, or facilitation of non-auditory input into the auditory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Coordination between excitatory and inhibitory firing allows neural gain to adjust or &#x0201c;compensate&#x0201d; for any changes in its function by altering intrinsic excitability, receptor expression, neurotransmitter release volume or probability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is additive noise (that can occur at multiple different levels) which possibly compensates for overt hearing loss. This central noise may be a part of homeostasis maintenance within the brain, in part through a bottom-up process of adaptive stochastic resonance (SR). SR theory states that addition of uncorrelated neural noise allows a particular narrow range of signals that are weak, for example, due to impaired cochlea neurons, to increase via SR and reach a threshold in the nonlinear auditory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These factors, however, may alter sensory perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].
</p><p id="Par3">Predictive coding is a common framework which explains perception as a result of constant updating of internal models of the environment based on sensory input. From the lower levels of the sensory system, we receive current sensory input. Higher level predictions about the sensory input are based on prior beliefs and expectations. The bottom-up sensory information ascends through the neural pathway via excitatory neurons, and top-down predictions are relayed down by inhibitory neurons, to be compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Any discrepancies between them generate a <italic>prediction</italic>
<italic>error</italic> signal, which can then be used to update the model to bring its predictions more in line with sensory input. Prediction errors and predictions are each weighted by <italic>precision</italic>, which reflects the level of confidence, reliability or importance the system attaches to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Where prior predictions carry a lot of precision, the resulting <italic>posterior</italic> perceptual inference is closer to the prior prediction than the sensory input. On the other hand, when prior predictions carry relatively less precision, prediction errors have more influence over the resulting posterior perceptual inference, aligning perceptual inference more closely to the sensory input. Precision is principally encoded by postsynaptic gain, which at a cortical level is principally controlled by the basal forebrain cholinergic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to this view, attention operates via (and is the same as) increasing the precision of specific topographic regions of sensory input.</p><p id="Par4">In predictive coding frameworks, tinnitus is argued to occur when spontaneous activity in the auditory pathway is subject to sufficiently high precision to create an inferred percept by over-riding the default auditory prediction of silence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. After the tinnitus signal is recognised and learned, which can occur as a result of neural activity altered by any of the tinnitus onset mechanisms mentioned above, auditory predictions are adjusted accordingly, and a much lower level of sensory precision is required in the future to lead to the perception of tinnitus. Therefore, an individual becomes more predisposed to developing tinnitus, as weaker spontaneous signals could cross the threshold into conscious perception of tinnitus, or the person may more readily develop tinnitus from events such as noise exposure (that leads to heightened neural activity within the auditory system) or either chronic or even temporary hearing loss (such as ear plugging and infections).</p><p id="Par5">While this view remains largely theoretical, it could potentially unite many contributory mechanisms to tinnitus into a common framework and highlight the importance of also considering how differences or alterations in auditory predictive coding processes might either predispose people to developing tinnitus and/or result from the presence of chronic tinnitus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>What is Mismatch Negativity?</title><p id="Par6">Neural correlates of prediction error signals are commonly measured using electroencephalography (EEG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a pre-attentive evoked potential that indicates sensory regularity violations in comparison to recent sensory context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It quantitatively represents prediction errors created from these comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and its magnitude also indicates the precision of the prediction being violated. While MMN does not require attention, it is increased by attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which can be considered as it also quantitatively reflects the precision of the sensory input that violates the prediction. However, it is not a &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; marker of prediction error, as it also reflects other processes such as adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Sensory memory traces may underlie MMN, as these grow in tandem with repetition of the regular sensory context, allowing for a stronger response during comparison between the new incoming information and repetitive recent events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the auditory system, MMN generation has been attributed to changes in extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity in a network comprising bilateral primary auditory cortices and superior temporal gyri (secondary auditory cortex), prefrontal cortical regions, and the insula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Studies that collected responses to frequency deviants through a number of paradigm types using MEG were fitted to a number of potential network connectivity models using dynamic causal modelling (DCM); the best model was one with forward and back connections between the primary auditory cortex (A1), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), as well as intrinsic connectivity within A1 that represents adaptation mechanisms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This common network was confirmed in other auditory deviant types as well, but with small differences between deviant types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Importantly, increasing age affects the connectivity underlying MMN through stronger inhibition of the rIFG but increased connectivity between STG and A1. This possibly occurs due to decreased ability to create a sensory memory trace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, a DCM study showed that attentional modulation can increase the gain of intrinsic inhibitory neurons within A1 and inhibitory backward connections, which results in increased MMN amplitudes to attended compared to unattended stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Exposure to long-term occupational noise, even without explicit markers of hearing loss, may also alter the primary source of MMN: in participants who were exposed to noise, the maximum current strength appeared more lateralised towards the right temporal region whereas in the unexposed group, maximum current strength appeared more frontal (though these two groups also had significantly different attention scores on a cognitive test) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Other factors, such as sex and psychological factors, can also alter latencies and amplitudes of the MMN response (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Winning dynamic causal model to explain auditory MMN (reproduced from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]).

Within the auditory modality, a deviation could occur in simple sound features including frequency, intensity, duration, location or omission (silent gap). Amplitudes of auditory MMN responses have been shown to have good test&#x02013;retest reliability over separate recordings when conducted on the same subjects on multiple occasions, or in multisite experiments, in a variety of paradigm types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. MMN is represented in EEG data as a negative polarity waveform over the vertex, typically using a mastoid reference. It is calculated by subtracting the responses to standard auditory events from the response to a deviant auditory event, and usually occurs around 150&#x02013;250&#x000a0;ms after the onset of the deviant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], though the duration and latency can depend on the size of the deviant, with larger deviants giving MMN responses that begin earlier, are shorter in duration and larger in amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Timeframes in which MMN is studied however may differ depending on the paradigm, as simpler deviations may create delayed and prolonged MMN waveforms even in healthy participants (e.g. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows responses to simple duration deviants, and has a later MMN timeframe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Example MMN and its calculation.

Even much of the research into risk factors of tinnitus (except hearing loss-related factors) is not yet conclusive enough to determine causal relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, it is not clear which mechanisms are required for tinnitus development, or instead are correlates of closely related conditions such as hearing loss and hyperacusis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Hearing loss has been established as the largest risk factor of tinnitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Hyperacusis (a disorder in which normal environmental sounds are experienced as uncomfortably loud) also often co-occurs with tinnitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Frequently, these factors are not subject to stringent enough controls in tinnitus research to know which condition(s) actually relate to any observed neural changes. In this review, we discuss whether MMN can be used to indicate tinnitus presence in all participants, whether or not they have these confounding conditions.</p><p id="Par9">Another difficulty in determining tinnitus mechanisms is that tinnitus research has been heavily guided by animal studies; there is no standardised animal model, and limited correlation between different putative measures of tinnitus in animals, such as the acoustic startle reflex and conditioned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A reliable diagnostic test for tinnitus in animals that has also been validated in humans would allow tinnitus research findings from human and animal research to be better aligned.</p><p id="Par10">An ideal tinnitus biomarker would be one that indicates the presence of tinnitus across all the potential subgroups, irrespective of specific contributory mechanisms. Such a biomarker would not only help to better understand essential core tinnitus mechanisms, but also allow treatment studies to more objectively determine their effectiveness across tinnitus groups. As explained above, predictive coding frameworks might potentially unite the different mechanisms that potentially lead to subjective tinnitus by providing a potential &#x0201c;final&#x0201d; measurement that occurs in all individuals with tinnitus regardless of initial causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It is, therefore, appealing to search for tinnitus biomarkers that reveal aspects of auditory predictive processing that are common to a majority of, or even all, cases of tinnitus. However, the question remains as to whether MMN can act as such as biomarker.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>MMN and Tinnitus</title><p id="Par11">Using studies that include deviations in simple sound features, one might identify changes in MMN associated with tinnitus in two possible ways: the first is that the presence of tinnitus causes changes in MMN as a result of either the sound properties itself, altered auditory predictions, or secondary to distress or altered attention; and the second possibility is that MMN could reflect altered sound processing that might affect one&#x02019;s propensity to tinnitus (e.g. determination of regularities in auditory signals). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. A number of studies have been carried out to investigate alterations in deviance detection in chronic subjective tinnitus compared to controls, using different types of oddball paradigm (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Studies that did not feature a control group were not included because tinnitus mechanisms and biomarkers were of particular interest, rather than correlates of tinnitus distress.

Every second stimulus is a deviant of some kind (interspersed with standards), but each deviant only differs in one of the following characteristics: frequency (usually&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10%), intensity (usually&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;dB), duration (25&#x000a0;ms rather than 75&#x000a0;ms), perceived location (800 us latency difference between left and right stimuli sources) or there may be a silent gap (7&#x000a0;ms silent gap in the middle of the 75&#x000a0;ms stimulus tone).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Examples of classical oddball paradigms. <bold>a</bold> A classicalfrequency paradigm with tones at 1&#x000a0;kHz.

Notably, the majority of these oddball studies, whether classical or multi-feature, focused on lower frequencies (commonly 1000&#x000a0;Hz). While this follows MMN research into other phenomena such as ageing, cognitive function and even Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, this choice of frequency to study tinnitus is in other respects counter-intuitive, considering tinnitus pitch tends to be fairly high frequency, likely due to its high comorbidity with sensorineural hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

The aforementioned multi-feature study also saw a reduced MMN amplitude in tinnitus in response to a <italic>downward</italic> frequency deviant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, another study found no differences in response to downward deviants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Unfortunately, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] did not report the exact frequencies used in their control condition, only mentioning that the standard tones were one octave below the edge frequency of each tinnitus participant, with three downward deviant conditions (1, 2 or 4% lower than standard frequency). The edge frequency is calculated by finding the largest difference in hearing threshold between one tested frequency and the next (e.g. 2000&#x000a0;Hz and 4000&#x000a0;Hz in standard Pure Tone Audiometry). Finally, there were also two multi-feature studies that did not differentiate between the directionality of the frequency deviant, who also found an overall weaker amplitude to these deviants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Some of the studies had limitations in terms of samples sizes and control matching, either for age or in hearing thresholds. Previous studies found reduced MMN amplitudes, associated with increasing age, in response to both upward and downward frequency deviants (as well as duration, but not intensity, deviants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Unfortunately, the two studies that formally matched on both age and hearing did not differentiate between upward and downward frequency deviants; therefore, it is unclear whether the directionality of the deviant played a role in this set of findings. However, the only two studies that found similar MMN amplitudes in response to <italic>upward</italic> frequency deviants between the two groups were matched in hearing thresholds but had tinnitus participants who were significantly older than controls. Other factors that may have influenced those findings include the higher anxiety score in the tinnitus group, which has previously been related to larger MMN amplitudes, and the additional presence of distant higher frequencies within the paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This may be an important factor for the MMN responses, in control participants in particular, as previous studies have shown different patterns, in an intensity oddball paradigm run on healthy participants, simply on account of blocks of a different frequency being present elsewhere in the experiment, even though the current and recently preceding stimuli were identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]).

Another study had age-matched control participants but did not report THI scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The latter study had the largest difference between the standard (500&#x000a0;Hz) and deviant (tinnitus match or 8&#x000a0;kHz) frequencies. The authors found that during a passive paradigm (with no active auditory task but with a distractor, i.e. a silent movie), there were no differences in MMN amplitude in response to an <italic>upward</italic> frequency deviant <italic>toward</italic>s the tinnitus frequency between tinnitus and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], tinnitus participants were recruited in a clinical setting, based on matching their tinnitus pitch to 8&#x000a0;kHz. Eight kilohertz was used as a <italic>downward</italic> deviant (D1) from the standard (8.5&#x000a0;kHz). There was also an upward deviant set at 9&#x000a0;kHz (D2). The control group did not show a significant MMN response to either of the deviants (though there was a trend towards a larger response for D1). The tinnitus group showed a significantly stronger MMN amplitude to D2 which was further <italic>away</italic> from their tinnitus frequency but not D1, which was the tinnitus pitch match [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The tested ear of the tinnitus group on average had some hearing loss (up to 60&#x000a0;dB at 8&#x000a0;kHz) while controls had normal hearing, which may have affected responses both to D1 and the standard. Additionally, the hearing thresholds in the tinnitus group could have been lower for 9&#x000a0;kHz than 8&#x000a0;kHz, thus leading to a combined upward intensity and upward frequency deviant. The second study that used matched tinnitus frequency as a deviant used a standard tone that was 100&#x000a0;Hz &#x0201c;different&#x0201d; from the matched tinnitus pitch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. They did not specify the direction in which the deviant tone changed, but this stimulus set-up was probably most like D1 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].

Differences between this and the other two studies might lie in better hearing matching or exclusion of participants with low pure-tone loudness discomfort level (LDL) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. LDLs have been associated with presence of hyperacusis, which remains a significant confounding factor in tinnitus research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. However, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] did not report the LDL cut-off values they used in their exclusion criteria so it is not possible to assess their reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Non-Tinnitus Pitch-Matched Stimuli</title><p id="Par20">One study used the audiometric lesion edge (LE) of each tinnitus participant as the tinnitus pitch match [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. LE was defined as the point just below the frequency at which hearing ability began to deteriorate according to pure-tone audiometric testing. However, a recent study showed that LE is much lower than the tinnitus frequency in people with sensorineural hearing loss, and frequency of maximal hearing loss tended to be just below the tinnitus frequency regardless of the exact configuration of the hearing loss (steep/notched/gradual/inverted &#x0201c;U&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This homeostatic theory of tinnitus pitch arising from compensatory hyperactivity within the hearing loss area has been supported by other research over the tonotopic model (which posits that the activity occurs in the tonotopic area just below the hearing loss region) (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]). Regarding the [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] experiment, the LE frequency was used as a standard tone along with a control standard tone which was one octave below LE. Deviants were 1, 2 or 4% below either of the standard conditions. There was a deviant type dependency in the LE condition, where the 1% deviant elicited a stronger response in the tinnitus group compared to controls while the 2% deviant elicited a weaker response. Furthermore, there was an inverse relationship between tinnitus distress and the 2% deviant MMN amplitudes. Notably, as there was only one other study that looked into <italic>downward</italic> frequency deviants, which used a multi-feature paradigm rather than the classical frequency oddball paradigm, there could be a plethora of reasons for the discrepancy including the differences in sample-matching limitations as well as paradigm contexts (including both presence of other deviant types and far-away frequencies).</p><p>Two further studies explored MMN response amplitudes to frequency deviants but did not make an explicit pitch-matching attempt. Both of these used multi-feature paradigms but different frequencies, and one included fewer deviant types than the other. One study, which also included lower frequencies, used frequencies around 5&#x000a0;kHz and found a reduction in MMN amplitudes in response to both <italic>downward</italic> and <italic>upward</italic> frequency deviants in tinnitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This, however, was the study that had significant differences in age between the two samples, which may have led to the reduction of MMN amplitudes independently of tinnitus (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). Another study investigated potential effects of high tinnitus distress on MMN amplitudes compared to a group with low tinnitus distress and a control group, all of which were hearing and age-matched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The frequencies used in this study were around 8&#x000a0;kHz. All groups showed similar MMN amplitudes in response to <italic>downward</italic> frequency deviants. In response to the <italic>upward</italic> frequency deviants, the low tinnitus distress group had similar MMN amplitudes to controls. However, the high distress tinnitus group had significantly weaker MMN than either of the other two groups. While there is a possibility that the lack of tinnitus pitch-matching also affected this result, it is interesting to compare it with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], which saw larger MMN amplitudes in the tinnitus group than the controls in response to a deviant tone that was 100&#x000a0;Hz closer in frequency to the tinnitus pitch-match than the standard tones. Both studies matched participants in age and hearing, but [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] excluded participants with suspected hyperacusis by excluding those with low LDLs. LDL scores do sometimes have low sensitivity however, so these tests may miss some cases of the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Neither of the tinnitus distress groups in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] had a similar alteration in response pattern to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] compared to controls, and the most clear differences between the two comparisons were the paradigm and the explicit lack of hyperacusis (as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] did not use a hyperacusis measure). However, there is also the possibility that the smaller control group sample size in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] led to an unrepresentative result.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Frequency Deviants: Conclusion</title><p id="Par22">Overall, while a number of studies have explored the effect of tinnitus presence on response to frequency deviation (particularly in lower frequencies), there are still many gaps in the literature. For example, there is a notable lack of downward frequency deviant studies in lower frequencies using classical oddball paradigms, and a lack of differentiation between deviant directionality in multi-feature studies. Furthermore, out of 11 published papers that included a control group and investigated MMN responses to frequency deviants, six did not fully match the groups on hearing and age, and only one explicitly measured and excluded hyperacusis. While the multi-feature paradigm studies have generally been more successful in group matching, these studies did not attempt to look at responses to deviants near the tinnitus pitch (though two authors did use frequencies that possibly were close to tinnitus frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]).

These results were supported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], which did not differentiate between the two deviant directions but found that overall, tinnitus was associated with reduced MMN amplitude to intensity deviants to tones around 1&#x000a0;kHz. These authors also accounted for cognitive function, including only participants who scored within normal range on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. This is important as some previous research suggested that decreased MMN responses to both upward and downward intensity deviants are related to impaired working memory (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]), and decreased MMN responses to <italic>upward</italic> intensity deviants were related to higher age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], though others found no differences between younger and older participants (with and without depression) or older healthy participants compared to participants of similar age but with mild cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].

Participants with tinnitus had larger MMN responses to <italic>upward</italic> deviants, but smaller MMN responses to <italic>downward</italic> deviants, compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. During this experiment, and in keeping with most previous studies, a passive task was utilised in which each participant chose a subtitled, silent film to watch during the EEG recording. Another study contrasted results obtained during this passive task with those during an active auditory attention task, and an active visual attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. This study only used the edge frequency of the tinnitus, measured using the method from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The MMN response patterns, both in the tinnitus and the control groups, recorded during the passive task were consistent with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Additionally, the auditory attention task increased the MMN response amplitudes to both upward and downward deviants in the tinnitus group, without qualitatively changing the profile of MMN responses. This was a helpful finding because MMN literature in tinnitus has used both auditory attention tasks and passive attention tasks in the past, and the results of these studies can be meaningfully compared if profiles of response difference between tinnitus and control groups only change quantitatively, rather than qualitatively, on account of this. However, a visual task largely attenuated the MMN responses to <italic>upward</italic> deviants, especially in the tinnitus group compared to controls. In response to <italic>downward</italic> deviants, MMN was present for the tinnitus group, but not for the control group, during the visual task. Importantly, both of the studies described in this section may have been influenced by the presence of hyperacusis in the tinnitus group. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], the tinnitus group had an HQ mean score of 16.05, which was both significantly higher than the control group HQ mean score, and just above the suggested cut-off score of 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Tinnitus-Like and 1&#x000a0;kHz Frequencies</title><p id="Par27">To investigate whether tinnitus is associated with differences in MMN responses to stimulus frequencies unrelated to the region of the hearing loss and tinnitus, a 1-kHz control frequency was used as one of the frequencies within the roving intensity paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The authors also used the edge frequency from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] as the tinnitus-match frequency because there, the edge frequency showed stronger responses compared to the centre frequency. While results in the tinnitus group were similar to those from the previous study that used very similar (tinnitus centre and tinnitus edge) frequencies, MMN responses to tinnitus frequency tones in the control group became more like those of the tinnitus group once a 1-kHz frequency stimulus condition was added. Thus, these results did not follow the expected pattern in controls and did not show the strength of between-group differences as in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], for reasons which we explain in the following section.</p><p>Notably, none of two aforementioned studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]) controlled for hyperacusis presence, which explains potential discrepancies between the results according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] findings. In this study which accounted for hyperacusis, at 1&#x000a0;kHz, the <italic>upward</italic> deviant elicited a significantly weaker MMN response only in the group of T&#x02009;+&#x02009;H&#x02009;+&#x02009;participants while controls and T&#x02009;+&#x02009;H- participants had similar responses.

This finding strongly implies that intensity deviant MMN abnormalities from previous studies are largely reflective of hyperacusis rather than tinnitus per se (with implications for frequency deviants still unknown) and highlights larger MMN to downward intensity deviants in stimuli around the tinnitus frequency as, currently, the sole abnormality specifically attributable to tinnitus.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Distance Between Frequencies Affects Intensity Deviant Responses</title><p id="Par29">While [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] could explain some of the differences in tinnitus sample responses, the differences seen in response patterns of the controls remained unexplained.

However, a subsequent study aiming to clarify this discrepancy, which used three healthy control groups (and no tinnitus groups), showed that there was a striking difference in MMN patterns between intensity roving paradigms where different experimental blocks were set at frequencies with a small frequency difference between them (6&#x000a0;kHz and 1/3 octave lower) compared to either a single frequency (6&#x000a0;kHz only) or a larger frequency difference between blocks (6&#x000a0;kHz and 1&#x000a0;kHz) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. That is, the presence of different frequency stimuli in remote parts of the same experimental session had a major effect on the MMN response profile to otherwise identical standard and deviant stimuli.

While an assumption is being made in this conclusion about the three samples in the multi-feature studies, it seems in accordance with the roving paradigm findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, the differences seen between T&#x02009;+&#x02009;H&#x02009;+&#x02009;and T&#x02009;+&#x02009;H- might alternatively result from tinnitus distress, rather than hyperacusis, as the two groups had significantly different THI scores (similarly to upward frequency responses in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]). On the other hand, all three of the multi-feature studies that used lower frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] had tinnitus samples with higher THI scores than the T&#x02009;+&#x02009;H&#x02009;+&#x02009;group in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">In response to roving stimuli at tinnitus-like frequencies, the reported findings also seem consistent, showing both the reproducibility of the findings, and also the implications of different choices of paradigm depending on the type of intensity deviant response abnormality one is trying to highlight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. For example, hyperacusis was characterised by increased upward and reduced downward intensity MMNs. The pattern related to hyperacusis might be best revealed using narrowly different frequencies, to give the maximal contrast between the intensity conditions compared to controls. Conversely, tinnitus without hyperacusis was characterised by increased downward intensity deviants, and therefore may be best revealed using single-frequency or widely spaced frequency differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Other Deviant Types</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Duration Deviants</title><p id="Par32">Overall, six studies included duration deviants. However, this has not been the sole focus of these studies. Within multi-feature paradigms, at frequencies below 5.5&#x000a0;kHz (most often at 1&#x000a0;kHz), tinnitus was associated with reduced MMN amplitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, the studies in which duration deviants were used as a rare control deviant found that the tinnitus and control groups had similar MMN amplitudes to duration deviant in response to both 1&#x000a0;kHz and tinnitus-like frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. One potential difference could be the number of included deviant types, as the three studies that found similar responses between the groups had less than four deviant types, whereas the other three studies had at least seven deviant types.</p><p id="Par33">Besides inclusion of a higher frequency, the level of distress experienced by the tinnitus groups may affect the results, as the latter studies had samples with the lower THI mean scores. However, the multi-feature study that used higher (but not necessarily tinnitus-like) frequencies showed no differences between high and low tinnitus distress groups, or between either and the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Age difference may explain the findings in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] as higher age has been linked to lower duration deviant amplitudes (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]). Higher levels of depression have been associated with tinnitus, and a review concluded that people with depression or PTSD-related hyper-arousal, as well as healthy people exposed to psychosocial stress-causing cues, tended to show attenuated MMN responses to duration deviants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. In adolescents, decreasing MMN responses to duration deviants have been related to increasing general psychological difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Decreased duration deviant amplitude was also associated with extensive negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in people at high risk of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Location Deviants</title><p id="Par34">Location deviants were only studied as part of multi-feature paradigms in three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In two of these studies, MMN responses were reduced in the tinnitus group compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], but one study did not find a significant difference between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is not immediately clear why the difference in findings occurred. Similar speculations to differences that caused duration deviant response differences include possible presence of hyperacusis and psychological difficulties that were not measured in the samples. Previous research that explored sound source localisation (but not using MMN) has generally found that tinnitus interferes with this ability especially at a higher frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], but only in certain sound types that included pure tones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. However, this may be in part due to effects of hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Additionally, presence of unilateral tinnitus may increase the localisation difficulties on the same side as tinnitus compared to the opposite side or in cases of bilateral tinnitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Silent Gap (Omission) Deviants</title><p id="Par35">Three multi-feature paradigm studies found decreased MMN responses to silent gap deviants compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], while one found that only the high distress tinnitus group had reduced MMN, but not the low distress tinnitus group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The low distress group had much lower THI scores than any other group in these four studies, so it is possible that that tinnitus severity is related to the reduced silent gap deviant MMN response. Alternatively, the higher frequencies used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] compared to the other studies may have been related to the differences in a way that has not yet been explored. Frequencies above 4&#x000a0;kHz were also used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] but due to the inclusion of 1&#x000a0;kHz blocks and the differences in age of the groups, the reason for their result was unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">A review (including studies that did not use MMN measures) concluded that there is a possibility that tinnitus does cause participants to require a longer gap to detect it compared to controls, as this was found in seven studies that used various types of gap detection tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. An additional important factor may have been musical education in the two groups, as gap detection tests scores were significantly different between musicians and non-musicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Other Deviant Types: Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">Overall, to understand whether tinnitus presence has an impact on detection of duration, location or silent gap deviants, more research is needed that focuses specifically on these types of deviants. The duration, silent gap and location deviants may reflect psychological/cognitive factors that may or may not stem from tinnitus, rather than the percept itself. However, this conclusion is based on speculation from previous literature. Location deviant responses may also reflect auditory factors such as hearing loss or tinnitus lateralisation. Silent gap detection may be related to tinnitus presence, but this conclusion is also not based on MMN literature, and they may also reflect musical experience.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par38">Overall, the simple sound features that have been most researched and are likely the most relevant to the tinnitus percept rather than related symptoms are frequency and intensity. Frequency deviants have been studied for longer, but require more tightly controlled samples in terms of hearing and age, as currently the true mechanisms behind the differences seen in tinnitus groups compared to controls remain inconclusive. Additionally, splitting directionality of the deviants, and studying both upward and downward frequency deviants, is needed to understand how widespread the association between tinnitus and MMN alterations is. Intensity deviant findings still need to be replicated to determine whether these can allow researchers to differentiate between tinnitus with and without hyperacusis. Another useful direction would be to understand whether the findings in all deviant types could be partially explained by tinnitus distress rather than hyperacusis.</p><p id="Par39">Groups with tinnitus and without hyperacusis group reflect the closest thing to a &#x0201c;pure tinnitus&#x0201d; measure obtained within the intensity oddball paradigms, possibly similarly to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] within frequency oddball paradigms. However, measures by which the presence of hyperacusis was determined differed, with one study using LDLs and the other using HQ and IHS scores. Some inconsistencies between LDLs and questionnaire scores have been previously found, especially with tinnitus also present, and it has been suggested that both measures should be used to identify hyperacusis due to differing specificity and sensitivity of the two measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Essentially, LDL scores have high specificity, and if LDLs show altered values, one can be confident that participants have hyperacusis; however, these tests may miss some cases of the condition. HQ scores have high sensitivity, which would allow to correctly include participants with hyperacusis as they do not miss true cases, but the scores may be altered even in participants without hyperacusis. Therefore, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] may have erroneously kept some participants with hyperacusis, while in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] there may be some erroneously included participants within the T&#x02009;+&#x02009;H&#x02009;+&#x02009;group that did not truly have hyperacusis. However, this would only have weakened the findings, yet the findings for T&#x02009;+&#x02009;H&#x02009;+&#x02009;were strong. IHS scores were also collected to determine presence of hyperacusis in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], but this measure may also reflect tinnitus distress, anxiety and depression, which may reduce its selectivity for hyperacusis as opposed to tinnitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In the future, an interesting self-report to use would be the Hyperacusis Assessment Questionnaire, which has been reported to measure subcategories of hyperacusis without the limitations found in IHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">It may also be interesting to understand effects of certain emotions and cues on change detection in people with tinnitus. In some mentioned experiments, participants watched silent films during EEG recordings (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]). However, it has been found that seeing positive pictures was related to larger MMN amplitudes to intensity and duration deviants, compared to negative or neutral pictures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Auditory emotional cues (happy versus sad music) can also alter responses; visual cues could alter responses even to standard tones when a misleading cue had been presented beforehand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Aversive and more arousing sound elicited larger MMN amplitudes in healthy participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Studying differences in cue and emotion-based auditory predictions, and their violations, could add a whole additional layer of understanding to our knowledge about differences in sensory processing associated with tinnitus, and mechanisms of the percept itself compared to effects of tinnitus-related distress.</p><p id="Par41">A potential limitation of all mentioned MMN research is that the studies were not longitudinal. It may help to understand how the differences in sound processing develop over time in intermittent tinnitus and during the acute stage of constant tinnitus, as this could shine light on the development and divergence of the alterations in different mechanisms related to tinnitus/combination of tinnitus and comorbid conditions. It would be useful to understand whether MMN changes occur before, or follow after, tinnitus development.</p><p id="Par42">Another important factor may be whether or not participants had undergone any tinnitus treatment. While many studies recruited from ENT and tinnitus clinics, a large proportion did not report whether any treatment was received prior to the experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Other studies, which recruited via non-clinical routes, also did not report whether participants with tinnitus had ever undergone tinnitus treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. However, it may be important to understand how treatment (or tinnitus being non-bothersome) may alter MMN amplitudes, because two studies, in which two different types of tinnitus treatment were used, showed that MMN amplitudes in response to frequency deviants in participants with tinnitus became more similar to MMN amplitudes in controls, compared to MMN amplitudes seen pre-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. This pattern should be studied in order to understand whether MMN amplitudes can indicate tinnitus presence overall, or only presence of bothersome tinnitus.</p><p id="Par43">Within the limitations and caveats of this field of research, we can say that (1) the presence of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis seems to be fairly consistently associated with reduced MMN amplitude to frequency deviants (and seemingly other types of deviant) where stimuli are remote from the tinnitus frequency, but it is unclear how, and how directly, this relates to core mechanisms of tinnitus itself; (2) the presence of hyperacusis, with or without tinnitus, is associated with increased MMN amplitude to upward intensity deviants at the affected frequencies; (3) tinnitus without hyperacusis may be associated with increased MMN amplitude to downward intensity deviants around the tinnitus frequency, with effects on frequency deviants unknown; and (4) many factors peripherally related to tinnitus quantitatively affect the amplitude of MMN responses, including attention/task, and the overall range of stimuli used in the experiment.</p><p id="Par44">To conclude, MMN studies may provide interesting and useful insight into tinnitus mechanisms; however, more well-controlled investigations are still needed to fully grasp the meaning behind MMN alterations associated with tinnitus. It would be beneficial to include tight hearing and age-matching, questionnaires about mental health/cognitive ability and LDLs and self-reports about hyperacusis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
