This review aims to analyze the regulatory landscape in the U.S., safety, efficacy, and current challenges of PDTs, focusing on mental health conditions. Relevant articles were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and FDA Guidance Documents databases, supplemented by manual searches of reference lists from included studies. Inclusion criteria covered English-language studies on the development and application, therapeutic efficacy, and regulatory guidelines of PDTs in mental health. Data extraction and synthesis were conducted to summarize key findings and trends in the literature. FDA regulatory frameworks for PDTs are evolving through pathways of de novo and 510(k) applications, with patient-centric guidance. Clinical trials and real-world data support PDTs&#x02019; safety and efficacy, while highlighting regulatory needs. Challenges include payer coverage, patient accessibility, and data privacy concerns. Mixed patient feedback reveals areas for improvement. Limited healthcare provider engagement and payer coverage contributed to financial challenges for PDT manufacturers. Future trends suggest that PDTs will expand beyond mental health. The evolving landscape underscores the need for continued research, regulatory refinement, and collaborative efforts across stakeholders to ensure the successful integration of PDTs into healthcare.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs)</kwd><kwd>digital health</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>FDA regulations</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>1. Introduction</title><sec id="sec1dot1-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>1.1. PDT Definition</title><p>PDTs represent a rapidly developing domain within the digital healthcare landscape. PDTs are software-based prescription therapies delivered on software platforms that are designed to directly address and manage a broad spectrum of significant diseases and disorders as a subcategory within the domain of digital therapeutics (<xref rid="pharmacy-13-00019-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The devices are accessible via computers, smartphones, mobile applications, wearable devices, or web portals (<xref rid="pharmacy-13-00019-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Their effectiveness has been validated both as stand-alone and combination therapies. PDTs are &#x0201c;cleared&#x0201d; as Class II medical devices based on clinically relevant safety and efficacy data obtained from clinical trials. Typically, FDA-cleared medical devices are not required to undergo clinical trials, unlike FDA-approved products, which must undergo these trials to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness. However, PDTs are an exception according to the FDA regulations that despite being FDA-cleared, they are required to undergo clinical trials.</p><p>In contrast to traditional healthcare practices, digital healthcare operates via a patient&#x02013;machine&#x02013;HCP interface, providing tailored care and precision medicine through an unconventional workflow [<xref rid="B1-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The HCP functions as a consultant, guide, or collaborator, engaging patients actively in the decision-making processes. The health data are disseminated among multiple shareholders, including institutions, hospitals, and patients, facilitated by dynamic point-of-care delivery as long as the patient is present [<xref rid="B1-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this review is to thoroughly examine the therapeutic effectiveness and utilization trends of mental health PDTs in the clinical setting. Additionally, it seeks to explore the impact of PDTs on patient outcomes, the challenges and opportunities in their adoption, and the roles of different stakeholders in facilitating their integration into healthcare systems.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>1.2. PDTs in Mental Health</title><p>The development and access of PDT products is heavily focused on mental health, driven by the convergence of factors including the high burden of mental health disorders, the technological capabilities of personalized medicine, and regulatory support from the FDA through clear pathways. PDTs have emerged as a transformative force in the prevention, management, and treatment of mental health disorders. They provide innovative solutions to address various types of diseases, including MDD, ADHD, PTSD, etc. [<xref rid="B2-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Mental health PDTs may function as a stand-alone therapy or part of a combination therapy. Stand-alone PDTs in mental health are individual therapies that operate independently of other interventions, providing patients with tailored tools for self-directed mental health management that cater to their individual needs and preferences. Conversely, most mental health PDTs operate as combination therapy concomitant with existing pharmacological interventions as part of comprehensive treatment plans. The integration of PDTs with traditional treatments expands current clinical practices. They offer evidence-based care to reduce patient stigma, improve access to care, mitigate provider shortages, and streamline complex healthcare systems. Additionally, PDTs may lower the risk of adverse events serving as non-pharmacologic interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>2. Regulatory Pathways</title><p>In the U.S., the FDA and other regulatory bodies are currently in the process of developing guidelines for digital therapeutics. Nonetheless, some established guidelines exist to evaluate software in clinical settings, particularly in terms of clinical assessment. The primary oversight of this protocol falls under the IMDRF, a voluntary association comprising international medical regulators [<xref rid="B3-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The FDA plays a pivotal role within the IMDRF and holds responsibility for regulating the utilization of PDTs in the U.S. [<xref rid="B3-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The FDA regulates PDTs by approving or clearing them as Class II devices [<xref rid="B4-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although PDTs manifest different technology from traditional medical devices, they are reviewed by the CDRH, which may not always align with the iterative and dynamic nature of the software treatments [<xref rid="B3-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Following the evaluation of a digital treatment in one or more clinical studies, including randomized controlled trials, the data and formal requests for authorization are subsequently submitted through one of two FDA pathways. Each pathway is characterized by distinct regulatory and evidence-based requirements as outlined below.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>2.1. De Novo Pathway</title><p>The FDA uses the de novo request pathway to classify novel medical devices that demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness but lack a legally marketed predecessor [<xref rid="B5-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Devices classified through a de novo request can serve as references for subsequent premarket notification submissions. There are two options for submitting a de novo request for classification into Class I or II [<xref rid="B5-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first option is to submit after receiving a high-level determination of not SE in response to a 510(k) submission [<xref rid="B5-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Alternatively, the second option entails submission without preceding 510(k) submission and determining the absence of a legally marketed device for SE determination [<xref rid="B5-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>2.2. 510(K) Pathway</title><p>A 510(k) is a submission sent to the FDA prior to the commercialization of a device. Its purpose is to demonstrate the device is safe and effective, establishing it is SE to a legally marketed device [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Submitters are required to compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices, known as &#x0201c;predicates&#x0201d;, and support their claims of SE [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A device is considered SE to a previously approved predicate device if it has the same intended use and technological characteristics [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Until the FDA declares a device is SE to a predicate, it cannot be legally marketed in the U.S. Typically, this determination is made within 90 days based on the information provided by the submitter [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Upon receiving confirmation of SE, the device can proceed to be marketed in the U.S. [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, if there are changes to an existing device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or if it is proposed for a new intended use, a new 510(k) submission is required [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>2.3. Graphic Comparison of Regulatory Pathway Timelines (De Novo vs. NDA)</title><sec id="sec2dot3dot1-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>2.3.1. IDE to De Novo Timeline</title><p>The process of bringing a medical device to market involves several phases with varying timelines. An IDE is a regulatory submission that allows an investigational device to be used in a clinical study to gather data on its safety and effectiveness. Initiating an IDE submission typically requires one to three months, followed by a 30-day FDA review [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Subsequently, the IDE clinical trial phase spans several months to years, allowing for comprehensive evaluation. In cases necessitating a de novo submission, the preparation phase also requires one to three months, followed by a five-month FDA review period [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. After Phase 2, sponsors can seek guidance on designing large Phase 3 studies, which is crucial before submitting an NDA. The submission of an NDA formally requests FDA consideration for marketing approval, with the FDA having 60 days to decide whether to file it for review. If filed, an FDA review team evaluates the drug&#x02019;s safety and effectiveness based on the sponsor&#x02019;s research. The culmination of these phases leads to the FDA&#x02019;s decision, marking the completion of the regulatory journey for the medical device. The comparison between the approval timeline of IDE and de novo is outlined in <xref rid="pharmacy-13-00019-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot2-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>2.3.2. Comparison of NDA and De Novo Timeline</title><p>The processes for bringing medical devices and pharmaceuticals to market involve distinct yet complex stages. Submitting an IDE submission for a medical device typically takes one to three months, followed by a subsequent 30-day FDA review [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The IDE clinical trial phase spans several months to years. For devices requiring a de novo submission, the preparation phase also takes one to three months, followed by a three-month FDA review [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The FDA decision marks the culmination of the regulatory journey. In contrast, drug development entails an IND submission, which takes one to three months for FDA approval [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The FDA review process lasts one to several months, and clinical trials span one to six years [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Upon completion of Phase II, an End of Phase II Meeting is conducted, followed by a six to twelve-month NDA or BLA preparation, a one to three-month submission phase, and a five-month FDA review [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. An Advisory Committee Meeting may be held, and the FDA&#x02019;s final approval decision takes several months [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Overall, both processes are intricate and time-intensive, each comprising its unique set of stages and durations (<xref rid="pharmacy-13-00019-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>3. FDA Special Considerations for PDTs</title><p>User-centered design and human factors are pivotal for PDTs&#x02019; success, relying heavily on user engagement. FDA guidelines underscore the importance of incorporating human factor principles into design, including user interfaces, usability testing, and ensuring user-friendliness [<xref rid="B8-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Emphasized elements include the provision of clear instructions, effective feedback mechanisms, and flexibility for diverse user needs [<xref rid="B8-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As the regulatory landscape evolves, manufacturers are urged to stay abreast of guidelines for successful market entry of innovative digital therapeutics.</p><p>Furthermore, PDTs stand apart from conventional pharmaceuticals due to their post-regulatory adaptability, especially when driven by AI or ML technologies [<xref rid="B1-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. How can a product be approved if it evolves over time and may potentially &#x0201c;hallucinate&#x0201d; responses to input? To address this, the FDA is progressively advancing its comprehensive regulatory framework for digital therapeutics, including PDTs.</p><p>Lastly, evolving regulations aim to guide industry players in the nuanced data submissions crucial for establishing safety and efficacy [<xref rid="B9-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Instead of evaluating outcomes for clinical and statistical significance, the FDA prioritizes the benefits of PDTs over baseline outcomes in clinical trials, given the assumed lower risk of PDTs.</p><p>The FDA&#x02019;s Digital Health Center of Excellence plays a crucial role in aiding manufacturers through the dynamic regulatory landscape. It serves as a comprehensive resource hub, offering insights into innovation, health equity, cybersecurity, and AI/ML applications in wireless devices. The center has issued 23 guidance documents (in draft and final stages) to assist manufacturers in preparing data for regulatory approval [<xref rid="B10-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>4. PDT Examples with Clinical Trial Data</title><p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of PDTs in mental health, we conducted a comprehensive keyword search using databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and FDA Guidance Documents. The keywords used in our database searches included software as medical device (SaMD), prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs); digital health; mental health. Our research focused on FDA-approved PDTs, covering both de novo and 510(k) pathways, and included all approved mental health and sleep disorder therapies. Key devices examined included reSET<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, EndeavorRx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, NightWare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sunrise Sleep Disorder Diagnostic Aid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, reSET-O<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Freespira<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Somryst<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Rejoyn<sup>TM</sup>, and PRISM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for PTSD. This review provided valuable insights into how these PDTs are innovating patient care and treatment outcomes.</p><p>Data extraction and synthesis were conducted to summarize key findings and identify trends over a five-month period starting 15 December 2023 for studies conducted in the U.S. PDTs that received clearance during this timeframe were included. The analysis compared 510(k) and de novo summaries, providing insights into clinical trial data, device functionalities, and the safety and efficacy of these therapies. Patient reviews were also incorporated to assess the effectiveness of the PDTs. ClinicalTrials.gov was a key source for understanding the clinical landscape, and the inclusion criteria centered on the development, application, efficacy, and regulatory guidelines of mental health PDTs.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>4.1. The First Digital Therapeutic</title><p>Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is an aripiprazole tablet equipped with an ingestible event marker sensor [<xref rid="B11-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is indicated for schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (monotherapy or with lithium/valproate), and MDD when used alongside other antidepressant medications [<xref rid="B11-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tracks medication adherence through a combination of an ingestible sensor, a wearable patch, and a smartphone application. The aripiprazole tablet contains a built-in ingestible sensor made of minerals found in most diets [<xref rid="B11-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Upon ingestion, the sensor is activated and emits an electrical signal as it contacts stomach fluid. The signal is then detected by a wearable patch worn by the patient, recording the time of medication intake [<xref rid="B11-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The data captured by the patch are subsequently transmitted to a smartphone application via Bluetooth, where medication ingestion data are displayed on a dashboard portal. Authorized HCPs can access the data to monitor adherence.</p><p>In 2017, Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was the first FDA-approved digital medicine system designed to enhance adherence in mental health patients through the Class III (higher risk due to ingestion of the device) premarket approval process [<xref rid="B12-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the trial involving 30 patients with schizophrenia, participants were administered the Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment once daily for eight weeks [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The safety sample comprised all 30 patients who used the Abilify MyCite system during the trial. Results indicated that most patients (64.9%) had exposure to the system for 50 to 56 days [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Adverse events were observed, with 35.1% experiencing device-associated TEAEs and 32.4% experiencing medication-associated TEAEs [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Two serious TEAEs were reported but were deemed unrelated to the treatment [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Ten patients discontinued the trial, citing reasons such as adverse events, withdrawal of consent, and protocol deviation [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These statistics provide insights into the safety and tolerability of the Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system in patients with schizophrenia during the trial period [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The trial concluded that there were not any safety concerns significant enough to change the labeling of the medication [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>It raised a controversy despite its approval. The debate around Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> centers on its ability to track medication adherence in patients with mental health conditions. The manufacturer Otsuka claims that such technology can offer valuable insights into adherence patterns, facilitating collaborative efforts between patients and HCPs to address non-adherence issues and improve health outcomes [<xref rid="B14-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Notably, Otsuka lacked evidence demonstrating enhanced adherence or improved health outcomes for patients using Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [<xref rid="B14-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has raised ethical and privacy concerns regarding the secure handling of sensitive health data. According to Otsuka, the Abilify MyCite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system not only records the timing of medication intake but also tracks the patient&#x02019;s activity level (number of steps) and resting time automatically [<xref rid="B12-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, a 2019 study criticized the regulatory approval process, citing insufficient evidence and a lack of improved medication adherence with the digital form of aripiprazole compared to the conventional version [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Given the ongoing debate, subsequent mental health software devices utilize various clinically meaningful endpoints to optimize clinical outcomes and diminish healthcare expenditures.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-pharmacy-13-00019"><title>4.2.

Healthcare providers can interpret integrated data to diagnose sleep disorders effectively.</p><p>The clinical trials for these PDTs have demonstrated both potential benefits and challenges. The benefits include demonstrated effectiveness in targeted populations, enhanced accessibility to treatment, and the potential for personalized interventions. The possible benefits are often lower compared to those of pharmacotherapies. Additionally, several limitations must be addressed, such as the quality and generalizability of the studies, small sample sizes, and the need for further evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy. For example, the clinical trial that led to the FDA approval of reSET<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was properly powered and detected significant differences in abstinence rates between the treatment and control groups.

However, the bankruptcy of Pear Therapeutics in 2023 has led the Oklahoma State Medicaid program to take a cautious approach to digital therapeutics due to concerns about their stability and reliability [<xref rid="B51-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Contrarily, there is a growing trend of private insurers extending coverage for PDTs via pathways of value-based payment models, flat fee reimbursement, subscription fees, bundled payments, or direct contracts among the plan, employers, and prescribers [<xref rid="B52-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, a dilemma still exists especially among private insurers. While PDTs promise to improve patient outcomes and mitigate healthcare costs in the long run, they often entail significant initial expenses. Payers may be hesitant to cover these devices due to concerns about the upfront financial investment, uncertainty about the devices&#x02019; real-world effectiveness, and the absence of well-defined reimbursement mechanisms.</p><p>PDTs usually serve as extensions of direct patient care, with a focus on minimizing in-person interactions between HCPs and patients, generating the collection of off-site data for monitoring mental health conditions, and offering real-time data to HCPs. Ultimately, PDTs will enhance behavioral health outcomes for patients [<xref rid="B50-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, payers may face the challenge of determining the value proposition of PDTs. Unlike conventional medications, these devices may not align seamlessly with existing reimbursement models, posing difficulties for payers in assessing their cost-effectiveness and allocating resources appropriately.</p><p>Moreover, robust evidence demonstrating the real-world impact and cost-effectiveness of PDTs may be needed, which requires dedicated timeframes and continuous surveillance. The available clinical trials failed to perform &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d;-finding studies to identify optimal usage, recruit diverse participants, reflect significant improvement upon the current standard of care, or explore long-term adverse events [<xref rid="B53-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consequently, payers may be cautious about covering these devices until there is a breakthrough PDTs in which there are sufficient data to support clinical effectiveness.</p><p>Therefore, the dilemma for payers revolves around balancing the potential advantages of PDTs in improving patient outcomes and reducing long-term healthcare costs with the immediate financial considerations and the need for robust evidence to justify coverage. Manufacturers are implementing marketing strategies to drive sales of PDTs due to the lack of insurance coverage. For example, Akili, Inc., the manufacturer of EndeavorRx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has introduced EndeavorOTC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a non-prescription alternative for adults with ADHD, utilizing the same technology [<xref rid="B18-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B54-pharmacy-13-00019" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].
