The goal in such cases is to restore functional and biological efficiency, ensuring that the teeth, periodontal structures, masticatory muscles, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) mechanisms all work in synchronized harmony. As such, a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the dental arches and other components of the masticatory system is critical for successful outcomes, from diagnosis through to the completion of treatment. In many cases, especially complex and comprehensive cases, we do not have enough time to work and check the information in the dental chair. Hence, we expect to create a set of data that most closely simulates the patient&#x02019;s actual condition, including teeth and dental arches about bones and faces. Two critical references in this simulation include the 3D position of the upper dental arch in the skull and the maxillomandibular relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Traditionally, we perform this by taking impressions, pouring plaster casts, and mounting casts with a facebow and articulator. Accurately mounting the mandibular arch (lower jaw) on an articulator is essential for diagnosing and planning treatments. This process involves determining whether to position the mandible seats in maximal intercuspal position (MIP) or centric occlusion (CO). In such cases, according to The Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms (v.10th, 2023) centric relation (CR) is a maxillomandibular relationship in which the condyles articulate in the anterior-superior position against the posterior slopes of the articular eminences while CO is the teeth position when the TMJ is at centric relation (CR), wherein the condyles articulate against the posterior slopes of the articular eminences in an anterior-superior posture. The mandible can only move fully rotating, providing a repeatable, therapeutically valuable reference position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although ideally, MIP should coincide with CO, in most cases, there is a discrepancy between CO v&#x000e0; MIP. Selecting between MIP and CO for mandibular mounting should be tailored to the patient&#x02019;s specific clinical situation. MIP is generally appropriate for individuals with stable occlusion and no temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Conversely, in cases involving occlusal discrepancies or TMJ issues, utilizing CO can offer a more precise representation of the jaw relationship, thereby enhancing treatment planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">On the other hand, maxillary mounting is a critical step, as its accuracy directly influences the success of subsequent stages. This step establishes the upper occlusal plane about the hinge axis. However, even using a facebow does not provide complete facial information, making it difficult to achieve a comprehensive plan in terms of both aesthetics and function. In contemporary dentistry, noticing and focusing on facial-driven dental treatment is crucial. Therefore, simulating the occlusion in a 3D relationship with joint and facial landmarks is vital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Nowadays, with the continuous development of digital dentistry, creating a virtual patient model that visually simulates the face and occlusion has become a reality. The digitization of dental arches, as well as the digitization of faces, have gradually become popular. In the digital workflow, virtual mandible mounting, which simulates the maxillomandibular relationship, can be easily obtained with an intra-oral scanner (IOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, digitized images of the face and dental arches can be combined in a simple, convenient way for doctors and patients. A high-accuracy virtual patient model is still a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although recent studies have demonstrated the potential of using a virtual facebow and facial scan files to create a virtual model, the accuracy of 3D maxillary mounting remains a limitation that should be improved. Previous studies have also indicated some suggestions for designing the transfer device to reduce data deviation and enhance patient comfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, a lack of studies combine exactly the facial data and dental arch at CO when the TMJ is in CR. Here, we aimed to develop a simple customized transfer key that facilitated upper dental arch virtual mounting using a face scanner while recording the 3D position of the lower arch at CO with an intraoral scanner. We then evaluated the virtual patient model&#x02019;s accuracy (trueness and precision) with a maxillomandibular relationship at CO in-vitro.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par8">In the in-vitro study, the subject was a phantom skull with soft tissue and full dental arches.

To design the skin model, we used modeling clay for sculpture to create the face shape with general anatomical landmarks such as ear, eyes, nose, and lips. Then, the silicone mold was cast from the sculpted skin model. The liquid silicone and catalyst (Elite Double 22 Normal, Zhermack, Italy) were mixed with an earthy orange color for skin tone according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions for preparing the silicone mixture. The silicone mixture was poured into the mold, and the air bubbles were removed after complete polymerization for 24&#x02009;h at room temperature. The silicone layer was gently removed from the mold, trimming the details on the silicone skin, including eye, nose, and mouth cavities, which were adjusted to ensure a good fit with the skull. Finally, silicone color was used to create details for the skin layer, simulating natural facial skin and covering the back surface with medical glue. The completed silicone skin layer was installed on the skull, and fit testing was done in a static state or when the lower jaw was moving (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C&#x02013;E</xref>).

The disc was unnoticed in this in-vitro design. We manually guided the mandible to the position where the left and right condyles of the skull sit in the center of the fossa to simulate the centric relation position. At that time, only the lower teeth were in contact with the surface of the bite plan of the key; the posterior teeth were completely open [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The contact point of the lower incisors on the insert&#x02019;s bite plan was marked with articulator paper. After guiding the lower jaw to the correct contact position on the bite plan, the self-cure resin was used to create two palatal occlusal locks on the first premolars and molars on both the left and right sides. The receptacle part was rotated until one arm aligned with the facial midline while the other was parallel to the line connecting the two pupils (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G, H</xref>). The spherical swivel joint connecting the insert part and the receptacle part of the transfer key was then secured. An experienced occlusion instructor conducted this entire procedure.

The obtained scanning files were all stored in STL format. IOS-STL files were exported for integration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>).

MetiSmile face scanner (Shining3D, China) with resolution: data acquisition camera 1.3 Mega Pixel, HD texture camera 5.0 Mega Pixel, published accuracy 50&#x003bc;m, optical field: 500&#x02009;mm, FOV 210*270&#x02009;mm, was set to handheld mode according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Computer systems and software were included with the scanner. In brief, the scanner was held at a distance of about 50&#x02009;cm from the face surface with optimal brightness adjustment, scanning from left to right, going around the entire face, then scanning from the chin to the nose over the head, from under the left ear to the head over the right ear. The transfer key was also recorded during the scanning process. The scanning process was monitored on the computer output image, ensuring that the entire face, ears, chin, forehead, and transfer key were scanned.

Then, the IOS files of both jaws were imported (step 1), and the upper jaw&#x02019;s IOS was aligned with the in-lab-scanned data of the key using overlapping reference points on the extent horizontal bar of the intra-oral part of the key (step 2). The upper jaw&#x02019;s IOS without the insert was then aligned using the four sharpest cusp reference points at teeth 14, 24, 18, and 28 (step 3).

The generation of an STL file from DICOM data commenced with importing the DICOM dataset, consisting of multiple image slices. All layers were subsequently merged to create a cohesive dataset for processing. A mask was then generated, with threshold values applied to segment the specific region of interest, encompassing the facial and jaw structures while excluding the osseous areas. Tools such as split masks, edit masks, and crop masks were employed to refine the selection, enabling zoomed and precise isolation of the targeted soft tissues while disregarding non-essential areas. The Mask 3D Preview mode facilitated a simulated visualization of the 3D reconstruction for validation purposes. Following successful segmentation, the mask was converted to a 3D mesh by calculating parts into discrete objects. Extraneous small shells were filtered out to enhance model fidelity, and the final STL file was exported.

More than the correct three-dimensional alignment of the upper and lower jaw relationships is required to achieve optimal treatment outcomes, particularly in comprehensive functional and aesthetic dental restoration. Accurately replicating the three-dimensional position of the maxilla relative to the cranial base, particularly concerning the temporomandibular joint socket, is also essential. This involves creating a virtual patient model that closely approximates the anatomy in digital dentistry. Our findings indicate that developing a digital virtual head model with relatively high accuracy is promising, as demonstrated by the precision and trueness of 0.69&#x02009;mm. Additionally, the 3D position of dental arches in centric relation can be reproducibly recorded with an average trueness of 0.51&#x02009;mm and precision of 0.41&#x02009;mm. In a comparable study, Li et al. reported the reproducibility of maxillary 3D position with an average trueness of 1.14&#x02009;mm and precision of 1.09&#x02009;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, their study collected facial scan data using smartphone scanners, which may affect research outcomes and introduce more significant inaccuracies. Based on our findings and previously reported data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we recommend using industrial-grade 3D scanners to acquire more precise facial data. In the digital workflow, 3D facial scanners performed comparably to traditional facebow records for virtual dental cast mounting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For the highest accuracy in cases requiring precise alignment of the jaw relative to the cranial base, combining a transfer device with a facial scanner is likely to yield optimal results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The devices play a crucial role in the integration of facial data and IOS data.</p><p id="Par27">The primary advantage of the transfer key developed in our study is its ability to simultaneously record two critical references for comprehensive occlusal simulation: (1) the relationship between maxillary and mandibular dental arches and (2) the three-dimensional relationship between occlusion and the cranial base. Our concept employs an anterior deprogrammer with an extra-oral extension that enables simultaneous capture of the maxillary&#x02013;mandibular relationship at the centric occlusion and the integration of both facial and intraoral scan data. The transfer key provides adjustments for the facial midline and interpupillary line using the extraoral part, which was shown on the facial scan data. The intra-oral part of the key was scanned during IOS scanning, which also contained the upper dental arch. Therefore, the occlusal plane information was also collected and transferred to the virtual phantom model by integration of scanned data.</p><p id="Par28">The intermaxillary relationship in centric relation is traditionally recorded in the analog workflow using methods such as cast articulation, maximum intercuspation (MIP), or Lucia jig combined with a bite index for CO-CR recording. Additionally, a facebow can be used to localize the maxilla&#x02019;s 3D position relative to the reference planes and terminal hinge axis movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several studies emphasize the importance of facebows in dental treatment planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In a digital workflow, the first reference can be recorded efficiently using an intraoral scanner with or without an anterior deprogrammer, depending on the case requirements. The second reference is more complex, and current methods involve superimposing IOS data with two-dimensional data, such as facial photographs or cephalometric X-rays, or three-dimensional data, such as CBCT scans, or by combining a virtual facebow and facial scan data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The hinge axis and third point of reference are important in the traditional facebow transfer data to simulate the patient&#x02019;s real condition. In digital workflow, by integrating the facial 3D scan data and intra-oral scan data, we could also create a virtual model that simulates the real patient. The mounting procedure may be slightly different between analog and digital workflow, although the final objects all simulate the closest patient&#x02019;s real condition. The intra-oral part of the key was scanned during IOS scanning, which also contained the upper dental arch. Therefore, the occlusal reference plane information was also collected and transferred to the virtual model by integration of scanned data. In this study, we compared the difference between CBCT data and a combination of full-facial data and IOS data. Our study applied the segmentation strategy as the previous study with evidenced accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, DCOM data in this study was the available reference that involved both face and jaw information at centric occlusion. In fact, a study also used CBCT data as a reference when investigating the accuracy of virtual facebow records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Our transfer key is designed to capture these two essential data points accurately. The intraoral insert component of our transfer key is inspired by the Lucia jig, making it easy to use, operate, and familiar to many practitioners. This component acts as an anterior deprogrammer, facilitating simple and effective recording of the centric relation (CR) position, which is critical in dental practice, especially in complex cases such as full-mouth rehabilitation and orthodontics. By mounting on the articulator in centric relation, centric occlusion can be assessed or adjusted as necessary. With its adjustable arm system for midline and pupil alignment, the extraoral receptacle component offers adaptability across diverse facial anatomies, further enhancing its utility in clinical applications. Incorporating 3D printing technology to fabricate customized transfer keys represents a significant advancement in the digital workflow for occlusal analysis on the virtual patient model. By combining this transfer key with IOS and facial scans, we achieved precision and trueness comparable to, and potentially exceeding, that of traditional facebow techniques, as supported by prior studies on the kinematic facebow and virtual facebow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The accuracy of the virtual patient model was validated by superimposing 3D images generated from IOS and facial scans onto CBCT-derived STL files. This analysis confirmed high levels of trueness and precision, particularly in the facial and dental regions critical for occlusal adjustments and restorations. Given the reliance on accurate jaw positioning in treatments such as orthodontics, full-mouth reconstructions, and TMJ-related therapies, the improved fidelity of virtual mounting with transfer key holds substantial clinical relevance. Additionally, the large field-of-view CBCT in the present study was used as the reference to evaluate the trueness of 3D images generated from the combination of face and teeth scans via transfer key at centric occlusion. In clinical situations, we can use only a face scanner and IOS with a transfer key to obtain the virtual patient model without CBCT. It reduces the usage of CBCT in unnecessary cases.</p><p id="Par30">In-vitro study design is the standard method to investigate the accuracy of optical devices and 3D images to eliminate any potential bias in clinical situations. Many previous studies investigated the virtual facebow technique&#x02019;s accuracy and used phantom models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, this design, while controlled, may not fully replicate clinical complexities such as patient movement, CR position, and variations in soft tissue resilience. Additionally, exploring further refinements in the transfer key&#x02019;s materials or design could enhance its durability and adaptability. In our study, limitations arose due to the partial fixation of the mobile edge of the silicone coating in the mandibular angles of the skull model. Although partially fixed, this edge could still move to some extent, contributing to the observed deviations in the face scan data. Furthermore, the alveolar bone and interproximal contact areas were covered with dental wax to simulate gingiva for improved IOS scanning. However, the wax was not represented on the CBCT and 3D reference images and was trimmed during superimposition. Inaccurate trimming in some areas of the gingival papilla was noted, as highlighted in red. Our present study did not integrate the dynamic data, but only static data. These issues can be addressed in subsequent human studies to assess the transfer key&#x02019;s clinical effectiveness. In the next studies, we continue to confirm our method&#x02019;s accuracy in clinical and motion-tracking situations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">Our study presents a novel, customized transfer key that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of virtual patient modeling with maxillomandibular relationship at centric occlusion. By integrating facial and intraoral scans with a 3D-printed transfer key, this approach provides a promising alternative to traditional methods, paving the way for more streamlined and patient-friendly digital dental workflows. Future studies should include in-vivo trials to assess the tool&#x02019;s robustness and accuracy in dynamic clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
