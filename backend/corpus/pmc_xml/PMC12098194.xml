This disturbance pulse was spatially aligned with soil moisture and vapour pressure deficit anomalies, implying an increasing role of drought in disturbance regimes (Senf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>). Drought legacy effects observed in the following years suggest that physiological recovery processes were impaired, and trees were prone to secondary impacts from pests and pathogens (Schuldt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The most severe and widespread disturbances in European forests have been caused by the European spruce bark beetle (<italic>Ips typographus</italic> L.), which primarily affects Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic> (L.) H. Karst.), a species constituting approximately 25% of the total growing stock in Europe&#x02019;s forests (Hl&#x000e1;sny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>). <italic>I. typographus</italic> belongs to the subfamily Scolytinae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and is one of the few bark beetle species exhibiting eruptive population dynamics, capable of rapidly increasing in number and causing extensive tree mortality (Raffa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2008</xref>). During outbreaks, enlarged beetle populations overwhelm tree defences through mass attacks, coordinated by chemical signalling that guides individuals to specific host trees (Raffa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>). The beetle typically targets trees older than 60&#x000a0;years and with diameter exceeding 20&#x000a0;cm (Wermelinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2004</xref>). Under outbreak conditions and high population densities, smaller and younger trees may also be colonized. Factors such as a high proportion of spruce, high stand density, advanced stand age, and the presence of forest edges are among the key conditions that predispose bark beetle infestation on the stand level (Netherer and Nopp-Mayr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par8"><italic>I. typographus</italic> possesses several traits regulated by temperature and photoperiod, such as spring swarming, generation timing, and voltinism, which allow it to adapt its life cycle across a broad geographic range (Baier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>; Bentz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>). In many parts of Europe, where the annual heat sum is sufficient, <italic>I. typographus</italic> can produce more than one generation per year (J&#x000f6;nsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>). While warmer climate increases the number of annually completed bark beetle generations and extends the beetles` flight period (Jakoby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>), heat and drought spells compromise the defence mechanisms of host trees (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>), Netherer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2021</xref>. Specifically, spruce cannot tolerate a drop in plant water potential below a certain limit (Schumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2024</xref>), at which point it closes stomata to prevent further water loss. This stomatal closure, typical of spruce&#x02019;s isohydric strategy, helps protect the tree against hydraulic failure, but also limits photosynthesis and thus the production of defence compounds against bark beetles (Hartmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). Hot and dry conditions can thus boost population growth of <italic>I. typographus</italic>.</p><p id="Par9">Historically, large outbreaks of <italic>I. typographus</italic> were mainly initiated by windthrows, which generated pulses of breeding material that boosted beetle population growth (Wermelinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2004</xref>). Upon successful colonization of windfelled trees, the enlarged beetle populations typically expanded into the surrounding forests and caused tree mortality that often exceeded the impact of the initial windthrow (Mezei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>). The outbreaks triggered by windthrows typically declined after several years due to the exhaustion of local resources and other mechanisms, such as decreasing fitness of individual beetles, intra-specific competition, increasing levels of antagonists, defence priming of host trees and changes in symbiont communities (Biedermann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">The recent emergence of drought-initiated outbreaks occurring in the absence of windthrows represents a distinct change away from the historical disturbance regime. Such drought-induced outbreaks have occurred across a range of environments and forest types in recent years, including lowland and montane forests of Czechia, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, and Sweden (Hl&#x000e1;sny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>; K&#x000e4;rvemo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>; Washaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2024</xref>). They have severe ecological and socio-economic consequences, including accelerated species turnover, reduced forest carbon stocks and increased rate of carbon release to the atmosphere, compromised cultural ecosystem values and increased timber price fluctuations (Buras et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>; Hl&#x000e1;sny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>; Asada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2023</xref>). While climate projections do not indicate any clear trend in windspeed (Seneviratne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>), suggesting a relatively stable frequency of outbreaks induced by windthrows, a strong trend in climate aridification throughout the distribution of Norway spruce (Vicente-Serrano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2013</xref>) suggests an increasing frequency of drought-induced outbreaks. The amplifying effect of climate change on outbreak size and severity together with the increased incidence of triggering events can thus lead to a substantial increase in forest disturbance by bark beetles. However, the possible future trajectories and their implications for the provisioning of ecosystem services remain unclear.</p><p id="Par11">Dynamic vegetation models are important tools for understanding ecosystem dynamics under climate change (Blanco and Lo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2023</xref>; Rammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2024</xref>). However, models are challenged by the emergence of novel process interactions and feedbacks, which require a continuous evaluation of model structure. In the context of <italic>I. typographus</italic> dynamics, models exist for simulating the interaction between windthrows and outbreaks, for example, PICUS, iLand, and LandClim (Temperli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>; Maroschek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>; Rammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2024</xref>). Water limitation typically serves as predisposing or amplifying factor in these models but is not considered as an inciting factor (sensu Manion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1981</xref>) of large-scale outbreaks. Given the experiences of years following 2018 and the expected future increase in drought frequency and severity, this design element of current models could lead to a considerable underestimation of bark beetle dynamics under climate change. Considering drought as predisposing, amplifying, and inciting factor of outbreaks explicitly could thus significantly improve simulations of climate change-induced shifts in disturbance regimes.</p><p id="Par12">Here, our objectives were to (i) develop an approach that incorporates drought-induced bark beetle outbreaks into the forest landscape and disturbance model iLand (Seidl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>; Rammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2024</xref>); (ii) test whether this approach is able to capture important characteristics of the recent bark beetle outbreak in Central Europe; (iii) analyze simulations incorporating the compound effects of wind- and drought-initiated outbreaks throughout the twenty-first century considering scenarios of climate change; and (iv) assess their impact on forest species composition and growing stock.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Simulation model</title><p id="Par13">iLand is a process-based forest landscape model that simulates forest dynamics at the level of individual trees for landscapes spanning several thousands of hectares (Seidl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>; Rammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2024</xref>). The model accounts for continuous processes such as tree growth, mortality, and regeneration, and discontinuous processes such as natural disturbances and forest management. iLand operates in a multiscale hierarchical framework, with large-scale processes forming constraints for processes at finer scales, and the dynamics at fine scales feeding into processes at higher scales.</p><p id="Par14">iLand dynamically simulates the regeneration, growth and mortality of individual trees, as influenced by climate, soil, initial state of the vegetation and disturbance. The spatial resolution of forest dynamics simulations is 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;m, while element cycles and environmental constrains related to energy, water and nutrients are considered at the scale of 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;m. iLand is driven by daily climate data, i.e., minimum and maximum air temperature, precipitation, radiation, and vapour pressure deficit. Production physiology is modelled using a light-use efficiency approach, driven by environmental conditions and species traits (Landsberg and Waring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1997</xref>). Carbohydrate allocation in trees is calculated annually based on allometric ratios and is sensitive to a tree&#x02019;s competitive status. Tree regeneration is modelled at an annual time step in 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> grid cells. Seed dispersal, climate-dependent establishment, and seedling and sapling growth are driven by species-specific traits. The mortality probability of a tree is influenced by its carbon balance, size, and age.</p><p id="Par15">Management is simulated using iLand&#x02019;s Agent-Based Management Engine (Rammer and Seidl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>), which employs so-called Stand Treatment Programs (STPs) to execute a series of silvicultural operations throughout the course of stand development. STPs include planting, thinning and harvesting of trees. The adaptive elements of STPs include modifying the timing of thinning based on the actual stand density, replanting disturbed sites depending on the state of natural regeneration, and resetting the sequence of operations if a stand experiences severe disturbance.</p><p id="Par16">Wind disturbances are simulated based on maximum wind speed, wind direction, and storm duration (Seidl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>). Impacts are simulated with a dose&#x02013;response model, accounting for the vertical wind profile and resulting turning moment (Gardiner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>), and for local sheltering by neighbouring trees as well as the size of upwind gaps. Wind disturbances are initiated in locations where vertical differences between the top heights of neighbouring grid cells exceed 10&#x000a0;m, i.e., at forest edges (Blennow and Salln&#x000e4;s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>). Critical wind speeds are calculated separately for stem breakage and uprooting based on Gardiner et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>). Wind impacts are simulated iteratively during an individual event, with forest structure being updated after each iteration. The model was tested, for example, in Sweden following the storm Gudrun (2005), displaying good correspondence of observed and predicted wind damage patterns (Seidl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">iLand includes an advanced submodule for simulating European spruce bark beetle (<italic>Ips typographus</italic> L.) dynamics. The module considers the phenology and development of beetles, their spatially explicit dispersal, host tree colonization and defence, and temperature-related overwintering success (Seidl and Rammer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>). Beetle development is simulated using a phenology-based process model (Baier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>), accounting for life-stage specific thermal requirements for beetle development and determining the number of generations and sister broods the insect can complete per year.&#x000a0;Host trees are Norway spruce trees with a diameter at breast height of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;cm. Concerning dispersal, the model tracks beetle cohorts defined as the minimum number of beetles needed to colonize a tree. Every brood tree disperses a number of beetle cohorts determined by the reproductive rate of the beetles, estimated to range between 4 and 24 (Wermelinger and Seifert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1999</xref>). Dispersal consists of two stages: a passive flight simulated with a symmetrical dispersal kernel and an active flight where beetles look for suitable host trees within a 30&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;m search window (Kautz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>). Host colonization success depends on the defense capacity of the host tree that is approximated by non-structural carbohydrate reserves (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). While bark beetle population size fluctuates depending on meteorological conditions, outbreaks are mainly triggered by windthrows, which provide a surplus of breeding material (Wermelinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2004</xref>). Removal of windfelled trees can thus exert a strong dampening effect on bark beetle outbreaks (Dobor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020a</xref>; Augustynczik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>). Model simulations were previously tested against independent data by Sommerfeld et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2021</xref>), who found good correspondence of simulated levels of infestation and spatial infestation patterns. The model code and executable as well as an extensive online documentation are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iland-model.org/">https://iland-model.org/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Implementation and testing of drought-initiated outbreaks</title><p id="Par18">In the absence of windthrow, bark beetle infestations are initiated in iLand based on a parameter determining the probability of a forest patch to be infested, represented as the annual outbreak probability per hectare. This initial probability (IP) is a user parameter with a default value of 0.000685, which has been estimated based on an empirically determined disturbance rotation period of 365&#x000a0;years and a mean disturbance size of 4&#x000a0;ha (Thom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2013</xref>; Thom and Seidl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>). The IP is modified by a climate-sensitive modifier that represents the deviation of summer precipitation in the actual year from the historical average conditions for which the IP has been specified (Seidl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016</xref>). While these fluctuations can mimic the variation in the size of endemic bark beetle populations (i.e., in a non-outbreak phase), they are unable to initiate large-scale outbreaks.</p><p id="Par19">We build on the existing iLand bark beetle module &#x02013; as described above &#x02013; for incorporating drought as an inciting factor of bark beetle outbreaks. Since research on drought-induced outbreaks of spruce bark beetle remains scarce (but see Hl&#x000e1;sny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>; K&#x000e4;rvemo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>; Washaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2024</xref>), we used a semi-empirical model formulation, combining fundamental ecological understanding with limited observational data (Jorgensen and Bendoricchio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>). Specifically, we introduced a mechanism for drought-initiated outbreaks using Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) as an indicator for drought, as VPD is a strong driver of tree mortality (Park Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>; Hartmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Moreover, VPD is readily available within iLand, as it affects stomatal conductance and primary production in the model (Rammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2024</xref>). We introduced a new function to the module, the <italic>OutbreakClimateMultiplier</italic> (OCM), which increases IP during heavy droughts. Specifically, the function transforms VPD into an OCM value, which is then used to scale IP multiplicatively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Eq.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>). Rather than using mean annual VPD, we used the biologically more relevant June-July mean VPD (<italic>VPDjj</italic>), roughly corresponding to the time of year when the second bark beetle generation emerges in Central Europe (Holu&#x00161;a et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>), i.e., during a period when increased climatic stress to trees can critically boost beetles` colonization success and population growth. As the interannual fluctuations in <italic>VPDjj</italic> led to unrealistic model behaviour and to consider the effect of multi-year droughts we applied a weighted <italic>VPDjj</italic>, using 70% from the current year and 30% from the previous year (VPDjj&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7*<italic>VPDjj</italic><sub>year i</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.3*<italic>VPDjj</italic><sub>year i-1</sub>).

Forests in the study landscape have been intensively managed for timber production, which resulted in a widespread occurrence of Norway spruce, mostly growing outside of its realized niche. Except for Norway spruce (57.7%), the current tree species composition mainly&#x000a0;consists of Scots pine (<italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.; 10.7%), European beech (<italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> L., 7.6%),&#x000a0;and oaks (<italic>Quercus spp.;</italic> 8.8%).

To evaluate the transient change in forest dynamics from 1961 to 2100, we used these forest conditions as a starting point for simulations.

The variation between climate models was substantial. The most extreme scenario, represented by the hot-dry HadGEM2_CCLM model under RCP8.5, led to a sharp reduction in spruce after two consecutive windthrows around 2050, i.e., already before the major windthrow in 2070 (Online appendix C). This reduction persisted until the end of the simulation period. In the less extreme climate scenarios the reduction in spruce was effectively offset by the ingrowth of other tree species, notably European beech and Scots pine, maintaining the overall growing stock at a stable level (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). This compensatory dynamic was pronounced under RCP8.5, supported by the stronger fertilization effect of elevated atmospheric CO&#x02082; concentrations.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;9</label><caption><p>Development of tree species composition simulated with different model versions under different climatic scenarios. &#x02018;Wind,&#x02019; considers only wind-initiated bark beetle outbreaks. &#x02018;Wind-Drought&#x02019; considers both wind and drought as outbreak triggers.

This can be attributed to the already severe disturbance conditions under RCP4.5, which led to rapid spruce depletion and thus negative feedbacks on disturbance activity.

The proposed approach can be used to explore, for example, the compounding effects of outbreaks initiated by wind and drought, an interaction expected to become increasingly frequent in the future. We demonstrated that the improved bark beetle module can reliably reproduce observed local outbreak dynamics and generate plausible outcomes in decadal-scale simulations. Given the projected increase in drought conditions under climate change, our approach represents an important contribution to more robust simulations of future disturbance dynamics. In the following, we discuss the limitations of&#x000a0;the proposed framework and the potential ecological implications of the presented simulation outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Simulation of bark beetle outbreaks</title><p id="Par44">Like several other ecosystem models simulating spruce bark beetle dynamics (Temperli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>; Maroschek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>), iLand includes windthrows as an inciting factor for outbreaks. Drought, on the other hand, has typically acted as amplifying factor for bark beetle infestations, modulating disturbance severity rather than triggering large-scale, self-sustaining outbreaks. However, the recent surge in drought-initiated bark beetle outbreaks across Europe underscored the emerging role of severe drought as a primary trigger. In response, we developed and tested a modelling approach capable of initiating outbreaks following such extreme drought events. We chose VPD as an outbreak trigger due to the growing evidence for its significant effects on tree physiology and mortality (Park Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>; Hartmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Additionally, VPD is employed in iLand to modulate stomatal conductance and primary production, which ultimately determine the availability of non-structural carbohydrate reserves and hence tree defence against bark beetles (Rammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2024</xref>). Although inciting factors, as defined by Manion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1981</xref>), operate on a short time scale, such as windthrows, we utilized a two-year weighted average of June-July VPD as outbreak trigger in the simulations. This allowed us to capture the effect of multi-year droughts, which can impair tree physiological processes, including production of secondary metabolites essential for tree defence (Gely et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Nonetheless, we note that the degree to which biotic mortality agents are linked to stress physiology is highly variable and insufficiently understood (Trugman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2021</xref>), limiting the implementation of these interactions in ecosystem models. For example, legacy effects of previous drought exposure, gradual depletion of non-structural carbohydrate reserves under multiyear droughts, and the relationships between primary and secondary metabolism and their responses to drought, remain insufficiently understood, yet they are essential for improving the modelling of tree&#x02013;bark beetle interactions (Netherer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). Advances in empirical understanding of these interactions are essential for replacing prevalent, simplified representations (such as the one presented here) with more sophisticated, process-based approaches (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). Unless such knowledge is available, the proposed approach, which substitutes complex process understanding with an empirical relationship between changing climate and outbreak risk, provides a practical means to simulate transient disturbance dynamics, with potential applicability beyond bark beetle outbreaks.</p><p id="Par45">We fitted parameter values of the function translating VPD to infestation probabilities, achieving a good match between observed and simulated outbreak dynamics. We note, however, that this parameterization mainly focused on high local accuracy, and that its ability to generalize should be tested in future works. The fact that the dynamics observed for our study landscape aligns well with developments observed across the Czech Republic (Washaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2024</xref>) and Central Europe (Senf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>) could be a first indication for broader applicability of the approach presented here. Future work should focus especially on refining the VPD outbreak threshold, identified as the most influential parameter in our sensitivity analysis (Online appendix E). To account for uncertainty in outbreak-triggering conditions due to factors such as variable forest age structure, spruce proportion and distribution, and site conditions, we represented each parameter using probability distributions. Due to limited empirical data, these distributions were defined arbitrarily in the current study. However, recent advancements in the use of remote sensing for research on biotic disturbances in forests (Senf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2017</xref>) could help identify drought-initiated bark beetle outbreaks across Europe and thus improve the generality of model parameterizations, including parameter uncertainty ranges.</p><p id="Par46">Uncertainty remains regarding the duration of drought-driven bark beetle outbreaks, which may differ from that of wind-driven outbreaks due to different resource distributions (K&#x000e4;rvemo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>). Moreover, our understanding of the underlying processes causing outbreaks to subside remains insufficient, even for wind-initiated outbreaks (Biedermann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>). While the outbreak observed in our study landscape peaked in a single year (2019), the simulated tree mortality level remained high until the end of the simulation in 2021. An improved process-based understanding of processes driving the collapse&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;bark beetle outbreaks could further improve the robustness of simulated trajectories of bark beetle disturbance. In this context, future research should specifically examine how drought- and wind-triggered outbreaks differ in terms of the mechanisms that dampen outbreak dynamics (Biedermann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>; Schroeder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2025</xref>).</p><p id="Par47">Despite the limitations of the proposed framework, our results demonstrate the applicability of iLand and the improved bark beetle module to simulate local developments with high accuracy, and make meaningful decadal-scale projections of landscape trajectories.

Considering wind- and drought-triggered outbreaks jointly resulted in a persistent reduction of growing stock already in the coming decades. This suggests that while growing stock was resilient to a wind-dominated disturbance regime, this resilience diminished under the compounded impact of wind- and drought-triggered disturbances, even under the moderate climate change represented by RCP4.5. This result aligns with previous studies which indicated low resilience of forest carbon and biomass to novel disturbance regimes under climate change (Turner and Seidl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2023</xref>), with potentially strong consequences for bioeconomy and climate change mitigation (Dye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2024</xref>; Hetem&#x000e4;ki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2024</xref>). The simulated magnitude of bark beetle impact also corresponds well to recent observations from Central Europe: For instance, spruce growing stock in the Czech Republic declined by approximately 20% from 2017 to 2022, with certain regions experiencing reductions of 40 to 60% (Washaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">Incorporating drought as a trigger for bark beetle outbreaks led to a notable decoupling of wind and bark beetle disturbances. Moreover, we observed an overall transition from wind- to drought-driven dynamics in the twenty-first century, with a notably smaller impact of the 2070 windthrow under the combined effect of wind and drought-initiated outbreaks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The underlying mechanisms were complex, involving an increasing frequency of critical VPD conditions while windthrow frequency remained stable (Seneviratne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>), and vegetation feedback characterized by an increase in species which are less wind-prone than spruce (Wallentin and Nilsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2014</xref>), and which are not suitable hosts for the European spruce bark beetle. These findings confirm the ability of our new module to simulate transient ecosystem dynamics and help understand changes in disturbance regimes in Europe caused by climate change.</p><p id="Par50">Regarding tree species composition, spruce remained dominant when solely considering wind-driven bark beetle outbreaks, except in the most severe scenarios of climate change (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The incorporation of drought-incited outbreaks significantly reduced spruce on the landscape, with the major drop occurring between 2030 and 2040, even under the moderate climate scenario represented by RCP4.5. Subsequently, species such as European beech and Scots pine gained dominance. The direction of this transformation aligns well with previous empirical and modelling studies, which indicated the increase in drought tolerant and warm-adapted tree species under climate change, such as European beech at the expense of Norway spruce (Hanewinkel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>; Kasper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the high pace of the transition identified here suggests that previous studies may have underestimated the impact of natural disturbances amplified by climate change and their catalyzing effect on forest transformation (Thom &#x00026; Seidl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">Finally, the two model variants (i.e., with and without considering drought-induced bark beetle outbreaks) resulted in distinctly different variability in simulation outcomes, driven primarily by differences among climatic scenarios. In the wind-only simulations, variability remained high because a substantial amount of mature spruce stands persisted throughout the simulation period, allowing for varied disturbance dynamics under different climatic conditions. Conversely, under the compounding impacts of wind- and drought-initiated outbreaks, spruce growing stock was rapidly depleted&#x02014;even under RCP4.5&#x02014;thereby narrowing the simulated range of variability. Hence, while simulations with outbreaks triggered by wind-only suggest that spruce could be maintained and related management objectives achieved under certain conditions, simulations considering both wind and drought as outbreak triggers invariably predict a critical decline of spruce. Since the compounding impacts of wind and drought-triggered outbreaks are likely to become the new normal in the future, these outcomes warrant critical consideration in management planning in spruce dominated forests of Central Europe.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">Modelling novel disturbance dynamics is among the key challenges for current ecosystem modelling, as it is essential for both projecting future ecosystem trajectories and for robustly informing ecosystem management and forestry policy-making.
