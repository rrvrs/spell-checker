Participants were divided into two groups: the intervention group (receiving the &#x0201c;Apollo&#x0201d; device) and the control group (receiving no intervention).</p></sec><sec id="sec4419"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scores, calculated as the difference between post-GAD-7 and pre-GAD-7 scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec4420"><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were recruited from two different cohorts, with the intervention group derived from the &#x0201c;Apollo&#x0201d; dataset and the control group derived from the &#x0201c;KaT Cohort 9&#x0201d; dataset. Matching was performed based on Age, Sex, and pre-GAD-7 scores to create comparable groups.</p><p>For those with full datasets, a total of 4 (out of 5) participants from the &#x0201c;Apollo&#x0201d; group were matched with 15 (out of 45) participants from the &#x0201c;Control&#x0201d; group, based on the selected criteria. Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values and non-numeric entries. Propensity score matching was used to match participants from the &#x0201c;Apollo&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Control&#x0201d; groups based on Age, Sex, and pre-GAD-7 scores. An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean change in GAD-7 scores between the two groups. Since propensity score matching requires complete data on matching factors (age, sex, pre-GAD-7), those without full datasets were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec4421"><title>Results</title><p>The median change in GAD-7 scores in the &#x0201c;Apollo&#x0201d; group was &#x02212;8.5, indicating a median reduction in anxiety symptoms.The independent samples t-test revealed no statistically significant difference in the change in GAD-7 scores between the &#x0201c;Apollo&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Control&#x0201d; groups (t = -0.889, p = 0.387). Therefore, the study so far did cannot conclude a significant difference.</p></sec><sec id="sec4422"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ketamine assisted therapy remains a promising way to decrease anxiety among patients with generalized anxiety disorder and elevated GAD-7 scores. Ways to potentially improve these results are increasing the number of Apollo patients and having more balanced numbers between groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec4423"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
