ACSL1 is required for &#x003b2;-oxidation in tissues that rely on fatty acids as fuel, but no consensus exists on why ACSL1 is induced by inflammatory mediators in immune cells. We used a comprehensive and unbiased approach to investigate the role of ACSL1 induction by interferon type I (IFN-I) in myeloid cells in&#x000a0;vitro and in a mouse model of IFN-I overproduction. Our results show that IFN-I induces ACSL1 in macrophages via its interferon-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor, and consequently that expression of ACSL1 is increased in myeloid cells from individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune condition characterized by increased IFN production. Taking advantage of a myeloid cell-targeted ACSL1-deficient mouse model and a series of lipidomics, proteomics, metabolomics and functional analyses, we show that IFN-I leverages induction of ACSL1 to increase accumulation of fully saturated phosphatidic acid species in macrophages. Conversely, ACSL1 induction is not needed for IFN-I&#x02019;s ability to induce the prototypical IFN-stimulated protein signature or to suppress proliferation or macrophage metabolism. Loss of ACSL1 in IFN-I stimulated myeloid cells enhances apoptosis and secondary necrosis in&#x000a0;vitro, especially in the presence of increased saturated fatty acid load, and in a mouse model of atherosclerosis associated with IFN overproduction, resulting in larger lesion necrotic cores. We propose that ACSL1 induction is a mechanism used by IFN-I to increase phosphatidic acid saturation while protecting the cells from saturated fatty acid-induced cell death.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Supplementary key words</title><kwd>Bis[monoacylglycerol]phosphates</kwd><kwd>enzymology/Enzyme mechanisms</kwd><kwd>glycerophospholipids</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>lipotoxicity</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>phospholipids/phosphatidic acid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="kwrd0050">ACSL1</term><def><p>long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0060">BMDM</term><def><p>bone marrow-derived macrophage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0070">BMP</term><def><p>bis[monoacylglycerol]phosphates</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0080">ECAR</term><def><p>extracellular acidification rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0090">ESI</term><def><p>electro-spray ionization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0100">IFN-I</term><def><p>interferon type I</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0110">OCR</term><def><p>oxygen consumption rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0120">PA</term><def><p>phosphatidic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0130">PBMC</term><def><p>peripheral blood mononuclear cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0140">SLE</term><def><p>systemic lupus erythematosus</p></def></def-item></def-list></front><body><p id="p0010">Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) convert long-chain fatty acids to their fatty acyl-CoA derivatives (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), channeling fatty acids into various pathways, including glycerophospholipid and triglyceride synthesis and &#x003b2;-oxidation.

However, in macrophages, ACSL1 is induced by a number of inflammatory stimuli, including toll-like receptor ligands, interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN&#x003b3;), type 1 interferons (IFN-I), and TNF&#x003b1; (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

Macrophage peptide digests (equivalent to 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of protein) were desalted on a C-18 trap column (0.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;40&#x000a0;mm) at a flow rate of 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min for 7&#x000a0;min.

Both the trap and analytical columns were packed in house with Magic C-18 reverse-phase resin (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m; 100&#x000a0;&#x000c5;; Michrom Bioresources). The columns were kept at room temperature, and the peptides were separated using a multistep gradient as follows: 1&#x02013;7% solvent B for 1&#x000a0;min; 7&#x02013;25% solvent B for 105&#x000a0;min; 25&#x02013;35% solvent B for 30&#x000a0;min; and 35&#x02013;80% solvent B for 10&#x000a0;min. The column was subsequently washed for 5&#x000a0;min in 80% solvent B, 80&#x02013;1% solvent B in 1&#x000a0;min, and then re-equilibrated in 1% solvent B for 19&#x000a0;min (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile).</p><p id="p0065">The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode and the peptide digests were analyzed in the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, with 2,100&#x000a0;V of spray voltage and 300&#x000b0;C of ion transfer tube temperature for ionization. The acquisition method combined MS1 scans with DDA MS2 scans. For the MS1 scan, a scan range of m/z 350&#x02013;1,800, an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000 (at m/z 200), a target automatic gain control (AGC) value of 400,000, and a maximum injection time of 50&#x000a0;ms were used. For the DDA MS2 scans, precursor ions with charge state of 2&#x02013;5 were isolated using a 1.6&#x000a0;m/z window and an automatic scan range (starting from m/z 110), an Orbitrap resolution of 30,000 (at m/z 200), a target AGC value of 50,000, and a maximum injection time of 50&#x000a0;ms. Fragmentation was performed using higher energy collisional dissociation fragmentation with 30% collision energy with a stepped collision energy of 1.5%. Dynamic exclusion was set to detect a precursor ion once and the exclusion duration was set as 30&#x000a0;s. This approach facilitated extensive data-dependent MS/MS sampling and the generation of an adequate number of peptide-counts to reproducibly reflect relative peptide or protein abundance in macrophages.</p><p id="p0070">MS/MS spectra were searched against the UniProtKB mouse database (20,190,114) using the Comet search engine (v2021.02.0) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) with fixed Cys alkylation and variable Met oxidation modifications.

Acyl-carnitine species were quantified using an UPLC-MS/MS system composed of a Shimadzu Nexera X2 UPLC system connected to an AB Sciex 5500 QTrap MS equipped with an ESI source. The Shimadzu UPLC system was composed of a binary LC-30AD pump, DGU-20A 5R degasser, SIL-30AC autosampler set at 10&#x000b0;C (injection volume of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) and CTO-20AC temperature-controlled column compartment set at&#x000a0;&#x02212;40&#x000b0;C. The data were acquired using AB Sciex Analyst 1.6.3 software. All the molecules were ionized in positive ESI mode, and the mass analyzer was running in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Analytes were separated using reverse-phase (RP) chromatography on a Waters XSelect HSS T3 2.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 150&#x000a0;mm, 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m analytical column (Waters Part # 186006739).

The assay targeted 67 MRMs, of which 54 were acyl-carnitines species and 13 were SILISs used to determine absolute concentrations of the measured analytes. Optimized MRM conditions for each acyl-carnitine species and spiked SILISs are listed in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Metabolomics Data Supplement</xref>. For the species that had corresponding SILISs, the absolute concentration was determined directly by comparing MRM peak area of analyte to MRM peak area of corresponding SILIS of known concentration. For those acyl-carnitines without corresponding SILISs, their concentrations were determined indirectly by comparing peak areas of the analyte to that of the SILIS with the closest retention time to the analyte. MRM peak areas were measured using AB Sciex MultiQuant 3.03 software. From the cell samples, 22 acyl-carnitine species were measured. In order to monitor the system performance, an in-house QC sample (pooled human serum) was injected every 8 samples and used to monitor data reproducibility. In addition, a QC sample made from pooled study set was analyzed every 8 samples to determine the reproducibility of the run. For this study set of 24&#x000a0;cell extract samples, 4 QC runs were performed and the medium CV was 3.9%. From the 35 measured MRMs (22 analytes plus 13 SILISs) 23 had CV under 5%, 7 had CV 5&#x02013;10% and 4 had CV 10&#x02013;22%. The CVs were determined by measuring peak areas without any signal normalization. All the samples were acquired in one batch over a 20&#x000a0;h period.

IFN-I had marked effects on the global glycerophospholipidome both in WT and ACSL1-deficient BMDMs (see the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Phospholipidomics Data Supplement</xref>). The most marked difference between IFN-I stimulation in the two groups of BMDMs was observed in phosphatidic acid (PA) species. IFN-I induced a significant increase in PA species containing fully saturated acyl-chains (14:0, 16:0 and 18:0) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A). IFN-I failed to induce a significant increase in saturated PA species in ACSL1-deficient BMDMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B), suggesting that induction of ACSL1 by IFN-I serves to increase saturated PA species in macrophages. Once formed, PA can be converted to diacylglycerol (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) through the action of PA phosphatases (lipins) (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Since IFN-I caused an increase in saturated PA species, we reasoned that in addition to inducing ACSL1, lipins might be inhibited by IFN-I, thus further enhancing saturated PA accumulation. Indeed, <italic>Lipn1</italic> mRNA levels were markedly suppressed by IFN-I in a dose-dependent manner at 4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h after IFN-I stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C), while <italic>Lipn2</italic> mRNA levels were not suppressed and even increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D).

Thus, IFN-I relies on two strategies to increase saturated PA species&#x02014;induction of ACSL1 and suppression of lipin 1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>F). The increased levels of fully saturated PA species is unlikely to be due to increased de novo fatty acid synthesis because fatty acid synthase (<italic>Fasn</italic>) gene expression was markedly suppressed by IFN-I in macrophages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>G), consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>IFN-I increases saturated phosphatidic acid species via ACSL1 in macrophages.

These experiments revealed that ACSL1-deficient macrophages exposed to fatty acids exhibited a higher level of apoptosis than WT macrophages after 3&#x000a0;h of exposure, an effect exacerbated in the presence of IFN-I (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>H). Moreover, fatty acid exposure markedly increased secondary necrosis measured in real-time beyond 24&#x000a0;h, and ACSL1-deficient macrophages underwent secondary necrosis earlier than WT macrophages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>I). Induction of ACSL1 by IFN-I in WT cells protected from fatty acid-mediated secondary necrosis, while this effect was lost in ACSL1-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>I).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0220">Our study is consistent with the proposal that ACSL1 induction is a mechanism leveraged by IFN-I to increase PA saturation while protecting the cells from saturated fatty acid-induced cell death. However, the increased PA saturation is unlikely to affect IFN-I-induced signaling or induction of the prototypical interferon signature response, because no obvious impairment of IFN-I&#x02019;s effects on interferon-induced pathways were observed in ACSL1-deficient myeloid cells. Likewise, the effects of IFN-I on cell metabolism (oxygen consumption and glycolysis), proliferation, and efferocytosis were unaffected by the loss of ACSL1. Moreover, no impairment in the effects of pristane, a hydrocarbon oil that causes overproduction of type 1 IFN &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), on induction of IFN-induced genes, myelopoiesis, plasma S100A8/A9 and IL-18 levels, or ssDNA antibody production were observed in mice lacking ACSL1 in myeloid cells.</p><p id="p0225">PA, an anionic lipid, is mostly present on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and on the ER membrane. Cholesterol strongly prefers to associate in membranes with anionic lipids over neutral lipids and saturated acyl chains over unsaturated (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). It is therefore possible that the increase in fully saturated PA species by IFN-I serves to localize free cholesterol to particular membrane domains. In this context, it is interesting that IFN-I protects macrophages from the pore forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins secreted by bacteria by reducing a small &#x0201c;accessible&#x0201d; membrane cholesterol pool (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Restricting cholesterol accessibility by increasing its binding to saturated PA could serve as a strategy to protect the cell from succumbing to such toxins. Because the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is believed to be less saturated than the outer leaflet (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), increased levels of saturated PA could potentially have large effects. In addition to modulating membrane cholesterol pools, PA may alter intracellular signaling (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), facilitate membrane rearrangements (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), and increase the chaperone activity of heat shock proteins (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). However, these functions have mostly been ascribed to unsaturated PA species, making them less likely as downstream effects of IFN-I.</p><p id="p0230">We show that in addition to inducing increased expression of ACSL1, IFN-I markedly suppresses expression of lipin 1. One of the biological functions of lipin 1 is to catalyze the conversion of PA to DAG (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The finding that dipalmitoylglycerol (DG 16:0_16:0) was the most abundant DAG species that showed reduced levels in muscle of lipin 1-deficient mice (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) further supports the conclusion that IFN-I uses two complementary strategies to achieve maximal accumulation of fully saturated PA species&#x02014;induction of ACSL1 and suppression of lipin 1. Together, these results strongly suggest that accumulation of saturated PA is biologically important. Whether IFN-I relies on ACSL1 to generate a PA reservoir for saturated fatty acids and whether this pool has a hitherto unknown function require further studies.</p><p id="p0235">We further provide human relevance by demonstrating that <italic>ACSL1</italic> is induced in PMBCs from individuals with SLE, using a discovery cohort and confirming the results in a replication cohort. Myeloid cells were responsible for the ACSL1 induction in these PBMC preparations. How might the IFN-I-induced changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism be relevant to the pathogenesis of SLE? One possibility is that the changes we describe could lead to impaired lysosomal maturation, which has been proposed to contribute to accumulation of nuclear self-antigens in SLE (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), because downregulation of lipin-1 leads to impaired maturation of autolysosomes (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Further studies are needed to address this possibility.</p><p id="p0240">Our data demonstrating that loss of ACSL1 causes an increased susceptibility to apoptosis and secondary necrosis, especially under conditions of increased fatty acid load, are consistent with those of Saraswathi and Hasty (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) who showed that the ACSL inhibitor triacsin C results in apoptosis in macrophages exposed to saturated fatty acids. However, others have found reduced cell death in ACSL1-deficient cells stimulated with palmitate and lipopolysaccharide (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) or no differences in cell death in ACSL1-deficient cells (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The reason for the discrepancies might be due to differences in cell types&#x02019; sensitivity to cell death, experimental design, which can markedly impact cell death experiments (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), or to differences in the rates of cell death versus efferocytosis. Strength of our studies include two complementary methods to assess cell death in&#x000a0;vitro as well as an in&#x000a0;vivo approach (necrosis in lesions of atherosclerosis).</p><p id="p0245">Interestingly, IFN-I-stimulated macrophages rely on fatty acid uptake rather than fatty acid synthesis to meet their fatty acid needs. Thus, de novo 16:0 (palmitate) synthesis is markedly suppressed while total levels of 16:0 are increased in IFN-I-stimulated macrophages (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Consistently, fatty acid synthase gene expression was suppressed by IFN-I in our study. Therefore, we propose that IFN-I induces ACSL1 to allow channeling of imported saturated fatty acids to a PA reservoir. Without ACSL1 induction, the uptake of saturated fatty acids results in an increased susceptibility to apoptosis and secondary necrosis. Elegant studies have demonstrated that palmitate-induced lipotoxicity associate with accumulation of bi-saturated glycerophospholipid species, rather than of sphingosides or ceramides (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Interestingly, several of the proteins significantly upregulated by IFN-I only in the ACSL1<sup>M&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (e.g., CD69 and FN1) were upregulated at the mRNA level by palmitate in that study, consistent with the idea that loss of ACSL1 results in intracellular mislocalization of palmitate and other saturated fatty acids in IFN-I stimulated cells, exacerbating lipotoxicity. Accordingly, the increased cell death in ACSL1-deficient macrophages is most obvious in the presence of increased fatty acid and IFN-I load.</p><p id="p0250">In light of the present findings, increased macrophage death could have contributed to our previous findings of smaller early lesions of atherosclerosis in diabetic mice with myeloid cell ACSL1-deficiency (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), a condition associated with increased IFN stimulation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Increased apoptosis might also explain previous findings of suppressed inflammation in the setting of ACSL1-deficiency (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) because rapid efferocytosis of apoptotic cells quells inflammation (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>).</p><p id="p0255">In summary, our extensive unbiased characterization of the effects of ACSL1 in myeloid cells shows that IFN-I, and likely other inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), use induction of ACSL1 as a strategy to modulate membrane phospholipid composition, rather than to alter macrophage metabolism or inflammatory capacity. In the case of IFN-I, induction of ACSL1 allows an increase in saturated PA species without the risk of apoptosis and secondary necrosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec4"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0260">If all data are contained within the manuscript and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental data</xref>; <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Major Resources Supplement</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Phospholipidomics Data Supplement</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Proteomics Data Supplement</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Metabolomics Data Supplement</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Original Data Supplement</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec5"><title>Supplemental data</title><p id="p0265">This article contains <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental data</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="p0275">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: KEB serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of Esperion Therapeutics.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grevengoed</surname><given-names>T.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Klett</surname><given-names>E.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Coleman</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acyl-CoA metabolism and partitioning</article-title><source>Annu.
