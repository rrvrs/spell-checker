Overcrowding and climate change facilitated this vector-borne disease. Hence, we carried out this study to evaluate the incidence and outcome of dengue fever in monsoon, post-monsoon, and pre-monsoon periods. Additionally, we correlated the age, platelet count, and duration of hospitalization of the participants.</p><p>Methods: We conducted this cross-sectional study from June 2019 to September 2021 at Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneswar, India.&#x000a0;We obtained data (age, gender, organs affected, platelet count, requirement of ICU, platelet transfusion, duration of hospitalization, and outcome) from their case records. R software version 4.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for data analysis.</p><p>Results: Seven hundred eighteen dengue patients were recruited for this study. Their mean age was 43.2 &#x000b1; 11.8 years. There were 347 (48.3%) female participants. The mean platelet count of the study population was 132.1 &#x000b1; 64.7 &#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L. The dengue cases were the highest (561, 78.1%) during the monsoon period. Most participants had their kidneys (185, 25.8%) affected due to dengue fever. A total of 224 (31.2%) patients had bleeding manifestations, and 371 (51.7%) patients required ICU admission. The average duration of hospital stay was 11.0 &#x000b1; 3.9 days. Of 718 patients, 693 (96.5%) were discharged and 25 (3.5%) died. The platelet count and duration of hospital stay were negatively correlated (r = -0.390, p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusion:&#x000a0;Dengue cases were maximum during the monsoon period. Younger individuals and men were more affected. Kidney involvement was the maximum, followed by lungs, liver, and heart. The duration of hospitalization and platelet count were inversely related.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>capillary leakage</kwd><kwd>correlation</kwd><kwd>dengue</kwd><kwd>monsoon</kwd><kwd>ns1 antigen</kwd><kwd>platelet</kwd><kwd>transfusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In India, dengue has become one of the most common vector-borne infectious diseases [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It might be associated with seasonal variation and overcrowding in India [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After the 1990s, malaria incidence in India was gradually reduced [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, dengue cases increased in number. For the last three decades, dengue has posed a significant public health concern in India [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Dengue is transmitted to human beings through <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>&#x000a0;and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although the virus and its vector are active throughout the year in India, dengue fever has the highest occurrence during monsoon periods [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Rainy or post-rainy seasons allow water accumulation in coconut shells, coolers, old tires, and ancient earthenware pots. These items serve as a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As a result, the vector grows, and dengue incidence rises [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are more mosquitoes (3-4 females per house) during the rainy season than there are during the dry season (1-2 females per house) [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dengue fever exhibits cyclical and seasonal patterns in India, with significant outbreaks every 2-3 years [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is considered one of the most serious complications of dengue [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A sharp reduction in the glomerular filtration rate characterizes it. In the last three decades, the frequency of kidney damage has dramatically increased in patients with dengue fever [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hypotension, direct damage due to the virus, immune system-mediated indirect mechanisms, and rhabdomyolysis could lead to AKI [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Patients with dengue frequently have liver damage. Liver enzymes are temporarily mildly elevated in most dengue patients [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A condition known as dengue-induced severe hepatitis (DISH) occurs in 4%-15% of dengue patients [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Transaminase levels are increased around 10 times in patients with DISH [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, and increased capillary permeability may lead to respiratory problems such as pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Oxidative stress and increased viral load may trigger myocarditis and heart failure [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thrombocytopenia in dengue fever leads to bleeding manifestations. Patients with platelet values below 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;with bleeding symptoms are managed with random donor platelet (RDP) transfusion [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, RDP transfusion becomes mandatory for those with critically low levels of platelets (&#x0003c;10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) even without bleeding symptoms [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In India, the monsoon period spans from June to September. The next four months, i.e., October to January, are considered post-monsoon. The remaining four months, i.e., February to May, are pre-monsoon periods [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The incidence of dengue fever, duration of hospitalization, and outcome of patients are affected by numerous factors such as socioeconomic status, accessibility to healthcare, and comorbidities. We carried out this investigation to determine the incidence of dengue fever in India during the monsoon, post-monsoon, and pre-monsoon seasons. Additionally, we assessed the patients' seropositivity, gender-specific parameter variations, and correlations between age, platelet count, and duration of hospitalization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted from June 18, 2019, to September 30, 2021. Our study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) (approval number: KIIT/KIMS/IEC/18/2019). We followed the Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Study criteria</p><p>In this study, we recruited adult patients admitted to our hospital with dengue fever within the specified time frame. We excluded patients below 18 years of age, patients with bleeding disorders, and pregnant women.</p><p>Study procedure</p><p>We obtained the data of eligible participants from their case records. We noted their age, gender, platelet counts, and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. We also recorded the organs affected at admission or during their hospital stays. We mentioned the month, season, and year of the hospital admission. We denoted the following months as per the monsoon phase in India: June to September (monsoon period), October to January (post-monsoon period), and February to May (pre-monsoon period). The positivity status of serum NS1 Ag, IgM Ab, and IgG Ab of all participants was noted. We recorded the requirement for RDP transfusion, ICU admission, and duration of hospitalization.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Eligible participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Continuous variables were shown as mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables were shown as numbers and percentages.&#x000a0;We analyzed the participants' age distribution and platelet counts with jitter plots. Organ involvement and other parameters (e.g., ICU entry and RDP transfusion) during various seasons were assessed with pie diagrams. We evaluated the associations among age, platelet count, and duration of hospitalization&#x000a0;with correlation plots. R software version 4.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A p-value of 0.05 or less demonstrates statistical significance. We assessed categorical variables with the Chi-square test. Continuous variables were assessed through the unpaired t-test or ANOVA. Associations were analyzed using Pearson's correlation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recruited 718 patients with dengue fever from June 18, 2019, to September 30, 2021. We divided the calendar year into the following three seasons as per the monsoon period in Eastern India: monsoon (June to September), post-monsoon (October to January), and pre-monsoon (February to May). The incidence of dengue fever in our hospital during the study period is shown in Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The highest number of dengue cases was seen during the monsoon period (total: 561 cases, 201 in 2019, 165 in 2020, and 195 in 2021). The number of female patients was higher in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, there were increased incidences of dengue fever in male patients compared to female patients.

We also assessed the correlation among age, platelet count, and duration of hospitalization. Our study had a few limitations. The hospital admissions during the study period were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the discharge rates were also affected by the same. This had caused prolonged hospitalization for some patients. We did not evaluate the medications&#x000a0;of the patients and laboratory parameters for the seasonal variations, as well as the quality of life of the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dengue cases were maximum during the monsoon period.
