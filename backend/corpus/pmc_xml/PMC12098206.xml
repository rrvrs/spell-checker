Although passive recolonization is occasionally sufficient, often, active revegetation through seeding is required. However, the outcomes of seeding likely differ by site (due to varying environmental conditions) and the composition of the seed mix. We evaluated the effects of both passive recolonization and seeding treatments (varying density and diversity of natives) on wetland plant community cover and composition at two sites in the Great Salt Lake Watershed, USA, over two years. We found that passive recolonization was insufficient to increase native plant cover at one location and limit invasive species' cover at either location. Furthermore, different emergent wetland restoration sites, despite geographic proximity, had different plant community outcomes, likely due to distinct site environmental conditions. We also found that the effects of the seeding treatments appeared to be overwhelmed by water depth due to two extreme weather events (severe drought in year 1 and prolonged flooding in year 2). However, these events provided an opportunity to observe the recovery potential of the different functional groups and identify three species of restoration interest (<italic>Bolboschoenus maritimus, Schoenoplectus acutus,</italic> and <italic>Distichlis spicata</italic>) that were able to survive the extreme conditions during both growing seasons at one site. These findings underscore the importance of not relying on passive recolonization and instead using bet-hedging strategies (e.g., seeding diverse mixes with species with a range of hydrologic tolerances) to overcome hydrologic extremes, conditions likely to become more common with climate change and ever-increasing upstream water diversions.

Occasionally, in wetland restoration, the seed bank of the restoration site is sufficient to support native recovery. However, in sites with a long history of plant invasions where seed banks are depauperate, revegetation is an essential step to both increase native plant cover and minimize reinvasion and secondary invasions following invasive species management (Adams and Galatowitsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; Kettenring and Adams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>). Nonetheless, active revegetation (seeding; planting) is not always pursued. Wetland revegetation can be expensive and logistically complicated (Kettenring and Tarsa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>), diverse seed supplies may be unavailable (Henry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2024a</xref>), and restoration practitioners may lack the expertise to successfully seed and plant (Henry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2024b</xref>). Furthermore, the high mortality of seeds and seedlings in restorations (Bohnen and Galatowitsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>; Larson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>) raises questions about the value of seeding, especially as restoration conditions become more extreme with climate change. There are uncertainties about when seeding is necessary in wetlands, whether it improves restoration outcomes, and how best to design seed mixes to achieve goals.
</p><p id="Par6">When seeding is implemented, two factors that can be altered by restoration practitioners to influence plant community cover and composition (the number and identity of species that are present) are density and functional diversity (Maron and Marler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2007</xref>; Kettenring and Tarsa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2024a</xref>). High native seeding densities can increase both the cover of sown species and the chance that less competitive species will emerge even in the face of high seed and seedling mortality (Wilkerson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2014</xref>; Grman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>; Tarsa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022a</xref>) while simultaneously suppressing unwanted species (i.e., biotic resistance to invasive species; Byun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2023</xref>). Functional diversity, based on the diversity of traits within a community (Funk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>), can also drive plant community composition through resource competition and niche partitioning (Maron and Marler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2007</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2024a</xref>). For example, species that are part of the forb functional group can grow quickly and preempt resources from an invasive grass, maintaining native plant communities by reducing invader growth (Byun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2024a</xref>). Altering these two factors can increase the success of a restoration project by enhancing native plant communities and their resistance to invasives, although it is unclear how these factors will respond under different conditions, especially as conditions become more extreme with climate change.</p><p id="Par7">To develop generalizable results from restoration experiments, treatments should be tested at multiple sites with potentially different environmental conditions. Both establishment and biotic resistance of native plants can be altered in geographically proximate sites due to abiotic conditions (such as salinity and hydrology) and biotic conditions (e.g., differing levels of competition from invasives; Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2015</xref>; Fried et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>). For example, even for species adapted to local site conditions, germination from the seed bank can be inhibited by factors such as flooding (Fraser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>) and long-term water-level fluctuations (Wilcox and Nichols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2008</xref>). Understanding how the effects of seeding treatments differ between sites, and therefore which ones are generalizable across locations, is critical for restoration practitioners designing plans for revegetation.</p><p id="Par8">We were interested in determining the effect of passive recolonization and seeding on wetland community cover and composition at two locations in the Great Salt Lake Watershed, USA, over two growing seasons. We asked four questions: (1) What species recolonize passively from the seed bank following invasive species management? We predicted that passively emerging species cover would be low for native species due to a depleted seed bank from years of invasive species presence and low for invasive species following intensive removal of the invasive species by land managers (Rohal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>). (2) Does seeding alter wetland plant community cover and composition? We predicted that seeded plots would have different species and a higher native cover than unseeded plots as well as lower invasive species cover due to the invasion resistance of the seeded native community (Adams and Galatowitsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; Tarsa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022a</xref>) (3) When seeding, how does altering seed mix functional group identity and density affect plant community cover and composition? We predicted that a greater seed mix density would result in a greater number of species and a higher native plant cover (Tarsa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022a</xref>) and that a higher native seeding density and an increased proportion of native forbs would reduce invasive species cover (Byun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2024a</xref>). (4) Does passive recolonization and the effects of seeding differ between two restoration sites within the same watershed? We predicted that despite the geographic proximity of the two sites, the passively and actively restored plant communities would differ due to divergent site environmental conditions and hydrologic management capabilities (Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2015</xref>; Fried et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experiment Overview</title><p id="Par9">We explored the effects of native seeding density and functional group identity on seeded, unseeded native, and unseeded invasive plant cover at two locations over two years (2022 and 2023). At each site, we implemented a full factorial experiment examining two levels of density and five levels of functional group identity. Species were planted in mixes of three species with all three species representing the same functional group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Functional groups were based on family, longevity (perennial or annual), and growth form (forb or graminoid). Native seeding densities were 1x =&#x02009;1938 pure live seed (PLS) m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> or 5x =&#x02009;9688 PLS m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, which were selected based on recommended seeding densities for the region (Tarsa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2022b</xref>). We also included an unseeded control to characterize the community that emerged from the seed bank (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Great Salt Lake wetlands, where Farmington Bay is located, is one of the largest wetlands in the western United States and provides critical habitat for migratory birds (Intermountain West Joint Venture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). Water levels in many Great Salt Lake wetlands are controlled by managers through a series of dikes and head gates in wetland impoundments, infrastructure that allows managers to restrict or provide water to wetlands based on management objectives and water availability (Downard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>) and also buffers the wetlands to some extent from the decreasing lake levels that made international news in recent years (e.g., Flavelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2023</xref>; Great Salt Lake Collaborative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">n.d.</xref>). However, inter- and intra-annual fluctuations remain the norm despite this infrastructure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b).

As opposed to Farmington Bay, Utah Lake wetlands are largely continuous with the lake itself but at the mercy of lake levels that fluctuate greatly across years due to site evaporation from the shallow lake (maximum depth ~&#x02009;3 m) and upstream diversions from the inflowing rivers (Richards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>; Zanazzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2020</xref>; Utah Lake Authority <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2024b</xref>). The Utah Lake shoreline (and thus water available for wetlands) can shift long distances (potentially 50&#x02013;100 s of meters) each year.

Final cover estimates were converted to continuous proportions using the midpoint of the cover class. Final cover was analyzed using the beta distribution or the log-normal distribution, depending on model fit, as described below. For analyses using the beta distribution, all 0 values were converted to one half the smallest recorded value and all 1 values were converted to 0.995 to fit within the [0,1] bounded distribution. All treatments with values above 100% cover were analyzed using the log-normal distribution. For each site, multiple mixed effects models were used to determine the effects of treatments. Response of total native, invasive, and seeded plant cover for each functional group was tested using native functional group identity (five levels) and native density (two levels) as fixed effects, as well as block (six levels) as a random effect. We also conducted a Dunnett&#x02019;s test in association with each model to determine whether final cover differed between any of the treatments and the control. Seeded plant cover was analyzed by adding together the seeded species for each functional group. We were unable to fit models to the data for the annual forb, rush, or perennial forb functional groups at the Farmington Bay site for 2022, the grass or rush functional groups at the Utah Lake site for 2022, or any seeded species for the Farmington Bay site for 2023.

Interestingly, almost all species that germinated at Farmington Bay during 2022 were also present at Utah Lake; however, they differed by relative abundance of cover and the plots in which they grew (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a,c; 6a,c).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Plots were Dry During the 2022 Growing Season but Flooded During the 2023 Growing Season (Question 4)</title><p id="Par24">At Farmington Bay, groundwater fell deep below the soil surface (18&#x02013;76 cm below) for the majority of 2022 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Water briefly reached the soil surface in early August after managers released water from the neighboring impoundment to provide water to the experiment; however, the effects of releasing this water did not persist. In 2023, all blocks had standing water (8&#x02013;25 cm above) for the majority of the growing season, only falling below the soil surface in mid-September (4&#x02013;13 cm below; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Sites could not be accessed before the first sampling date in mid-July due to deep flooding that made the site inaccessible.

In this experiment, we examined the effects of passive recolonization and seeding on wetland community cover and composition at two locations within the same watershed over two growing seasons. We identified four key findings from this research. First, passive recolonization alone was insufficient to increase native plant cover and reduce the number of invasive species. The two sites differed greatly in their passive recolonization, but neither site achieved restoration goals related to increasing natives and reducing invasives. Second, we found indications that the effects of passive recolonization and seeding on cover and composition of the seeded, unseeded native, and invasive communities varied by site despite geographic proximity. Although in the same watershed, the two field sites differed in final cover and overall plant composition. We hypothesize that these site-specific differences are related to differences in salinity and hydrology at the two locations. Third, surprisingly and unfortunately, it seems that extremes in water depth during the two study years (drought in 2022 and flooding in 2023) overwhelmed the seeding treatments to drive plant community composition. Yet, these hydrologic extremes, which are becoming increasingly common due to climate change and human water withdrawals (Wurtsbaugh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>; IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2023</xref>), provided an opportunity to evaluate the recovery potential of the various functional groups. In turn, we identified a subset of species that are of interest to managers (<italic>B. maritimus</italic> and <italic>S. acutus</italic> from the bulrush functional group and <italic>D. spicata</italic> from the grass functional group) that were able to survive the extreme weather conditions of both growing seasons at Farmington Bay. These findings underscore the importance of not relying on passive recovery but instead seeding diverse seed mixes as a bet-hedging strategy. As unpredictable extreme weather events and hydrologic fluctuations become more common in wetlands, there will be a greater need for bet-hedging strategies to promote native growth regardless of the abiotic conditions that arise.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Passive Recolonization was Insufficient to Achieve Restoration Goals Following Invasive Species Management</title><p id="Par26">Although passive recolonization following invasive plant management may sometimes achieve wetland restoration goals, revegetation is often a necessary step to increase native plant cover and decrease the chance of invasive species reinvasion (Adams and Galatowitsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; Kettenring and Adams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>; Tarsa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022a</xref>). Although the two sites in the present study differed greatly in passive recolonization, neither of the two locations resulted in both high native species cover and low invasive species cover, typical restoration goals following invasive species management. At Farmington Bay, overall native plant cover remained low across both growing seasons, likely explained by the fact that seed bank emergence can be very low following multi-year invasive plant management (Rohal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>). Large stands of invasive species such as <italic>P. australis</italic>, which have been treated at Farmington Bay for over a decade, block the dispersal of seeds of nearby native plant communities, which can have long-lasting effects on the seed bank (Elsey-Quirk and Leck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021</xref>). Furthermore, these large stands can leave behind litter (which was anecdotally noted by study authors at the site), which can also block seeds from having sufficient contact with the soil (Cranney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>). Restoration efforts in locations with such histories will likely require additional modification during restoration, such as seeding and litter removal (Rohal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>; Tarsa et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2022b</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">Farmington Bay also exhibited potential to return to an invasive dominated state, likely due to the extreme weather that affected conditions at the site. Invasive species are successful in part because they can survive broader and more extreme conditions than native species (Zedler and Kercher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2004</xref>; Hovick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2023</xref>), making it important to identify native species traits that contribute to tolerance or resilience to a range of conditions in wetlands (Moor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>). In fact, during the second growing season, the research plots at Farmington Bay were dominated by invasive species, suggesting that these species could better survive the extreme hydrologic conditions, while many of the native species could&#x000a0;not. This was true even though all species that emerged at Farmington Bay during the second growing season (seeded, unseeded native, and invasive) were all flood tolerant species, as shown by their wetland indicator status of facultative, facultative wetland, and obligate. This finding is consistent with those of Byun et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>), who, in a study of species and functional diversity effects on biotic resistance in a freshwater wetland, found that <italic>P. australis</italic> had increased invasion success in wetlands following flooding.</p><p id="Par28">Utah Lake had much higher total plant cover in the passively recovering community than Farmington Bay, showing potential that passive recolonization might be a viable strategy for increasing native cover. However, the plant community still included a large diversity of invasive species, suggesting a high likelihood of the community reverting to be invasive-dominated in the future. Although seeding in any context is useful for increasing native plant cover (Tarsa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2022a</xref>), it is especially important to seed when invasive propagule pressure is high (Adams and Galatowitsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>)&#x02014;a fact that is particularly important for Utah wetlands, which have been shown to have unusually high <italic>P. australis</italic> propagule pressure (Rohal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>). Furthermore, efforts to shape wetland plant communities to be more resilient and resistant to invasion are particularly important in areas prone to extreme weather conditions (Hovick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2023</xref>), such as the flooding seen in Utah Lake during 2023. Although we were unable to monitor for a third season to determine the effects of the flooding on the plant community, we would expect invasive species to benefit from the flooding (Zedler and Kercher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2004</xref>; Byun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>), as they did at Farmington Bay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The Effects of Passive Recolonization and Seeding on Cover and Composition of the Seeded, Unseeded Native, and Invasive Communities Varied by Site</title><p id="Par29">Even in sites that are geographically close and experiencing the same climate, different restoration outcomes can result from small changes in biotic and abiotic conditions unique to sites (Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2015</xref>; Fried et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>). In the present study, the two sites differed substantially in the cover and composition of the unseeded native, seeded native, and invasive community. Plant community differences could be attributed to many biotic and abiotic factors, but salinity or hydrology are likely large drivers. The brackish wetland of Farmington Bay contained a higher cover of salt-tolerant species like <italic>D. spicata</italic> and <italic>S. rubra</italic> (i.e., reflecting the fact that species have different salinity tolerances; Tootoonchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2023</xref>) and a plant community composition with fewer species (i.e., species were filtered out due to inadequate salt tolerances). The recolonizing wetland plant communities subject to the more benign freshwater conditions of Utah Lake had a greater number of unseeded native species than Farmington Bay but a lower proportion of halophytic species<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par30">These plant community differences were likely also driven by the hydrology of the two sites, specifically long-term lake-level fluctuation. Lakes that fluctuate yearly have greater diversity, as differences in abiotic conditions allow for more niches and increased germination from the seed bank (Keddy and Reznicek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1986</xref>; Wilcox and Nichols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2008</xref>), a fact that may explain why more species emerged from the background community at Utah Lake than Farmington Bay. Although both sites experienced drought in 2022, Utah Lake is known to have yearly fluctuations in lake level due to evaporation and upstream water diversions (Richards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>). Although Farmington Bay also experiences water-level fluctuations (as was seen in this experiment), managers at Farmington Bay have coarse control over water level to lessen the effects of water-level fluctuations on restoration outcomes (Downard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>), as seen when managers released water into the experimental area in early August 2022.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Water Depth Appeared to Overwhelm Seeding Treatments</title><p id="Par31">Drought can be a major constraint to successful restoration, as water availability can lead to rapid mortality of the more vulnerable seed and seedling stages of plants relative to more established plants (Doherty and Zedler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>; Buisson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>; Hebert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>). On the other hand, flooding can drive wetland community assembly because different species germinate and survive at different water depths with associated variations in light, temperature, and oxygen (Spence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1982</xref>; Webb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2012</xref>). In the present study, hydrologic extremes, both severe drought and prolonged and, at times, deep flooding, appeared to overwhelm the functional group and seeding density treatments. At Farmington Bay, most of the seeded species never emerged, and the majority that germinated in the first growing season were absent by the second season. Although emergent species can survive a range of hydrologic conditions, the set of conditions under which seeds can germinate and grow is narrower (Rosbakh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2020</xref>). One germination study from a wetland seed bank found that growth was reduced across the entire seed bank when water was 6&#x000a0;cm below the soil surface and greatly reduced when water was 2&#x000a0;cm or greater above the soil surface (Fraser and Karnezis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>). In the present experiment, water levels at Farmington Bay were 8&#x02013;76 cm below the soil surface in 2022 and 8&#x02013;25 cm above the soil surface in 2023, suggesting that few seedlings were able to germinate and survive in 2022 and any that were able to emerge in 2022 were likely unable to establish in 2023. At Utah Lake, the plots were flooded by &#x0003e;&#x02009;1.5 m of water in year 2 over the entire growing season, so the plots themselves were not identifiable, and certainly, the seedlings would not have survived if they had withstood the drought in year 1.</p><p id="Par32">The extreme weather events presented an opportunity to identify species that survived these extremes, suggesting they may be good focal species for wetland restoration. We found that three species (<italic>B. maritimus</italic> and <italic>S. acutus</italic> from the bulrush functional group and <italic>D. spicata</italic> from the grass functional group) have the potential to survive the hydrologic extremes present in the field that will become more common at both sites as a result of climate change (Wurtsbaugh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>; Richards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>; IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2023</xref>). Managers value the three species for their habitat benefits (Downard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>; Rohal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2018</xref>). The species also represent a range of hydrologic tolerances, likely contributing to their resistance or resilience to hydrologic extremes. Bulrushes, in particular, showed great potential for growing under varied environmental conditions as they were the only species for which seeding had a measurable effect on native cover in the study. This finding is consistent with other studies that found that <italic>B. maritimus</italic> can tolerate water levels ranging from drought to flooding, as well as highly alkaline and salty soils (Downard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>; Houde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2024</xref>). The seeds can also germinate even when below the water surface (Clevering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1995</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>S. acutus</italic> was the only seeded species to increase over time during both growing seasons. Although <italic>S. acutus</italic> typically prefers flooding (Stewart and Kantrud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">1972</xref>; Downard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>), these results suggest that it has the potential to establish and spread under broad hydrologic conditions. Finally, <italic>D. spicata</italic> was also able to survive both years of extreme weather at Farmington Bay, aligning with previous studies that found <italic>D. spicata</italic> to survive both regular inundation (Stalter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2022</xref>) and extreme drought (McKee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">The ability to compare hydrologic data to plant growth outcomes is complicated to evaluate and has rarely been tested (Brudvig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>; Sueltenfuss and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2019</xref>). Methodological limitations (e.g., linking hydrology to delayed plant responses; collecting plant and hydrology data on compatible spatial and temporal scales) are particularly problematic given that the inability to manage hydrology adequately for plant communities is a major reason that restoration projects fail (Bohnen and Galatowitsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>; Galatowitsch and Bohnen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>). The water level data we collected (at the block level intended to describe site conditions) does not allow statistical comparison with plot-level plant data. However, given that field experiments are notoriously poor at elucidating drivers of plant community assembly due to many uncontrollable factors, our findings emphasize the need for controlled experiments (e.g., in the greenhouse) to more precisely identify drivers of salinity, hydrology, and their interactions on plant community assembly in this system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Diverse Seed Mixes can Act as a Bet-Hedging Strategy for Restoration Success</title><p id="Par34">Given the difficulty of predicting environmental conditions within wetlands (Bohnen and Galatowitsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>), particularly with increasing hydrologic extremes due to climate change and human water withdrawals (Wurtsbaugh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>; IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2023</xref>), wetland restoration should focus on incorporating diversity on multiple levels of a restoration project through the use of a bet-hedging strategy (also called a portfolio effect; Schindler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>). Given that extreme weather events are unpredictable and restoration projects often take place on small geographic scales, portfolio effects can be particularly important for increasing resilience to environmental extremes in restoration projects to combat this increased volatility (Zabin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2022</xref>). The results of this experiment exemplify how seeding species from different functional groups and hydrologic tolerances can serve as a form of bet-hedging. Although we did not design this experiment to test the effects of bet-hedging, seeding a variety of species (i.e., across the functional group identity treatments) resulted in some native growth during both hydrologic extremes, something that may not have occurred if only flood-tolerant or drought-tolerant species had been introduced. Seed mixes should include a wide variety of species from different functional groups to ensure that restoration goals can be met regardless of weather and site conditions and to avoid biotic homogenization, which can lead to a loss of diversity and ecosystem functioning (Holl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2022</xref>; Luong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2023</xref>). Furthermore, seeding a variety of species allowed us to ensure native growth at both locations even without precise knowledge of the future abiotic conditions.</p><p id="Par35">A bet-hedging strategy can be further enhanced with reseeding sites over multiple years and breaking dormancy in only a subset of the seed mix to increase the probability of aligning seed and seedling abiotic requirements with favorable environmental conditions for establishment in future years (Doherty and Zedler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>; Rader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2022</xref>; Zabin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2022</xref>). Interestingly, we broke dormancy for all seed mixes under the presumption that the seeds would be sown at the optimal time for germination and seedling establishment. Yet, we did not foresee the hydrologic extremes facing the restoration sites post-seeding. Treating a fraction, like half, of the seed lot (as a bet-hedging strategy) would have been an additional, but not insurmountable, logistical hurdle that might be feasible for others to implement in wetland seedings, thereby building up the seed bank for the future when environmental conditions are better suited for seeds (Evans and Dennehy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>), especially given that annual weather is a determinant of restoration success (Copeland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2024</xref>). In addition, re-seeding sites over multiple years may also be required in a future with greater environmental extremes (Groves and Brudvig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>; Kettenring and Tarsa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>). Given the difficulty of predicting abiotic conditions at a site within a short temporal scale, it is important to incorporate bet-hedging to ensure restoration success regardless of conditions. This research was a useful step in exemplifying the importance of this strategy for the many restoration projects where year-to-year hydrologic extremes may ultimately drive outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13157_2025_1935_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file 1 (DOCX 691 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D.
