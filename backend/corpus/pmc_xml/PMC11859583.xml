Psychological help-seeking attitudes are influenced by various factors, including self-stigma, mental health literacy, and levels of depression and anxiety. Several studies have examined the relationships between these variables and help-seeking attitudes, shedding light on the predictors of seeking psychological help. Self-stigma, or the internalization of negative attitudes towards seeking psychological help, has been found to significantly impact help-seeking attitudes. Individuals who experience higher levels of self-stigma are more likely to hold negative attitudes towards seeking help. Additionally, mental health literacy, which refers to knowledge and understanding of mental health issues, has been identified as another important predictor of help-seeking attitudes. Individuals with higher mental health literacy are more likely to have positive attitudes towards seeking psychological help. Depression and anxiety, two common mental health concerns, have also been found to influence help-seeking attitudes. Research has shown that individuals with higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms are more likely to express intentions to seek counseling for psychological and interpersonal concerns. These mental health concerns can serve as motivators for individuals to seek professional help. Furthermore, cultural and demographic factors can also play a role in shaping help-seeking attitudes.</p></sec><sec id="sec7569"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study was planned to examine the variables predicting psychological help seeking attitudes: self-stigma, mental health literacy, and depression/anxiety</p></sec><sec id="sec7570"><title>Methods</title><p>The sample of the study was determined by purposive sampling method.
