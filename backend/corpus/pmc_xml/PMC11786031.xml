A recent meta-analysis of 32 studies reported an estimated overall mean proportion of malignant transformation (MT) of 9.3% in OLK <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Given the complex clinical scenario associated with OSCC management, it is crucial to clarify the occurrence and development mechanism of OLK and establish effective screening methodologies to identify oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) with higher efficacy, and thus improve the prognosis of patients.</p><p>HOXC9, a member of the HOX family, is highly expressed in various tumors such as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and is related to tumor malignancy and an increased risk of distant metastasis, and is thus an indicator of poor prognosis <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Recent studies have found that high expression of HOXC9 induces EMT in a variety of cancer cell lines <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, promotes the motility of tumor cells and enhances their self-renewal capabilities <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Sequencing studies have found that the expression of HOXC9 is abnormally elevated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. However, whether HOXC9 is closely related to OLK progression is unclear, and the role of HOXC9 in malignant transformation of OLK has not been reported previously.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the occurrence of OLK involves complex molecular biological processes, including abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells acquisition of cell stemness and EMT <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The study found that the expression of NANOG in the moderate OLK group was significantly lower than that in the severe OLK group, suggesting that NANOG may play a role in the malignant transformation of OLK from mild to severe dysplasia <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The expression of SOX-2 in the basal and upper basal layers of the OLK group was higher than that in the normal oral mucosa group, and the expression in the upper basal layer was even higher. This suggests that there is an ectopic expression pattern of stem cell like population extending from the basal layer to the upper basal layer during the occurrence of OLK, which seems to be a reliable indicator for distinguishing inert and high-risk cases <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. EMT plays a significant role in promoting the OLK malignant transformation. As an important regulator of EMT, SNAI2 could be a target to block the OLK malignant transformation <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. In summary, the expression of stem cell markers and EMT may play an important role in the occurrence of OLK and indicate extremely high malignant potential.</p><p>To further investigate the effect of HOXC9 on the malignant transformation of OLK, we designed overexpressed the HOXC9 sequence to study its role in dysplastic oral keratinocytes (DOK), and designed knocked down HOXC9 with two siRNA sequences to study its role in HSC3 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also used Co-IP and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the potential mechanism of HOXC9 expression, thereby providing a theoretical basis for HOXC9 as a potential therapeutic target for OLK.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>DOK and HSC3 cell lines</title><p>DOK cells were purchased from Luzhen Industrial Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China), and squamous cell carcinoma (HSC3) cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA).

Among them, HOXC9 was one of the most differentially expressed mRNAs, and its expression was high in the five OSCC cell lines compare to DOK cells (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). To clarify the HOXC9 expression, we then used GEPIA database (<ext-link xlink:href="http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/" ext-link-type="uri">http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/</ext-link>), which is based on (The Cancer Genome Atlas) TCGA database, to obtain and analyze the relative HOXC9 expression data between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues and adjacent normal tissues, The results showed that HOXC9 was more highly expressed in HNSCC tissues (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). To further confirm the expression of HOXC9, IHC staining was performed in 28 normal oral mucosa(NOM) tissues&#x03001;45 OLK and 72 OSCC tissues, We found that the HOXC9 expression were enhanced significantly in OLK tissues than in NAT, Meanwhile, The HOXC9 expression in OSCC tissues, were also most highly expressed compared with the NOM and OLK tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E), According to statistical analysis, the number of cases with high HOXC9 expression (score &#x0003e; 4 points as high expression) was 0.00% in NOM tissues, 31.11% in OLK tissues, and 40.28% in OSCC tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). We also performed immunohistochemical analysis of CD133, which is a critical markers of cell stemness. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G, NOM cases showed lower CD133 immunolabeling when compared with the OLK cases, although this difference was not statistically significant. However, the means were statistically higher in OLK when compared with that in NOM, and in OSCC, the means were statistically highest. According to statistical analysis, the number of cases with high CD133 expression (score &#x0003e; 4 points as high expression) was 3.50% in NOM tissue, 4.44% in OLK tissue, and as high as 34.72% in OSCC tissue (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G). In addition, we performed a correlation analysis of HOXC9 and CD133 expression in OLK tissues, and the results showed that there was a positive association between HOXC9 and CD133(Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H). The above results indicate that the expression of HOXC9 and CD133 increases with the degree of malignancy of oral epithelium and the HOXC9 expression is accompanied by an increase in CD133 expression. However, it is currently unclear whether HOXC9 can promote the malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia by increasing the cell stemness of oral leukoplakia.</p></sec><sec><title>HOXC9 functions as an oncogene in oral leukoplakia</title><p>To investigate the potential role of the HOXC9 on OLK malignant transformation, we transduced Dysplastic Oral Keratinocyt (DOK) cell which is pre-cancer cell with a HOXC9-overexpressing vector and determined the self-renewal ability reflecting the cancer stem(-like) cells (CSCs) signature. <italic>In vitro</italic> tumorsphere formation analyses demonstrated that HOXC9-overexpressing DOK cells exhibited increased tumorsphere numbers and size when compared to control groups (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A-C), Consistently, western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of CSCs markers (ALDH1A1, CD133) were increased in HOXC9 overexpression groups (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F-G), suggesting that upregulated HOXC9 augmented the self-renewal ability of DOK cells.</p><p>Given that high self-renewal ability is more invasive and contributes to OLK aggressiveness <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, we next investigated the role of HOXC9 in regulating OLK aggressiveness. <italic>In vitro</italic> transwell invasion analyses demonstrated that overexpression of HOXC9 markedly promotes the number of migrating or invading DOK cells (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D-E). As the enhanced invasiveness of DOK is closely linked to their preferential expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, we next examined the levels of EMT markers in DOK. The results demonstrated that the N-cadherin protein levels were increased, while the E-cadherin protein levels were impaired in the HOXC9 overexpression groups (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F-G), which proved that overexpression of the HOXC9 gene promotes EMT. Taken together, these results indicate that HOXC9 overexpression correlates with the acquisition of self-renewal ability and invasiveness.</p><p>We further explored the self-renewal ability and invasiveness of HOXC9 in cancerous (HSC3) cells. First, HSC3 cells were infected with siRNA targeting human HOXC9, and the knockdown effect was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F-G), which showed that the knockdown of HOXC9 significantly attenuated the sphere-forming, migratory and invasive ability of HSC3 (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A-E). We performed western blot analysis for CSCs and EMT markers in HSC3 cells. N-cadherin, ALDH1A1, and CD133 protein levels decreased, while E-cadherin protein levels were impaired in the HOXC9 knockdown groups (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F-G). Taken together, this suggests that HOXC9 knockdown suppressed cancer migration, invasion, and sphere-forming ability in HSC3.</p></sec><sec><title>HOXC-AS1 activates the oncogenic functions of HOXC9 to enhance the self-renewal and EMT ability</title><p>The increased expression of HOXC9 in oral epithelium tissue with increasing malignancy and its promotion of CSCs and EMT indicate a close relationship with the malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia. We focused on the regulatory mechanism of HOXC9 and examined the HOXC9 promoter region in detail using the NCBI website. We identified an antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), HOXC-AS1, upstream of the transcription initiation site (TSS) of HOXC9. We investigated the role of HOXC-AS1 in DOK <italic>in vitro</italic>. After successful transfection of the vector expressing HOXC-AS1 or expressing siRNA targeting HOXC-AS1 in DOK, the overexpression efficiency of HOXC-AS1 (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) or the knockdown efficiency of siHOXC-AS1-1 and siHOXC-AS1-2 (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) was analyzed using q-PCR. the expression level of HOXC9 increased in the HOXC-AS1 overexpression model (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C-D) and decreased in the HOXC-AS1-silenced model (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E-F). The western blotting results showed that CSCs and EMT markers were enhanced when HOXC-AS1 was overexpressed and inhibited when HOXC-AS1 expression was silenced in DOK cells (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E-F). Given these findings, we determined whether HOXC9 is a key downstream effector of HOXC-AS1 that promotes CSCs and EMT. We next performed rescue experiments, which revealed the partial reversal of the inhibitory effects of HOXC-AS1 on tumor sphere formation and EMT in HOXC9 OE DOK cells (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G-H). Collectively, these data demonstrated that HOXC-AS1 promotes cell stemness and EMT through HOXC9.</p></sec><sec><title>HOXC-AS1 regulates methylation levels in the HOXC9 promoter region</title><p>Given that the HOXC-AS1 coordinate is located in the HOXC9 promoter region, the presence of antisense lncRNAs (HOTTIP and HOTAIR) in the HOX family gene cluster can regulate the expression of HOX genes through epigenetic regulation <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Therefore, we next investigated the role of HOXC-AS1 in the epigenetic regulation of HOXC9. Because H3 methylation in the HOX gene promoter region is considered a potential biomarker for OSCC <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, we next examined whether HOXC-AS1 regulates HOXC9 mRNA expression by modulating this process. ChIP analysis revealed that compared to DOK, the H3K27me3 level in the HOXC9 promoter region of HSC3 cells was significantly downregulated (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I). At the same time, silencing of HOXC-AS1 significantly decreased methylation K27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>J). Taken together, these results suggested that HOXC-AS1 promotes the methylation of histone H3 at K27, thereby epigenetically enhancing HOXC9 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between HOXC-AS1 and EZH2</title><p>Given that lncRNAs exert their functions mainly by binding to specific proteins <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, we next performed an RNA pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry to screen for HOXC-AS1-interacting proteins, which revealed that EZH2 was a putative HOXC-AS1 binding protein (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Zeste homolog 2 enhancer (EZH2), an oncogene that is overexpressed in various human cancers, is a subunit of polycomb inhibitory complex 2 (PRC2), which binds to approximately 20% of lncRNAs and catalyzes H3K27 trimethylase activity through lncRNAs <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Next, we searched the bioinformatics prediction site RNAInter (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.rnainter.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.rnainter.org/</ext-link>) and found that EZH2 is a HOXC-AS1-interacting protein (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). In addition, RNA-Protein Interaction Prediction (RPISeq) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/RPISeq/" ext-link-type="uri">http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/RPISeq/</ext-link>) was performed to estimate the interaction probabilities between HOXC-AS1 and EZH2, the results of which confirmed their interaction (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). We performed RNA pull-down assays followed by western blotting to clarify the association between EZH2 and HOXC-AS1. The results were consistent in that EZH2 was pulled down in the biotin-labeled sense HOXC-AS1 group (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). To further confirm this interaction, we conducted an RIP assay followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and qRT-PCR analysis, the results of which supported the enrichment of HOXC-AS1 by EZH2 (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D, E). In addition, co-IP analysis showed that endogenous EZH2 interacted with H3 in DOK cells, and that silencing HOXC-AS1 significantly enhanced the binding between EZH2 and H3 (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F). To verify whether the regulation of EZH2 by HOXC-AS1 is related to H3K27 trimethylase activity, selective EZH2 inhibitor (EBI-2511) was first added to the DOK to inhibit protein synthesis, while silencing of HOXC-AS1 increased the H3K27me3 level in the HOXC9 promoter region of DOK cells (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>G) and suppressed the expression of HOXC9 (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H). Taken together, these results suggested that HOXC-AS1 acts as a decoy to competitively bind EZH2 and inhibit EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylase activity.</p><p>To determine which region of HOXC-AS1 is responsible for binding to EZH2, we first employed a truncated mapping strategy using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed HOXC-AS1 fragments to pull down EZH2. The data revealed that the second fragment containing 251-619nt was associated with EZH2, similar to the full-length HOXC-AS1 (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>I), suggesting that 251-619 nt are critical for the interaction of HOXC-AS1 with EZH2. Next, we constructed a mutant (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>J). Consequently, the mutant completely abolished the binding of HOXC-AS1 with EZH2 (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>K). Moreover, OE of HOXC-AS1 increased and OE of HOXC-AS1 mutant failed to increase the binding of EZH2 (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>L). Taken together, these data indicated that HOXC-AS1 physically interacts with EZH2.</p></sec><sec><title>HOXC-AS1 and EZH2 Coordinate CSCs and EMT through HOXC9</title><p>Given these findings, we next investigated whether HOXC9 is a key downstream effector of the HOXC-AS1/EZH2 axis that promotes CSCs and EMT in DOK cells. In rescue experiments, DOK cells were infected with oeHOXC-AS1 lentivirus to overexpress HOXC-AS1 and then infected with siRNA to knockdown HOXC9. The sphere formation analysis showed that the spheroid formation of the oeHOXC-AS1 group increased significantly compared with the Ctrl group, However, knockdown of HOXC9 partly reversed the increased spheroid formation ability caused by HOXC-AS1 overexpression (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A-C).</p><p>Similar results were obtained in the transwell assay (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D-E). The average number of migratory cells per field was 33 in the control group, which, when HOXC-AS1 was overexpressed, increased to 102 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), before decreasing to 55(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) following HOXC-AS1 knockdown. Similar results were observed when the fold change in invasion was calculated. These results indicated that HOXC9 overexpression reversed the increased migration and invasion ability caused by HOXC-AS1 overexpression.</p><p>As EBI-2511 is a highly selective EZH2 inhibitor, we next explored the blocking effects of EZH2 release on spheroid formation after HOXC-AS1 depletion. Strikingly, EBI-2511 restored the spheroid formation caused by HOXC-AS1 suppression (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F-H). Similar results were observed when the migration or invasion fold-changes were calculated (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>I-J). These results indicated that EBI-2511 restored the migration and invasion ability of DOK HOXC-AS1 knockdown.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that HOXC9 knockdown can restore the CSCs and migration abilities of DOK cells overexpressing HOXC-AS1, thereby suggesting that HOXC-AS1 interacts with HOXC9 to increase tumor stemness of oral leukoplakia and promote malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>Oral leukoplakia can evolve into oral squamous cell carcinoma with high malignancy and a low survival rate <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, therefore, there is an urgent need to identify more effective molecular markers to diagnose oral leukoplakia with potential deterioration. In this study, our results altogether revealed that HOXC9 is upregulated in OSCC cells and tissues. The levels of HOXC9 expression increases with the degree of malignancy of oral epithelium, while knockdown of HOXC9 significantly inhibited CSCs and EMT. These findings demonstrated the oncogenic role of HOXC9 in OSCC.</p><p>lncRNAs are emerging as important factors in the malignant progression of tumors such as OSCC <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Notably, lncRNAs can also interact with RNA-binding proteins by acting as molecular scaffolds and affecting gene expression through post-transcriptional regulation <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Recently, HOXC-AS1 has been reported to bind to RNA-binding protein-like insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, miR-99a-3p <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, and miR-4651 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> in various tumors, increasing target protein expression, stability, and activity In their study, Ma et al. demonstrated that lncRNA NEAT1 can inhibit GADD45A expression by recruiting BRG1 and installing H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in the promoter region of GADD45A, thereby promoting gastric cancer progression <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. In this study, we discovered HOXC-AS1 to promote HOXC9 expression by inhibiting H3K27 methylation in its promoter, while knockdown of HOXC-AS1 partially reversed the function of HOXC9 in OSCC CSCs and EMT. This suggests that HOXC9 may be a potential HOXC-AS1-interacting gene, and that further exploration and research are warranted. In addition, how HOXC-AS1 and HOXC9 interact to promote CSCs and EMT in DOK cells requires further investigation.</p><p>Due to the positive regulation of the H3K27me3 level by EZH2 that has previously been reported <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, we predicted the potential binding between HOXC-AS1 and EZH2 through the RPISeq website and confirmed their interaction. An oncogene that is overexpressed in various human cancers <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. EZH2 is a subunit of the PRC2 that binds to approximately 20% of lncRNAs and catalyzes the H3K27 trimethylase activity of the EZH2 subunit through lncRNAs, acting as a transcription inhibitor <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. We then explored the critical sequences and domains involved in the interactions between HOXC-AS1, EZH2, and HOXC9. From immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that HOXC-AS1 probably interacted with EZH2, with nucleotides 251-619 of HOXC-AS1 required for binding. In HOXC-AS1-overexpressing OSCC cells, HOXC9 methylation was significantly inhibited and protein stability was upregulated. These results indicated that HOXC-AS1 acts as a decoy by inhibiting HOXC9 methylation and promoting protein stability. Overexpression of EZH2 is related to the inhibition of tumor suppressor and metastasis-related genes and has been proven to have carcinogenic effects on various types of tumors, leading to tumor glycolysis, EMT, migration, and invasion <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Research has demonstrated that high expression of EZH2 in OSCC is associated with low survival rates in patients <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. EZH2 can determine the expression levels of downstream genes in both directions through both PRC2-dependent transcription regulation and PRC2-independent translation regulation <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>; therefore, EZH2 probably plays an oncogenic role in various tumor types, and ubiquitination of EZH2 might be a critical regulatory process in tumorigenesis <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Following this hypothesis, a rescue experiment indicated that HOXC9 and EZH2 probably act as downstream targets in the process of HOXC-AS1 promotion CSCs and EMT of oral leukoplakia. These results illustrate that HOXC-AS1 promotes malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia by inhibiting the interaction between HOXC9 and EZH2 and the methylation of HOXC9.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, HOXC-AS1 function with HOXC9 deserve further investigation. In this study, pull-down and LC-MS identified 328 proteins that may interact with HOXC-AS1. Additionally, EZH2 is a protein that may interact with HOXC-AS1 to promote CSCs and EMT were selected by bioinformatics. Therefore, we selected only EZH2 proteins for subsequent pull-down verification. The validation results showed that HOXC-AS1 interacts with the target protein EZH2. Proteins other than EZH2 are worthy of further exploration. In addition, the role of HOXC9 in promoting CSCs and EMT has not been identified, and we plan to further investigate the underlying mechanism in future studies.</p><p>In summary, HOXC9 overexpression could serve as a pivotal risk factor associated with worse outcomes in OLK, with substantial value for molecular diagnosis and prognostic determination. The most encouraging finding in this study is that we showed for the first time that HOXC-AS1 regulates HOXC9 expression by competitively binding to EZH2, preventing it from binding to H3 in the HOXC9 promoter region, resulting in a decrease in K27 trimethylation level of H3, which may be the underlying mechanism of the detrimental roles of HOXC9 in OLK progression (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>M). Our study showed that the HOXC-AS1/EZH2/HOXC9 axis plays a key role in the malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia by regulating CSCs and EMT.</p></sec><sec id="SM0" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary methods and tables.</p></caption><media xlink:href="jcav16p1202s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Youth Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund of Guangdong Province (2021A1515111196, 2021A1515110872).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical statement</title><p>Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Stomatological Hospital of Southern medical University (Approved No. Of the Ethics Committee:NYKQ-EC-[2024]02).
