</sup> However, these contributions have yet to exceed the sum of their parts, prompting little in the way of programmatic development, methodological reflection or horizontal conversation across the field as a whole. Meanwhile, the most authoritative statement of the remit and rationale of geographical political economy, extending to some nineteen far-reaching propositions, does not explicitly identify a place for the role of ideas or the analysis of ideation&#x02014;save for an acknowledgment of the discursive construction of economic relations, attributed supplementally to &#x0201c;the domain of cultural theory&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr157-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard, 2018</xref>: 169).</p><p>Consistent with the heterodox and ecumenical theory-culture of geographical political economy (cf. <xref rid="bibr35-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Bok, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr140-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Peck, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr145-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr156-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bibr157-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), the paper asks what it might mean for this capacious and evolving project to specify an explicit role (and indeed place) for ideas and ideation, as something exceeding supplement or sideline. We take this step while noting the abundance of invitations to geographical engagement issuing from the broad field of heterodox political economy, in evocative concepts like thought collectives, expert ecologies, and epistemic communities (<xref rid="bibr60-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Cross, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Farrell and Quiggin, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr93-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Hirschman and Berman, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr131-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Mirowski and Plehwe, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr152-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Seabrook and Wigan, 2018</xref>); in the deconstruction of globalization projects, traveling models, and spatial imaginaries (<xref rid="bibr9-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Ban, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr161-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Slobodian, 2018b</xref>, <xref rid="bibr162-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>); in accounts of the role of ideas across cycles of crisis, failure, institutional transformation and consolidation (<xref rid="bibr23-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Best, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Blyth, 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="bibr45-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Campbell, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr85-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 2013</xref>); and in the demonstration effect of richly contextualized and situated modes of analysis and explication (<xref rid="bibr34-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Bockman and Eyal, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr62-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Dezalay and Garth, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr94-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Jabko, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr147-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Rueschemeyer, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Yet if heterodox political economy can be credited with addressing &#x0201c;how, when, where, and why ideas &#x02026; matter&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr149-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt, 2008</xref>: 305), the corresponding array of &#x0201c;where&#x0201d; questions has yet to receive the same degree of analytical attention, beyond commonplace attribution to &#x0201c;national differences&#x0201d; (cf. <xref rid="bibr27-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Blyth, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Pedersen, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr82-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 1989</xref>). Confronting these questions directly, the point of departure for the paper is a sympathetic assessment of the ideas-school research program. We then go on to ask what a <italic toggle="yes">geographical</italic> political economy of ideas, conceived in its own terms, might look like. Our first step is to identify and elaborate those ontological and epistemological commitments that geographical political economy can be said to share with ideas-school approaches, including a qualified embrace of constructivism, axiomatic concerns with institutionally embedded power relations, and predispositions toward contextualized and conjunctural modes of analysis. But if these affinities and overlapping orientations are methodologically suggestive, they are hardly definitive or sufficient. This is our rationale for extending the discussion through an engagement with three contrasting models of ideational analysis, each of which is constructively adjacent to (but not <italic toggle="yes">of</italic>) the ideas school, while also being notable for their creative and distinctive handling of the <italic toggle="yes">spatiality</italic> of ideas: from anthropology, Hannah <xref rid="bibr5-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Appel&#x02019;s (2019)</xref> poststructuralist ethnography of the reproduction of &#x0201c;offshore&#x0201d; oil economies; from sociology, Marion <xref rid="bibr71-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Fourcade&#x02019;s (2009)</xref> comparative study of disciplinary traditions and intellectual formations in economics; and from history, Quinn <xref rid="bibr161-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Slobodian&#x02019;s (2018b)</xref> alternative history of neoliberal globalization. Together, these monographs illustrate some of the diverse ways of &#x0201c;doing&#x0201d; ideas, each with resonances and implications for geographical political economy.</p><p>Our overall purpose is to emphasize the variety of methodologically tractable ways in which ideas and ideation can be productively engaged in accordance with the ontological premises, epistemological practices, and programmatic aspirations of geographical political economy. Furthermore, in building from foundations in heterodox political economy (where, in practice, &#x0201c;geography&#x0201d; &#x02248; national differences), we seek to advance a case for problematizing the contextual specificity of ideation, conceived as a socio<italic toggle="yes">spatial</italic> process. Along the way, and partly for heuristic reasons, areas of common concern and constructive difference will be identified with the extant science-studies tradition in economic geography, with its more practiced rationales and routines. This is not to polarize these approaches, as mutually exclusive or irreconcilable, but to sharpen the sense of what might be distinctive about <italic toggle="yes">geographical</italic> political-economy approaches to ideation, while opening up avenues for methodological experimentation and interpretative debate. To this end, the paper concludes with a distillation of implications, lessons, and rules of thumb for geographical political economies of ideation, grounded in the principles of conjunctural analysis. With this destination in mind, we begin by examining the rise of the historical-institutionalist ideas school, before summarizing and synthesizing the key tenets of (geographical) political economy approaches to ideation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-03091325251326790"><title>II Ideas and ideation</title><p>There has never been a shortage of &#x0201c;ideas about ideas&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr149-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt, 2008</xref>: 306), such that judgment calls become necessary even at the stage of basic definitions.

</sup> Influenced by catholic readings of Weber and Marx, historical institutionalists seek to analyze sociopolitical change with reference both to materially rooted power relations and to ongoing processes of normalization, institutionalization, and social learning. In contrast to rational-choice theorists and more orthodox Marxists (who tend for quite different reasons to attribute policy actions to calculable, material interests), historical institutionalists seek to construct midlevel, intermediate paths between the microanalytical and the macrostructural. They do so by prioritizing the mediating roles of political parties, social movements, corporatist institutions, and governmental organizations in the historically discontinuous movement of (dominant) ideas, governing paradigms, and disputed policy knowledges, refining their arguments through extended, critical-case investigations, such as macroeconomic crises, the evolution of welfare regimes, the long arc of the Keynesian consensus, and transformations in multilateral governance (see <xref rid="bibr1-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Abdelal, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr67-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bibr82-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bibr148-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Rueschemeyer and Skocpol, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr167-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Steinmo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bibr169-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Strange, 1988</xref>).

Constructivists seek to explain how situations come to be as they are, rather than otherwise, and how they are shaped in relation to alternatives. Neither deterministic nor definitive, their accounts are concerned with cognitive worldviews and political beliefs, symbols and imaginaries, social norms and identities, together with contingent and contested processes of institutionalization. Institutions may structure and stabilize, but they are never permanent, static or complete. It follows that constructivist explanations are always partial and contestable, in fact categorically so. Properly understood as a pluralist enterprise, constructivism is animated by experimentation and ongoing debate between competing, contestable, and never-complete explanations. Constructivists differ around attributions of agency and causality, while demurring in principle from one-sided, deterministic or reductionist explanations. Some portray ideas as &#x0201c;causally powerful,&#x0201d; with a degree of independent influence over &#x0201c;the form and content of institutional change&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr27-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Blyth, 2002</xref>: 10), while others opt to explore contingent alignments and &#x0201c;elective affinities&#x0201d; between ideas, worldviews, politics, and institutions (<xref rid="bibr71-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Fourcade, 2009</xref>: 242). For the former, especially those sympathetic to the &#x0201c;paradigms&#x0201d; tradition in political science, a premium is placed on the attribution of the (sometimes overdetermined) power of ideas in steering political change. For the latter, such as those working in science studies or practice-oriented sociology, the influence of ideas is less direct and more mediated. Explanation is often couched in terms of the coevolution and congruence between ideas and fields like governmental policymaking, epistemic networks or the professions (see <xref rid="bibr19-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Berman, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr62-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Dezalay and Garth, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bibr63-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr71-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Fourcade, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr158-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Sikkink, 1991</xref>). Here, ideas may not be the starting point or explanatory locus, but acquire meaning and salience through instituted practices.</p><p>Since its emergence as a subcultural trend within historical institutionalism, the ideas school morphed into the heterodox mainstream of critical international political economy and economic sociology.

First, we develop the case for an approach to economic ideas in which place, context, and situation actually matter, above and beyond their background effects; second, we argue for a relational understanding of ideation as a power-laden, uneven sociospatial process; and third, we underscore the analytical and political contribution of conjunctural approaches to ideation, engaging and explaining its attendant practices and politics of ideation in concrete-complex and geohistorically specified terms. These theoretical considerations set the stage for an indicative examination of the variety of methodological practices that have the potential to complement, realize, and extend this approach.</p><sec id="sec3-03091325251326790"><title>1 Putting ideas in their place</title><p>The &#x0201c;ideas debate&#x0201d; has been marked by a persistent constellation of concerns with the non-deterministic interplay between potentially transformative ideas, contending forces and interests, and the moving terrains of political struggle and institutional change, as well as with recurring debates between more structural-materialist versus agent-centered or interactive approaches, and over the attribution and location of ideational agency. Across these positions, however, it is widely acknowledged that the causal capacity and intrinsic efficacy of ideas depend on context-specific circumstances (see <xref rid="bibr71-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Fourcade, 2009</xref>: 244; <xref rid="bibr147-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Rueschemeyer, 2006</xref>: 249). Since neither ideas nor the interests &#x0201c;behind&#x0201d; them can be said to speak for themselves, this means that ideas acquire meaning and salience only in context and conversation, through socioinstitutional mediation, even as they may subsequently appear to take on lives of their own (see <xref rid="bibr23-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Best, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr99-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">James, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bibr181-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Widmaier, 2016</xref>). These particular articulations of processes and practices are not reducible to Humean rules of constant conjunction, since no universal or mechanical relationship between economic ideas and political-economic outcomes holds across cases and contexts, leading explanations in the direction of mutual conditioning, adaptative interaction, and complex relationality, but away from essentialism and foreclosure (see <xref rid="bibr27-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Blyth, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr75-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Gofas and Hay, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr87-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Hay, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bibr89-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Interpretative judgment calls made in this causally ambiguous and somewhat indeterminate terrain are precisely that. Ideas may prefigure, format or animate institutional and political projects, serving instrumental purposes for social actors and analysts alike&#x02014;but they may also retrospectively <italic toggle="yes">appear</italic> to do so, as justifications, rationalizing devices or congruent narratives, sometimes invoked in real time, sometimes post hoc. (&#x0201c;Ideas that matter&#x0201d; may be called upon as the explanation of institutional change or socioeconomic transformation, or they may be <italic toggle="yes">represented</italic> as such, as &#x0201c;ideas that fit.&#x0201d;) Inescapably, the uneven traction and apparent periodicity of influential ideas must be, to some degree, in the eye of the beholder. &#x0201c;Visible,&#x0201d; significant or conspicuous ideas may be(come) recognized as such for circumstantial reasons (for instance, being advanced by charismatic ideational entrepreneurs, attending to legitimacy deficits or gaining recognition in urgent situations), as well as for putatively causal or explanatory reasons (for instance, as templates for transformative change). Ideas may even appear to &#x0201c;fail,&#x0201d; while nevertheless prompting reactions, adaptations, and innovations in the realm of practice, including the production of new devices, rules, rationalizations, and other such &#x0201c;concrete effects&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr23-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Best, 2020</xref>: 612). The nexus of circulating ideas and contextual efficacy is&#x02014;and can only be&#x02014;contingent and ultimately political. Few have expressed this more pithily than Milton <xref rid="bibr72-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Friedman (1982</xref>: xx), who in the post-Keynesian climate of the early Reagan years declared that, &#x0201c;Only a crisis&#x02014;actual or perceived&#x02014;produces real change &#x02026; the actions that are taken [will] depend on the ideas that are lying around [once] the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.&#x0201d;</p><p>A defining characteristic of political economies of ideation, it follows, is their engagement with what might be called the &#x0201c;worlding of ideas,&#x0201d; including their construction, circulation, and reception. Beyond a concern with ideas in the abstract, this must encompass the places and fields of practice and translation, political mobilization and contestation, and the wider socioinstitutional and demand-side circumstances within which ideas, models, and interpretative frames acquire (or fail to acquire) salience. The reach of ideational analysis consequently encompasses what <xref rid="bibr23-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Best (2020)</xref> suggestively calls the &#x0201c;practical life of ideas,&#x0201d; tracing the movement and mutation of ideas not only as they travel &#x0201c;downstream&#x0201d; or radiate outward from some supposedly founding text, influential thinker or original source, but also to distill and diagnose their mediated effects &#x0201c;in solution,&#x0201d; in the intersubjective and hybrid worlds of practice, assimilation, mediation, translation, and institutionalization.<sup>

</sup> This approach recognizes that while the so-called power of ideas may derive from their apparent potency or efficacy (as enabling imaginaries and frameworks for social action or as diagnostic and interpretative devices), it may also be a function of their flexibility, indeterminacy, and ambiguity, by virtue of their availability for &#x0201c;localized&#x0201d; customization, expedient repurposing and recontextualization.<sup>

</sup> The power of ideas, in other words, is situational: &#x0201c;powerful&#x0201d; ideas may hail powerful actors or interests, or advance through institutional endorsement, but the powers that they possess (or acquire) only make sense in the (constitutive) context of agentic, social, and institutional relations. As <xref rid="bibr18-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Sheri Berman (2013</xref>: 229) has reflected:<disp-quote><p>the intrinsic attractiveness of any idea probably plays only a limited role in its chances of gaining political acceptance; instead, things such as its ability to attract clever and powerful champions, fitting into existing traditions and modes of thinking, and providing easily understood explanations and solutions to contemporary problems probably play significantly more important roles &#x02026; Studying ideational change, in short, requires an examination of both the demand and the supply side of the equation&#x02013;&#x02013;the creation of political spaces and the emergence of new ideas to fill them&#x02013;&#x02013;and therefore an attention to <italic toggle="yes">both</italic> structural variables and impersonal forces, on the one hand, and case-specific factors and agency, on the other.</p></disp-quote></p><p>The practice of ideational analysis is consequently as much contextual as it is textual, as much socioinstitutional as semiotic.

Again, this is not to invite economism or reductionism, against which there must be ongoing checks. The analytical horizon must encompass, but also transcend, the domains of the intersubjective, the performative, and instituted orders of power/knowledge (see <xref rid="bibr10-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Ban, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Bieler and Morton, 2018</xref>), acknowledging the conditions prevailing in different situations and terrains of struggle, but reaching towards more transformative visions, alternative imaginaries, and counter-hegemonic programs. Predicated on a relational conception of ideation, responses to this mandate resonate with Stuart Hall&#x02019;s doubled-sided reading of articulation&#x02014;as a discursive act, involving expressed attributions of meaning, and as an ontological condition, that of non-necessary connection or dialectical relation. To paraphrase Hall, ideational analysis is &#x0201c;a way of asking how [social ideas] do or do not become articulated, at specific conjunctures&#x0201d; (quoted in <xref rid="bibr78-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Grossberg, 1986</xref>: 53).</p></sec><sec id="sec5-03091325251326790"><title>3 Situating ideas, conjunctural approaches</title><p>&#x0201c;Ideas,&#x0201d; for Stuart Hall, &#x0201c;only become effective if they do, in the end, <italic toggle="yes">connect</italic> with a particular constellation of social forces&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr80-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 1983</xref>: 82, original emphasis).

</sup> This translates into a position of measured skepticism concerning one-sided assertions of the intrinsic or supply-side power of ideas, or analyses otherwise detached or decoupled from the explicit theorization of geohistorical conditions and sociomaterial power relations.</p><p>There is a concern with the reproduction of hegemony here, but not in a rigid or monolithic sense. If hegemonies only exist in persistent states of reconstruction and contestation across moving terrains, situated struggles over socially articulated ideas are integral to this ongoing process. The ideas that achieve traction and influence will tend to exhibit (or establish) degrees of reciprocal congruence with the instituted and materially embedded ordering of power relations (see <xref rid="bibr14-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000e9;land, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Bell, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Bieler and Morton, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Blyth, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr137-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Parsons, 2016</xref>), against which social actors may mobilize, developing disruptive and alternative ideas in the effort to secure countervailing influence. Constructivists have elaborated theories and concepts to account for these movements. <xref rid="bibr51-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Carstensen and Schmidt (2016)</xref>, for example, identify three axes of what they term &#x0201c;ideational power.&#x0201d; Persuasive power, or power <italic toggle="yes">through</italic> ideas, refers to the capacity to project and convert, to enroll others into ideational positions and perspectives on the basis of cognitive validity or normative value, frequently through the manipulation of narratives, symbols, stories, imaginaries, frames, models, and identities. Institutional power, or power <italic toggle="yes">over</italic> ideas, concerns the unevenly distributed capacities to control and dominate how ideas acquire meaning and salience, including the adoption/imposition of favored ideas, the exclusion of alternatives, and the outflanking of obstacles and sources of resistance. And hegemonic power, or power <italic toggle="yes">in</italic> ideas, refers to entrenched forms of common-sense, in which authoritative ideas become institutionalized, normalized, and structured in received thought. In moments of emergence and contestation, these may take the form of &#x0201c;social imaginaries&#x0201d; and prospective visions, allied to particular hegemonic projects (see <xref rid="bibr135-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Moulaert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr171-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Sum and Jessop, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Gathering the preceding arguments, we argue that geographical political economies of ideation should be wedded to explicitly contextualized, conjunctural modes of explanation, situated in worldly terms (see <xref rid="bibr56-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bibr57-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr98-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000e4;ger et al., 2016</xref>). Conjuncturalism, in this respect, is not just a perspective; it is also a position, and a geohistorically situated position at that. After all, it was the breakdown of Keynesianism, modernist projects of development, and the contested rise and uneven consolidation of neoliberalism, along with the proliferation of orthodox globalization discourses, that initially &#x0201c;animated a new generation of constructivist scholarship&#x0201d; in heterodox political economy (<xref rid="bibr1-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Abdelal, 2009</xref>: 66).

</sup> These circumstances were propitious, in retrospect, for the way in which they presented critical, real-time tests for emergent claims concerning policy paradigms, power-knowledge regimes, strategic selectivity, and the rupture and reconstruction of hegemonic projects. It is not that ideas <italic toggle="yes">only</italic> matter in periods or places of crisis, but they will tend in such situations to be more visible and voluble, sometimes more disruptive and decisive.</p><p>Developed in such circumstances, conjunctural approaches to ideation engage ideas in the context of historicized, grounded, and situated readings of political-economic conditions, articulated with (at least) medium-term movements in the uneven development and periodic rupture, crisis, and contestation of social formations. There is less of a concern with categorizing, defining, and bounding particular ideas in their own terms or for their own sake, but instead an insistent and searching (wider-angle) focus on their worldly encounters, purposeful translations, and contested invocations. Much of this will be engaged at the meso-analytical level, and indexed to historical, geographical, and institutional sources of conditioning and specificity, with an emphasis on the constitutive connections between the micro and the macro, the agentic and the structural, rather than privileging one at the expense of the other. This suggests approaches to conjunctural inquiry that gravitate towards politically contested sites and situations, interrogating problem spaces and arcs of crisis management with recourse to conceptual metaphors like regime, paradigm, and (social) formation (<xref rid="bibr57-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr79-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Grossberg, 2019</xref>). The intention here is to grasp (and to ground) the macro as an extended scalar domain across which super-emergent and more-than-local properties are manifest, and where processes of interdependent, uneven, and combined development are registered. This also facilitates one of the objectives of conjunctural inquiry, to explore and problematize part-whole connections in relational and comparative terms, across a diversity of grounded and situated contexts (cf. <xref rid="bibr86-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Hart, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr121-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">McMichael, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bibr126-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Meulbroek 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr140-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Peck, 2023</xref>, <xref rid="bibr141-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6-03091325251326790"><title>III Models and methods</title><p>The preceding discussion marshalled some of the distinctive ontological orientations and epistemological commitments associated with political-economy approaches to &#x0201c;spatialized&#x0201d; ideational analysis. For all of their methodological implications, however, these approaches are neither complete nor discrete. Ideational explanation is more a matter of different strategies of representation, the balance of arguments, and choices made in interpretation than it is about the imposition of binding methodological rules or the hammering out of definitive, once-and-for-all conclusions. Despite the well-known differences between science-studies treatments of &#x0201c;soft realities,&#x0201d; in which the ideational is &#x0201c;practice embedded [and] location dependent&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr107-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Law, 2017</xref>: 43, 40), and the priority that political economists typically place on the structuring role of institutionalized power relations, along with more hard-edged takes on the ideational, we have suggested that it is counterproductive to polarize these approaches, given the opportunities for debate and dialogue across the spaces in between. Indeed, there are reasons to value encounters between competing methodological approaches on the contestable terrain of constructivist explanation.</p><p>In the spirit of such a positive-sum approach to methodological diversity, we now turn to a focused discussion of three monographs&#x02014;Hannah Appel&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">The Licit Life of Capitalism</italic>, Marion Fourcade&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Economists and Societies</italic>, and Quinn Slobodian&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Globalists</italic>. Our criteria for selecting these among many potential candidates are threefold. First, they extend the registers of the ideational, each featuring substantive, contrasting engagements with the grounded spatiality of political-economic ideas in ways that are complementary to, but distinct from, the historical-institutionalist mainstream of the ideas school. Second, in their contributions, respectively, to poststructuralist anthropology, to comparative economic sociology, and to critical intellectual history, these monographs speak to different ways of &#x0201c;doing&#x0201d; ideational analysis, exemplifying different dimensions of what ought to be a diverse and open methodological repertoire. And third, by highlighting various silences, congruences, and touch points with extent or emergent methodological currents in economic geography, they are indicative of some of the different ways in which questions of space, place, and scale, or grounding, worlding, and contextualization, might be taken up in geographical political economies of ideation, beyond the methodological routines of the ideas school. In what follows, we engage each book on its own terms (and terrain), before briefly picking out some cross-cutting themes.</p><sec id="sec7-03091325251326790"><title>1 Ethnographic encounters: Ideas in the wild</title><p>The treatment of economic ideas in science studies and poststructuralist anthropology is notable for the attention afforded to heterogeneous and nonhuman forms of &#x0201c;micropractical&#x0201d; agency, and to the performance and translation of ideas through (actor) networks and ordering frames across spatially or relationally adjacent fields (see <xref rid="bibr10-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Ban, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Bockman and Eyal, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr41-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Callon, 1998</xref>).

This poststructuralist variant of ideational analysis is concerned with the concrete and experiential settings in which shared understandings emerge, how they are constructed through social relations &#x0201c;in place,&#x0201d; and how ideas are (dis)embedded, localized and delocalized through social networks (cf. <xref rid="bibr12-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Barnes, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr153-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Shapin, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr154-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard, 2005</xref>). <xref rid="bibr5-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Appel (2019</xref>: 23) works with and through &#x0201c;the complex entanglements, histories, and multiplicities of daily life&#x0201d; to inquire into how Equatorial Guinea&#x02019;s oil economy comes to be &#x0201c;sublated into something called &#x02018;global capitalism&#x02019;,&#x0201d; the definition and received character of which are understood to be &#x0201c;made&#x0201d; (and locally remade) rather than fixed or given.

Furthermore, received and constructed categories&#x02014;including some of the most taken for granted, such as the &#x0201c;national economy&#x0201d;&#x02014;are seen to flatten and format economic life into statistical representations, in this case (re)producing images of the oil industry as a benevolent engine of growth and development (see also <xref rid="bibr132-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bibr133-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).

These distancing effects are &#x0201c;aspired to and fought for&#x0201d; through a variety of &#x0201c;bodily, affective, and technical practices,&#x0201d; including the mobilization of economic theory: oil company managers invoke resource-curse theory to distance themselves from local politics, while elites used the idea to apportion blame and responsibility for the country&#x02019;s economic condition, pointing to conditions (naturally) associated with the resources themselves, rather than &#x0201c;at the feet of power&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr5-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Appel, 2019</xref>: 23, 221).

The circulation of &#x0201c;ideas about lawlessness,&#x0201d; for example, becomes implicated in justifications for &#x0201c;modular&#x0201d; forms of extractivist capitalism, insulated and gated off from host communities. This is a quite different approach to that of following ideas to (or out from) &#x0201c;truth spots,&#x0201d; linking them to upstream spaces of knowledge production or back to sites of supposed origination.

As an investigation into the (re)production of smoothness, there is some smoothness in this deftly handled ethnographic analysis too. There is less of an explicit concern with the construction of ideas themselves, with their sometimes-disruptive role in wider social struggles, or with contoured or variegated formations of capitalism, in its unevenly developed forms or in competing hegemonic projects. Instead, the concern with abstraction extends to capitalism itself, which is encountered in closely focused and grounded settings, but less often in wider angles.</p><p>Connecting with longstanding geographical debates over the production of space (cf. <xref rid="bibr76-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Goswami, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr157-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard, 2018</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Licit Life</italic> documents how oil companies actively reconstruct understandings of distance and connectivity as they negotiate contradictions between aspirations for the seamless and unimpeded global flow of capital and entanglements with local sites. This reconstruction takes place through practices of distancing and decontextualization, many of which are rendered material (e.g., the creation of spaces like the enclave and the offshore).

Her focus is less on the (competing) positions and theoretical ideas of prominent economists and more with the patterning of ideational cultures within nationally constituted orders, read as coexistent and coevolving styles of economics. Meticulous documentation and detailed description is combined with more boldly drawn distinctions, rendered in broad-brush terms: the United States is shown to possess a meritocratic class of &#x0201c;merchant professionals,&#x0201d; defined by deference to the market; the culture of economics in the UK is shaped by public-minded elites, oriented to establishment power centers; and consistent with the engineering ethos characteristic of French economics, technocratic knowledge is placed in the service of an administrative state.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Economists and Societies</italic> exemplifies a rigorously constructed cross-national research design, one that is relatively rare in geographical political economy but which represents something of a staple of economic sociology and historical institutionalism.

</sup> The very meanings attributed to &#x0201c;the economic,&#x0201d; including what it means to &#x0201c;be&#x0201d; an economist, are themselves matters for probing inquiry and cross-case comparison. Nevertheless, attachment to the national scale of analysis does imply certain trade-offs, privileging some connections, institutions, and relations while marginalizing others. One implication is that the realm of the international is relegated to secondary status (although see <xref rid="bibr62-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Dezalay and Garth, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bibr63-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr70-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Fourcade, 2006</xref>), even as the three national cases are never simply portrayed as independent, self-contained units or simple equivalents. Recognizing these issues, Fourcade approaches her national cases as a mutually referential selection of hierarchically articulated and unevenly ordered fields. For example, in the early years of American economics, there was deference to the ostensibly superior training provided by German universities along with valuation of such &#x0201c;foreign linkages,&#x0201d; while the economics professions of Britain and France are shown to be subject to (uneven and incomplete forms of) &#x0201c;Americanization&#x0201d; after the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century (<xref rid="bibr71-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Fourcade, 2009</xref>: 65, 140, 163). Even in these crossover contexts, however, nationally scaled institutional processes are shown to imprint path-dependent effects on the wider trajectory of &#x0201c;global&#x0201d; economics.</p><p>As <xref rid="bibr128-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Mirowski (2009)</xref> observes, this focus on national comparisons cannot but underplay the changing positions of rival schools of economics <italic toggle="yes">within</italic> national borders (see also <xref rid="bibr92-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Henriksen et al., 2022</xref>).

Moving in the opposite direction, outside-in approaches cut in from the demand side and the historicized present, distilling ideational currents from complex social situations. Conventional intellectual histories tend to favor the first approach: as forward narratives, they characteristically depart from seminal texts, prescient thinkers or formative debates, before venturing downstream from this elevated terrain to the marshy lowlands. In contrast, to recover or excavate ideas from the thickets of particular social institutions, geohistorical moments or the here-and-now is to work in the opposite (upstream) direction.

Here, the Geneva school&#x02019;s slow-burning project of market-protecting constitutionalism takes shape as a dialectical response not to the limits and crises of 1970s Keynesianism, as now-conventional accounts have it, but instead to a much earlier era of historical dislocations: the First World War and the end of empire. The geohistorical arc of neoliberalization itself consequently rendered anew, beginning as a reaction against popular enfranchisement and democratization (insulating markets and property from politicization), before evolving more programmatically in opposition to economic managerialism (and the interventionist conceit that national and global economies are knowable and therefore governable).</p><p>Combining methodological discipline with explanatory ambition, <xref rid="bibr161-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Slobodian (2018b</xref>: 19, 24) concentrates on a &#x0201c;relatively small number of individuals,&#x0201d; a cabal of Geneva-adjacent prime movers, plus an array of second-tier allies and enablers, in the service of a &#x0201c;fairly constrained story&#x0201d; with quite sweeping implications. Anchored in central Europe, but reaching far and wide, this sociologically inflected history involves a close and critical engagement with neoliberal thinkers, theories, and imaginaries.

This said, the Central Europe of the interwar and midcentury years is some distance, temporally and spatially, from what are more conventionally invoked as the &#x0201c;heartlands&#x0201d; of post-1970s neoliberalization (see <xref rid="bibr101-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Jessop, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr164-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Slobodian and Plehwe, 2022</xref>).</p><p>It is axiomatic for <xref rid="bibr161-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Slobodian (2018b</xref>: 34) that &#x0201c;[n]eoliberal thinkers arrived at their ideas in response to the world they saw around them,&#x0201d; in a situational sense, as a matter of worldview, and in terms of future-oriented imaginaries. Here, a pivotal inflection point is an ideational turn engineered by Central European neoliberals, away from projects of statistical representation, the measurement of business cycles, and other schemes of &#x0201c;world observation,&#x0201d; in favor of an almost metaphysical conception of the global economy as &#x0201c;sublime,&#x0201d; ineffable, and &#x0201c;beyond capture&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr161-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Slobodian, 2018b</xref>: 57, 87). This lends itself to an alternative imaginary, &#x0201c;thinking in orders,&#x0201d; which for Slobodian sits at the heart of ordoliberalism. After Carl Schmitt, this was (re)conceived as a &#x0201c;doubled&#x0201d; world, divided between the &#x0201c;dominium&#x0201d; of market dynamics and the &#x0201c;imperium&#x0201d; of territorially demarcated nation states, yielding the advocacy of constitutional measures to restrain and contain politicization while protecting market rule. Slobodian&#x02019;s is a probing analysis of this meta-constructivist program, delivering &#x0201c;not only a genealogy but a feel for [its] institutionalizing imaginary [and] unfolding institutional facticity&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr176-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Weiner, 2023</xref>: 203). In so doing, he ventures further than most from the interior of one of neoliberalism&#x02019;s lesser-known yet projects of germination to the outer reaches of its influence, if less than all of the way into its institutional lifeworlds and social contestations.</p></sec><sec id="sec10-03091325251326790"><title>4 Reading for ideation: Extending methodologies</title><p>Our reading of the preceding three monographs has had to be both limited and somewhat telegraphic. The specific purpose here has been to deploy selective readings of a small but diverse sample of exemplary texts as a means to extend the field of methodological vision-<italic toggle="yes">cum</italic>-practice, beyond the routines of the ideas school and in anticipation of emergent pathways for geographical political economy. The three books each have their own ways of &#x0201c;locating&#x0201d; and then problematizing ideas, according different meanings and explanatory weights to processes and practices of ideation. In Hannah Appel&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Licit Life</italic>, ideas are encountered in their vernacular, grounded, and artefactual forms, sedimented in (often tacit) social practice, courtesy of a method of ethnographic casing that ranges fluidly from the scales of the local and national to the global. This treatment of ideas in solution, rather than in pre-social abstraction, resonates with methodological dispositions in key strands of geographical political economy, by staying close to practices in their diverse, localized, and networked forms, by attending to the performative qualities of models, visionary schemes, and formatting devices, and by tracing distributed forms of (more-than) human agency. While she does not begin with ideas, Appel is keenly attentive to the work that they do, in their everyday forms, with how they fuse with received practices and understandings, and not least, with the ways in which these ongoing projects sustain the idea of capitalism itself.</p><p>If Appel&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Licit Life</italic> models a methodologically disruptive treatment of the taken-for-granted context occupied by corporate capitalism, Marion Fourcade&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Economists and Societies</italic> is disruptive in a quite different way, as a geographically staged, critical counter to the performative monoculture that is economics, in its academic, &#x0201c;applied,&#x0201d; professional, and political forms. If crossover opportunities abound in the methodological trading zone between geographical political economy and Appel&#x02019;s style of poststructuralist ethnography, this is perhaps less obviously true of Fourcade&#x02019;s comparative approach to the sociology of economic knowledge. Fourcade&#x02019;s rigorous and reflexive research design, however, is surely also worthy of emulation in geographical political economy, where an ingrained aversion to methodological nationalism has permitted the neglect of this undeniably consequential scale, as well as missed opportunities to connect with international political economy, economic sociology, heterodox political science, and related institutionalisms. Fourcarde&#x02019;s original blend of field theorizing and &#x0201c;critical organized comparison&#x0201d; calls attention to some of the roads less traveled in political-economic geography, where methodological experimentation on this front continues to lag. Finally, <italic toggle="yes">Economists and Societies</italic> is also distinguished by its deft combination of long-range institutional analysis, archival inquiry, and expert interviews, of which more will surely need to be made if the ambitions for more deeply historicized and comparative approaches to conjunctural analysis are to be realized in geographical political economy.</p><p>One of the interdisciplinary spaces in which geographical political economists can claim a presence is the critical study of neoliberalism. This said, the emergence in recent years of a new genre of critical intellectual histories of neoliberalism has remade this space in ways to which geographers have yet to reciprocate. Slobodian&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Globalists</italic> illustrates the potential of a creative and expansive mode of inside-out analysis, centered in this case on the transnational constitutionalism of the Geneva School, and bringing to earth (competing) projects of globalization. As Adam Tooze has observed, the book offers a critical counter to the Hayekian conceit of &#x0201c;the economy sublime,&#x0201d; as (if) unknowable, deterritorialized, ungovernable, and effectively beyond politics, pointing to the potentially transcendant role of anti-Hayekian historical geographies:<disp-quote><p>To move beyond Hayek, what we need to revive is not simply the idea of economic sovereignty, whether on a national or transnational scale, but his true enemies: the impulse to know, the will to intervene, the freedom to choose not privately but as a political body. An anti-Hayekian history &#x02026; would be one that refuses neoliberalism&#x02019;s deliberately elevated level of discourse and addresses itself instead to what [the] airy talk of orders and constitutions seeks to obscure: namely, the engines both large and small through which social and economic reality is constantly made and remade, its tools of power and knowledge ranging from cost-of-living indicators to carbon budgets, diesel emission tests and school evaluations. It is here that we meet real, actually existing neoliberalism&#x02014;and may perhaps hope to counter it (<xref rid="bibr173-03091325251326790" ref-type="bibr">Tooze 2018</xref>: 136).</p></disp-quote></p><p>This speaks to a remit that is attentive to dialectical processes of historical change, and to the episodic movement of conjunctural formations, but also to their ongoing coproduction and periodic contestation through localized projects, micropractices, and everyday lifeworlds. The methodological move here is once again a disruptive one: to take on and then push beyond the naturalization of neoliberalism in deregulationist discourse and technocratic normalization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec11-03091325251326790"><title>IV Conclusion: Worlding ideas</title><p>The so-called power of economic ideas, we have argued here, cannot be located on the supply-side alone, in original texts, with influential thinkers, or with intrinsic, essentialized capacities of ideas themselves. To the extent that these powers are realized, they are realized unevenly, in situationally specific ways, and through socially mediated interactions and translations. Since ideas are associated with powers, properties, and potentials that are conjunctural and geohistorically specific, rather than mechanical or universal, there is a distinctive and indeed significant mandate for the development of <italic toggle="yes">geographical</italic> political economies of ideation. To problematize ideation as a sociospatial process is consequently to invite inquiries that are necessarily and reflexively context-specific, rather than just incidentally so. Even as they sometimes take on lives of their own, ideas do not speak for themselves. They do not arrive on the scene as self-propelling bolts from the blue. They are coproduced with the institutionally contoured and unevenly developed worlds in which they intervene, and where they are mobilized to explain, narrate, and in some cases transform. They find meaning, gain traction, and acquire salience&#x02014;where they do&#x02014;under certain sociospatial conditions (for instance, in moments or sites of crisis), which is to say that they do so in dialogue, through contestation, and in contexts that are geohistorically contingent.</p><p>This means that the charge to put ideas in their place&#x02014;to trace their mobilization, meanings, and diverse effects in grounded and conjunctural ways&#x02014;is hardly a secondary one, nor merely a supplement to ideas-school approaches. It calls for critical explorations of ideation as a worldly social process, shaped in conjunction with the moving terrains across which geographical political economy is practiced. Departing from a sympathetic engagement with the ideas school, this paper has sought to make a space for geographical political economies of ideation, in conversation with parallel currents in sociology, history, and heterodox political economy. It is perhaps surprising, given the eclectic disposition and ecumenical habits of contemporary economic geography, that there has not been more engagement with economic ideas, the ideas school or the wider research program of historical institutionalism. In opening this dialogue, our intention is not to advocate a wholesale importation of ideas-school perspectives and problematics. Instead, we have sought in a selective way to draw out lessons, insights, and implications from what have been extended and fruitful debates around the role of ideas, big and small, in processes of political-economic transformation, extending to the consideration of different varieties of constructivist methodology and interpretation. We have sought to identify connections and congruences between the axiomatic commitments of geographical political economy and interdisciplinary currents in heterodox political economy, recognizing that there are many conversations yet to be had, and roads yet to be taken. Looking forward, there do not seem to be many obstacles, but plenty of openings and opportunities.</p><p>For its part, the extant literature on the political economy of ideation displays both interdisciplinary range and methodological sophistication, even if its specifically geographical dimensions are seldom prioritized, lurking as background conditions and subtexts, sometimes being marshalled into national differences or network effects. On the other hand, geographical political economists have attended to these issues in suggestive but mostly case-specific ways, having yet to engage in sustained dialogue across approaches and disciplines. Seeking to move beyond this inchoate condition calls for both intermediate theorizing and methodological experimentation&#x02014;preferably in dialogue. To this end, we have developed three cross-cutting arguments. First, there is a need to explore, in dialogue, variants of constructivist method and explication that are worldly but also wary, problematizing ideation as a situated social process. Second, economic ideas should be engaged not as free-floating &#x0201c;things,&#x0201d; but as socially shaped carriers or &#x0201c;compounds,&#x0201d; coproduced with political struggles and programs and subject to ongoing theorization in relation to the uneven spatial development of state power, capitalist transformation, and contested social relations. And third, there are compelling reasons to analyze the always-contextual powers of ideation in conjunctural terms, capitalizing on middle-range or mezzanine-level frameworks and formulations that span the agentic and the institutional, the semiotic and the social, text and context.</p><p>Critical attention is consequently focused on those sites and situations where economic ideas are taken up, articulated, and mobilized in social practice. For geographical political economists, the resulting methodological mandate is anything but singular, as we have illustrated with reference to three especially effective monographs that address the &#x0201c;placing&#x0201d; of economic ideas in quite different ways. These are just some of the methodological pathways that might be followed, however, preferably in ways that are reflexive and dialogic. Experimentation with varieties of constructivism, for example, could work the spaces between &#x0201c;thicker&#x0201d; treatments that emphasize the relatively independent power of ideas, for instance in the performativity approach, and &#x0201c;thinner&#x0201d; alternatives in which ideas become little more than carriers for structurally embedded interests. Rather than just picking a side or splitting the difference, there is an opportunity to mediate between the two, working with the principles and practices of geographical political economy to weave uneven spatial development, embedded knowledge cultures, and entrenched power asymmetries into the analysis.</p><p>These are but some of the ways to explore the worldly geographies of economic ideas. Rather than force a binary choice between the study of ideas from the inside-out or from the outside-in, or between ideas in the abstract and ideas in social context, critical attention should be focused on the mutual interactions between ideas and contexts, their coproduction and articulated relations. Hence the invitation to explore the connections between ideas as concepts and ideas in contexts, between ideas in thought and ideas in practice, between the supposedly esoteric realm of ideation and the social life of ideas, on the street as well as in the corridors of power. The point here is not to drive towards a methodologically correct or complete solution, as if to isolate a source of ultimate determination, but instead to make and contest explanations of the worlding of ideas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This paper was presented at the Honolulu meetings of the American Association of Geographers in April 2024, benefitting from the discussions there.
