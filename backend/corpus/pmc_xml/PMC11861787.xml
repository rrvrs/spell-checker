The suboptimal conditions for imaging under which iMRI is performed extend both acquisition time and reduce image quality. Manually placed surface coils prohibit fast parallel imaging through generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions or sensitivity encoding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] that otherwise accelerates brain MRI. The use of iMRI has increased the duration of surgery from 20&#x02009;min to 60&#x02009;min depending on the imaging protocol and surgical setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, the images are more prone to noise distant from the coil elements, unlike those acquired using conventional head coils. Since its advent, one of the main strides in iMRI has been the improvement of image quality, ranging from low to high-field scanner configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recent reports highlight the need voiced by surgeons for improved iMR image quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">To address prolonged scan times, compressed sense (CS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] may be adopted in iMRI. Still, substantial undersampling leads to image artifacts, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lower resolution, and potentially non-diagnostic or poor-quality images where the surgically accessible tumor is not identified. A promising alternative is the utilization of deep learning (DL) for reconstruction, aiming to accelerate MRI and enhance quality through denoising and super-resolution strategies. Key to its success is training DL networks on relevant MRI data that is representative of the foreseen imaging setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Initial prospective studies on knee, spine, and brain images have demonstrated that DL networks were able to generalize anatomy and pathology beyond their training scope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further evidence is needed to warrant deploying DL networks in the highly variable iMRI setting.</p><p id="Par20">In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate: (i) the generalizability of DL-based reconstruction on on-scanner accelerated iMRI during tumor resection surgery after being trained on conventional neuro MRI; and (ii) whether DL-based reconstruction can generate high-resolution iMR images with improved diagnostic quality compared to the currently used protocol and ease the detection of tumor residuals. We adopted the densely interconnected residual cascading network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and trained the network on the fastMRI neuro dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with pairs of fully sampled and retrospectively downsampled images, adjusted to match the clinical protocols&#x02019; downsampling scheme.

The model was qualitatively evaluated and compared to the CS reconstructions by three expert readers on a cohort of 40 patients who underwent iMRI. DL was found to reconstruct iMRI with significantly better image quality compared to CS for two of the three readers. Notably, the neuroradiologists (readers 1 and 2) favored overall DL over CS to a larger extent than the neurosurgeon (reader 3). Reader 3 assessed that the CS reconstruction had improved image quality compared to the DL equivalent. The difference in image quality assessment reflects the subjective nature of the interpretation. Further, iMRI is different from conventional MRI diagnostics in that radiologists rarely review these images whereas they are a central part of the neurosurgeon&#x02019;s intraoperative assessment of the extent of tumor resection. In discussing the results with the expert reviewers, it was noted that the focus of the neurosurgeon was mainly on the extent of resection, whereas the radiologist focused more on image quality and diagnostic quality in the area of interest.</p><p id="Par42">iMRI requires specialized operating and scanning equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], relying on the use of flexible surface coils to adjust to the required head position dictated by the tumor location. The required coil setup typically results in low SNR in areas distant from the target tumor region. This is partially compensated for by the coil sensitivity maps used in the CS reconstruction, but not the DL variants. As such, the low SNR artifact was particularly visible in the DL images, as pointed out by reader 3. The low intensity coupled with the two-dimensional nature of the reconstruction gave rise to pronounced striping artifacts in some cases with DL reconstruction. It is worth noting that most of these artifacts occurred outside the resection area of interest due to the coil placement. The use of three-dimensional reconstruction could potentially reduce or completely remove the striping artifact and the rarely seen slice-wise noise since the network would not be dependent on slice-wise variability. Despite the artifacts, the DL model showcased high-quality reconstruction and super-resolution, and all reviewers commented that the DL reconstructed images were in general of good or acceptable quality. Further improvements should focus on reducing the striping artifact and improving the signal intensity in the low-intensity regions caused by the iMRI imaging setting.</p><p id="Par43">Importantly, DL-specific artifacts were rare, but in some cases worrisome when brain regions close to the area of resection had low signal as can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> which highlights three cases with worrisome DL-related artifacts. Note, the artifact in the first case stems from the bias-field correction. The two remaining cases had reduced signal in the area of resection in one or more of the scans taken. Upon close inspection of the raw non-reconstructed images, it was seen that the affected scans either had a high degree of noise or a very low signal in the affected area. Although the artifacts were a rare occurrence, it is important to be addressed as they can impact surgical decision-making.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Three cases highlighted by the neurosurgeon where the DL reconstructions had considerable artifacts and were evaluated as nondiagnostic or poor by the neurosurgeon compared to the compressed sensing (CS) counterpart. For the two last patients, the artifacts affected the area of resection for one or more of the scans. The first patient, <italic>i.e.</italic>, columns 1 and 2 did not have a T1-weighed post-contrast series</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41747_2024_548_Fig6_HTML" id="d33e905"/></fig></p><p id="Par44">The majority of works in DL-based reconstruction of MRI have focused on retrospectively downsampled data. Recent studies have demonstrated that DL can successfully be adapted to on-scanner downsampled data, particularly in contexts with relatively normal pathology and scanner configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This study aims to validate the generalizability of DL reconstruction of highly non-conventional brain images.</p><p id="Par45">Except for imaging artifacts, DL reconstruction significantly outperformed the CS reconstruction on all assessment metrics by both readers 1 and 2. In addition, since the fastMRI dataset was imaged exclusively on Siemens scanners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], this study implies that DL models exhibit generalizability across vendors and scanner setups even on an unordinary scanner setup that is iMRI. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect that further improvements could be made if the training dataset better represented the characteristics in the iMRI data with similar coil elements, data from the same vendor, and similar FOV. We opted to use both the 1.5-T and 3-T fastMRI data to better encompass different image characteristics to allow for improved generalizability although the iMRI data was acquired on a 3-T scanner.</p><p id="Par46">A concern of iMRI is the increased procedure time and risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. DL-based reconstruction methods have shown promise to decrease the total scan time by 45% and 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] over traditional acceleration methods on standardized imaging setups. Nonetheless, due to the challenging iMRI imaging setup, this study aimed to determine whether DL reconstruction could improve image quality and successfully adapt to the iMRI imaging setup and showed promising results by two of the three readers. Improved image quality could further help the neurosurgeon to distinguish between residual tumors, artifacts, and contrast leakage from the surgical cavity. Incidentally, this was the major concern raised by reader 3. Based on the results of this study, we believe DL-based reconstruction in iMRI could lead to easier-to-interpret images, however, further studies are needed to validate this since the number of studies that focus on DL reconstruction for iMRI is limited.</p><p id="Par47">The findings in this study should be interpreted with multiple limitations in mind. First, the study included a relatively limited patient cohort size of 40 patients from a single site. Additional patients from multiple sites would need to further validate the generalizability of the model. Second, the DL reconstructions were only compared to their respective CS reconstruction, and not the ground truth in a quantitative analysis. Acquiring fully sampled ground truth images in an iMRI setting would be very time-consuming and therefore not feasible for ethical reasons and the clinically used CS-based accelerated reconstruction was therefore considered the best standard of comparison. Third, the number of MRI sequences per patient varied, so each scoring is not for the same number of sequences. We opted for this method of assessment since an expert reader would evaluate the case &#x0201c;as a whole&#x0201d; with all scans. Fourth, although the readers were blinded, and the DL/CS scans were randomized per patient; it is feasible to accurately guess which is which by an expert reader due to the general imaging characteristics of the different reconstruction methods. Lastly, additional neurosurgeon readers would further strengthen the findings of this study, potentially affect the conclusion, and help quantify the difference in opinion between the readers.</p><p id="Par48">Future work could explore the effect of a further increase in acceleration factor. Here, we opted against retrospectively downsampling the on-scanner downsample data to simulate further acceleration as we wanted the study to solely focus on on-scanner undersampled data. To properly evaluate the potential gains from the improved image quality, a &#x0201c;during surgery&#x0201d; evaluation would strengthen the findings in this study. Additional focus should be placed on the evaluation of the extent of resection and quantizing differences in tumor residuals.</p><p id="Par49">In conclusion, DL-based iMRI reconstruction allows for high-quality reconstructions of on-scanner undersampled iMRI. The neuroradiologists favored the DL reconstruction over the CS counterpart, while the neurosurgeon favored the CS reconstruction. Further work is needed to account for low coil sensitivity distant from the area of resection and alleviate the striping artifact seen from the two-dimensional nature of the reconstruction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
