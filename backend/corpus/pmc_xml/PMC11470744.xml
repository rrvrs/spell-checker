</xref> there is limited information regarding the impact of these advanced programs on changes in colonoscopy quality. Therefore, we aimed to examine the changes in colonoscopy performance among trainees during our advanced endoscopy training program.</p></sec><sec id="deo270027-sec-0060"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="deo270027-sec-0070"><title>Study population and data collection</title><p>We conducted a retrospective analysis of colonoscopies performed by all 11 trainees who participated in an advanced endoscopy training program at the National Cancer Center Hospital East between April 2015 and March 2020; four attending endoscopists supervised the training. To assess the changes in colonoscopy quality and efficiency at different training levels, we included screening or surveillance colonoscopies performed by trainees in their first six months of first year, and second 6 months of second and third year, as well as those performed by attending endoscopists. The exclusion criteria of cases for assessment were as follows: (1) prior colorectal surgery, (2) a history of chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, (3) colonoscopy for preoperative evaluation of advanced cancer, (4) polyposis cases such as familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome, and (5) colonoscopies with overall poor preparation rated more than &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; on the Aronchick bowel preparation scale. Details regarding the colonoscopies excluded by these criteria are shown in Table <xref rid="deo270027-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. Data on insertion and withdrawal times, success of cecal intubation, number of resected colorectal lesions, and their clinicopathological characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records.</p></sec><sec id="deo270027-sec-0080"><title>Advanced endoscopy training program</title><p>Since 2013, our department has been offering a 3&#x02010;year training program specializing in advanced diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy in the gastrointestinal field (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270027-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In Japan, trainees usually complete a general gastroenterology fellowship program during their first 2&#x02013;4 years as gastroenterologists. During this time, they encounter simple colonoscopy cases and perform basic endoscopic procedures such as biopsy and polypectomy. Our program was developed for endoscopists who have completed their general gastroenterology fellowship. Although we have not created a strict definition of fellowship completion, we recommend that trainees should apply to our program after completing at least 2&#x02013;3 years of a general gastroenterology fellowship. For colonoscopy procedures, the final goal is to acquire expertise in effective insertion technique, independently conduct polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection based on the appropriate diagnosis using magnifying endoscopy, and perform advanced therapeutic procedures such as ESD, dilatation, and stent insertion. In our program, first&#x02010; and second&#x02010;year trainees perform colonoscopies under the supervision of attending endoscopists and receive verbal instructions and technical support as needed. Additionally, by performing colonoscopies alongside attending endoscopists in the same endoscopic room, trainees can closely observe the procedures performed and practice them immediately. Third&#x02010;year trainees independently perform colonoscopies and can seek support from attending endoscopists when necessary. In the first year of training, prior to performing a colonoscopy, trainees learn about the insertion method using the axis&#x02010;keeping shortening technique through lectures led by attending endoscopists and hands&#x02010;on practice with the Colonoscope Training Model (Kyoto Kagaku Co., Ltd.). Moreover, through lectures and regular weekly conferences held throughout the year, trainees learn how to detect lesions, perform magnifying observations using image&#x02010;enhancing endoscopes, and make qualitative and quantitative diagnoses based on endoscopic findings in actual cases. The educational features of our program are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270027-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="deo270027-tbl-0001" content-type="TABLE"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Features of our training program.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

All patients underwent standard bowel preparation using either a polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution or oral sodium phosphate. Before the examination, butylscopolamine or glucagon was injected intravenously as an antispasmodic medication. We used analgesics, such as meperidine and midazolam, only upon the patient's request or in patients who experienced severe pain in their previous endoscopies.</p><p>For colonic intubation, the axis&#x02010;keeping shortening technique was initially attempted in all cases.<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> We had an agreement that if a patient complained of severe pain during insertion or if it took longer than 10 min, especially during sigmoid colon insertion, the trainee was replaced by an attending endoscopist. Cecal intubation was performed for screening and surveillance in all cases. Even in cases where trainees were substituted by an attending during insertion, the trainees completed the endoscopy at the time of removal. When a polyp was detected, the endoscopists recorded its location, morphology, and size prior to resection. Location was defined as the proximal colon when polyps were present in the cecum, ascending colon, or transverse colon. For any detected lesion, we decided on a treatment plan after a qualitative diagnosis of the lesion using magnifying endoscopic or chromoendoscopic observation. We followed a general policy for resecting all suspected adenomatous lesions during all colonoscopies. Resection and discard strategies were not implemented in any procedure.</p></sec><sec id="deo270027-sec-0100"><title>Outcome definitions</title><p>We evaluated the insertion time and cecal intubation rate to gauge the proficiency of the insertion technique, and adenoma detection rate (ADR), proximal ADR, and mean number of adenomas per patient (MAP) as indices of the ability to identify and diagnose neoplastic lesions. Polypectomy efficiency (PE) was assessed as an indicator of procedural efficiency during colonoscopy.<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> We compared outcomes for each of these indicators annually and those of the attending endoscopists.</p><p>Insertion time was the time to reach the cecum from scope insertion. Cecal intubation rate was the percentage of colonoscopies reaching the cecum independently. ADR and proximal ADR were percentages of colonoscopies detecting at least one adenoma or cancer in the total and proximal colon. MAP was the average number of lesions detected per colonoscopy. PE was calculated as (polyps resected/withdrawal time) &#x000d7; 100, indicating procedure efficiency rather than diagnostic competence. Insertion times were primarily obtained from the endoscopy reports. When the insertion time was not documented in the report, we referred to the endoscopic images, which often included a timer that indicated when the insertion process was started. However, because of the retrospective nature of the study, the insertion time could not be determined for 215 (15%) cases. Cases with missing data regarding the insertion time were excluded from the insertion time analysis and PE analysis.</p></sec><sec id="deo270027-sec-0110"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We employed the student's <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>&#x02010;test for continuous variables and the chi&#x02010;squared test or Fisher's exact probability test for categorical variables.

We evaluated previously reported quality measures of colonoscopy, such as insertion time, ADR, MAP, and PE, a measure of procedural efficiency, over consecutive years. We found that our advanced endoscopic training program significantly improved these measures with each passing year, especially the insertion time, PE, and MAP in surveillance colonoscopy. The stratified analysis revealed significant improvements in insertion time and PE among trainees with prior experience of &#x0003c;500 colonoscopies during their fellowship. This study underscores the effectiveness of our advanced endoscopy training program in improving the quality and efficiency of colonoscopy over time for post&#x02010;fellowship trainees, particularly those with fewer than 500 colonoscopy experiences.</p><p>Guidelines in each country stipulate the requisite number of colonoscopies to achieve sufficient proficiency during a fellowship. For example, in the United States, 140 colonoscopies are recommended, while in the United Kingdom, 200 colonoscopies are recommended.<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>17</sup>
</xref> However, these target numbers, calculated based on the cecal intubation rate as an indicator, do not necessarily guarantee trainee proficiency. Consequently, it has been proposed that competence standards should be established, considering all aspects of colonoscopy: insertion, detection, and treatment. In fact, data from South Korea indicate that a minimum of 500 cases is required to be able to independently perform colonoscopy insertion, treatment, and hemostasis in more than 90% of the cases, highlighting the need for continuous advanced training even after fellowship completion.</p><p>Several aspects of our advanced endoscopy fellowship program, offered since 2015, are worth mentioning. First, trainees enter the program with a strong foundation in essential endoscopic skills, especially the fundamental insertion technique. Second, during the first and second years of training, the trainees conduct examinations under the supervision of an attending physician. This environment empowers trainees to learn from these experienced practitioners on a one&#x02010;on&#x02010;one basis and promptly put their learning into practice. Although there have been numerous reports on the improvements in ESD and other treatment skills among trainees participating in advanced endoscopy fellowships.<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>11</sup>
</xref> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the changes in colonoscopy competence. We believe that evaluating the progression of trainee skills over time in our advanced fellowship program will aid not only in designing similar endoscopy programs in the future but also in assessing the long&#x02010;term learning curve from novice to expert.</p><p>Our study showed a trend toward year&#x02010;to&#x02010;year improvements across all metrics of insertion, lesion detection, and procedural efficiency. Improvement in the insertion time was particularly significant, with an average insertion time of 7 min in the third year. This suggests the efficacy of the insertion method employed, known as the axis&#x02010;keeping shortening technique.<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> This technique enables a shorter insertion time but requires a sufficient number of years of training to master fully. Although trainees exhibited improvement, they still fell short of the proficiency levels of the attendings, implying that additional training time may be required for them to attain full proficiency in insertion. Improvement in PE, particularly pronounced during the third year, may be attributed to trainees gaining proficiency by performing several procedures with varying degrees of difficulty. The majority of post&#x02010;treatment surveillance and high&#x02010;risk screening colonoscopies at our cancer center contributed to the high ADR (47%) observed in first&#x02010;year trainees. Despite the overall improvement over time, the lack of significant differences may be because of the distinctive characteristics of these cases, and the fact that the proportion of surveillance colonoscopies with a high risk of detecting iatrogenic lesions was greater with the first&#x02010; and second&#x02010;year trainees than with the third&#x02010;year trainees.<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> Moreover, the improvement in MAP over time and the sub&#x02010;analysis of surveillance colonoscopy showed significant improvements, suggesting that our advanced fellowship is effective in enhancing competency to detect lesions. In the sub&#x02010;analysis based on the number of colonoscopies performed prior to beginning the advanced fellowship, the improvement in PE was observed only among trainees with &#x0003c;500 colonoscopy experiences. This result is similar to that of a previous report that calculated the number of cases required to achieve total colonoscopy competence,<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> suggesting that approximately 500 cases are required to attain proficiency in lesion detection and polypectomy procedures.<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>18</sup>
</xref> This study's findings suggest that long&#x02010;term training is necessary for trainees to become independent endoscopists in colonoscopy.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, it was a retrospective observational study and the uneven distribution of colonoscopy indications over the years may have influenced the evaluation of these indicators. Additionally, one&#x02010;on&#x02010;one instruction was enforced only during the first and second years, we could not entirely exclude the possibility that the absence of one&#x02010;on&#x02010;one instruction during the third year may have contributed to an apparent improvement in PE. Second, differences in scope, light source, and extraction modality were not considered. The factors that can significantly impact insertion time and treatment efficiency,<xref rid="deo270027-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>20</sup>
</xref>; their impact on outcomes could not be evaluated. Third, assessing whether the observed improvement in trainees' skills in this study was attributable to the program itself or to individual growth over time remains a complex task.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that trainees after completing a general fellowship have shown improvements in their ability to perform higher&#x02010;quality colonoscopies under our advanced endoscopy fellowship.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270027-sec-0190"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>Author Hiroaki Ikematsu is an associate editor of DEN Open.
