<bold>Purpose:</bold> Previous studies have demonstrated that many healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack the appropriate training and knowledge to recognize and diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. As a result, women in LMICs are frequently diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer (Stage III/IV) with a poor prognosis.</p><p>
<bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We hosted a 1-day breast cancer educational conference directed towards healthcare workers in Honduras. We conducted pre- and postcourse (1&#x02013;2 months later) assessments that evaluated knowledge of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer specialists at the University of Minnesota and Honduras developed a 12-question assessment tool in Spanish.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> A total of 157 people attended the course, and 86 completed the precourse knowledge assessment. The overall percentage of correct responses was 70% in the precourse assessment. Postcourse knowledge assessments were completed by 94 participants. The overall percentage of correct responses was 80% in the postcourse assessment and was significantly higher than precourse assessment scores (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer globally and is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Breast cancer deaths disproportionately affect women living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the majority of deaths occur in women younger than 70 years old [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In most LMICs, breast cancer is diagnosed at a late stage (Stage III/IV), when treatment is generally less effective, more expensive, and more disabling [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Late-stage diagnosis markedly reduces survival, and treatment is both difficult and resource-intensive.</p><p>Substantial delays of months or more than a year from the onset of initial breast symptoms to the initiation of breast cancer treatment contribute to late-stage diagnosis and elevated mortality rates in LMICs. The greatest delays to breast cancer diagnosis in LMICs are not attributable to patients delaying care but rather occur after the first medical consultation has taken place [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Even when a patient seeks care soon after the onset of symptoms, this does not always translate to early diagnosis and treatment. If the first or subsequent providers do not have the appropriate training or knowledge to recognize early breast cancer and do not know where or how to refer for necessary diagnostic intervention(s), diagnostic delay will result. Previous studies have demonstrated that many healthcare workers in LMICs lack such skills [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Effective implementation of early cancer diagnosis programs should include community-based education, with cancer awareness and training, and subsequent deployment of healthcare workers. Successful planning and implementation of such programs, along with robust monitoring and evaluation, are necessary to effectively downstage breast cancer and ultimately improve mortality rates in LMICs.</p><p>Honduras is an LMIC with a population of approximately 10 million, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer recently reported that breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer for Honduran women [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Half of the population of Honduras lives in rural and remote areas, with most of these individuals living in poverty [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In one study, approximately 60% of rural breast cancer patients in Honduras were diagnosed with an advanced-stage cancer (Stages IIb&#x02013;IV) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We hosted a 1-day breast cancer educational conference directed towards healthcare workers in Honduras. We conducted pre- and postcourse assessments that evaluated knowledge of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer. Our objective was to determine if an educational intervention could improve breast cancer knowledge among healthcare workers in Honduras.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><p>Breast cancer specialists from the University of Minnesota and Honduras organized a 1-day, in-person breast cancer educational course in Honduras in March 2023 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The conference organizers from the University of Minnesota and One World Surgery Honduras sent emails and letters to primary healthcare workers throughout Honduras. We targeted primary care physicians and nurses who see women in Honduras with breast cancer. Most participants were invited through nonprofit organizations/foundations including One World Surgery Honduras, Centro de Cancer Emma Romero de Callejas, Liga Contra El Cancer Honduras, and Sociedad Hondure&#x000f1;a de Oncologia. The trainers included radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, and medical oncologists from Honduras and the University of Minnesota. Our primary course objectives were to train healthcare workers to recognize the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and to emphasize the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment. The format included lectures, hands-on demonstrations, and tumor boards. Topics included breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Lectures that were presented in English were translated into Spanish in real time.</p><p>This study was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board. Informed consent for the study was obtained for all research participants. The course participants were informed that their involvement in the study was voluntary and that they could continue with the course without participation in the research study. We created a 12-question assessment tool in Spanish that evaluated knowledge of breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The assessment tool was developed by breast cancer specialists at the University of Minnesota and Honduras and utilized multiple choice and true/false questions. The questions were piloted for content and clarity and tested by 20 people from the United States and Honduras who were not study participants. <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table"> Table 1</xref> lists examples of questions in each domain, and the Appendix contains the entire assessment tool. The average time to complete the knowledge assessment was 8&#x02013;10&#x02009;min. The precourse knowledge assessment was administered online and onsite just prior to the start of the course. All the precourse questionnaires were administered in person at the course. Most were submitted electronically, while a few were submitted in paper form because of limited internet access by some participants. We found no differences between the paper and electronic baseline scores. One month after the course, we contacted the participants to complete the postcourse knowledge assessment online. Nonresponders were contacted 2 weeks later and then weekly for a total of 4 weeks. All postcourse knowledge assessments were completed 1&#x02013;2 months after the course and were submitted online. Pre- and postcourse scores for the entire assessment tool and for each domain of screening, diagnosis, and treatment were compared by linear regression. We also collected demographic data of the course participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>A total of 157 people attended the course, and 86 completed the precourse knowledge assessment. The median age of the participants was 30 years; 49% had previously undertaken some breast cancer educational activity; 54% worked primarily in a hospital setting; and 40% were physicians (<xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The overall percentage of correct responses was 70% in the precourse assessment (<xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Employment status (clinic vs. hospital), age, and prior educational activities were not significantly associated with initial baseline knowledge assessment scores (coefficients <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> were 3.84 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.87], 9.65 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.86], and 4.52 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.72], respectively).</p><p>Specific questions that had less than 70% correct responses were as follows:

The overall percentage of correct responses was 80% in the postcourse assessment and was significantly higher than precourse assessment scores (<xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For the individual domains of screening, diagnosis, and treatment, the postcourse knowledge assessment scores were significantly improved as compared with the precourse scores. Age and prior educational activities were not significantly associated with knowledge assessment postcourse scores (coefficients <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> were 0.59 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.22] and 0.66 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.15]); however, employment status (clinic) was associated with increased score <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> 1.35 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Specific questions that persistently had less than 70% correct responses in the postcourse assessment were as follows:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02022; Frequency of breast screening</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022; Management of breast erythema</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022; Estrogen receptor testing</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that a 1-day, in-person breast cancer educational course directed towards healthcare workers in Honduras resulted in improved breast cancer knowledge assessment scores 1&#x02013;2 months later. We found significant improvement in overall scores as well as in screening, diagnosis, and treatment domains. In the postcourse assessment, we found continued knowledge deficits in the frequency of breast screening, management of breast erythema, and estrogen receptor testing.</p><p>A substantial proportion of women with breast cancer in LMICs are diagnosed at a late stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage III or IV), ranging from 30% to 50% in Latin America to 75% in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Patients with breast cancer in LMICs often experience significant delays to diagnosis and treatment even after they present to the healthcare system. The Breast Health Global Initiative recommends that the diagnostic interval that includes clinical evaluation, imaging, and biopsy be completed within 60 days [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Survival outcomes are worse if this interval is longer than 3 months [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Yet, few LMICs achieve a diagnostic interval within 60 days [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Early detection requires that trained healthcare workers recognize the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and understand the impact of delays. Previous studies have demonstrated that many healthcare workers in LMICs lack such skills. In a study from Cameron, Nguefack et al. reported that less than half of the healthcare professionals had good knowledge of breast cancer [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Botswana, many healthcare workers at local clinics did not recognize cancer symptoms and misdiagnosed women as having other common health problems such as sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a study of healthcare workers from Nigeria, only 49% of physicians believed that breast cancer could not be cured with herbal or alternative therapies, and 42% thought that breast cancer could completely disappear with prayer [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There have been no previous publications evaluating breast cancer knowledge or skills of healthcare workers in Honduras. One of the objectives of this study was to determine the baseline knowledge level of healthcare workers in Honduras. At the precourse knowledge assessment, 70% of the responses were correct. Perhaps these individuals who decided to attend a breast cancer conference already had an interest and baseline level of knowledge of breast cancer and are not representative of healthcare workers in Honduras.</p><p>Implementation of programs that focus on training healthcare workers may decrease rates of late-stage breast cancer. Sarawak General Hospital in Malaysia instituted an educational program that included training 400 healthcare workers in early diagnosis techniques including clinical breast examination [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Four years after implementation, the proportion of Stage III/IV breast cancer was reduced from 60% to 35%. These results were accomplished without screening mammography. In two Mexican states, Keating et al. reported that competency-based breast cancer education improved the knowledge of community healthcare workers about breast cancer risk factors, signs and symptoms, screening, and treatment [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, Rehman et al. reported that an educational intervention improved health professionals' knowledge about breast cancer risk, presentation, and screening in Pakistan [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Pace et al. conducted a breast cancer training program for community healthcare workers in Rwanda that focused on recognizing signs and symptoms of breast cancer, clinical breast evaluation, and navigation; the educational intervention resulted in a higher proportion of early-stage breast cancer [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A Cochrane analysis of four randomized clinical trials (two in India, one in Rwanda [cited above], and one in the Philippines) evaluated the effectiveness of training healthcare workers in clinical breast examination in LMICs; the authors concluded that training healthcare workers in clinical breast examination may provide some benefit to early detection [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations to this study. The postcourse assessment was completed between 1 and 2 months after the course; it is not clear if breast cancer knowledge will be retained for a longer duration. The follow-up knowledge assessment was completed outside the course venue, so participants could have used the internet or other sources to improve their test scores (&#x0201c;open book&#x0201d; examination). Additionally, the healthcare workers who participated in this course may not be representative of all healthcare workers in Honduras. Finally, improved breast cancer knowledge may not translate into earlier diagnosis and treatment. Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates that in at least one LMIC, breast cancer knowledge among healthcare workers can be improved with a 1-day educational course.</p><p>In summary, we found that a 1-day educational course improved breast cancer knowledge among healthcare workers in Honduras. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an intervention that improved breast cancer knowledge in Central America. We think that the differences in knowledge scores are clinically meaningful, but the actual proof will be if such educational activities result in meaningful decreases in advanced-stage breast cancer. The persistence of knowledge deficits on the postcourse assessment may highlight the need for multiple educational interventions over time. Future research and implementation strategies will include training healthcare workers throughout Honduras and determining the impact of these educational interventions on the late-stage presentation of breast cancer.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app><title>Appendix A: Conferencia Cancer De Mama</title><p>March 11, 2023</p><p>Knowledge assessment (% correct precourse/% correct postcourse)
