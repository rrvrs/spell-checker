The health consequences of this nutrition transition are not well understood. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in the Kilimanjaro region in Northern Tanzania to investigate the immune and metabolic effects of switching between Kilimanjaro heritage-style and Western-style diets for 2 weeks and consuming a traditional fermented banana beverage (&#x02018;Mbege&#x02019;) for 1 week. Seventy-seven young and healthy volunteers assigned male at birth, some living in urban areas and some living in rural areas, were recruited in the trial. Primary outcomes were changes in the immune and metabolic profile before and after the intervention and at the 4-week follow-up. The switch from heritage-style to Western-style diet affected different metabolic pathways associated with noncommunicable diseases and promoted a pro-inflammatory state with impaired whole-blood cytokine responses to microbial stimulation. In contrast, the switch from Western-style to heritage-style diet or consuming the fermented beverage had a largely anti-inflammatory effect. Some of the observed changes in the immune and metabolic profiles persisted at the follow-up, suggesting a sustained impact from the short-term intervention. These findings show the metabolic and immune effects of dietary transitions and the consumption of fermented beverages, underscoring the importance of preserving indigenous dietary practices to mitigate noncommunicable disease risk factors in sub-Saharan Africa.

Urban adult mortality rates now exceed rural rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, largely because of lifestyle changes, including the adoption of calorie-dense Western diets (WDs). Africa has a rich diversity of heritage diets, often rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains and fermented products.

Urban residents, with greater exposure to WD environments, exhibited a stronger pro-inflammatory profile than those living in rural areas. Most rural dwellers in the study were from the Chagga tribe, whose heritage diet is predominantly plant-based, rich in fiber and polyphenols, and includes &#x02018;Mbege&#x02019;, a fermented banana beverage made with finger millet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Therefore, we performed an open-label, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the short-term and long-term immunometabolic effects of a short dietary intervention in young Tanzanian men from rural and urban backgrounds. The study investigated the effects of switching from a Western-style diet to a Kilimanjaro heritage diet and vice versa, and the effects of consuming the fermented beverage &#x02018;Mbege&#x02019;. Changes in circulating leukocyte profiles, the inflammatory and cardiometabolic proteome, whole-blood cytokine responses and transcriptome, and plasma metabolome were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention and 4 weeks later.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participant characteristics and dietary recall</title><p id="Par6">Seventy-seven healthy adult men (median age&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.6 years; interquartile range (IQR)&#x02009;=&#x02009;21&#x02013;27.2) participated in an open-label, short dietary intervention with 4-week follow-up to assess its longer-term immunometabolic effects.

Preserving the consumption of heritage diets or incorporating indigenous and traditional foods into dietary practices could have a critical role in preventing and managing NCDs. However, Africa&#x02019;s diverse heritage diets are largely understudied, and the field of nutritional immunology in this context is still emerging. Policymakers often rely on findings from the Global North, which do not account for regional dietary, cultural and genetic differences. Our study provides direct evidence of the health risks of dietary westernization and the benefits of heritage diets and indigenous beverages, emphasizing the need for further research to explore their health impacts before they are lost to globalization, ensuring culturally appropriate and sustainable public health solutions.</p><p id="Par41">Our study also has a few limitations.

Second, the dietary intervention was short, although similar or even shorter interventions have demonstrated important immune effects. For example, a 2-week intervention with a vegan or ketogenic diet induced marked immune and gut microbiome changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, while a 5-day fiber-poor diet was sufficient to alter host responses in both mice and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our controlled setting established a baseline for short-term dietary responses in African environments, laying the foundation for future research on long-term effects. Third, our study included only men because of cultural logistics and confounding variables. Future studies should include women and diverse age groups. Fourth, the sample size is relatively small, although it is comparable to other multiomics dietary studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Sample size calculations were based on functional immune responses rather than multiomics data, given the challenges in defining meaningful effect sizes for large, complex multiomics datasets. The homogeneous study population and the largely consistent direction of inflammatory and metabolic changes in the intervention groups, reduce the likelihood that our findings are due to chance.

Lastly, while the Chagga tribe&#x02019;s plant-rich and fiber-rich diet aligns with healthy dietary practices, Tanzania has over 100 tribes with varied diets.

In the fermented beverage arm, participants were directed to consume at least 1&#x02009;l of the beverage daily between 16:00 to 17:00 while maintaining their usual diet. The beverage, produced fresh daily by one local manufacturer, was dispensed at a central location in Moshi town and intake was supervised. Intake of this fermented beverage was restricted in the other groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline, after the intervention (2 weeks for the dietary switch, 1 week for the fermented banana beverage), and 4 weeks thereafter for the follow-up.

Because of the absence of recorded portion sizes, macronutrient contributions to energy intake were calculated per 100&#x02009;g of food and adjusted based on typical daily intake, assuming standard portion sizes. In the WD, carbohydrates contributed approximately 55% of total energy, primarily from refined sources such as refined maize flour (used for making stiff porridge, &#x02018;ugali&#x02019;), pancakes, potato chips, white rice, macaroni and fried plantains. Fats accounted for 23% of total energy, mainly from fried foods like fried chicken, beef, potato chips, &#x02018;chips mayai&#x02019; (a local dish combining potato chips and eggs) and pancakes. Protein contributed 16% of total energy, with chicken, beef and eggs as the primary sources. Simple sugars and dietary fiber contributed 2.2% and 3.5% of total energy, respectively. In contrast, the Kilimanjaro AHD provided 60% of total energy from carbohydrates, mainly derived from whole grains, roots and tubers, such as taro and boiled sweet potatoes. Protein contributed 11% of total energy, primarily from meat, local free-range chicken and fish.

Comprehensive validation details for the assay can be accessed on the Olink website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.olink.com/">https://www.olink.com</ext-link>). All samples were measured in a single run in the same batch. Proteins with values below the limit of detection in more than 25% of subsequent samples were excluded. This resulted in the removal of 22 proteins, leaving 162 out of 184 proteins for further analysis. Most of these proteins had values below the limit of detection in almost all samples. Quality control measures and outlier detection were performed, revealing no significant batch effects or outliers attributable to technical issues. Additionally, control participants from both urban and rural groups exhibited consistent overall proteomic profiles, suggesting minimal batch-related bias. PCA was conducted using the prcomp function (stats v.3.6.2) on scaled NPX values or scaled NPX values corrected for participants (removeBatchEffect function, limma package v.3.50.3).

TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Globin (Illumina) was used to convert total RNA into double-stranded complementary DNA molecule libraries.
