However, as of 2024, WPV1 remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since 2000, outbreaks of circulating virus derived of polio vaccines (cVDPVs) have emerged in multiple regions, primary driven by low vaccine coverage rates (VCRs). The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine immunization, resulting in millions of unvaccinated children, and leaving many countries vulnerable to both WPV1 and cVDPVs outbreaks.

Two of these WPVs were globally eradicated: WPV2 since 2012, and WPV3 since 2019 [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2024, only WPV1 persists in two endemic countries, but outbreaks caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPVs) have been reported since 2000, the year initially proposed for global polio eradication [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The success in reducing by more than 99.9% the number of AFP cases caused by WPV involved massive vaccination campaigns with the trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV), which is composed of live attenuated polio strains&#x02014;Sabin 1, 2, and 3 [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In 1994, the American region was declared free of WPV by the WHO [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but in 2000 the first outbreak caused by cVDPV1 was detected in this region [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Before 2000, few countries had adopted the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in their routine immunization (RI) schedules. The majority were European countries [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where rare cases of AFP caused by polio were recorded, mainly in unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated individuals, and WPV1 was the most frequent strain [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Most countries adopted tOPV on the basis of its ease of administration, its low cost, its robust immunogenicity, and its capacity to induce intestinal mucosal immunity (IMI), which helps reduce poliovirus shedding in breakthrough infections [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Sabin vaccine is considered one of the safer vaccines, but Sabin live virus strains are genetically unstable, and in rare occasions they can mutate and reacquire neurovirulence. As a result, OPV can cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in recipients or contacts of recipients. The risk is higher after the first dose, in communities with low vaccine coverage rates (VCRs), and among immunocompromised individuals. These revertant strains named vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) can cause paralysis, with indistinguishable clinical signs and severity from those caused by WPV [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>VDPVs are classified in three categories: cVDPVs (circulating), when there is evidence of transmission (more than one case), iVPVD, when the infections are confirmed in immunocompromised individuals, and aVDPV (ambiguous) that can represent the initial isolates from cVDPV outbreaks, samples isolated from individuals without documented immunodeficiencies or that are environmental samples, with no evidence of community circulation [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Low VCRs are the most important factor associated with the emergence and circulation of these new pathogenic strains [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>At the onset of the 21st century, Canada and the USA replaced tOPV by IPV, considering that the number of VAPP cases outnumbered those caused by WPV, and these countries changed tOPV to IPV. The IPV vaccine is highly immunogenic, safer, and more effective than OPV to prevent polio, but it induces low IMI. After 2000, as outbreaks caused by cVDPVs emerged in all WHO regions [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], high-income countries (HICs), where high VCRs were achieved with three doses of tOPV [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], progressively included IPV in their national immunization programs (NIPs) [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Initially, IPV was included in NIPs concomitantly with DPT-based whole-cell or acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPw or DTPa). As the acellular pertussis vaccine quickly proved amendable to be combined with IPV, DTPa combination vaccines including IPV and other antigens were developed and introduced into RI. HICs adopted acellular pertussis vaccines in combination with IPV earlier, while low-income countries (LICs) and middle-income countries (MICs) continued using OPV and combination vaccines with DTPw [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nowadays, HICs use pentavalent or hexavalent combination vaccines formulated with IPV and aP, while most LICs and MICs still rely on pentavalent vaccines containing whole cell pertussis vaccines and the separate administration of at least one dose of IPV and more than two OPV doses [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The GPEI strategy recommended for global polio eradication focused on tOPV until 2016. The amazing success in eradicating WPV2 and WPV3 in four of the six WHO regions&#x02014;the Americas (1994), the Western Pacific (2000), Europe (2002), and Southeast Asia (2014), associated with the fact that OPV induces IMI and the rare occurrence of VAPP cases before 2015, were the main reasons invoked to maintain the use of tOPV in RI. Between 2004 and 2009, monovalent oral polio vaccines (mOPV) were also used during specific outbreaks [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite this success, even in areas declared polio-free, many AFP cases were associated with the continued use of OPV [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This was especially the case in areas with low VCR, where cVDPV2 caused the majority of outbreaks [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Polioviruses are highly infectious [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the WHO recommends a minimum of 90% of VCR with three doses of OPV in the first year of life to achieve global polio eradication [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2018, the global VCR was 84%, but with large variations between different countries and regions of the same country [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Polio Epidemiology After the COVID-19 Pandemic</title><p>Since 2019, WPV1 is the only WPV still in circulation, but the number of AFP cases and outbreaks caused by VDPVs is a cause of concern [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The minimum number of AFP cases caused by WPV1 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was 22, in 2017. In 2019 and 2020, an increase in AFP cases caused by WPV1 was observed, with 176 and 140 cases, respectively. Most of these cases were notified in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but nine children and adolescents outside these endemic countries developed AFP caused by WPV1 in 2021 and 2022: one in Malawi (November 2021) and eight in Mozambique (2022) [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Extensive national and subnational campaigns of immunization were conducted in these countries and in neighboring countries (Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) to avoid WPV1 spreading in the region. No new AFP or detection of WPV1 through environmental surveillance (ES) was registered in these countries after 2022, and they were not considered as endemic countries [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In 2024, the WHO considers only Pakistan and Afghanistan as endemic countries, i.e., countries where the transmission of indigenous wild poliovirus never stopped. Thanks to the work of the WHO and many partners (UNICEF, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance) to increase VCR in endemic and recent outbreak countries, including numerous and extensive campaigns of immunization, the number of APF cases caused by WPV1 was reduced to only six, in 2021. Yet this is no reason to let the guard down, as in 2024, this number is more than five times higher, with 62 AFP cases caused by WPV1 confirmed in Afghanistan (23) and Pakistan (39) as of 22 October 2024 compared with 12 AFP cases in 2023 (full year) [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite the success of maintaining a geographically limited circulation of WPV, the number of countries that previously stopped indigenous WPV but are experiencing either the importation of WPV or VDPVs from other countries or the local emergence of cVDPVs has grown since 2016.</p><p>In 2016, there were 37 AFP cases caused by WPV1 and five caused by cVDPVs. In 2017, the number of AFP cases caused by cVDPV2 (96) surpassed the number of AFP cases caused by WPV1 (22), reaching a peak in 2020 (1082), affecting 24 countries (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01323-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>There was a reduction in the number of AFP cases caused by cVDPV2 over the last 4 years, but new countries have been infected, reaching a total of 51 countries with detection of cVDPV2. In 2024, cVDPV2 strains were detected only through environmental surveillance in 13 countries (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01323-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In 2023, the WHO reported 12 AFP cases caused by WPV1 and 527 AFP cases caused by cVDPVs. From 1 January to 22 October 2024, 62 AFP cases caused by WPV1 were confirmed and cVDPV2 persists as the predominant strain detected through AFP surveillance and having caused paralysis in 182 individuals from 16 countries, including one case in Gaza confirmed on 25 July 2024 [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01323-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In the last four years, outbreaks caused by cVDPV1 were registered in six countries: Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, and Mozambique. Despite the substantial reduction in these numbers, as recently as 25 September 2024, cVDPV1 was still circulating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (five AFP cases) and Mozambique (one APF case); additionally, one AFP case caused by cVDPV3 was confirmed in Israel in 2022 [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3-vaccines-12-01323"><title>3. Strategies Recommended by the WHO for Polio Eradication</title><p>The GPEI strategies to achieve polio eradication changed many times over the years. From 1988 to 2005, the WHO recommended the exclusive use of tOPV in routine and immunization campaigns. Monovalent OPV vaccines (mOPV) became the vaccines of choice for supplemental immunization campaigns between 2005 and 2009 in polio-endemic or polio-epidemic countries. Indeed, the single-strain vaccine can help avoid the issue of the immunological interference between the three Sabin strains, especially with Sabin-2, the most immunogenic [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The massive use of mOPV1 (mOPV) resulted in the virtual elimination of WPV1 in India. Bivalent OPV containing Sabin strains 1 and 3 (bOPV1,3) has superior immunogenicity against polio 1 and 3 as compared with tOPV, without loss of immunogenicity as compared with mOPV1 and mOPV3, and was also largely used after WPV2 global eradication [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In 2012, with the dramatic reduction in WPV and eradication of WPV2, the WHO started to recommend the introduction of one dose of IPV to prepare for the post-eradication era. In that year, an IPV based on Sabin strains (sIPV) started to be used in Asia (Japan in 2012 and China in 2015) [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The WHO considers that these vaccines are as immunogenic and safe as IPV manufactured from WPV. HICs adopted a full IPV schedule before 2015, preferentially in combination with other vaccines, but most of the MIC and LIC persisted using tOPV and mOPVs until 2016. That year, with the declaration of the eradication of WPV2, the WHO recommended the substitution of tOPV by bOPV1,3 and one IPV dose [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The limitation in the supply of IPV, and a delay in the introduction of this vaccine in the poorest countries, resulted in a substantial gap of protection against polio 2, the most likely cause of the emergence of several cVDPV2 outbreaks in more than 40 countries.

[<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] estimated that 59% (95% CI 9&#x02013;77%) of susceptible individuals (primarily children under 10 years old) had been infected with WPV1 over a little more than six months, mostly before the vaccination campaign&#x02019;s onset, and that the vaccination campaign had averted 10% (95% CI 1&#x02013;24%) of WPV1 infections.</p><p>Many mathematical models have estimated the risks of the emergence of new VDPV strains, especially cVDPV2 and cVDPV1 in areas with extremely low VCR [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Recent publications showed that the introduction of at least one dose of IPV in addition to mOPV or bOPVs can contribute substantially to protect against polio [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite the low impact on intestinal immunity, IPV is highly immunogenic in higher-, middle-, and lower-income countries [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Children immunized with IPV can be infected by WPV or VDPVs without developing symptoms; these strains can multiply in the gastrointestinal tract and the silent circulation will put at risk people with incomplete protection, whether they live in high-, middle-, or low-income countries. The same can occur when OPV is used in areas where OPV has low VCRs or have demonstrated low efficacy because of the interference of other enteroviruses [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Devaux et al. (2024) affirmed that the intestinal microbiota can contribute to increasing poliovirus infection, replication, recombination, and transmission. There is evidence that the exposure to bacteria, and especially to lipopolysaccharides, is a potent enhancer of poliovirus infectivity. They also suggested that some bacterial strains increase co-infections by different polioviruses, promoting genetic recombination between different viruses. In LICs, these new aspects related to infection can make the use of IPV more favorable [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The viral shedding after the first OPV dose is high, peaking 2 weeks after vaccination, and is null after IPV. In areas with low VCRs, the use of OPV has been responsible for VPDV emergence and cVDPVs outbreaks. Inactivated strains cannot replicate and never cause VAPP or give origin to VDPVs.</p><p>Connor et al. (2002), in a review of mucosal immunity against poliovirus, showed that intestinal immunity after oral polio vaccines wanes over time to undetectable levels 1 to 4 years after the primary schedule with OPV. It is not observed also in adolescents and adults, probably because of an age-related defect in enteric mucosal immunity to poliovirus. Older children, adolescents, and adults immunized with OPV more than 1 year before can shed live polio strains for more than 2 months upon challenge. This new knowledge can impact the strategies proposed for the final phase of polio eradication [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>To solve the problems associated with low seroconversion after immunization with Sabin vaccines, new genetically attenuated live vaccines have been developed over the last decade. The nOPV2 was used since 2021 in epidemic countries, and it was expected that it could reduce the risks of VAPP and VDPV emergences. In fact, it was proven that nOPV2 was 80% less likely to seed new-variant polio outbreaks. However, a lower risk for mutation is different from zero risk, and recently it was confirmed that nOPV2 can also cause paralysis [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

In this trial, the seroprevalence against polioviruses type 1 (59.6%) and type 3 (53.0%) was also extremely low, despite the large use of bOPV(1,3) [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>A recent case-control study performed in Nigeria showed that nOPV2 had low effectiveness to protect against cVDPV2, even after two doses. On the contrary, the IPV demonstrated higher effectiveness and efficacy [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Despite the large use of nOPV2 in Nigeria, and the reduction of AFP cases caused by cVDPV2 from 2021 to 2024, &#x0003e;40% of cVDPV2 AFP cases confirmed in 2024 (49 of 117) were from this country [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>A new cause for concern about nOPV2 was the detection of strains derived from this vaccine in countries that never used it. In South Sudan, a new emergence of cVDPV2 strains was detected with whole-genome sequencing (WGS), indicating that the origin of the virus was the novel OPV2, although the vaccine has never been used in the country [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the Russian Federation, VDPV2 strains detected in migrant children from Tajikistan [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and in Gaza, cVDPV2 detected through ES were both genetically related to nOPV2 vaccine strains used in Egypt [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The other relevant point to discuss is the duration of protection offered by OPVs and IPVs. In the past, the circulation of wild poliovirus could provide a natural booster, but large outbreaks involving adolescents and adults demonstrated that it is not possible to guarantee this natural protection [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Gao et al. (2022), in a meta-analysis about the duration of protection after vaccines, reported only eight papers discussing polio duration of protection post-OPV or -IPV, and the majority were focused on combined vaccines containing IPV. The studies with available prevaccination records suggested that the geometric medium titers and geometric medium concentration of antibodies (GMT/GMC) remained around three times higher than prevaccination levels for all three poliovirus types at 5&#x02013;6 years postvaccination, but only one article reporting results for 10 years postvaccination was included in this meta-analysis. There were no data about the duration of protection offered by OPV in LICs/MICs in the absence of poliovirus circulation and campaigns with OPV [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A study performed in Italy showed a long duration of protection with both OPV and IPV, but Italy is a HIC, where OPV has higher immunogenicity as compared with MICs/LICs [<xref rid="B44-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>A cross-sectional study for poliovirus seroprevalence performed in Guangdong, China, carried out in 2014 (before the change in the polio vaccine in 2015), including 6339 people, showed that the seropositivities for PV1, PV2, and PV3 were 95.2%, 94.9%, and 88.7%, and the respective GMTs were 82.9, 55.8, and 26.3, respectively. The highest seropositivity and GMT were observed in the 1&#x02013;9-year-old age group. However, similarly to other seroprevalence studies, lower immunogenicity was observed for PV3 [<xref rid="B45-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Another study conducted in Chongqing, China tested 636 people for poliovirus neutralizing antibodies. The overall seroprevalence rates for PV1, PV2, and PV3 were 93.40%, 96.38%, and 91.82%, and GMTs were 61.14, 66.78, and 21.47, respectively. GMTs were negatively associated with age in the geographic districts with poor economic conditions, which will increase the risk of the emergence of VDPVs after a polio vaccine switch. More than one dose of IPV should be introduced into the polio vaccine schedule, and the supplementary immunization of polio should still be annually carried out after the polio vaccine switch, especially among older children and adults [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In the DRC, an outbreak was caused by WPV1 in 2010, affecting 16% of adults. It is now one of the countries with the largest number of AFP cases caused by cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. A study assessing poliovirus seroprevalence in 5526 adults aged 15&#x02013;59 years was performed in this country in 2013&#x02013;2014. The results showed that 74%, 72%, and 57% of adults were seropositive for neutralizing antibodies for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These results show that adults can be at risk also for cVDPVs [<xref rid="B47-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Two doses of full-dose IPV can elicit more than 90% protection against polio, but HICs adopted three or more doses to ensure long-lasting protection, and all trials that estimated the duration of protection included a preschool IPV dose [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. IPV can boost the immunity to polio 1 and 3 after bOPV1,3, but two IPV doses can be insufficient to ensure a long duration of protection against polio 2. In countries that use fIPV, despite the good seroconversion after two doses, the antibody titers are lower as compared with full IPV, and there is no study confirming the long-term protection offered by this vaccine [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Plannings for the End of the Game and Post-Eradication Era</title><p>In the last decade we learned that we should consider not only the advantages and disadvantages of each type of vaccine, but also other factors, like logistics, acceptance, supply, regulatory challenges involving clinical trials and time for approval, and the industrial capacity to supply the new vaccines to LMICs [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B48-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Considering that WPV1 and cVDPVs were not eradicated until the middle of 2024, a new plan for polio eradication will be proposed by the GPEI, and the best strategies for this phase are debated [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B48-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The strategy proposed by the GPEI to eradicate polio assumes that the route of transmission of WPV and cVDPVs is feco-oral, but this hypothesis remains controversial, and recent evidence based on the transmission of cVDPVs showed that there is a higher possibility that the route is mostly respiratory rather than only feco-oral, which is one more factor to support the exclusive use of IPV [<xref rid="B51-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>There is no doubt that only IPV can eradicate both WPV and cVDPVs [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Combination vaccines containing IPV and three (DPT) or more antigens (Hib, HepB) have been extensively used in HICs, and in some MICs, showing an excellent safety profile, improving timely vaccination, and leading to higher VCRs for many serious diseases. China and Japan adopted an IPV based on Sabin strains, approved since 2012, and a few LMICs adopted an fIPV, which cannot be combined with other antigens. The biggest challenge persists in the poorest countries, exactly where VCRs are low, OPVs induce lower seroconversion, intestinal infections are frequent, and there is recurrent civil unrest, conflicts, and natural disasters that have dramatic impacts on public services [<xref rid="B52-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The lack of access to medical services, combined with the destruction of the already weak infrastructure (water, sewage, distribution of food and medicines), have been responsible for population displacements. The great number of migrants from regions where oral vaccines are still used and the travelers to these countries, including military, healthcare professionals, and volunteers, can contribute to the importation of polioviruses into areas considered polio-free [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B43-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B49-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>The WHO considers that there is a sufficient supply of IPV (including fIPV and Sabin IPV), but the estimation was made for only two doses. If a transition to the exclusive use of an IPV or at least more than two doses of an IPV is expected, close coordination with manufacturers should be engaged to account for the time required to ramp up production and deliver sufficient capacity. Additionally, it is fundamental to consider that many people older than 5 years were not protected, and catching up will be necessary for non-immunized children, adolescents, and adults, increasing the need for an IPV supply [<xref rid="B56-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>There are some new vaccines in development proposed to finish polio eradication. Among the candidates, those produced with live strains (including nOPV1, nOPV3, and nOPV1,3) can pose the same challenges as recently discovered with nOPV2 (transmission, a low but confirmed risk of mutation, and the possibility to cause paralysis). The S19-IPV vaccine, now on phase I of clinical development, is formulated with the S19 virus&#x02014;a hyper-attenuated, genetically stabilized strain that cannot replicate at human body temperature and has been highly restricted in its potential to revert to a neurovirulent form during the manufacturing process. It is impossible to know if this strain could recombine with other Sabin strains or enterovirus in the case of an escape from manufacturing sites [<xref rid="B50-vaccines-12-01323" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>The VLP vaccine is also a promise, not a reality. There are substantial regulatory challenges for its approval. It will not be possible to demonstrate its efficacy/effectiveness against WPV and VDPVs. It will be difficult to prove if it will induce intestinal immunity and if it can be combined with other antigens. The clinical development plan to have pentavalent or hexavalent combinations with new vaccines requires time and funding that could be better invested in combination vaccines containing IPV that are already available and have confirmed efficacy/effectiveness against polio and other diseases, like diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hib, and Hepatitis B, for which the burden and case fatality rates are higher in the poorest countries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-12-01323"><title>5.
