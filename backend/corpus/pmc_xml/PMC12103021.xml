LL-37 drives Th17 differentiation, and Th17 cells produce IL-17A and IL-17F which form the biologically active heterodimer IL-17A/F. While IL-17 is a critical mediator of neutrophilic airway inflammation, LL-37 exhibits contradictory functions; LL-37 can both promote and mitigate neutrophil recruitment depending on the inflammatory milieu. The impact of LL-37 on IL-17-induced responses in the context of airway inflammation remains largely unknown. Therefore, we examined signaling intermediates and downstream responses mediated by the interplay of IL-17A/F and LL-37 in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). As LL-37 can become citrullinated during airway inflammation, we also examined LL-37-mediated downstream responses compared to that with citrullinated LL-37 (citLL-37) in HBEC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Using an aptamer-based proteomics approach, we identified proteins that are altered in response to IL-17A/F in HBEC. Proteins enhanced in response to IL-17A/F were primarily neutrophil chemoattractants, including chemokines and proteins associated with neutrophil migration such as lipocalin-2 (LCN-2). We showed that selective depletion of LCN-2 mitigates neutrophil migration, functionally demonstrating LCN-2 as a critical neutrophil chemoattractant. We further demonstrated that LL-37 and citLL-37 selectively suppress IL-17A/F-induced LCN-2 abundance in HBEC. Mechanistic studies revealed that LL-37 and citLL-37 suppresses IL-17&#x000a0;A/F-mediated enhancement of C/EBP&#x003b2;, a transcription factor required for LCN-2 production. In contrast, LL-37 and citLL-37 enhance the abundance of ribonuclease Regnase-1, which is a negative regulator of IL-17 and LCN-2 in HBEC. In an animal model of allergen-challenged airway inflammation with elevated IL-17A/F and neutrophil elastase in the lungs, we demonstrated that CRAMP (mouse orthologue of LL-37) negatively correlates with LCN-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Overall, our findings showed that LL-37 and citLL-37 can selectively suppress the abundance of IL-17A/F-mediated LCN-2, a protein that is critical for neutrophil migration in HBEC. These results suggest that LL-37, and its modified citrullinated form, have the potential to negatively regulate IL-17-mediated neutrophil migration during airway inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that the immunomodulatory function of LL-37 enhances the RNA binding protein Regnase-1, suggesting that a post-transcriptional mechanism of action is mediated by the peptide.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12950-025-00446-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>LL-37</kwd><kwd>IL-17</kwd><kwd>Lung</kwd><kwd>Lipocalin-2</kwd><kwd>Regnase-1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2020-06599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mookherjee</surname><given-names>Neeloffer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Cationic Host Defence Peptides (CHDP), also known as antimicrobial peptides, exhibit a wide range of immunity-related functions and selectively regulate inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. CHDP LL-37 is the only cathelicidin peptide expressed in humans. LL-37 influences immune responses in a highly complex manner, with at least 16 direct interacting protein partners, and alters the expression of over 900 genes with more than a thousand secondary effector proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. LL-37 selectively regulates pathogen- and cytokine-driven inflammation, with mechanisms dependent on the inflammatory environment, the tissue, and cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is known that LL-37 levels are altered in chronic inflammatory diseases of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The pro-form of LL-37, hCAP-18, is released from neutrophils by degranulation and LL-37 is found in NETs (neutrophil extracellular trap) during airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that LL-37 can drive the differentiation of T-helper (Th) cells to Th17 cells in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Th17 cells produce cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F, and the heterodimer IL-17A/F is a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in neutrophilic airway inflammation during respiratory disease such as severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although both LL-37 and IL-17A/F are elevated in the lungs in airway inflammation, these do not mediate similar effects on neutrophil recruitment and activation. While IL-17 promotes neutrophilic airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the role of LL-37 remains controversial. LL-37 can facilitate the recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs to resolve pulmonary infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and in contrast, can limit neutrophil migration and activation in acute lung injury models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The peptide by itself can facilitate neutrophil recruitment and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but under inflammatory conditions LL-37 suppresses chemokines that facilitate neutrophil migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To that end, the impact of LL-37 on IL-17-mediated downstream inflammatory responses and neutrophil recruitment in the lungs remains unresolved.</p><p id="Par5">IL-17A/F targets the IL-17RA/RC receptor complex expressed solely by structural cells such as human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), to enhance neutrophil infiltration to the lungs via the production of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As a recent study has shown that LL-37 can selectively alter IL-17-mediated pro-inflammatory metabolic and immune responses in structural cells such as synoviocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we examined the impact of LL-37 on IL-17A/F-mediated responses in HBEC.</p><p id="Par6">Recent studies have shown that the arginine residues of LL-37 get citrullinated by peptidyl arginine deiminase (enzymes enhanced during inflammation), and citrullinated LL-37 (citLL-37) is found in the NETs during airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Both LL-37 and citLL-37 are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the human lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Limited studies demonstrate that citrullination of LL-37 impairs it&#x02019;s antimicrobial functions and alters some immunomodulatory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we also compared the effects of citLL-37 along with LL-37, in the presence and absence of IL-17A/F, in HBEC.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we used an aptamer-based proteomics array to define proteins altered by IL-17A/F in HBEC. We showed that LL-37 and citLL-37 selectively suppress IL-17A/F-induced Lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) and that the depletion of LCN-2 mitigates neutrophil migration. We also showed that the mouse cathelicidin peptide CRAMP (mouse orthologue of LL-37) negatively correlates with LCN-2 and neutrophil elastase (NE) in an IL-17-driven mouse model of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the results of this study demonstrated that LL-37 suppresses IL-17A/F-mediated C/EBP&#x003b2;, a transcription factor required for LCN-2 production, and in contrast enhances the endoribonuclease Regnase-1 which is an inhibitor of IL-17 and LCN-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that LL-37-mediated immunomodulation engages post-transcriptional mechanisms by enhancing the RNA binding protein Reganse-1. Overall, our findings suggest that LL-37 has the potential to selectively limit neutrophilia via the suppression of IL-17&#x000a0;A/F-induced LCN-2 production in airway inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents</title><p id="Par8">Peptides LL-37 and sLL-37 were manufactured by CPC Scientific (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and citLL-37 was obtained from Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden).

This is corroborated by previous studies demonstrating that LCN-2 facilitates neutrophil activation and migration with mechanisms that engage the cell surface receptor 24p3R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, the interplay of LCN-2 with other IL-17-induced chemokines such as Gro&#x003b1; and IL-8, in facilitating neutrophilia within the complex inflammatory environment in the lungs, warrants further investigation.</p><p id="Par42">Interestingly, LCN-2 also functions as an antimicrobial protein in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Here, we show that an antimicrobial host defence peptide LL-37 can suppress the abundance of another antimicrobial protein LCN-2 secreted from bronchial epithelial cells. This suggests that cathelicidin peptides such as LL-37 have the potential to influence the expression and/or activity of other antimicrobial peptides and proteins in the lungs. This opens a new avenue of research to examine how the network of various antimicrobial host defence peptides is altered by cathelicidins during airway inflammation.</p><p id="Par43">Change in the abundance of cathelicidin peptides such as LL-37 seems to be dependent on the kinetic and type of airway inflammation, including that with neutrophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, the effect of LL-37 on neutrophils remains confounding; LL-37 can promote internalization of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 on neutrophils and suppress neutrophil chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In contrast, LL-37 has also been shown to directly enhance neutrophil recruitment by activating the formyl peptide receptor 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. It was previously suggested that LL-37 can enhance GRO&#x003b1; in human PBMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], which results in the enhanced recruitment of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, our results show that despite the presence of GRO&#x003b1; in TC supernatants obtained from HBEC stimulated with IL-17A/F, selectively depleting LCN-2 significantly suppresses neutrophil migration. This is corroborated by previous studies demonstrating that LCN-2 can enhance neutrophil migration in chronic inflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Neutrophils are a dominant source of cathelicidins in chronic inflammatory lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. There is a concomitant increase in LL-37 with markers of neutrophil degranulation and NET formation such as NE and extracellular DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is aligned with our in vivo results demonstrating a concurrent increase in CRAMP (mouse orthologue of LL-37) and NE, along with IL-17A/F and LCN-2 in the lungs, in a mouse model of allergen-mediated airway inflammation. Furthermore, our in vivo results demonstrating that LCN-2 positively correlates with NE, but negatively with CRAMP, suggest that cathelicidin peptides may elicit a negative-feedback loop to limit IL-17A/F-induced downstream inflammation in the lungs. It is likely that the regulation of IL-17A/F-mediated downstream processes by cathelicidin peptides is dynamic and may be dependent on the kinetics of response. For example, it has been shown that cathelicidins can potentiate IL-17A/F-producing Th17 cells in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that LL-37 could drive neutrophil accumulation in the lung during the initiation phase of inflammation, and in contrast, the peptide has the potential to limit neutrophil infiltration in the later stages of inflammation by intervening in IL-17-mediated LCN-2 production from bronchial epithelial cells.</p><p id="Par44">Our findings indicate that the mechanistic underpinnings of the regulation of IL-17A/F-induced downstream responses by LL-37 engage the RBP Regnase-1, which degrades mRNA of targets within the IL-17 signaling pathway and inhibits LCN-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This is aligned with previous studies demonstrating that the immunomodulatory functions of LL-37 involve the peptide&#x02019;s direct interaction with GAPDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and that GAPDH moonlights as an RBP to facilitate the degradation of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA and downstream inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Our results demonstrating that LL-37 enhances the RBP Regnase-1 indicate a post-transcriptional mechanism related to LL-37&#x02019;s ability to selectively alter the IL-17A/F-mediated downstream response. The role of LL-37 in regulating inflammation and engaging post-transcriptional machinery is a new area of investigation.</p><p id="Par45">It is known that enzymes PADI2- and PADI4-dependent citrullination of LL-37 occurs in the human lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and that PADI4 activation increases in IL-17-driven neutrophilic airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Citrullination of LL-37 impairs the ability of the peptide to limit pathogen or endotoxin-mediated inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, we show that both LL-37 and citLL-37 significantly suppress IL-17A/F-induced LCN-2 abundance and enhances the RBP Regnase-1. This is corroborated by our recent study demonstrating the citrullination of LL-37 does not mitigate the peptide&#x02019;s ability to suppress TNF&#x003b1;-induced matrix metalloproteinases in HBECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that citrullination does not impair all immunomodulatory functions of LL-37. However, we show that citrullination of the peptide selectively alters some LL-37-mediated functions; LL-37, but not citLL37, enhances the IL-17&#x000a0;A/F-mediated increase in <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> mRNA abundance. I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b6; (encoded by <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> mRNA) is known to control IL-17A-mediated induction of GRO&#x003b1; and CCL20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the differential activity of LL-37 and citLL-37 on IL-17A/F-mediated GRO&#x003b1; and CCL20 production may be due to the loss of the peptide&#x02019;s ability to enhance I&#x003ba;B&#x003b6; mRNA abundance following citrullination. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that citrullination of LL-37 perhaps leads to the selective loss of classical pro-inflammatory NF-&#x003ba;B signal transduction without altering the increase in Regnase-1, which is an anti-inflammatory mediator. Thus, it may be that citrullination of LL-37 is a mechanism to facilitate immune homeostasis by selectively limiting the peptide&#x02019;s &#x02018;pro-inflammatory&#x02019; functions. Taken together, our results indicate that even though LL-37 may be citrullinated within the IL-17-driven neutrophilic inflammatory milieu, it retains the peptide&#x02019;s ability to enhance Regnase-1 and suppress LCN-2, thus maintaining LL-37&#x02019;s potential to dampen neutrophil infiltration in the lungs.</p><p id="Par46">A limitation of this study is a lack of direct in vivo evidence to support our findings that LL-37 controls neutrophilic airway inflammation by suppressing LCN-2. This is challenging, as neutrophil recruitment and activation is mitigated in a cathelicidin knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], thus making it difficult to directly assess the role of cathelicidin in IL-17-driven neutrophilic airway inflammation in vivo. Another limitation is a relatively small sample size in some of the in vitro experiments, although we provide a statistically significant dataset. Moreover, we have used various complementary approaches to confirm and validate the findings presented in this study. It is a challenge with CHDP to find a true negative peptide for in vitro studies, as scrambled peptides with the same charge and size can sometimes exhibit off-target effects. Similarly, in this study the scrambled peptide sLL-37 elicited some responses like LL-37 in HBEC, albeit quantitatively different. Although the central focus of this study was to compare the effects of LL-37 and citLL-37, we provide all data with sLL-37 as it represents valuable information for researchers using sLL-37 as a paired negative control for defining the biological activities of LL-37. Nevertheless, the results in vivo support our in vitro findings and establish the potential role of LL-37 and citLL-37 in selectively limiting IL-17-driven LCN-2 in bronchial epithelial cells. Overall, the findings in this study indicate the potential of cathelicidin peptides to limit neutrophilic airway inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">The findings of this study provide a comprehensive insight into the interplay of LL-37 and IL-17A/F and are relevant to the immunobiology of respiratory disease such as severe asthma and COPD that are characterized by airway inflammation with neutrophilia. Our findings indicate that an IL-17A/F-mediated increase in LCN-2 may be a central driver of neutrophil migration in the lungs. Our results suggest that cathelicidins such as LL-37 have the potential to act as a negative regulator of neutrophil influx to the lungs, which may be mediated by selectively suppressing LCN-2 in bronchial epithelial cells. Findings reported in this study support the rationale to examine cathelicidin-derived peptides as interventions to target IL-17-driven neutrophilic airway inflammation for chronic respiratory diseases such as severe asthma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>
