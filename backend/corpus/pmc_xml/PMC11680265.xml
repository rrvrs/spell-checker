In this study, with the contribution of 15 independent laboratories across all WHO regions, we carried out a controlled analysis of neutralisation assay platforms using the first WHO International Standard for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (source: NIBSC). Live virus isolates (source: WHO BioHub or individual labs) or spike plasmids (individual labs) for pseudovirus production were used to perform neutralisation assays using the same serum panels. When comparing fold drops, excellent data consistency was observed across the labs using common reagents, including between pseudovirus and live virus neutralisation assays (RMSD of data from mean fold drop was 0.59). Utilising a Bayesian model, geometric mean titres and assay titre magnitudes (offsets) can describe the data efficiently. Titre magnitudes were seen to vary largely even for labs within the same assay group. We have observed that overall, live Microneutralisation assays tend to have the lowest titres, whereas Pseudovirus Neutralisation have the highest (with a mean difference of 3.2 log2 units between the two). These findings are relevant for laboratory networks, such as the WHO Coronavirus Laboratory Network (CoViNet), that seek to support a global surveillance system for evolution and antigenic characterisation of variants to support monitoring of population immunity and vaccine composition policy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neutralisation</kwd><kwd>antigenicity</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Bayesian model</kwd><kwd>global surveillance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</funding-source><funding-source>Global Immunology and Immune Sequencing for Epidemic Response (GIISER)</funding-source><award-id>INV-030570</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Innovation and National Research Foundation of South Africa</funding-source><award-id>98341</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>SA Medical Research Council Strategic Health and Innovation Partnerships (SHIP) program</funding-source><funding-source>European Union&#x02019;s Europe Research and Innovation Programme</funding-source><award-id>101046041</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Theme-based Research Scheme of the Research Grants Council of HKSAR</funding-source><award-id>#T11-705/21-N</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Swiss National Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>310030B_201278</award-id><award-id>31CA30_196644</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Fondation Ancrage Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet, the Fondation Priv&#x000e9;e des H&#x000f4;pitaux Universitaires de Gen&#x000e8;ve and Swiss National Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>196644</award-id><award-id>196383</award-id><award-id>215567</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH NIAID Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR)</funding-source><award-id>75N93021C00014</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</funding-source><award-id>P35159-B</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Medical Research Council</funding-source><award-id>MR/Y004337/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division (AFHSD), Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) Branch</funding-source><award-id>P0021_22_AF</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Emory Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Synergy Fund award</funding-source><funding-source>Pediatric Research Alliance Center for Childhood Infections and Vaccines and Children&#x02019;s Healthcare of Atlanta</funding-source><funding-source>COVID-Catalyst-I3 Funds from the Woodruff Health Sciences Center and Emory School of Medicine</funding-source><funding-source>Woodruff Health Sciences Center 2020 COVID-19 CURE Award</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>German Federal Ministry of Education and Research</funding-source><award-id>8040701710</award-id><award-id>8064701703</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>VARIpath</funding-source><award-id>01KI2021</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Federal Ministry of Health through Grant SeroVarCoV</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>DURABLE</funding-source><award-id>101102733</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>ECDC project Aurorae</funding-source><award-id>NP/21/2021/DPR/25121</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Charit&#x000e9;&#x02014;Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin and the Berlin Institute of Health</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>P.L.M. and J.N.B. are supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Global Immunology and Immune Sequencing for Epidemic Response (GIISER) program (INV-030570).

Introduction</title><p>The evolution of SARS-CoV-2, particularly the emergence of the Omicron variant, has had profound implications for global health and pandemic management. Understanding the mechanisms driving viral evolution, including genetic variation, selective pressures, and antibody escape, is crucial for developing effective interventions [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and research has revealed unprecedented numbers of genomic sequences, shedding light on evolutionary events that had previously been inferred indirectly or had gone undetected. These events include the emergence of variants with distinct phenotypes such as transmissibility, severity, and immune escape [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The antibody escape capacity of Omicron subvariants poses challenges for neutralising antibody efficacy generated by vaccines with the initial composition or convalescent exposure to a prior variant of concern (VOC) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The XBB.1.5 variant, which possesses 40 amino acid substitutions in the spike protein compared to the index virus, features enhanced viral fitness, transmission, and capacity to escape neutralising antibodies. Notably, mutations such as E484A, K417N, and N501Y are associated with a higher risk of antibody escape [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Understanding the structural and functional changes in emerging variants and their sub-lineages is essential for developing targeted therapeutics and vaccines [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Variations within VOCs can significantly impact viral transmissibility, immune escape potential, and vaccine effectiveness. Even minor alterations in key regions of the spike protein may influence antibody neutralisation and the effectiveness of immunological countermeasures. Hence, assessing the antibody escape capabilities of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 is paramount for guiding vaccination strategies, informing public health measures, optimising treatment options, and enhancing global surveillance efforts to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how variants evade the antibody response generated by vaccines is essential for evaluating vaccine efficacy and determining the need for vaccine updates. In addition, monitoring cross-neutralisation of emerging variants contributes to global surveillance efforts aimed at detecting and responding to potential threats of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that may escape antibodies from infection and/or vaccination. This allows for the implementation of targeted interventions to prevent their spread and minimise their impact on populations worldwide [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>As neutralising antibody titres have been shown to be predictive of immune protection from symptomatic disease, neutralisation assays are crucial for the rapid and reliable assessment of antibody escape of emerging variants [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These assays provide a rapid and sensitive means of evaluating the potency of an antibody response generated by vaccination or natural infection. This rapid assessment is essential for informing vaccine development strategies, optimising vaccine formulations, and guiding public health responses to emerging variants [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since the onset of the pandemic, a number of different SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays based on either authentic replication competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates, lentiviral-based pseudoviruses, or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based chimeric viruses have been used and established. However, limited studies have directly compared the results of different assays using the same serum samples [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Establishing the comparability of neutralisation data derived from various laboratories utilising different assays and human sera lays the groundwork for a robust global surveillance system integrating data from diverse sources [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, ongoing surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including their prevalence in different regions, informs vaccine development strategies [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>To gain deeper insights into the variability of neutralisation assays conducted across different laboratories employing diverse protocols, we conducted a comprehensive analysis utilising data from 15 laboratories spanning 12 countries. Our study aimed to establish a collaborative laboratory framework to assess the antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2 variants, specifically focusing on the XBB.1.5 variant as a proof of concept. This included evaluating the comparability of neutralisation assays across different laboratories using the same plasma and analysing the variability in immune responses based on unique epidemiological contexts to gain insights into the virus&#x02019;s immunological landscape. Some labs have also performed titrations using Lentivirus-based pseudoviruses, their own in-house live viruses, and in-house human sera. Through this multifaceted approach, we aimed to elucidate assay comparability on a global scale and provide insights into the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-viruses-16-01936"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-16-01936"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>This study was designed to harmonise the antigenic characterisation through neutralisation assays, reflecting different methodologies commonly employed in the field, before their application in evaluating the immune escape potential of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Assays evaluated included the Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Test (PRNT), Focus Reduction Neutralisation Test (FRNT), Microneutralisation (MicroNeut), and Lentivirus-based Pseudovirus Neutralisation Test (PNT). Immune responses were quantified using standardised units specific to each assay method. Furthermore, 50% neutralisation dilution (ND50) was utilised for MicroNeut, and for PRNT, 50% neutralisation titre (NT50). Fold drop was calculated by sampling the difference between wild-type log2 titres and other antigens&#x02019; log2 titres within the Bayesian model framework (see Mathematical Methods Section in SI).</p><p>The selection of these assays was guided by recommendations from the WHO Technical Advisory Group for Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) and outlined in <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S23</xref>. Adding to the existing SARS-CoV-2 reference laboratory network, which has now transitioned to Coronavirus Network (CoViNet), over 35 laboratories were identified by a small internal steering group on the basis of their experience working in SARS-CoV-2 serology and were invited to participate in this study. A total of 22 reference laboratories expressed interest in participation and completed a competency survey to evaluate their proficiency and capacity to effectively perform the required assays. Criteria for inclusion encompassed laboratory capacity, competency to execute the specified assays, and geographical distribution across all six WHO regions. Seventeen laboratories were initially enrolled, out of which sixteen laboratories successfully completed the legal enrolment and conducted the experimental work and are included in this report. Two laboratories were excluded due to incomplete legal enrolment procedures. The final cohort of 16 participating laboratories exhibited a diverse representation, spanning across 12 countries across all six WHO regions (6 in the European region, 3 in the African region, 3 in the American region, 1 in the Eastern Mediterranean region, 1 in the Southeast Asia region, and 2 in the Western Pacific region; <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S23B</xref>).</p><p>Out of 16 participating laboratories in this work, 15 laboratories successfully conducted the experimental work for the comparability analysis. Results from one laboratory were excluded from this exercise due to insufficient amounts of viral isolates to repeat the experimental work. Two other labs had to repeat and extend their titrations, in one case due to an upper limit of detection being too low for most antigens and in the other case producing unexpected results possibly also due to low titres of propagated virus isolates. One lab which also could not propagate enough virus stocks only performed a Pseudovirus Neutralisation assay after generating their own pseudoviruses according to the protocol specified below. The laboratories engaged in the assessment, with 7, 5, 6, and 2 laboratories utilising PRNT, FRNT, MicroNeut, and PNT, respectively. Notably, 4 out of the 16 laboratories performed parallel analyses using two different methods. Each participating laboratory received a comprehensive set of materials, including a study protocol, Annex, six distinct viral isolates (as detailed in <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>), a reference plasma pool with neutralisation activity against Omicron variants, as well as a negative reference plasma produced and characterised by the NIBSC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-16-01936"><title>2.2. Viral Isolates and Standardised Control Reference Panel</title><p>The concept of the work in this session was to test the comparability of neutralising results across laboratories using the same shared reagents, including viral isolates and reference sera panels. The selection of variants for this assessment was determined based on the epidemiological exposure in the global population as well as the genomic difference. A total of 6 viral isolates were selected, produced by WHO BioHub Facility, and distributed among 16 laboratories. The following variants were selected for the analysis: Alpha, Beta, Delta, BA.1, BA.5.2, and XBB.1.5 using GISAID accession numbers EPI_ISL_3147384, EPI_ISL_2401142, EPI_ISL_5394579, EPI_ISL_7456457, EPI_ISL_12268493.2, and EPI_ISL_16760602, respectively. These isolates were produced in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and/or Calu-3 (VERO6T/C-3) cell lines. Some labs have only titrated against a subset of the antigens. These labs also received two types of plasma pool, NIBSC 21/338 [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and NIBSC 20/142 [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Other, more complicated models such as the fold drop models which constituted the main model of the paper also employed dataset-dependent slope terms to account for differences in fold drops between data coming from different labs, which we did not observe in the raw data here. The simplest model mentioned in [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] is the most similar one, where only an independent dataset titre magnitude effect is used, and it differs from the model used here by the fact that we employ a hierarchical model in which dataset titre magnitude effects depend on the estimated assay-type titre magnitude effects. We employed this approach because titre magnitude between labs using even the same assay type seemed too variable to be modelled by a single assay-dependent term, and yet we also wanted to obtain estimates of how assay type affects titre magnitude and how variable it is, which would not be possible using independent dataset titre magnitude terms.</p><p>The Bayesian model described above is given by

The first application of titre landscapes was presented in [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], where landscapes were fitted to individual HI titre data using local linear regression around each antigen and a linear weighing function was used to deal with fold drops involving thresholded titres. A maximum likelihood approach taking into account censoring was then employed in [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this case, we fit a single landscape to a group of titres where groups are determined by Bayesian clustering (see next section). Instead of local linear regression, we use geometric sum of multiple cone-shaped landscapes (we use model testing to determine optimal number of cones), rather than local linear regression. Local linear regression is more suitable for cases when the exposure history is more complicated. Cone-shaped landscapes are more suitable when, for instance, convalescent sera from previously naive animals or humans relatively early on in a pandemic are used. And instead of a maximum likelihood approach, we use a Bayesian approach, which not only allows us to use the prior knowledge of antigen positions more effectively but also to quantify the uncertainty in landscape coverage. In [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], cone-shaped landscapes are used also to fit sera from individuals after bivalent boosting with WT + BA.1 or WT + BA.4/5 using the package in [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We preferred to formulate this model first of all to be able to test multiple cones (which is not available in [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) and to also have a single Bayesian framework so that we can have HDI estimates for the landscapes coverage (see <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S20</xref>).</p><p>In this section, index i indicates antigens and index j indicates sera in a chosen group. We also assume that there exists a map of antigens in which c<sub>i</sub> represents the 2D coordinates of the antigen i. The landscape is modelled as a combination of one or several cones over this map (combination is defined by a function F, which is explained below).

Therefore mixture priors add sufficient flexibility to the model without overfitting (if the centres are restricted as described above). <bold>&#x003be;<sub>j</sub></bold> is the per serum bias, and &#x003c3; is the measurement standard deviation. CN and N are as in the previous section, and <bold>&#x00194;<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></bold>(<bold>&#x003bc;, &#x003c3;</bold>) is the inverse gamma probability density in location and scale parameterisation. <bold>CST</bold>(<bold>x</bold>|<bold>&#x003bc;, &#x003c3;, <bold><italic toggle="yes">&#x003bd;</italic></bold></bold>) is the censored StudentT likelihood. We normalise the data so that each serum is centred around the gmt of the data, hence the reason why the bias prior has relatively small standard deviation. We sample this model in PyMC with the following parameters: tune = 2000, draws = 4000, chains: 6.</p><p>The function F that appears in the likelihood operates over the index s of the cones (if there are multiple) and combines them into a landscape. In principle, there are various ways to combine the cones into a single landscape, but we have used geometric sum. Therefore, for instance, for two cones, one would have F(x, y) = x + y. Validating the correct combination method would probably require more antigens and multi-exposure sera with precisely known history. This was, for instance, applied to multi-exposure ferret reinfection sera and geometric sum was seen to be the most efficient (personal communication D. J. Smith, work in progress).</p><p>The fixed inputs to the apex centre and height mixtures can be determined by directly looking at the available data. Note that the number of the components of the mixture is independent from the number of cones. One simple way to construct the apex centre mixture is to take a couple of antigens which seem most likely to be local maxima from data and similarly compute the height mixture centres from the mean of the log titres at these antigens.</p><p>Note that in general, mixture models can suffer from non-uniqueness (such as label-mixing problems) and multi-modality of solutions. These problems especially manifest themselves when one wants to perform statistics on parameters involved in the mixture, such as &#x003bc;<sub>s</sub><bold>.</bold> However, the problem is remedied (provided other diagnostics such as chain convergence, etc., are fine) if one is interested in observables agnostic to labels. In this case, we are interested in the observable F(h<sub>s</sub> &#x02212; d(&#x003bc;<sub>s</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>) &#x000d7; &#x0a7b5;<sub>s</sub> + &#x003be;<sub>j</sub>), which is the combination of different cones (over index s) and therefore agnostic to order of label s. Nevertheless, we employ some tricks of the trade for working with mixture models such as ordering of the x coordinates. Combined with a somewhat informed prior, one may still be able to perform statistics on quantities such as &#x003bc;<sub>s</sub> without problems if their posterior distributions look unimodal. On the other hand, if one is simply interested in visualisation of individual cones, then sampling an observable where F is replaced by maximum will also produce a landscape agnostic to this.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5dot3-viruses-16-01936"><title>2.5.3. Clustering Titres</title><p>In this preliminary study, the available metadata are generally coarse and can only be used to provide a lower bound on the number of infections and vaccinations (with sometimes unidentified variants). Information regarding time since infection/vaccination are commonly not available. We provided a breakdown of the data where grouping is carried out by metadata in the SI, <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S22</xref>. Here, we followed an unsupervised clustering approach instead. We collated the in-house human serum data from all the labs which have provided data for the control serum NIBSC 21/338 and which have titrations against four or more antigens (AHRI, Emory, Innsbruck, FIVI, HKU, VIDRL NICD, and Gen&#x000e8;ve). We then clustered these data (sera with all thresholded titres were not included) using a Bayesian Mixture of Normals approach (see SI, Mathematical Methods). There are multiple reasons why we employ Bayesian clustering. The main reason is that out-of-the-box methods such as Euclidean k-means clustering or classical Gaussian mixture models do not allow modelling censored data. It is evident that there are ample censored titres in this dataset, and therefore not modelling them appropriately could lead to erroneous cluster assignments. A second benefit is that Bayesian modelling allows one to quantify probability of each serum belonging to a group, and therefore it is possible to draw a meaningful threshold in which sera which have high probability of belonging to two groups (such as 0.6 vs. 0.4) can be discarded as uncertain. The third benefit is that one is able to relatively easily add a separate cluster for outliers [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; therefore, one can also discard sera that do not really resemble any of the non-outlier groups. The major drawback is the problem of non-uniqueness and multi-modality. Label mixing is a technical difficulty that would in this case make the interpretation of the results meaningless, whereas multi-modality is a more fundamental issue which could suggest that chosen parameters (such as number of clusters) are too flexible or too stringent. Both problems could manifest the same symptoms such as multi-modal posteriors but for different reasons. Using a transformed coordinate system coupled with ordering on the first coordinate, using priors centred on pre-computed solutions such as Euclidean means (but still giving them enough flexibility for exploring different solutions), and including a fixed outliers cluster seems to remedy this problem and allows us to reach up to five sufficiently well-defined and distinct clusters within a dataset of 158 sera alongside an outliers cluster that indeed seems to pick up sera that do not resemble any of the other groups. We also employ diagnostic criteria such as a Bayesian version of the classical silhouette plot, which seems to correctly identify when clustering goes wrong.</p><p>While fitting the clusters, the data are mean centred since absolute magnitude of titres is irrelevant for this purpose and we are more interested in relative differences between titres. In order to deal with groups of sera which do not have a full set of measurements (contrary to experimental design, many labs have titrated against a limited set of antigens for various reasons), we first group the data into patterns of missing data (for instance all those data which are missing the measurement against the first antigen for one group, etc). The likelihood in the model below is applied to each group separately and only on antigens for which the group has no missing data.

Even though the solutions obtained from k-means will no doubt affect the solutions of the Bayesian model (especially the smaller groups), the standard deviations for centre coordinates are left relatively vague (compared to a mean data standard deviation of about 1.2 after mean centring) and therefore can easily explore alternative solutions or correct biases due to Euclidean k-means not taking into account censored titres.

The only change is in the first coordinate, which basically replaces the first titre by a difference of the first three titres and last three titres (and &#x003c3; for this coordinate is, respectively, scaled by sqrt(6)). Moreover, an ordering transformation is applied to this coordinate (which means that given n &#x0003e; 1 clusters, the first coordinate T<sub>1</sub> of the transformed cluster centres will always be ordered). This transformed and ordered choice of coordinates is meant to distinguish data based on their difference of titres between earlier and later variants and therefore prevent label mixing&#x02014;for sufficiently low number of clusters. We call the first coordinate T<sub>1</sub> the rank. Even though mixing can occur for a large number of clusters, we can at that point argue that the number of clusters represents a resolution finer than required.</p><p>Finally even though the model is set up so that it uses an independent set of univariate normals for the cluster centres, from the perspective of PyMC, such priors are very liable to mixing (basically, random cluster centre sampling occurs not just between clusters but also along coordinates). A remedy is using multivariate normals as is normally undertaken in clustering; however, one cannot define censoring for multivariate distributions in PyMC. Another option is defining labels for data explicitly and using the automatic marginalisation feature of PyMC experimental, but this experimental feature does not allow one to develop complex models where non-measured data can be handled. So we developed a workaround in which a set of independent univariate censored normals is wrapped as a single multivariate distribution (therefore censoring first and then turning it into a multivariate distribution) so that coordinates for a cluster are sampled together. For mathematical purposes, this is identical to a set of independent univariate censored normals, but it samples more efficiently.</p><p>In order to measure the efficiency of clustering, we define a Bayesian version of the silhouette plot. A silhouette plot in the classical setting measures roughly how well on average data belong to their cluster (by looking at the relative difference between how close a datum is to its cluster vs. how close it is to other clusters, i.e., relative cohesion&#x02014;separation). There is a much more natural construction of that in the Bayesian world. Let p<sub>ij</sub> be the probability that point i belongs to cluster j. Then cohesion of point i is max<sub>l</sub> p<sub>ij</sub> and separation of point i is sum<sub>j</sub> p<sub>ij</sub>-cohesion<sub>i</sub>. Then the silhouette score of a point is cohesion<sub>i</sub>-separation<sub>i</sub>. When performing further analysis, such as building landscapes, one can also clean groups by putting a lower threshold on the probability of a point belonging to its cluster. Lower values can be interpreted as a point which could potentially be swayed easily to another cluster by measurement noise and therefore its cluster cannot be identified reliably. When defining members of the group, such as in Figure 4A, we have only taken sera for which cohesion was less than 0.1.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-viruses-16-01936"><title>3. Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-viruses-16-01936"><title>3.1. Comparability of the Neutralisation Readout Across Laboratories and Across Assays</title><p>A total of 15 laboratories successfully conducted experimental work for comparability analysis (see <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref> for a summary of each lab&#x02019;s experimental setup). Of those, two laboratories extended the analysis to also use comparable viral strains that were independently isolated (termed &#x0201c;in-house&#x0201d; in the figures). One laboratory enrolled in this study and provided data but did not participate in the comparability analysis. Four types of titre measurement methods were tested in total: Microneutralisation Titres (MicroNeut, n = 5), Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Titres (PRNT, n = 7), Focus Reduction Neutralisation Titres (FRNT, n = 6), and Pseudovirus Neutralisation Titres (PseudoVirusNeut, n = 2, Lentivirus). All three except PseudoVirusNeut are live virus assays.

Geometric Mean Titres</title><p>The raw titres against the positive plasma pool (WHO International Standard 1st International Standard for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern NIBSC code: 21/338) for each of the labs (including in-house virus isolates from Emory and Innsbruck laboratories) are displayed in <xref rid="viruses-16-01936-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The negative pre-pandemic control plasma pool (20/142) was below detection limit (lowest titre tested) across all labs and assays. For each variant tested, the relative differences in titre magnitudes for each variant were largely comparable across assays (PRNT, FRNT, MicroNeut, and PseudoVirusNeut) and laboratories with the only exception of titres generated by RLID for Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants using the PRNT assay (<xref rid="viruses-16-01936-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Given the overall compatibility of these data in fold drops (RMSD between the mean centred GMT and measured titres was 0.56), we used a model which estimates these titres as a sum of two sets of variables: 1. A geometric mean titre (GMT) value for each antigen (6 parameters) and 2. A hierarchical overall titre magnitude value (with the parameter name offset) for every lab (20 parameters) controlling for the overall magnitude of the titre, which depends on the estimated titre for each assay platform (4 parameters). Precise definitions of these parameters are given in the SI in the Modelling Assay-wise Effects and GMTs Section. However for practical purposes, dataset titre magnitude (or offset for short) can be thought of as the difference between titre means (over antigens) between the estimated GMTs and lab titres. It is a relative measure of how high on average titres from one lab are compared to others (see also Assay Offsets Section). The GMT estimates from all laboratories and assays align very well with the lab raw data once the titre magnitudes are controlled for with the exception of the GMT estimates for Alpha, Beta, and Delta generated by RLID (<xref rid="viruses-16-01936-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B, RMSD: 0.59, see also Model Diagnostics Section for further analysis of the goodness of fit and posterior predictive checks and <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref> for a pairwise comparison of fold drops). Excluding RLID and in-house samples, the per antigen RMSD of titre magnitude-adjusted lab titres to the GMT line were as follows: Alpha: 0.39, Beta: 0.44, Delta: 0.87, BA.1: 0.28, BA.5: 0.64, XBB.1.5: 0.72 (calculated via the posterior means). The fitted per antigen standard deviation posteriors had means as follows: Alpha: 0.53, Beta: 0.54, Delta: 0.68, BA.1: 0.67, BA.5: 0.81, XBB.1.5: 0.71 (without excluding RLID and in-house samples).

An Initial Step Towards Global Immunological Surveillance</title><p>Population immunity landscapes, which refer to the spatial and temporal distribution of immunity within a population, are useful tools for evaluation of vaccine update strategies both prospectively and retrospectively [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Landscapes build &#x0201c;titre surfaces&#x0201d; on a two-dimensional map that represents the antigenic relation between variants as opposed to titre curves on a one-dimensional ordinal axis of antigens. They greatly facilitate interpreting relationships between sera that have been titrated against many antigenically distinct variants. This section highlights how to build landscapes from multiple labs&#x02019; sera archives using a Bayesian approach. The metadata available for the sera are coarse, and therefore, we apply unsupervised grouping methods to extract patterns out of the data before constructing the landscapes.</p><p>We analysed data provided by a subset of the labs (AHRI, Emory, Innsbruck, FIVI, HKU, VIDRL NICD, Gen&#x000e8;ve, and FIOCRUZ) where WHO stock viruses were titrated against their in-house human sera (N = 268). We analysed the data by grouping similar sera together via a Mixture of Censored Normals Model (within a Bayesian framework) and then fitted landscapes to each group (see the sections Clustering Titres and Modelling Landscapes in the SI for details). More than half of the serum set comes from individuals multiply vaccinated with WT vaccines (sometimes bivalent) and no reported/known infections (N = 151). The characteristics of the remaining sera are quite variable and, for instance, contain sera from individuals with confirmed BA.1, BA.5, XBB.1.5 infections (sometimes with no reported vaccinations and no other infections and sometimes with multiple infections) and many sera with unidentified variant infections and sometimes unspecified bivalent boosters. The full dataset with the available metadata is available in [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A table which shows a breakdown of the sera is given in <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>.</p><p>As the main result of this analysis, we see that the largest cluster that corresponds to roughly 80% of the data is clustered in a group whose mean fold-change drops look very similar to IS (NIBSC 21/338 pooled plasma) (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S15</xref>). This is not surprising because the metadata available suggest that these sera come from individuals who were likely vaccinated/infected multiple times with index virus and/or early VOCs, much like the constituents of the IS. It is also seen that non-parametric point estimation of fold drops for this group underestimates fold drop of XBB.1.5 by about two-fold (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S15</xref>).</p><p>The second pattern looks more cross-reactive and comes from a set of individuals in which the proportion of BA.1 or later variant exposures to those with only index infection/vaccination is much higher compared to the first group (<xref rid="viruses-16-01936-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S13</xref>). The metadata available suggest that these encounters are BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, Delta + BA.1, XBB.1.5, and some unidentified variants. Looking at the landscapes (<xref rid="viruses-16-01936-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S20</xref>), this is the only group that consistently covers XBB.1.5 well beyond its full 94% HDI range, whereas the other two groups cover only up to BA.5 or up to XBB.1.5 at their border (which is susceptible to change if the threshold plane&#x02019;s position changes by a unit or HDI is increased). Finally, the third pattern picked up by clustering comes from a set of individuals who are known to be BA.1-convalescent (without vaccination) plus one individual with two unidentified infections and no recorded vaccinations. The outlier cluster contains sera like BA.1, BA.5-convalescent individuals, or individuals with Delta, XBB.1.5 infections, and a WT vaccination.</p><p>The fact that the first group contains sera from uninfected individuals who were involved in a trial with BA.1 + index or BA.5 + index bivalent vaccine is likely an effect of imprinting due to earlier multiple index vaccines [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Indeed, the second, more cross-reactive group involves many individuals who are non-vaccinated and convalescent with BA.1, BA.2, and XBB.1.5 as well as those convalescent with XBB.1.5 and vaccinated with index. The proportion of no reported infections and multiply index-vaccinated individuals is much smaller compared to the first group (compare cluster 1 vs. cluster 2 in <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S20</xref>).

However, it is hard to make more detailed and definitive statements due to the uncertain nature of the metadata. A further breakdown of these sera by metadata is given in <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S13</xref>, and details about the process of clustering are given in the section Clustering Diagnostics.

Discussion</title><p>The findings of this study demonstrate a high degree of compatibility in SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay results across multiple laboratories, with minor variations observed. This suggests that despite differences in methodologies and laboratory settings, titres measured by different labs using different assay types can be compared, especially when adjusting for different assay/lab titre magnitudes. The lab/assay-specific titre magnitudes may be determined using the International Standard. The Bayesian model employed for estimating titres effectively accounted for laboratory-specific mean titre magnitudes, revealing a stark alignment of results with the overall trend. This study also suggests that the use of the same virus isolate across laboratories is not a necessity, but sequence harmonisation might be sufficient; pseudoviruses generated for the same sequences and to some extent live virus variants available in-house (with some sequence differences) yielded comparable results to WHO stocks (see <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>). This will greatly reduce the logistical and financial requirements for future assessments.</p><p>The differences that were observed are most likely attributable to one or more of the following: viral isolate propagation methods, choice of cell lines, and assay protocols. For example, while we do not judge that the difference in Alpha, Beta, and Delta titres generated by RLID is due to cell type, as this lab is not the only one that has used Vero E6 cells, there is nevertheless accumulating evidence that the choice of cell lines has an impact on assay results [<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Another interesting difference is seen in the titres against the Delta variant for Innsbruck between the shared and the in-house isolates (see <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>). The spike protein differences were A771S, G1167 (WHO has G1167V), and G1219 (WHO has G1219V) (see <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="app">Table S2 and Figure S24</xref>). This may be due to the fact that the in-house isolate was an early Delta isolate (B.1.617.2) as opposed to the shared one, which was a late Delta isolate (AY.43). Considering convergent evolution in the SARS-CoV-2 spike, this could explain the higher fold drop for the in-house virus isolate. Additionally, differences in assay sensitivities and thresholds may impact the detection of neutralising antibodies, highlighting the importance of standardised procedures and quality control measures. Incorporating censored modelling approaches, as demonstrated here, can also remedy this problem to some extent.</p><p>The study findings have significant implications for vaccine development, as they provide valuable insights into the likely effectiveness of existing vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The data shown here confirm the immune escape of the assessed XBB.1.5 variant in sera from people exposed only to pre-Omicron variants as previously published [<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] as well as the estimated GMT for the viral isolates provided in this study. Therefore, setting up a systematic and comparable methodology to determine the immune escape capabilities of variants is crucial for optimising vaccine formulations and guiding vaccination strategies. By assessing neutralisation titres against key variants, researchers can inform decisions regarding the need for vaccine updates or booster doses. Furthermore, the compatibility of assay results across laboratories underscores the reliability of global surveillance efforts in monitoring the impact of new variants on immune escape.</p><p>While this was not the goal of this study, the rationale for the WHO to support harmonising antigenic characterisation data is, just like for influenza, to identify quantitative thresholds for neutralisation assays that can be used to support decision-making processes about vaccine antigen composition. For example, the 8-fold drop measured between BA.1/BA.5 and XBB.1.5 in this study would likely warrant considering a change in vaccine antigen composition. On the other hand, the drop measured between Delta and Omicron was 4-fold, which is not as high as the drop measured by other studies that used sera of vaccinated individuals (from 6 to 25 fold drops) [<xref rid="B50-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. When using sera from infected and vaccinated individuals, more relevant to this study, the fold drop between Beta and Omicron was 3&#x02013;4-fold [<xref rid="B51-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which is comparable to what is found in this study. However, there was significant variability across studies, almost certainly reflecting the differences in underlying population immunity of the sera tested. This may be due to the fact that the WHO International Standard 21/338 was created as a pool of many individuals specifically to have a wider breath of responses than single individuals. This reference preparation was not meant to be representative of any population immunity, as the intended use is as the primary calibrant to harmonise results from assays from different laboratories using the same viral isolates. Regardless, neutralisation of the emerging variant using human (community) sera is not the only set of critical laboratory data that are needed to consider changes in vaccine antigen composition. For example, anti-sera (i.e., sera of naive animals then infected with the emerging variant under consideration for vaccine change) provide a more precise measure on how immunogenic this variant may be (and therefore how well the new vaccine would cross-protect against other variants). These are also very critical data, as some variants may be less immunogenic than others [<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The recent establishment of the WHO Coronavirus Network (CoViNet) will hopefully work as a platform to establish such thresholds [<xref rid="B53-viruses-16-01936" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, logistics has been time-consuming, as sharing virus isolates and the International Standard took time, and some laboratories experienced delays in receiving the material. Also, some laboratories were not able to rapidly propagate enough virus material. Therefore, and considering the results we presented, a way forward could be that, whenever feasible, laboratories generate their own isolates and the viral sequence is checked after each passage. Secondly, a hamster map from another source was used in the human serum landscape analysis. Although for the antigenic characterisation of influenza virus it is common to use maps generated using ferret sera, for SARS-CoV-2, we are still in the exploratory stages of comparing the behaviour of human versus hamster sera. Finally, human serum metadata were relatively poor in this study, and global surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic characterisation would certainly benefit from more detailed metadata.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-16-01936"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Continued research in global immunological surveillance is essential for building population immunity landscapes and guiding vaccine update strategies prospectively and retrospectively. Further investigations into the factors influencing assay variability, such as cell line choice and assay sensitivities, are warranted to enhance assay standardisation and comparability. Additionally, ongoing monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their immune escape capabilities is critical for staying ahead of the evolving threat posed by the virus. In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of neutralisation assays conducted across multiple laboratories provides valuable insights into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants. The high degree of assay comparability observed underscores the reliability of global surveillance efforts and emphasises the importance of continued vigilance and adaptive public health responses. It also suggests that virus sharing may not be always needed if the key mutations&#x02014;as per in silico prediction&#x02014;of the emerging variant under study are present in &#x0201c;in-house&#x0201d; viral isolates. By understanding the dynamics of viral evolution, immune escape, and vaccine effectiveness, researchers can better address the challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was conducted with biological material&#x02014;SARS-CoV-2, Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7), Beta variant (lineage B.1.351), Delta variant (lineage B.1.617), and Omicron variants (lineage B.1.1.529, lineage BA.5, lineage XBB.1.5, lineage XBB.1) obtained through the WHO BioHub Facility: Spiez Laboratory Switzerland.
