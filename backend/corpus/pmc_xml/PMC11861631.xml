Psychol 2921;12)</p></sec><sec id="sec6427"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our aim was to conduct a study to determine the prevalence of cyber violence victimization among university students and to examine whether this prevalence would be related to negative childhood traumas.</p></sec><sec id="sec6428"><title>Methods</title><p>We reached university students in many cities of Turkey through an online survey between 01 January 2023 and 31 March 2023. A total of 600 students participated. In our survey, we used the Turkish forms of the Childhood Adverse Experiences Scale and the Cyber Victimization Scale, for which sociodemographic data, validity and reliability studies have been completed in Turkish.</p></sec><sec id="sec6429"><title>Results</title><p>University students from 8 different provinces participated in our study. According to the results of our study, it was evaluated that university students who had negative childhood experiences were more likely to become cyber victims. We are exposed to many traumas from the moment we are born, and this exposure is the relationship with the mother, then relatives, friends, teachers, colleagues, etc. It continues throughout life through relationships. There is a moderate relationship between victimization of blocking and damaging behaviors in cyberspace and negative childhood relationships (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.304), a low level relationship between victimization of sexual bullying in cyberspace and negative childhood relationships (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.289), and victimization of spreading rumors in cyberspace. A low degree of correlation (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.277) was found between and negative childhood relationships. (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c;0.05)</p></sec><sec id="sec6430"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The widespread use of technology today facilitates the digitalization of violence, as in every field. As a result, cyber violence, like other types of violence, may be associated with childhood traumas, and this can be prevented by being exposed to the least trauma during childhood, and moreover, if we look from Bronfenbrenner&#x02019;s perspective, if the next generation grows up in a suitable ecological environment, cyber violence victimization can be prevented to that extent.</p></sec><sec id="sec6431"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
