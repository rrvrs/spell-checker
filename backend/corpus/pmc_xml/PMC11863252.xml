Alongside improvements in acute stroke care services has been relatively short hospital length of stays in most developed countries; thus, most of the stroke patients&#x02019; recovery occurs after the patient is discharged from the hospital.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr4-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> Transitions refer to the movement of patients across different healthcare settings, locations, providers, or levels of care, and are &#x0201c;marked by changes in patients&#x02019; physical, mental, emotional, and cognitive capacities&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr5-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>(p. 790).

</sup> A meta-ethnographic systematic review attributed limited access to community services and primary care support to the feelings of abandonment that stroke survivors and their caregivers report following hospital discharge.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Older adults with stroke arguably bear the brunt of these deficiencies, given that up to 80% of all strokes occur in older adults. Moreover, the vast majority (92%) of older adults with stroke have multimorbidity (&#x02265; 2 co-morbidities).<sup><xref rid="bibr14-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Multimorbidity has been linked to lack of care coordination/communication in transitions across care providers.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> Accordingly, older adult stroke survivors tend to be a more medically complex subgroup that face increased short- and long-term mortality, poorer health status, lower baseline functional status, longer hospital stays, and higher use of health services compared to younger stroke survivors.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> These problems with transitional care will continue to escalate with the number of older adults with stroke and multimorbidity expected to increase by one-third by 2035.<sup>

In addition to receiving usual care offered through their outpatient stroke rehabilitation program, the TCSI involved virtually delivered transitional support by an interprofessional (IP) team of HCPs from a hospital-based outpatient stroke rehabilitation program over a 6-month period following randomization. The IP team members (referred to as &#x0201c;participants&#x0201d; below) included an Occupational Therapist (OT), Physical Therapist (PT), Speech Language Pathologist (SLP), Social Worker (SW), and a Registered Nurse (RN) or Registered Practical Nurse (RPN).

The Hotel Dieu Shaver Health and Rehabilitation Centre is a separate rehabilitation centre (Site A) within the Niagara region in Ontario. Hamilton Health Sciences Regional Rehabilitation Centre is in a large tertiary teaching hospital, directly connected to an acute medical hospital, the Hamilton General Hospital (Site B). Each site had an IP team of healthcare providers, including a 0.80 full-time equivalent Care Coordinator, who delivered the intervention. Part of the IP team at Site A (Occupational Therapist, Physical Therapist and Speech Language Pathologist) had a pre-existing working relationship as members of the outpatient stroke rehabilitation team. The IP team at Site A provided both the TCSI and usual outpatient stroke rehabilitation services to participants randomized to the TCSI.

<xref rid="bibr61-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>
</sup> CFIR is an implementation determinant framework<sup>
<xref rid="bibr62-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>
</sup> designed to describe challenges and barriers to implementation outcomes (adoption/adoptability, implementation/implementability, sustainment/sustainability), which in turn shape the ultimate success of the intervention (achievement of intervention outcomes).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr61-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>
</sup> This framework consists of 39 constructs, organized into five domains known to affect implementation of interventions: 1) individual characteristics (including their knowledge and beliefs about the intervention, stage of change, and personal attributes); 2) innovation characteristics (adaptability, complexity, and design quality); 3) outer setting, which includes external factors (e.g., political, social, economic); 4) inner setting (e.g., organizational factors such as structures, communication, and readiness for implementation); and 5) implementation process including planning, engagement of key players, and how the intervention is executed.<sup>

Regular, effective, and clear communication among the IP team members was identified as a key factor for promoting effective IP collaboration. Collaboration between team members at Site A was facilitated by pre-existing working relationships. The intervention effectively leveraged the existing relationships and individual synergies. Site A participants described themselves as &#x0201c;multi-disciplinary&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;trans-disciplinary.&#x0201d; Their trans-disciplinary identity was a source of pride, and they attributed to it their pre-existing familiarity, being &#x0201c;already past that point of awkwardness&#x0201d;. They also acknowledged &#x0201c;really good communication&#x0201d; (A5) and strong working relations. This sense of interdependency and working collaboratively emerged in Site B as well, even though they did not have pre-existing relationships and experienced a higher provider turnover.</p><p>There was a sense of security and empowerment in being able to draw on the expertise of colleagues from other professions as needed. In addition to working well within their teams, participants highlighted the importance of collaborating with the HCPs delivering usual care to older adult study participants. Coordination between the intervention team and usual care staff promoted continuity of care particularly during the first 3 months post-discharge, when older adult participants received usual stroke rehabilitation services along with the TCSI.</p></sec><sec id="sec25-26335565251323748"><title>Dedicated resources (funding, staffing) to support delivery of the intervention</title><p>Another major facilitator to implementing the intervention was that funding was provided to the participating outpatient stroke rehabilitation sites to deliver the intervention. Funding was used to compensate the staff that were delivering the intervention so that they had protected time to deliver the intervention (beyond usual care), as well as offset other material costs associated with the delivery of the intervention. Funding was particularly important to support the Care Coordinator role, which was a new 0.80 FTE position and represented the greatest cost associated with delivery of the intervention. HCPs and Managers highlighted the critical foundational role of the Care Coordinator in leading the IP team, providing the majority of the visits, taking responsibility for the coordination of, and access to, all services, organizing and facilitating the monthly IP team conferences and communication among team members and other stakeholders, establishing goals for each visit, developing and documenting individual care plans, providing regular support to IP team members, acting as a point person for study participants, and managing the collation of online documents.</p></sec><sec id="sec26-26335565251323748"><title>Extensive training and ongoing support customized to individual HCP needs</title><p>To support intervention fidelity, the HCPs, were provided training by the PI and the RC prior to initiation of the intervention to prepare them for their roles by conveying key intervention activities, research study procedures, and underlying theories. A standardized training manual was developed that includes key content pertaining to all aspects of the intervention. Because the participating HCPs were already experienced in providing usual stroke care, the training focused on expanding their capacity with respect to the new intervention rather than teaching them about usual care at the same time. A key focus in the training was on the management of multimorbidity. Prior to the training, the PI and the RC conducted an informal assessment of the learning needs of the HCPs on each component of the intervention, including the assessment and management of older adults with multimorbidity. Open-ended questions were used to identify training needs, and difficulties and resources relating to the management of multimorbidity in older adults. The results of the needs assessment were used to tailor the training to the individual learning needs of the HCPs regarding delivering the intervention and addressing multimorbidity. Education and role-playing were used to enhance their knowledge and skills in all intervention activities. Training modules were made available online, and further education was provided during the monthly outreach meeting on various topics relevant to the intervention.</p><p>As delivery of the TCSI was a learning experience for all involved, ongoing mentoring, education and support of HCPs was an important factor facilitating implementation. Monthly outreach meetings with the HCPs were conducted to enable the PI and the RC to support the intervention teams, monitor intervention implementation, and strategize to address any challenges. Separate, bi-monthly meetings were also held with the Care Coordinators to support them in their roles. Regular research team meetings served as an opportunity to: 1) address clinical-related questions; 2) reinforce and address questions related to implementation of the study (e.g., documentation); 3) provide continuing education for best practices for stroke and stroke rehabilitation, multimorbidity and person-centred care; and 4) share success stories related to positive clinical outcomes and effective collaborative efforts with community partners. Participants felt that the support provided by the research team provided a venue for identifying and addressing issues related to implementation, created a sense of shared ownership among the IP team, and increased HCPs&#x02019; comfort and confidence in delivering the intervention. The HCPs valued prompt access to the PI and the RC via phone, email, and in-person to address implementation-related questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec27-26335565251323748"><title>Organizational readiness for implementation, strong leadership, and effective local champions</title><p>Participants highlighted that alignment of the TCSI with the mission and objectives of their organizations led to high organizational commitment to implementation of the intervention. Participants indicated that the intervention was a priority as it was addressing gaps in transitional care for a segment of the outpatient stroke population with the greatest needs, e.g., older adults with stroke and multimorbidity. Interviews revealed that the daily presence and support of designated Managers and Directors within each of the sites who became effective champions of the intervention was also instrumental in facilitating implementation. They were respected leaders who believed in the project, took ownership, and were committed to keeping the project on track during challenging times. They worked together with the research team and the HCPs to determine how to best operationalize the intervention in their respective clinical settings. This included establishing the IP teams, determining the nature and scope of various roles, designing workflow processes to integrate the intervention into usual practice, identifying information systems for sharing patient-related information within the team, and establishing reporting relationships and responsibilities. These champions attended the monthly research team meetings, provided the IP team members with ongoing support and feedback on the day-to-day implementation of the intervention, and promoted the study within their local setting. They fostered trust and promoted communication among team members in ways that helped to quickly resolve most of the challenges encountered.</p></sec><sec id="sec28-26335565251323748"><title>SharePoint and monthly IP team conferences facilitated virtual sharing of information and IP collaboration</title><p>HCPs reported that SharePoint served as an effective IP communication tool that facilitated consistent and transparent virtual communication and information sharing among IP team members. SharePoint also served as a platform for sharing training materials, study-related forms, information on community resources, and other study-related materials. Another strategy that facilitated virtual information sharing and IP collaboration was the monthly IP team conferences. The monthly team conferences provided additional opportunities for the team to meet, work cooperatively, benefit from complementary roles, and share responsibility for making decisions regarding patient care. The conferences enabled the HCPs to &#x0201c;get on the same page and work through the goals of the patients and any concerns from the team&#x0201d; [Manager Survey].</p></sec><sec id="sec29-26335565251323748"><title>Regular monitoring of intervention implementation, feedback mechanisms and flexibility embedded in implementation led to real-time adaptations increasing adoption</title><p>As the intervention progressed over time, barriers to continued adoption occurred that were primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular monitoring of intervention implementation, feedback mechanisms and the flexibility embedded in implementation allowed the research team to be responsive to implementation challenges, to identify new implementation strategies, and to ultimately facilitate continued use of the intervention over the course of implementation. We used an audit and feedback strategy, that involved encouraging feedback from HCPs, older adult study participants, and their caregivers, and regular review of documents that provided a record of the intervention components that were delivered. Monthly research team meetings provided a forum for HCPs and their managers to provide feedback and discuss the results of the audit to identify any gaps or challenges to implementation. This data helped to inform ongoing adaptation of the intervention to the local context and ensure consistency and adherence to the intervention protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec30-26335565251323748"><title>Implementation challenges</title><sec id="sec31-26335565251323748"><title>COVID-19 related challenges: Recruiting and retaining intervention staff and disruptions to community-based services and supports</title><p>The redeployment of intervention team members at Site B to acute inpatient units to manage COVID-19-related needs resulted in turnover of intervention staff, and the need to stop the trial three months early. Turnover of intervention staff resulted in disruptions to the delivery of the intervention, challenges in maintaining steady working relationships among the IP team members, and a lack of continuity of care. Participants reported significant challenges recruiting staff to replace IP team members. Significant time and effort, on the part of the managers and the research team, was devoted to the discussion of recruitment issues, and identifying potential recruitment strategies. This was particularly challenging since a health human resource shortage existed at this site prior to initiating the study. HCPs also spoke of the challenges accessing community-based services, that were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, social distancing measures and restrictions on gatherings affected the delivery of these services and made it challenging to access the services and supports they needed. Many community services pivoted from in-person to virtual delivery or faced financial challenges that led to reduced capacity or cessation of services.</p></sec><sec id="sec32-26335565251323748"><title>Poor communication and collaboration with local community-based service partners</title><p>HCPs spoke of the challenges of identifying and linking patients to home and community-based services, with primary care physicians being a particularly challenging group to engage. Some patients who were asked to follow up with primary care were unable to do so as they didn&#x02019;t have a family physician. Many IP team members were not familiar with the community-based programs and services in their region that supported stroke rehabilitation and recovery, and the criteria for acceptance into these programs, and struggled to identify appropriate referrals.</p><p>Community resources, including existing programs and services that supported older adults with stroke and multimorbidity, were reviewed during the initial training sessions, posted on SharePoint, and the MSRJ website. The Care Coordinator, and other IP team members were encouraged to learn about the resources in their communities and develop relationships with staff from these organizations. HCPs highlighted the difficulties referring patients to home care services. Even HCPs with decades-long experience in stroke rehabilitation who spoke of their well-established relationships with their community colleagues &#x0201c;we know them by first name if we were to call an organization&#x02026; to make this referral&#x0201d; (A4) were unclear about the criteria for referring patients to home care&#x0201d;. HCPs confirmed that implementation would be positively affected if the IP team built stronger partnerships with home and community-based service providers and primary care.</p></sec><sec id="sec33-26335565251323748"><title>Documentation burden (intervention-related)</title><p>HCPs cited the intervention-related screening and assessment tools, and forms, (e.g., visit record, and alerts) as both a facilitator and a challenge; they enhanced assessment and information sharing; yet they were burdensome to implement. HCPs indicated that it was often difficult to conduct assessments and address discipline-specific and patient-related concerns within the time allotted for the visit. Visits took longer than expected, requiring a few to prepare for their visits and complete intervention-related documentation on their own personal time. While SharePoint served as an effective IP communication tool that facilitated virtual communication and information sharing among team members, the data in SharePoint could not be integrated into the EMR. This meant that HCPs frequently needed to document the same information in both SharePoint and the EMR, resulting in increased documentation burden.</p><p>HCPs were also concerned that asking patients what may be seen as &#x0201c;really invasive questions&#x0201d; shortly after they had returned home &#x0201c;didn&#x02019;t get them time to settle and come to the reality that they just had a stroke and that they're coming home now,&#x0201d; while potentially adding to caregiver burden (Site B interview). HCPs also felt that patients thought that screenings were repetitive and lacked clarity and relevance; they were overwhelming and challenging, particularly for those with cognitive impairments.</p></sec><sec id="sec34-26335565251323748"><title>Technological/Virtual challenges impeded virtual delivery of the intervention</title><p>Virtual delivery of the intervention allowed providers to support patients&#x02019; recovery journey during the COVID-19 pandemic that restricted face-to-face visits. Video visits (using Microsoft Teams and Zoom) were seen as most effective. However, one participant observed, &#x0201c;a lot of participants [&#x02026;] don't have the technology or they don't have access to the internet, and some of them don't even have email&#x0201d; (B3). Another participant indicated that &#x0201c;sometimes the patients involved did not have the technology to participate or had technical issues with the connection to our staff&#x0201d; [Manager survey]. Training patients and their caregivers on how to access and use videoconference helped to address some of the technological barriers. An SLP described the difference that a videoconference made to hearing information only over the phone, for instance (B2). More severe strokes, communication impairments, having English as a second language and general technological difficulties made virtual care delivery even more challenging. Some providers also found it difficult to provide virtual support for physiotherapy, exercise management, social and safety concerns, and medication reconciliation. The option to conduct visits by phone or videoconference, coupled with the pre-discharge training offered to patients and their caregivers at Site B on how to use online platforms and related equipment supported the implementation of virtual visits.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec35-26335565251323748"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to enhance understanding of the facilitators and challenges to implementing the TCSI in real-world clinical practice, from the perspective of frontline HCPs and Managers. Our study had several innovative aspects. First, it involved testing a TC intervention that focused on clinically complex older adults (with stroke and multimorbidity) who are often excluded from studies evaluating TC models.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr29-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Thus, this research enhances our understanding of what is required to successfully implement TC interventions to a population such as this who are most susceptible to health challenges associated with fragmented transitional care. Second, it focused on identifying the facilitators and challenges to implementing the TCSI in real-world settings. Evidence on how to best implement effective, evidence-based transitional care interventions is lacking thereby limiting the successful spread of these interventions to other jurisdictions.<sup>

</sup> Third, we evaluated the factors influencing implementation of a virtual TC intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from studies and systematic reviews suggest that virtual stroke rehabilitation services (also called telemedicine, telehealth, or telerehabilitation) can be both feasible and effective.<sup><xref rid="bibr68-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr71-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> However, they are based on a weak evidence base, provide little information on implementation, and the preferences of people with stroke, and none focus specifically on older adults with stroke and multimorbidity. Thus, the TCSI study served to address this gap in the literature.</p><p>Our study identified an interplay of ten main factors (6 facilitators; 4 challenges) that influenced implementation of this multi-component intervention. Most of these factors (5 facilitators, 2 challenges) were related to five inner setting constructs: relational connections, available resources, access to knowledge and information, leadership engagement and mission alliance, information technology and communications, and compatibility. The finding that inner setting CFIR constructs were most common in influencing implementation means that factors within the organization itself play a significant role in determining the success or failure of the implementation process.<sup>

However, HCPs cited documentation burden (intervention-related) as a major challenge to implementation of the intervention. HCPs reported high levels of dissatisfaction with documentation, significant issues with duplication and redundancy, and the need to use their own personal time to complete documentation. Findings suggest that documentation burden for HCPs could be reduced by integrating the IP communication system (e.g., SharePoint) with other healthcare systems (e.g., EMR). Oorganizations&#x02019; seeking to implement the intervention should work collaboratively with HCPs to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all documentation currently in use in usual care and the intervention to identify areas of duplication and redundancy and determine aspects of documentation that could be modified. Findings also highlight the need to select and embed key metrics in the EMR to track implementation and real-time data collection systems; (so it is not an add-on but a rather, data on a key set of measures routinely collected in everyday practice). There is increasing evidence for the development of information systems, an organizational culture that supports ongoing monitoring and evaluation, knowledge sharing, and using data to track implementation to inform ongoing decision-making and ensure successful implementation of complex, person-centred interventions.<sup>

Although the TCSI in this study was only offered virtually due to pandemic-related restrictions, virtual care may not be appropriate for some patients.

As such, the TCSI trial allowed flexibility in the implementation of the intervention as it occurs in real-world settings, and among participants representative of the population presenting in the outpatient clinic, and places little control on the heterogeneity present within usual care.<sup><xref rid="bibr115-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>,<xref rid="bibr116-26335565251323748" ref-type="bibr">115</xref></sup> Thus, the TCSI study provides a realistic indicator of TCSI implementation for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity. Another strength of the study was the use of the CFIR framework to guide the development of data collection tools (e.g., interview and focus group guides), data extraction (e.g., team meeting minutes), and the analysis. Using CFIR to guide the study enabled us to build on the existing knowledge about implementation science to explore determinants or factors at multiple levels of influence on the implementation of a transitional care intervention for older adults with multimorbidity and stroke. Data collection included 12 HCPs and 3 Managers, who provided rich experiences, and data saturation was reached in both settings. Other strengths of this study included the use of a rigorous qualitative design, and the use of multiple qualitative data generation approaches (structured interviews, focus groups) to enable deep exploration of the subject matter both individually and collectively.</p><p>This study has several limitations that point to potential directions for future research. First, the study was conducted in two regions in Ontario and thus may not be transferable to other settings. Second, the study had a relatively small sample size, and the facilitators and challenges described in the present study are based on the participants&#x02019; descriptions of their practice, competence, and experience. Their experiences might not be representative of outpatient stroke rehabilitation services in other settings. A future RCT should involve multiple sites, to explore implementation facilitators and challenges across a broader range of settings and contexts. Third, the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite our efforts to minimize the effects of the pandemic, we do not know the impact that the pandemic had on the results of the study or what may be different if the study was conducted under &#x02018;normal&#x02019; circumstances, e.g., not under the constraints of the pandemic.</p><p>Fourth, our study was not designed to establish causal inferences, but rather to provide a broad as well as in-depth understanding of the factors that influence implementation of the TCSI across different outpatient stroke rehabilitation settings. Future work can build on the groundwork laid by our initial investigation to draw causal conclusions about factors that facilitate or inhibit effective delivery of the TCSI. A final limitation is that while attempts were made to gather information from older adult and caregiver participants regarding the implementation of the TCSI, because of the participants&#x02019; complex health conditions, very few agreed to participate in this component of the study.
