However, a rare postoperative complication known as periprosthetic acetabular fracture (PPAF) can occur, potentially affecting hip joint stability and implant longevity. The management of PPAF is guided by the Della Valle and Paprosky classifications, which assess implant stability and the extent of bone loss. In this study, we report two cases of PPAF occurring after BHA and THA. In Case 1, early open reduction and internal fixation were performed, successfully avoiding stem revision and achieving a favorable clinical outcome. In contrast, Case 2 was initially managed conservatively; however, due to fracture displacement progression and subsequent reinjury from a fall, surgical intervention became necessary, requiring acetabular reconstruction and implant revision. Treatment options for PPAF include conservative management, plate fixation, and implant revision. In many cases, early surgical intervention yields better outcomes. Therefore, close collaboration between orthopedic trauma surgeons and hip reconstruction specialists is essential. Given the limited number of reported cases, further accumulation of case data and evaluation of long-term outcomes are needed. Early classification and appropriate management are crucial for optimal treatment of PPAF.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>bipolar hip arthroplasty (bha)</kwd><kwd>della valle classification</kwd><kwd>paprosky classification</kwd><kwd>periprosthetic acetabular fracture</kwd><kwd>periprosthetic fracture</kwd><kwd>total hip arthroplasty (tha)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bipolar hip arthroplasty (BHA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) are widely used as standard treatments for femoral neck fractures and osteoarthritis of the hip in elderly patients [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Although periprosthetic femoral fractures have been widely studied, PPAF remain underreported. However, their frequency is expected to increase in the coming years, highlighting the need for accurate classification and appropriate treatment strategies [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>PPAFs are classified based on the fracture location and implant stability. The first classification, proposed by Peterson and Lewallen, divided fractures into Type I and Type II based on acetabular cup stability [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The most widely used system today is the comprehensive classification by Paprosky and Della Valle (2003), which covers all known variations of PPAF, including intraoperative fractures during cup insertion or removal, traumatic and spontaneous fractures, and pelvic discontinuity. This classification also provides guidelines for both surgical and non-surgical management [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, both cases were categorized as Type III fractures according to this system. Case 1 was classified as Type IIIA, where acetabular component stability was maintained, and the fracture was treated with ORIF along with cup reimplantation. Case 2 initially presented as Type IIIA and was managed conservatively; however, a subsequent fall during the healing phase resulted in progression to Type IIIB with component instability, necessitating revision arthroplasty using a cage construct.</p><p>Treatment strategies for PPAF include conservative management, plate fixation, and implant revision. Conservative treatment may be considered when the implant remains stable and the fracture is minor; however, it is often limited by challenges in pain control, delayed union, and the risk of secondary fracture [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Plate fixation is indicated when the implant is stable but the fracture is unstable, allowing for direct anatomical reduction. The use of locking plates has demonstrated reliable fixation even in osteoporotic bone [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, prolonged weight-bearing restrictions after surgery may result in muscle weakness, necessitating well-coordinated rehabilitation.</p><p>Implant revision is reserved for cases with severe loss of acetabular component stability. These procedures often involve the use of large acetabular components or reconstruction cages, sometimes requiring structural bone grafting [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, surgical invasiveness, particularly in elderly patients, and the limited long-term data on revision implant outcomes remain ongoing concerns.</p><p>PPAFs are also associated with a high risk of postoperative complications, including infection, heterotopic ossification, dislocation, and non-union. Selmene et al. reported dislocation in 30% and infection in 20% of cases following surgical treatment [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our two cases, careful preoperative planning, appropriate surgical decision-making, and meticulous postoperative management enabled us to avoid these complications. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up is necessary to assess delayed complications such as recurrent fracture and implant loosening.</p><p>In our study, Case 1 involved a PPAF after BHA, while Case 2 occurred after THA. The former underwent early ORIF without the need for stem revision. In contrast, the latter was initially managed non-operatively, but following a second fall with increased displacement, ORIF with acetabular reconstruction using a cage and femoral stem revision was performed two months after injury. Intraoperatively, the procedure was prolonged due to extensive scar tissue and increased bleeding.</p><p>In Japan, procedures such as BHA and THA are typically performed by hip surgeons, and due to limited experience with acetabular fractures, conservative management tends to be favored. However, PPAFs generally require surgical intervention, as conservative treatment frequently fails [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Early surgical management may be the most effective strategy to avoid poor outcomes [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Peterson et al. reported that 75% of Type IIIA fractures eventually required revision surgery [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and even if the cup appears stable immediately after the fracture, the mechanical stress of weight-bearing can lead to progressive loosening [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Minimally invasive plate fixation in the early phase may help avoid the need for more extensive revision. Therefore, collaboration between hip surgeons and orthopedic trauma surgeons is essential to ensure timely and appropriate management of PPAF.</p><p>Surgical treatment of acetabular fractures following BHA and THA should be based on fracture classification and implant stability, with a choice among conservative management, plate fixation, and revision arthroplasty. However, early surgical intervention generally offers favorable outcomes. Further accumulation of cases is necessary to optimize treatment strategies and evaluate long-term clinical outcomes in patients with PPAF.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This report demonstrates certain advantages of surgical treatment for PPAF; however, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, as this is a case report involving only two patients, further prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and reproducibility of the proposed strategies. Second, not all PPAFs necessarily require surgical intervention. Careful patient selection is essential to maximize surgical benefits. Third, the management of PPAF often requires collaboration between hip arthroplasty specialists and trauma surgeons, which may limit the generalizability of these strategies to specialized centers equipped with both teams. Fourth, this report lacks objective outcome measures, such as validated functional scores or range of motion data. Fifth, the short follow-up duration precludes evaluation of implant longevity and late complications. Lastly, due to the urgent nature of the surgeries, no osteoporosis-specific interventions were implemented. Future follow-up studies incorporating these elements are planned to provide a more comprehensive assessment of surgical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Surgical management of PPAF following BHA or THA should be selected based on fracture type and implant stability using classification systems such as the modified Paprosky-Della Valle classification. While some cases may be managed conservatively, early surgical intervention generally yields better outcomes. Collaboration between trauma and hip surgeons is essential for optimal treatment. Further case accumulation and long-term follow-up are necessary to evaluate treatment efficacy and establish optimal strategies for managing PPAF.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Kengo Harigane, Dr. Shota Higashihira, and Dr. Daisuke Enomoto for their valuable advice on these cases.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Masahiro Matsumoto, Ichiro Takeuchi, Naomi Kobayashi, Yutaka Inaba</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Masahiro Matsumoto, Hyonmin Choe</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Masahiro Matsumoto</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Ichiro Takeuchi, Hyonmin Choe, Naomi Kobayashi, Yutaka Inaba</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Epidemiology: hip and knee</article-title><source>Orthop Clin North Am</source><person-group>
