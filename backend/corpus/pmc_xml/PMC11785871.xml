In addition to NMDA receptor co-agonists, D-serine is a ligand for glutamate delta receptors (GluDs) and interacts with the ligand-binding domain with low affinity. However, D-serine binding does not lead to typical ion channel currents in GluD1 or GluD2 but may contribute to synaptic plasticity. In the developing brain, D-serine binding to GluD2 facilitates long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. However, the influence of D-serine on GluD1's interaction with its amino terminal domain synaptogenic ligand Cbln1 and its subsequent impact on synaptic function and behavior remains unexplored. Here, we found that D-serine inhibited the interaction between Cbln1 and GluD1 in an in vitro cell-binding assay. This effect was concentration-dependent, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of&#x02009;~&#x02009;300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M. Furthermore, in ex vivo central amygdala (CeA) slices application of recombinant Cbln1 (rCbln1), consistent with its synaptogenic property, produced a robust increase in excitatory neurotransmission and GluD1 expression. This effect of rCbln1 was partially blocked by pre-treatment with D-serine. Finally, in behavioral experiments, we observed that the pro-nociceptive effect of intra-CeA injection of rCbln1 was inhibited by pre-treatment with D-serine. In addition, the antinociceptive effect of intra-CeA rCbln1 injection in an inflammatory pain model was blocked by D-serine. Overall, these results demonstrated that D-serine binding to GluD1 reduces its interaction with Cbln1, which may be relevant to synaptic plasticity and behavior.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par3">

The iGluRs are classified into four subfamilies: &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and delta receptors. Structurally, iGluRs consist of an extracellular amino terminal domain (ATD), ligand-binding domain (LBD), transmembrane domain (TMD), and intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although GluDs share&#x02009;~&#x02009;20&#x02013;30% structural similarity with other iGluRs, they do not function as typical ligand-gated ion channels in a heterologous expression system. Instead, studies have shown that GluDs function as synapse organizers by forming a tripartite bridge by binding to the transsynaptic molecule (Cblns) which in turn bind presynaptic neurexins (Nrxns). This GluD-Cbln-Nrxn transsynaptic network plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of parallel fiber-Purkinje cells (PF-PC) and thalamostriatal, hippocampal, and parabrachioamygdala synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Although GluDs do not function as typical ion channels, their LBD is capable of binding endogenous ligands such as D-serine, glycine, and GABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The binding affinity of D-serine for GluD2, estimated using isothermal titration calorimetry, is&#x02009;~&#x02009;800&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but is significantly higher for GluD1 (K<sub>d</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;160&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. D-serine induces conformational changes in the receptor, as evidenced by its effect on constitutive currents from mutant GluD2 and GluD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the native system, D-serine binding to GluDs has been found to induce currents indirectly by activating metabotropic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. More recently, it has been suggested that GluDs may function as ligand-gated ion channels when they are in their transsynaptic configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; however, this finding requires further validation in native systems. Furthermore, the binding of D-serine to GluDs also contributes to synaptic plasticity. For instance, D-serine binding to GluD2 induces long-term depression at the PF-PC synapses in the developing cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and D-serine binding to GluD1 is necessary for the formation of inhibitory synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. More recently, it has been found that GABA binds to GluD1 with a lower affinity and is important for plasticity at inhibitory synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite these converging findings on the role of D-serine on GluD function and signaling, it is not well understood whether there is an allosteric interaction between D-serine and Cbln1 binding to GluD1. Such an interaction may affect the synaptogenic activity of Cbln1 and the effect of ligand binding on plasticity. Here, we studied the effect of D-serine on GluD1 interaction with Cbln1 and its downstream effects on synaptic function and behavior. We found that D-serine reduced Cbln1 binding to GluD1 in an in vitro cell-binding assay. Furthermore, D-serine inhibited the increase in excitatory neurotransmission induced by recombinant Cbln1 (rCbln1) in CeA neurons. In addition, D-serine reduced the rCbln1-induced upregulation of GluD1 in the synaptic compartment. Furthermore, we found that D-serine inhibited the pro-nociceptive effect of intra-CeA rCbln1 in na&#x000ef;ve animals as well as the antinociceptive effect of rCbln1 in an inflammatory pain model. Together, these results identified a previously unknown interaction between the GluD1 LBD and ATD ligands. We hypothesize that such interactions may play a role in synaptic plasticity in physiological and pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par15">COS-7 cells (ATCC Cat# CRL-1651, RRID: CVCL_0224) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2&#x000a0;mM L-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics in a humidified incubator under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cell binding assay</title><p id="Par16">The interaction between Cbln1-HA (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and GluD1 was assessed using an in vitro binding assay as previously described with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

The interaction between GluDs and Cbln1 can be replicated in heterologous expression systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed the effect of D-serine on the binding of rCbln1 to GluD1 in an in vitro cell-binding assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, 1B). A concentration&#x02013;response curve was generated using 0.1, 0.3, 1- and 3-mM D-serine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). We found that increasing concentrations of D-serine reduced the binding of rCbln1 to GluD1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and D).

Thus D-serine inhibits rCbln1 binding to GluD1 in a concentration-dependent manner. To further confirm that binding of D-serine to the LBD of GluD1 is required for the observed reduction in rCbln1 interaction with GluD1, we compared wildtype and mutant GluD1R526K with impaired D-serine binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in cell-binding assay.

For these experiments, we developed an ex vivo brain slice model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Acute brain slices containing the CeA region were prepared. Slices were pre-treated with D-serine (300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) (or vehicle) followed by incubation with rCbln1 (or vehicle), as described in the Methods section. During the incubation of brain slices, MK-801 was included in the aCSF in all groups tested to eliminate the potential NMDA receptor-dependent effects of D-serine. After the incubation period, slices were transferred to the recording chamber, and mEPSC recordings were obtained from CeC neurons, which are known to be enriched in GluD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consistent with the known synaptogenic property of Cbln1, incubation with rCbln1 produced a robust increase in both the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in CeC neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B&#x02013;D). D-serine application significantly reduced the rCbln1-induced increase in the mEPSC amplitude (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). In addition, pre-treatment with D-serine modestly, but not significantly, prevented the increase in the frequency of mEPSC produced by rCbln1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). We also tested the ability of D-serine in inhibiting rCbln1 effects on mEPSC post-rCbln1 application. D-serine did not prevent rCbln1-induced increase in mEPSC amplitude and frequency when applied post-rCbln1. It is likely that the synaptogenic effects of rCbln1 are not reversible once initiated. We also confirmed that the facilitatory effect of rCbln1 on excitatory neurotransmission were dependent on GluD1. Application of rCbln1 in GluD1 KO slices did not produce any change in excitatory neurotransmission in CeC neurons confirming that binding of rCbln1 to GluD1 is required for the effects on mEPSC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E&#x02013;G). In preliminary studies we also explored whether application of rCbln1 in recording chamber increases excitatory neurotransmission. A significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSC was noted after application of rCbln1 in recording chamber suggesting rapid effect of rCbln1 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1).

Interestingly, mice that received pre-treatment of D-serine did not show mechanical hyperalgesia upon intra-CeA injection of rCbln1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, E). Thus, D-serine blocked the rCbln1-induced increase in mechanical hypersensitivity.

Moreover, injection of MK-801 into the CeA prior to D-serine and rCbln1 did not influence the outcome, suggesting that these effects were independent of NMDA receptor activation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, E).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>D-serine administration in the central amygdala counteracts the nociceptive&#x000a0;effects of Cbln1. <bold>A</bold> Schematic depicting the working hypothesis that D-serine binding to GluD1 affects nociceptive signaling. <bold>B</bold> Schematic of the experimental design: C57BL/6 mice underwent cannulation surgery and were administered D-serine, rCbln1, and/or both into the CeA.

Therefore, we tested whether the effect of rCbln1 could be inhibited by D-serine. After baseline measurements of footpad mechanical sensitivity, CFA was injected into the right hind paw of na&#x000ef;ve animals and mechanical sensitivity was tested at 6, 24, and 48&#x000a0;h post CFA injection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F).

Similar to the above experiment, the injection of MK-801 in the CeA, prior to D-serine&#x02009;+&#x02009;rCbln1, did not affect the results, suggesting that these effects were independent of NMDA receptor activation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G).

Furthermore, the effect of D-serine on GluD1-Cbln1 signaling in ex vivo and in vivo studies is independent of NMDA receptor activation. In in vitro experiments, we found that D-serine produced a&#x000a0;concentration-dependent inhibition of rCbln1 binding to GluD1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of &#x02009;~&#x02009;300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, which is consistent with previous reports of&#x000a0;D-serine affinity for&#x000a0;GluD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In ex vivo brain slices, D-serine partly blocked the rCbln1-induced increase in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic recruitment of GluD1. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that the nociceptive action of rCbln1 in na&#x000ef;ve animals was effectively counteracted by D-serine administration. Additionally, D-serine inhibited the analgesic effects of rCbln1 in an inflammatory pain model. Together, these data demonstrate that D-serine can inhibit rCbln1 from binding to GluD1 and initiating downstream signaling.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Allosteric interaction between D-serine and Cbln1 binding</title><p id="Par35">Based on our in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo data, we propose that D-serine binds to the LBD of GluD1 and induces a conformational change that hinders the interaction between Cbln1 and GluD1, thus preventing the formation of a tripartite complex and thwarting GluD1-Cbln1 signaling. The GluD-Cbln1-Nrxn triad (~&#x02009;24&#x000a0;nm) occupies a tight synaptic cleft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Cbln1 is a dimer of trimers, and each trimer interacts with one of the four ATDs of tetrameric GluD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, the two hexameric molecules of Cbln1 bind to a single GluD. Upon binding of D-serine, changes similar to AMPA receptor desensitization occur, leading to breakdown of the ATD interface. In this scenario, the flexibility of hexameric Cbln1 may not be sufficient to bind two ATDs simultaneously, thereby reducing Cbln1 affinity for GluD1. Alternatively, it has been proposed that closure of the LBD of GluDs by D-serine contracts the GluD receptor towards the postsynaptic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This contraction may be responsible for the dissociation of the trans-synaptic complex. Given that Cbln1 binds to Nrxn with higher affinity (Kd&#x02009;~&#x02009;47&#x000a0;nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] than to GluD1 (Kd&#x02009;~&#x02009;100&#x000a0;nM), it is possible that Cbln1 dissociates from GluD1 but remains bound to Nrxn. The effects of D-serine alone on synaptoneurosome experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), as discussed below, are consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par36">The majority of our data examined whether the rCbln1 interaction with GluD1 was inhibited by D-serine. The effect of D-serine alone in disrupting the existing trans-synaptic GluD1-Cbln1 interaction was not directly tested in a heterologous system. However, our results from brain slice experiments provide some clues. We observed an intriguing reduction in Cbln1 content in synaptoneurosomes after D-serine treatment alone. This implies that D-serine dissociates the transsynaptic interaction between GluD1 and Cbln1. As discussed above, since the affinity of Cbln1 is higher for Nrxn1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], it is possible that upon dissociation from GluD1, the Cbln1-Nrxn1&#x003b1; complex may traffic to non-synaptic regions, thereby reducing the Cbln1 content in the synaptoneurosomes. This hypothesis is consistent with the complementary reduction in Nrxn1&#x003b1; expression in the synaptoneurosome fraction following D-serine treatment alone. However, it should be noted that D-serine alone did not produce any change in GluD1 content in synaptoneurosomes, GluD1 expression in IHC, or mEPSC characteristics. It is possible that a longer duration of incubation with D-serine may reveal functional changes in CeA synapses or GluD1 expression. Alternatively, it is possible that D-serine-induced changes in Cbln1 content in the synaptoneurosome are a transient pharmacological response. Also relevant is the observation that the intra-CeA injection of D-serine alone did not affect nociception. Thus, D-serine alone may not produce similar changes, such as a reduction in synaptic Cbln1, in vivo, as observed ex vivo. Alternatively, this could be attributed to the diffusion or metabolism of D-serine from the site of action, resulting in a lack of change in nociception 3&#x000a0;h post-D-serine injection. The synaptic concentrations of D-serine are typically in low micromolar range and D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) enzyme can potentially reduce the concentration given intracranially rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus it is possible that D-serine present in CeA synapses gets degraded or uptaken which may restrict its effect in vivo. It will be interesting to evaluate whether physiological or pathological conditions involving a longer duration of exposure to elevated levels of D-serine may produce effects mediated by the redistribution of Cbln1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Robust effects of recombinant Cbln1 in ex vivo central amygdala slices</title><p id="Par37">In electrophysiological studies, we found that rCbln1 application produced a dramatic increase in both the frequency and amplitude of mEPSC in CeA neurons. Given the increase in GluD1 expression upon rCbln1 application, we predicted that there would be an increase in synapse formation and not merely an increase in presynaptic transmitter release, which would account for the rCbln1-induced increase in the frequency of mEPSCs. The increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs suggests the incorporation of AMPA into the synapses. Although the direct effect of rCbln1 on AMPA receptor expression has not been examined in the CeA, it has previously been found that ablation of GluD1 or GluD2 leads to a contrasting increase in AMPA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Conversely, it is possible that overexpression or upregulation of GluD1 leads to reduced AMPA receptors. However, we found that short exposure to rCbln1 increased GluD1 expression and simultaneously increased the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC, suggesting the recruitment of AMPA receptors. These effects of rCbln1 were observed in the presence of MK-801, suggesting that they were independent of NMDA receptor activation. Another observation in electrophysiological studies is the occurrence of large-amplitude currents by the application of rCbln1. These partly resemble the slow inward currents that are dependent on NMDA receptors and astrocytic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is possible that axosomatic synapses with large postsynaptic appositions may be responsible for these large currents.</p><p id="Par38">These plastic changes induced by rCbln1 were partly blocked by D-serine pre-treatment potentially by blockade of GluD1-Cbln1 interaction. Specifically, D-serine blocked the rCbln1-induced increase in amplitude of AMPA receptor mEPSC, but did not significantly inhibit mEPSC frequency. Furthermore, D-serine blocked the rCbln1-induced increase in GluD1 in the synaptoneurosome fraction but not the overall increase in GluD1 expression in IHC. Thus, D-serine may prevent synaptic changes induced by rCbln1, but may not affect non-synaptic changes or the establishment of new synapses by rCbln1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Implications of allosteric interaction between GluD1 LBD and Cbln1 binding on synaptic organization</title><p id="Par39">One potential consequence of our results is that during early development, regions with high D-serine levels may limit the interaction between Cbln1 and GluD1, and therefore limit the range of GluD1-Cbln1 signaling in synaptogenesis. In the CeA, 39% of neurons express D-serine, and 68% express the serine racemase (SR) enzyme, suggesting a potential functional role for D-serine in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our study suggests that such a role may involve GluD1 in addition to NMDA receptors. Similarly, mechanisms that induce the release of D-serine from glia or neurons may compete with the binding of Cbln1, released in an activity-dependent manner, to GluD1 and the consequent synaptogenic function. This may allow other synaptogenic factors to mediate the synapse formation. It will also be interesting to test the effect of GABA, which was recently shown to bind to the GluD1 LBD on rCbln1 binding to GluD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusions, limitations and future perspectives</title><p id="Par40">Our study has certain limitations. While the in vitro cell-binding assay sheds light on the interaction between Cbln1 and GluD1 in the presence of D-serine, it does not fully capture the complexity of in vivo synaptic conditions. Although ex vivo and in vivo studies substantially mitigated this concern, further research is needed to ascertain whether the concentrations of agents used are physiologically relevant and if similar effects are evident at lower levels that are biologically pertinent. Additionally, our ex vivo studies focused on the short-term effects of D-serine and rCbln1 on excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic changes. Long-term investigations are necessary to determine whether these effects are sustained over time and to explore their potential impact on chronic pain conditions and synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that D-serine inhibits the effects of rCbln1, suggesting a potential for modulating pain pathways and other physiological processes regulated by GluD1-Cbln1 interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="18_2024_5554_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 637 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CeA</term><def><p id="Par4">Central amygdala</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GluD</term><def><p id="Par5">Glutamate delta</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cbln</term><def><p id="Par6">Cerebellin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATD</term><def><p id="Par7">Amino Terminal Domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBD</term><def><p id="Par8">Ligand Binding Domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTD</term><def><p id="Par9">C-terminal domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iGluRs</term><def><p id="Par10">Ionotropic glutamate receptors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NMDA</term><def><p id="Par11">N-methyl-D-aspartate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMPA</term><def><p id="Par12">&#x003b1;-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Siddhesh S.
