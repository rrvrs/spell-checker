The first part included <italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10 participants equipped with 128 and 64 channels gel-based active EEG electrodes in 10 sessions using standard bar feedback presented on a computer monitor. Nine participants were better than random at the 10th session and four improved over time. For the second part we reduced the electrode subset to 9 sponge-based active channels (2 frontal, 7 parietal around Pz) and a portable amplifier. Participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10) were trained each session within VR using bar feedback projected on a wall in the first 5 sessions and then controlling the flow of a water fountain. Participants were able to significantly downregulate their parietal alpha power after 5 sessions and learning occurred at the group level, with 7 participants showing both improvement over time and ability to modulate. However, these results were only shown during the fountain feedback and both ability and learning were non-significant in the VR projector condition. Based on self-reports, after excluding participants performing movements and closing their eyes, no particular mental strategy, such as relaxation, breathing or mental calculus was identified to help with alpha modulation. The hypothesized behavioral effect on sense of presence was not found nor any neurophysiological changes in fronto-parietal connectivity. While NF did not improve the sense of presence, we succeeded in adapting real-time NF training for high immersive VR technology via seamlessly embedded feedback in the form of a water fountain. The study showcases that NF is possible with sponge electrodes and portable EEG that would prove convenient in end-user (at home) or clinical setup.

It enabled high immersive VR via tracking the users&#x02019; movements. Combined with broadly available 3D development tools, it is now possible to generate virtual environments with virtual agents that provide immersive experiences. While applications have initially been most popular for gaming, there are many promising applications of HMD devices in education, exercise and healthcare (for review, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hamad and Jia, 2022</xref>).</p><p>HMD-presented VR (HMD-VR) has been successful at creating immersive experiences (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Slater and Sanchez-Vives, 2014</xref>) and eliciting heightened sense of presence in virtual environment (VE, <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Steuer, 1992</xref>). Participants experience a sense of &#x0201c;being there&#x0201d; in the VE (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Steuer, 1992</xref>) in opposition to where the body currently is (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Slater and Usoh 1993</xref>). Although often used synonymously, immersion and sense of presence can be distinguished as follows: immersion is quantifiable by objective measures and refers to the system&#x02019;s ability to present an environment highly realistically, while blocking or replacing sensory inputs (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez-Vives and Slater, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Slater and Wilbur, 1997</xref>). In contrast, sense of presence is a subjective sensation of the participant experiencing something as really happening (for further disambiguation between immersion and sense of presence, see <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Slater, 1999</xref>). More immersive environments lead to higher sense of presence (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Cummings and Bailenson, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have investigated neural correlates of the sense of presence (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Baumgartner et al., 2006</xref>). They subjected participants to two VR rollercoaster tracks, one very flat and the other labeled as &#x0201c;spectacular.&#x0201d; The most arousing track was associated with an increased sense of presence and an increased activity in the parietal cortex. Authors found a prefrontal-parietal top-down inhibition that was associated with decreased sense of presence. <xref rid="ref0001" ref-type="bibr">Baumgartner et al. (2008)</xref> replicated their study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and found in low presence participants a similar top-down inhibition pattern involving the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and large areas covering the parietal cortex involving the superior parietal cortex (SPG), the precuneus (IPG), and the parietal cingular cortex (PCC). Kober and colleagues reported similar findings (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Kober et al., 2012</xref>). They asked the participants to navigate through a maze, displayed either on a monitor or via an interactive VR wall. The interactive VR wall condition, that evoked a higher sense of presence, was associated with a decrease in power as compared to baseline indicating increased parietal activation. Decrease in time-related power (TRPD) were observed in the low alpha range (8-12&#x0202f;Hz) at the right parietal (Pz, P2 and P4) and right parieto-occipital (POz, PO2 and PO4) channels. Time-related power inhibition (TRPI) and TRPD express the power during a time window in percentage of a separate reference window such as a baseline recording. In contrast, event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Pfurtscheller, 1992</xref>) are measured in relation to time windows with individual baselines preceding their related event. The results also showed a stronger functional connectivity between frontal and parietal areas in the low presence group (i.e., using a monitor). The authors interpreted the increase in parietal activity as a result of adopting an egocentric, body-centered view evoked by the interactive VR wall.</p><p>On the basis of these results we were aiming at decreasing parietal alpha activity by means of neurofeedback (NF, for review see <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Enriquez-Geppert et al., 2017</xref>) to increase the sense of presence. NF allows for regulation of physiological activity that is usually not perceivable. Instrumental or operant learning (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 1978</xref>; Skinner, 1963) is involved in acquiring such skill. The goal of gaining control of (neuro)physiological activity is to change the related behavior. For example to increase attention by increasing the amplitude of slow cortical potentials (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Birbaumer et al., 1990</xref>). Neurofeedback learning leads to neuroplasticity and then presumably to behavioral change (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Gruzelier, 2009</xref>). It has been used for various applications such as epileptic seizure reduction (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Wyrwicka and Sterman, 1968</xref>), attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome in children (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Arns et al., 2014</xref>), anxiety reduction (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Stokes and Lappin, 2010</xref>), cognitive improvement (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Dessy et al., 2018</xref>), migraine pain reduction (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2020</xref>), or to improve cognitive performance after stroke (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Kleih and Botrel, 2024</xref>). After about 60&#x0202f;years of existence, NF still faces concerns with respect to evidence of the causal relationship between the achieved neuromodulation and behavioral changes, and its specificity (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Loriette et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Thibault and Raz, 2017</xref>). One of the reasons of the lack of evidence may be in the tremendous heterogeneity of study protocols, and reports thereof, and sample sizes. To overcome these shortcomings in the future, guidelines have been provided (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Rogala et al., 2016</xref>) and more recently a consensus has been co-signed by 84 researchers from 80 affiliations aimed at improving standards and reporting of NF studies (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Ros et al., 2020</xref>). In both herein presented studies we strictly followed these recommendations and reported when criteria could not be reached.</p><p>Our two studies were motivated by two factors. Firstly, the potential effect on pain reduction associated with increased sense of presence caused by parietal alpha downregulation. It has been shown that using immersive VR can reduce pain in the context of severe burn injury treatments (<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Maani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2011</xref>) and has been researched as an adjunct treatment for central neuropathic pain (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2020</xref>). Secondly, we were aiming at transposing NF training from a classical 2D presentation to 3D HMD-VR and to integrate the EEG electrodes and amplifier on the HMD. The 3D presentation should be as similar as possible to classic (bar) NF while at the same time be highly immersive. The classic bar feedback seemed essential, as it has been proven that it allows for gaining control over brain activity (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Kober et al., 2015</xref>). There are several limitations associated with the use of HMD and EEG electrodes in one system. The electrode positions are limited adaptable and may cause pressure leading to discomfort after little time.</p><p>Provided previous research, these two studies presented here were an attempt to answer firstly, whether we could increase the sense of presence with NF. For this, Part 1 assessed whether it was possible to train a neurophysiological correlate of the sense of presence and how much training would be needed. The consecutive Part 2 adjusted and translated the NF training of Part 1 fully inside HMD-VR.</p><p>The study in two parts described here were conducted within a project that aimed at reducing chronic pain via the use of VR and BCI, and to provide an easy-to-apply VR-BCI-NF treatment for reducing chronic pain. In a first step &#x02013; presented in this paper &#x02013; the sense of presence, which is negatively associated with pain perception (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2011</xref>), should be increased with NF training by increasing the neuronal correlate associated with the sense of presence. Part 1 concentrated on testing if it was possible to regulate parietal alpha activity and to explore its effects on the sense of presence. Part 2 emphasized on adapting the NF procedure for a more practical approach and therefore the number of electrodes were reduced. Since we were aiming at demonstrating that NF effects both, the neurophysiological and behavioral responses, and NF was required to be practical in clinical and home daily life set-ups, an NF scenario was integrated in VR and transfer sessions without NF were conducted in VR to evaluate the effect of NF training on the sense of presence when no feedback is provided.</p><p>To encourage reproducibility and further research, dataset is publicly available for part 1 <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds005846.v1.0.0" ext-link-type="uri">10.18112/openneuro.ds005846.v1.0.0</ext-link> and part 2 <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds005878.v1.0.0" ext-link-type="uri">10.18112/openneuro.ds005878.v1.0.0</ext-link>.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>We pre-registered the methods, dependent variables and hypotheses on the platform <ext-link xlink:href="http://aspredicted.org" ext-link-type="uri">aspredicted.org</ext-link> (Wharton Lab, University of Pennsylvania, USA).<xref rid="fn0001" ref-type="fn"><sup>1</sup></xref> For this manuscript we improved the original formulation into the following hypotheses:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Parietal alpha power is reduced during NF training after 10 sessions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Parietal alpha power does not differ whether feedback is presented or hidden (transfer).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Parietal alpha power does not differ whether full feedback or positive-only feedback is provided.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Baseline parietal alpha activity remains stable across sessions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>NF-based modulation of parietal alpha power is possible with a reduced subset of electrodes (offline comparison).</p></list-item><list-item><p>NF Training has no long-term effect on sense of presence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increase in fronto-parietal connectivity dlPFC (Broadman area A46) PCC (BA23) and PPC (BA5) as a result of training.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants&#x02019; reported fatigue before recording baseline correlates with baseline alpha power</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Part 1</title><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Part 1 was conducted in 2021.

The system had a dedicated computer unit, a monitor that mirrored the view of the HMD display and a touchpad control panel for the experimenter. From the control panel, the experimenter could start the VR scenario, which consisted of different steps of VTplus&#x02019; VR tutorial that taught participants to move in the VR via the joystick controller, grab objects using controller tracking and button press to complete simple interaction tasks (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The tutorial designed for participants with no previous VR experience also featured countermeasures for VR sickness: movement initiated by the directional buttons was not smooth but consisted of incremental shifts of about half a meter each. After each movement update from the joystick, there was a transient directional reduction of the field of view for reducing cybersickness as recommended by <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes and Feiner (2016)</xref>. The tracking answered naturally to head movements, yet, using natural walking movement to move to target location was discouraged as with 7 m<sup>2</sup> the space for real walking was much smaller than that presented in VR space. The user started the scenario anchored in an invisible avatar with the point of view (camera) matching with the head position tracked by the HMD sensors. Tracked movements would accordingly translate the camera in VR in an unobstructed fashion (i.e., clipping through obstacles). Every movement on the controller moved both the anchor and the attached camera. To evolve in VR, the invisible avatar was constrained by the game engine, i.e., gravity to stick to the ground and collisions with walls. As time passes in VR, users become unaware of their position in the real world and the camera can venture too far from the anchor, participants then find themselves unable to navigate between obstacles, in particular though doors. As a solution, before navigation events, experimenters triggered an event to re-anchor the camera. A projection on the floor represented as footprints, showed the respective location of both camera (red) and anchor (green). Participants were asked to make both footprints coincide, which had the effect of relocating and reorienting them to their start position.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Showcase of the virtual reality device and participant <bold>(A)</bold> and its in-game features including spatial cues [footprints <bold>(B)</bold>, and directional arrows <bold>(C)</bold>] and augmented interactions with the motion-tracked controller <bold>(D)</bold>.

It comprised the full timeline of Part 1 and all instructions about the VR sessions and NF training. Participants were blinded in two aspects: Firstly, they were informed that the targeted feature to modulate was parietal alpha, but we intentionally hid the direction of the relevant change in power (i.e., desynchronization). Secondly, we did not inform them about the behavioral target of the study (i.e., increase the sense of presence). The questionnaires used to measure presence were labeled as &#x0201c;measuring the quality of the VR experience.&#x0201d; If the experimenter was asked about the purpose of the study, the answer was that we were aiming at studying the modulation of parietal alpha since it was associated with cybersickness. Blinding and deceiving were revealed to the participant by the experimenter immediately at the end of the study. Instructions were provided by the experimenter orally, but also directly on the monitor prior to the baseline and NF runs. Due to the lack of respective knowledge, the experimenter was careful not to provide participants any suggestion about what mental strategy should be used to generate a change of parietal alpha activity and not to indicate the required direction. Such neutral instructions were, e.g., the alpha power had to be &#x0201c;steered,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;modulated&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;oriented,&#x0201d; in opposition to words such as &#x0201c;reduced&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;inhibited.&#x0201d;</p><sec id="sec13"><title>NF sessions</title><p>Sessions 1 and 10 lasted longer due to the extra preparing time needed for <italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;128 gel-based EEG channels.

To illustrate these instructions, participants were shown their live EEG activity filtered between 1 to 40&#x0202f;Hz. We asked them to move the head and neck, clench their teeth, blink their eyes repeatedly 3 or 4 times, close their eyes for about 10&#x0202f;s, glance strongly right and left, frown or tap their feet nervously. This step allowed the experimenter to check the EEG signal for potentially inadequately prepared &#x0201c;loose&#x0201d; channels by looking at how much the amplitude drifted and how long it took to readjust.</p><p>In two 90&#x0202f;s trials in one run, the baseline was recorded during which participants were asked to watch the animation of a 3D sphere made of white dots on a black background slowly rotating; trials were separated by a 15&#x0202f;s break. After calibration of the system that determined the average and range of the online signal, there were two online NF runs that lasted about 15&#x0202f;min. The first run with reduced expressivity had positive only feedback (i.e., from the origin, the bar moved only upward). The second run had full range feedback (the bar moved also down from the origin, indicating that the system detected a modulation in the wrong direction). Runs comprised 30 trials, split in 3 blocks with a 30&#x0202f;s break in between. Every 10<sup>th</sup> trial was a &#x0201c;test trial&#x0201d; with no NF provided.

The HMD could accommodate the user wearing glasses. After placing the participant in the starting position, the virtual world was initialized, representing the yard of a one floor building. The participant performed a sequence of different tasks: (1) viewing in all directions; (2) walking to a target and back; (3) grabbing an object with the controller; (4) moving and bending toward a virtual water fountain; (5) opening doors and flipping a light switch; (6) collecting bank notes and depositing them inside a box. To ensure navigation was possible, the participant was re-anchored in VR several times per session. Once about 2&#x0202f;min after the beginning, before drinking from a water fountain (in VR), and circumstantially about 3&#x0202f;min later if unable to cross the first door. Recentering of the solid avatar was required to avoid collisions with the walls. Head tracking only offered a limited radius of movement, and the participant used the directional keypad from the hand controller for any substantial forward-backward movement and rotation (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>All instructions about the task were provided by a pre-recorded voice that either repeated the instruction on failure or validated the participant&#x02019;s progress. There were extra directional arrows dynamically painted on the ground displayed to guide the participant to the next stop. The completion of the tasks in VR lasted 15&#x0202f;min. At the end, the experimenter removed the HMD headset. To avoid bias, the experimenter remained neutral, discrete and avoided unnecessary communication with the participant. The participant had a few seconds to re-habituate to the real world, after which the experimenter asked to answer the VAS scales and IPQ questionnaires at a nearby table. Then the session was finished, and the experimenter returned to a normal communicative state.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec15"><title>Online feature extraction from EEG data</title><p>EEG signal was processed using Python 3.9 with packages numpy1.23.4, scipy1.10.0, pylsl1.16.0, and pyxdf1.16.3.

In MNE the object containing data (i.e., &#x0201c;raw&#x0201d;) was initialized once then duplicated without EEG data but all information about channel position required for spatial filter computation. New EEG signals from the amplifier were then attached in real time to duplicated objects in a cost-effective manner. MNE source code was altered, specifically, we used current source density (CSD) to refine EEG channel signal to their reference-free Laplacian transformations (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Kayser and Tenke, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Perrin et al., 1989</xref>). The code from current source density (CSD) was split in two parts. A first part to determine the model based on baseline data on all 128 or 64 channels, that had an identical montage, and a second part that quickly applied the transformation online. For bandpass and notch filtering of signal epochs, we substituted MNE functions by Butterworth, forward and backwards scipy equivalent (i.e., &#x0201c;filtfilt&#x0201d;).</p><sec id="sec16"><title>Alpha power extraction from baseline</title><p>The EEG signal acquired during baseline was bandpass filtered between 1 to 40&#x0202f;Hz, using acausal Butterworth filters of order 16 and 4, respectively.

It was then split in 2&#x0202f;s epochs, corresponding to the length of the online NF buffer. After ASR treatment, the artifact rejection was strict: epochs exceeding 100&#x0202f;&#x003bc;V amplitude on any channel were discarded. From the artifact free epochs, CSD spatial filtering was applied on the data. Power spectrum density (PSD) was extracted using Welch&#x02019;s method with nfft&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;512. The 3&#x0202f;Hz wide window between 6.8&#x0202f;Hz to 12.7&#x0202f;Hz with the maximum PSD average, determined the alpha peak frequency range. PSD values were converted to dB using 20*log(x) and averaged across frequencies. Since we were using power values, the inaccurate dB formula was corrected during offline analysis to 10*log(x). Also, for readers&#x02019; convenience we refer to dB transformed PSD as &#x0201c;PSD.&#x0201d; The reference for normalizing PSD into <italic>Z</italic>-score was recomputed every session using the first baseline.

Single epochs were bandpass filtered. Then, ASR and CSD models from the baseline were applied on the epoch before extracting PSD from the determined peak window. The mean baseline was subtracted from the extracted PSD and then divided by the standard deviation of the baseline to obtain a <italic>Z</italic>-score. This normalization expresses the power in standard deviations of the reference data (i.e., the baseline). An increase or decrease of power translated numerically with 0 indicating no difference, but also with a 95% theoretical probability that the online signal falls within the limits of &#x02212;1.96 to 1.96 assuming it follows the same mean and distribution as the baseline.

Regardless of session number, the PSD was lower during trials than during calibration. At the group level, participants were therefore successful at desynchronizing subject-specific alpha power in the parietal cortex but did not improve over time when comparing performance in sessions 1 and 10. After running an additional <italic>t</italic>-test at session 1 we found out that 8 participants were already above chance level before any substantial training occurred.</p><p>According to Logan&#x02019;s instance theory of automatization learning follows typically a power trend with steep progress at the beginning and asymptotic performance with training (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Logan, 1992</xref>). Therefore, we fitted the power trend to individual learning curves (<italic>Z</italic>-scores) and found it significant for <italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;5 subjects, indicating learning, albeit not visible on the group level. We may speculate that with more training sessions more subjects would have learned to regulate their alpha activity. In the earlier days of applying neurofeedback for treatment of, e.g., epilepsy (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Sterman, 2010</xref>) or for communication in locked-in patients (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 1999</xref>) NF training continued for several weeks up to months and years. Likewise, for treating ADHD in children and adults, the number of training sessions is considerably higher (e.g., 30 in <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec41"><title>Validation</title><p>To provide uninterrupted feedback to the participant during online NF, there was artifact detection but flagged signals were not rejected. We assessed whether there were differences in average alpha power between online and offline as large differences would impact perceived performance. Results indicated no difference in alpha power during the NF trials between online and offline trials but found a reduced power during online baseline trials. While online baseline trials already had artifact rejection, the offline analysis added interpolation of bad channels while being stricter with respect to amplitude threshold. This significant difference in alpha power subsequently translated into offline <italic>Z</italic>-scores being 0.17 lower than online scores, which translates to better NF performance offline than online. Still, results indicated significant difference in alpha power between baseline and trials in both online and offline pipelines. It directly demonstrates participants were able to modulate their activity via NF. Also, descriptively, when visualizing the <italic>Z</italic>-scores averages for every participant at every session we find very close offline and online results regardless of the artifact rejection method (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec42"><title>Strategies</title><p>We noticed a recurring pattern in the strategies used for modulating parietal alpha. Five out of the nine participants used a strategy related to breathing, either breathing deeply or even withholding their breath. Although breathing worked well for some subjects, it is not what we were aiming at with NF as it is a strategy using voluntary bodily changes instead of mental imagery. Overall, we could not identify any specific mental strategy that was particularly effective or commonly used by participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec43"><title>Channel reduction</title><p>As mentioned in the validation section, there was a significantly better average <italic>Z</italic>-score in the offline artifact filtered pipeline as compared to the online average, but this was found in baseline trials and not the case during online NF trials, showing that participants were successful at keeping their artifacts low, and that the system could operate well in real-time. The offline analysis with reduced number of channels yielded reduced performance (<italic>Z</italic>-scores), but alpha power was still reduced. Individual offline learning curves remained similar and only one participant remained on chancel level. We may speculate from these results that extended NF training might be necessary for successful parietal alpha power down regulation. Part 2 of this Study investigated performance when providing participants with NF from 9 channels only.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec44"><title>Behavioral results and VR experience</title><p>Although subjects successfully reduced their parietal alpha power, we found no effect on the sense of presence. This may be because we did not instruct them to re-use their strategies applied during NF sessions. The number of sessions was presumably too low to evoke any longer lasting effects on parietal alpha. Furthermore, the sense of presence was already rated high at the beginning such that it might have been difficult to further increase it with NF.</p></sec><sec id="sec45"><title>Connectivity</title><p>We hypothesized decreased frontal inhibition on parietal cortex when experiencing presence. The connectivity analysis, however, did not return any significant difference in connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA-7 SPL) and the parietal cortex (BA-23) between session 1 and session 10. This is in line with the behavioral results.</p></sec><sec id="sec46"><title>Limitations</title><p>Neither a control group was included nor an inverse task was applied that would have allowed us to draw conclusions about the specificity of found effects. However, as we were aiming at exploring learning of parietal alpha modulation and its potential effect on the sense of presence, a control group was not compulsory at this point. With <italic>N</italic> =&#x0202f;10 the sample size was small and with 10 sessions training time short. Traditional NF studies comprised many more sessions (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Arns et al., 2014</xref>) providing more time for learning. However, the late start of the project (due to the Covid-19 pandemic) with no extension of funding, did not allow for longer training time. Further, we did not encourage the participants to apply their strategies during moving in the VR environment. Having said this, in the realm of BCI research 10 sessions are a considerable number of measurements allowing for within subject analysis of learning effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec47"><title>Conclusion Part 1</title><p>To conclude, participants were able to modulate their parietal alpha activity when being provided with NF in comparison to the baseline activity.

With EEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals as input (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Soekadar et al., 2021</xref>), BCIs can enable control over an application such as a robot, neuroprosthesis, or communication and interaction software (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 2014</xref>) via different approaches to detect changes in brain activity. There are different levels of active participation of the user for generating a control signal (<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Zander and Kothe, 2011</xref>). One of them is the active modulation of the targeted brain activity. NF fosters learning to modulate specific components of the EEG to improve or restore brain functions via neuroplasticity (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Loriette et al., 2021</xref>). Prior to the widespread use of HMD devices, most EEG-VR studies were conducted on stereoscopic 3D monitors, walls or at a larger scale on cave augmented virtual environments (CAVE) but without head tracking. Reviews including BCI-VR (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Lotte et al., 2012</xref>) and NF-VR (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2021</xref>) studies highlight that VR provides a more fun, engaging and motivating experience and requires shorter training than conventional paradigms presented on a simple 2-dimensional video screen, while enabling recovery of brain functions in clinical groups.</p><p>EEG-VR studies have raised new challenges and limitations (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Kober et al., 2017a</xref>), notably the increase in signal artifacts due to movements and extra equipment placed on the head (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2023</xref>) or the issue of cybersickness for which a NF study (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2022</xref>) attempted to influence its identified correlates (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Krokos and Varshney, 2022</xref>).</p><p>In Part 1 we have demonstrated that it was possible to modulate parietal alpha power in real time via NF. In Part 2 we aimed at evaluating (1) the feasibility of translating the same NF protocol into VR, and (2) how the reduced set of 9 electrodes would affect downregulation of parietal alpha power.

To determine whether the sample size was large enough to replicate Part 1, we used calculations of the main effect of trial type (baseline versus trials) in PSD using gPower, with the following requirements: 5 training sessions, partial eta square of 0.035 (note that we used the more conservative generalized eta square from the results of Part 1), correlation among repetitions of 0.4 and only 1 experimental group. From the 10 participants suggested we increased the sample to 15 for a total number of training sessions of 75. Data collection was around mid-2021, and thus, still under the influence of the pandemic. For this reason the number of sessions was reduced from 10 to 5. One participant dropped out due to a COVID-19 infection. Hence, all results are based on a sample size of <italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;14 participants (mean age 24&#x0202f;years, SD&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1.93, 10 female) performing 5 sessions of NF training. None were participants in Part 1. In this study, we prioritized the number of participants over the number of training sessions. All participants were trained for NF. Thus, no control group was investigated in Part 2.</p></sec><sec id="sec52"><title>Setup</title><p>A sponge-based system with active electrodes was used that does not require extended preparation times and washing the hair after participation. While prioritizing convenience, we used a traditional gel-based system once to compare the two. For the gel-based system 9 active electrodes (actiCAP, Brain Products GmbH) were used on their original cap and connected to a BrainAmp amplifier (Brain Products GmbH). Nine active electrodes were placed over cylinder-shaped sponges soaked in an electrolyte solution (potassium chloride and water) for enabling good skin contact. The electrodes were socketed on a different EEG cap that was more elastic (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Both gel and sponge-based systems used the same portable LiveAmp amplifier (Brain Products GmbH). Both gel-based and sponge-based montages followed the international 10&#x02013;20 system (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Nuwer et al., 1999</xref>). The reference (REF) and ground (GND) were Ag/AgCl electrodes placed on the earlobes, each at one side of an ear clip placed on the left earlobe and prepared for recording with electrolyte gel. The online transmission of EEG signals to the NF computer was granted by wireless Bluetooth connectivity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Participant seated and equipped with 9 channel EEG caps (left: actiCAP with silver-silver chloride electrodes and electrolyte gel; right: actiCAP slim with sponges soaked with potassium chloride solution (Brain Products GmbH) and HMD, currently attending the baseline measurement of the projector scenario).

The lateral strap secured the HMD on the head with comfort and allowed for accessing all midline channels from Fz to POz. The HMD was then carefully placed on top of the EEG cap, and signals were checked again. The lock-in place mechanisms of the HMD that pressed the frontal pole area and the occipital areas together with cushion pads intended at stabilizing the HMD on the head also helped prevent the EEG cap holding sponges from sliding.</p></sec><sec id="sec53"><title>Virtual reality</title><p>The participant was seated on a chair in VR. After the HMD was carefully placed on top of the EEG cap on the participant&#x02019;s head it remained fixed until the end of the training. In this study, the participant remained seated on a chair for the whole duration of the experiment. The high immersive VR world depicted two different scenarios.</p><p>The first scenario for NF training was in the same virtual location used in Part 1 and introduced two virtual scenes: an NF-controlled virtual projector indoors (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>), and NF-controlled fountain outside in the yard (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figures 10A</xref>,<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The experimenter pressed a button to move the participant (i.e., &#x0201c;teleport&#x0201d;) between the scenes. The first scene started at the back of an office room. In the &#x0201c;projector&#x0201d; condition the participant faced a wall screen that displayed a 2D bar feedback as similar as possible to the feedback that was provided on a monitor during Part 1. A vertical bar with an origin of 0 would move up or down depending on the NF score (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>). The second scene was a transcription of the bar feedback projected on a water fountain outside of the same building in the yard. In the &#x0201c;fountain&#x0201d; condition, the participant faced a fountain 3&#x02013;4 meters away. The natural vertical spray of water could range to a height of about 3&#x0202f;m and would move instantaneously following the calculated NF values computed and transmitted at a rate of 10 times per second. When the NF value was minimal (<italic>Z</italic>-score of 1.96) the spray was almost invisible, in its rocky bed (see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figures 10A</xref>,<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), at 0 it would be midway, and at &#x02212;1.96 it would reach maximum height. By default, the spray remained mid-height at 0 to inform the participant of the &#x0201c;threshold&#x0201d; for which no further specific cue was provided in VR space.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Aerial view of the Fountain scenario in VR and <bold>(B)</bold> by the point of view of the participant.

The scenario featured a VR walk on top of a hill in the countryside in the summertime with a panoramic outlook on farmlands (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D</xref>): Birds are chirping, and the sun is shining high in the sky with little to no clouds. A few middle-aged non-playing characters randomly walked the small paths and occasionally sat on the benches around the participants. There were 4 runs of either &#x0201c;exploration,&#x0201d; during which they were instructed to freely explore the environment or &#x0201c;transfer&#x0201d; during which they were instructed while exploring to continuously &#x0201c;move the bar up&#x0201d; like during the NF training but during an extended duration of 5&#x0202f;min. There was neither an NF-specific trial structure nor any feedback.</p></sec><sec id="sec54"><title>Behavioral measures</title><p>For evaluating sense of presence, we used again the IPQ scale at the end of every session. VAS for discomfort, nausea and sense of presence were assessed within the VE. Participants were asked via a pre-recorded voice to rate, using their voice, their level between 0 (not at all) to 10 (maximally). The audio was manually played from the experimenter who wrote down the answers.</p></sec><sec id="sec55"><title>Study timeline</title><p>The study comprised 6 EEG sessions each conducted on separate days within two weeks. The last session was a transfer session.</p><p>There were 5 sessions of NF in total. For sessions 1 to 4, we used a portable EEG system with sponge-based electrodes that was easy to set up and remove. To assess the signal quality of the sponge-based electrodes, we used active gel-based electrodes in the 5th session. The procedure for NF and transfer sessions are depicted in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>. By alternating between feedback modalities, we could investigate short term effects of time within the session although the projector modality always came first.</p><fig position="float" id="fig11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Timeline of Part 2 including 5 NF training sessions and a transfer session.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnins-19-1476264-g011" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec56"><title>Data extraction</title><p>The data extraction pipeline was adapted from Part 1. We reduced the number of input channels to 9 and tried to depart as little as possible from the methods used in Part 1. This pertains to the appearance of the feedback, the timings and the instructions provided to the participants, including not telling them about the real purpose of the study and not giving any indication about the direction of the power modulation. However, we added an artifact rejection when extracting mean and SD from baseline recordings. This artifact rejection specifically helped after noticing strong artifacts caused by movement. Also, to adapt to the low number of available channels, Artifact Subspace Rejection was disabled and the frontal channels only served for threshold-based artifact rejection. Hence, the current source density algorithm only used the signals from the 7 parietal channels. For baseline <italic>Z</italic>-score calibration and all the offline analysis, the artifact rejection threshold was lowered from 150 to 100&#x0202f;&#x003bc;V. As in Part 1, no artifact rejection was applied during real time feedback, only detection. Also, during offline analysis, after bandpass filtering we interpolated non-Pz channels if at least 33% of the epochs were flagged as artifacts on these channels, followed by artifact removal via the threshold method. Frontal channels AF3 and AF4 were dropped and CSD was applied on channels CP1, CP2, P1, Pz, P2, PO3, PO4. PSD from channel Pz was extracted using Welch&#x02019;s method with nfft&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;512 from which frequencies between 9 to 12&#x0202f;Hz were averaged. The decision to keep the CSD spatial filter even with a small number of channels seemed appropriate after validation from the simulated subset in Part 1.</p><p>For the data recorded during the transfer session, every run was split in 2&#x0202f;s epochs after bandpass filtering between 1 to 40&#x0202f;Hz. Epochs containing artifacts superior to 100&#x0202f;&#x003bc;V were rejected. We extracted the PSD of channel Pz for each epoch via Welch&#x02019;s method, averaging power values returned between 9&#x0202f;Hz to 12&#x0202f;Hz.</p></sec><sec id="sec57"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Dependent variables were parietal alpha <italic>Z</italic>-scores and PSD.

This may have increased the workload which in turn may lower performance (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000e4;thner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Riccio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Zickler et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to Part 1, transfer trials were not significantly different from NF trials, indicating that in good performers the transition to real world conditions, in which no feedback is available, can be readily achieved. Real world application was also supported by the finding that the sponge-based electrodes, which are more comfortable, enabled training and did not lead to more artifacts as compared to gel-based electrodes.</p><p>As in Part 1, no specific strategy proved better than another. Overall participants used more active intentional strategies. Four out of 7 good performers used inner voice or language related strategies. One third of the participants used relaxation or breathing strategies which, however, were not maintained to the very end, very likely due to perceived ineffectiveness. This is somewhat in contrast to reports from Part 1, where participants tested active strategies and then switched to relaxation and breathing techniques after a few sessions. We may speculate that reduced external stimulation from the sound insulated cabin may have increased self-awareness in contrast to the stimulus rich and dynamic VR environment (e.g., fountain produced different noise depending on spray height), and that this may have fostered performance (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Kober et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The transfer session was globally successful at keeping participants engaged in the VE and all reported attempting to transfer their NF ability to move up a hypothetical bar or fountain. Yet the transfer runs during the transfer session did not lead to decreased parietal alpha activity as compared to non-transfer exploration runs nor any increase in sense of presence.</p><p>The targeted behavioral variable sense of presence did not increase as a result of NF training, neither when looking at the NF-learner group nor in correlation analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec70"><title>Limitations study 2</title><p>As we adapted and transferred the methods from Part 1 of the Study to Part 2 for allowing NF within VR, we had to accept tradeoffs, namely training time and decreased signal-to-noise ratio. The number of training sessions was lower than the average of 7.7 reported in a meta-analysis from <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Rogala et al. (2016)</xref>. Comparing further, a recent meta-analysis of studies using NF for treating chronic pain included in the majority at least 12 sessions up to 58 sessions (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Hesam-Shariati et al., 2022</xref>); however, such a large amount of sessions was not feasible within this project. The choice of sponge-based electrodes on a portable system, the tremendous reduction from 128/64 channels to a subset of 9 channels were tradeoffs that we deemed necessary if aiming at transferring NF technology into VR and broader use of such technology, since the easiness of setting up such a system is a relevant aspect for avoiding non-use (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 2014</xref>). As the vision of our project was to train patients with chronic pain such as experienced in fibromyalgia, it was paramount to reduce constraints that were identified in focus groups (conducted specifically for this project) with such patients and health care professionals (unpublished data from <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Beck, 2023</xref>). Electrode preparation time and washing hair after using gel-based electrodes were specifically mentioned as hurdles which confirmed earlier findings (<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">Zickler et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our training sessions had two different VR scenarios (indoor projector and outdoor fountain), adding complexity for the participants. The duration of a session was short to limit the discomfort associated with the VR HMDs. Training time was reduced from a duration of 7&#x0202f;h30 in Part 1 to 1&#x0202f;h40, which very likely affected learning. Such short training times are suboptimal since learning to regulate a neurophysiological activity requires practice (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Birbaumer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;bler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Lacroix, 1986</xref>).</p><p>When designing Part 1 of the Study, we were worried that activity in the occipital cortex would result from animated feedback and environment (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000e4;ndel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Kastner and Ungerleider, 2000</xref>) or closing the eyes which may have led to higher alpha in the parietal areas (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Barry et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, we chose to narrow down the localization of the parietal alpha activity to Pz using CSD spatial patterns. Since the simulated offline reduction to 9 channels showed significant NF ability during Part 1, we used it as spatial filtering also for Part 2. With hindsight, other methods such as simple Laplacian spatial filter, interpolation or average of the parietal channels could have been simple methods to increase signal to noise ratio in the single electrode Pz.</p><p>We did not provide participants with a specific mental strategy, which may facilitate skill acquisition as known for regulation of the alpha power over sensorimotor cortices via motor imagery. Our approach was based on the premise that NF learning can be achieved by operant conditioning which does not require a strategy (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Sterman and Friar, 1972</xref>). Furthermore, we could not find specific strategies recommended, such as for motor imagery, for regulating alpha in the parietal region at channel Pz. Therefore, we assessed the strategies of the participants, but found no conclusive results toward any specific mental imagery.</p><p>One may consider the lack of a control group a limitation. However, as we conducted a feasibility Study (Phase 1) it is justified to focus on the practicability of the experimental setup and whether it allows the participants modulating the signal of interest.</p><p>A limitation present in both parts of our study is the use of infinite impulse response filters for bandpass filtering, which may introduce a delay between 20 to 100 milliseconds to the real-time bandpassed signal. Since it is known that delaying feedback impedes learning (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Belinskaia et al., 2020</xref>), finite impulse response filters with mitigation for startup transient may represent a better alternative.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec71"><title>General discussion</title><p>In Part 1 of our study we assessed the feasibility of increasing parietal alpha power via real-time NF to increase the sense of presence in VR. In Part 2 we transferred the training to immersive VR, with a portable and more practical EEG system comprising a reduced number of electrodes.</p><p>Using log&#x02013;log individual regression curves on the performance of single participants allowed us to profile our participants into three groups: learners, fixed performers and inefficient participants. The distribution between these three groups changed substantially between Part 1 and 2. In Part 2 we found no fixed performers. The proportion of participants able to modulate parietal alpha at the end of the training was reduced from 89% in Part 1 to 50% in Part 2, and those were all learners. Results of Part 2 confirm that NF learning is possible within a short training time and with few EEG channels for NF, but longer training may be necessary for some participants and for improving and stabilizing performance (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Rogala et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Kastner and Ungerleider, 2000</xref>). However, the optimal signal specific NF training time is still not known. While VR environments may be more entertaining, they may also distract participants from the main purpose of regulating a specific brain response.</p><p>We could not achieve the intended increase of the sense of presence in VR. Sense of presence was high from the beginning and remained stable over time. To address this specific issue, future studies attempting to modulate sense of presence may benefit from alternating between high and low sense presence environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec72"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To summarize, (1) Regulating parietal alpha activity was possible after short-term training with few EEG electrodes, but better after long-term training and higher a number of EEG channels that feed into the NF signal. (2) Successful down regulation of parietal alpha power did not affect the sense of presence, at least not if rated high already prior to NF training. (3) Regulation of parietal alpha activity was not linked to frontal&#x02013;parietal connectivity changes. (4) Enriched and more natural NF (fountain), as compared to classic bar feedback, did not increase performance. (5) No specific strategies to regulate parietal alpha activity were identified. From these results we cautiously conclude that NF learning in a practical VR setup is possible provided substantial training time. Enriched NF may hamper performance due to more sensory input and a more complex NF signal. Decreased parietal alpha power does not lead to an increased sense of presence, at least not if participants already feel highly present at the beginning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Carsten Scheller, Arthur Knauer, Jessica Topel, and Bastian Lange for the support in creating, adapting and testing the virtual environments.
