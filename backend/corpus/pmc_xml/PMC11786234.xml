UPF is characterized as energy dense,<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and excess energy intake is known to be associated with obesity development.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Additionally, the high saturated fat, sodium, and sugar content make UPFs hyperpalatable, which may drive overconsumption. In our study, we accounted for total energy intake and in a sensitivity analysis, we further adjusted for these nutrients of concern. Despite these adjustments, the associations remained significant. While studies in children are lacking, adult studies have related emulsifiers and additives found in UPF to altered gut microbiome,<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241604r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> also reflecting different associations in males vs females,<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> which aligns with our findings.</p><p>Finally, previous studies have shown sex differences in diet intake since early childhood. For example, males are reported to consume more calorie-dense foods.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This aligns with our study findings where UPF energy contribution was higher in males. Additionally, sex differences are well-known in obesity and regional fat distributions. Studies documented that males tend to store fat in the abdominal regions, including both subcutaneous and visceral fat, while females tend to store in the gluteofemoral regions.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Future studies should consider total and regional body composition, including lean, fat, or visceral fat mass.</p></sec><sec id="H2-12-ZOI241604"><title>Study Importance and Implications</title><p>Given that Canadian children&#x02019;s dietary patterns have shifted toward high UPF intake<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and that obesity tracks throughout life,<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> our results may hold public health and clinical implications. Our study shows that UPF is associated with higher BMI, waist to height ratio, and subscapular and triceps skinfold thicknesses, independently of energy, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium intake, the change in diet (eg, UPF intake from 3 to 5 years of age), and baseline BMI. Although our effect estimates are small, they reflect a <italic>z</italic> score increase from every 10% UPF energy contribution and may be significant on a population level. Promoting healthy food choices in early childhood can lead to better dietary patterns and improved long-term nutrient intake.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Our results can support existing public health policies such as front-of-package-labeling regulation or develop new policies.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Understanding the role UPF plays in childhood obesity can allow health care professionals to provide tailored dietary recommendations for obesity prevention. This work can also inform future studies, such as UPF subgroup studies (currently the NOVA system considers plant-based alternatives as UPF), studies examining other characteristics of UPF including the use of emulsifiers,<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> potential physiological mediators in the development of childhood obesity, and mechanistic studies.</p></sec><sec id="H2-13-ZOI241604"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective Canadian studies to examine early childhood UPF intake and obesity development and one of the first worldwide to demonstrate associations primarily driven by males. The large and detailed CHILD database enabled our study to adjust for various potential confounders, including maternal UPF intake. In addition to BMI <italic>z</italic> scores, we also calculated <italic>z</italic> scores of waist to height ratio and skinfold thicknesses. Waist to height ratio may be a better indicator of central obesity, while skinfold thickness are shown to estimate adult adiposity more accurately than BMI.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Using both measures alongside BMI is useful for assessing childhood obesity.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241604r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241604r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p><p>Our study also holds some limitations. Although we used a detailed 112-item FFQ, this tool is not ideal for capturing UPF intake. Furthermore, despite being the most widely used, the NOVA system is limited by the criteria interpretability.<sup><xref rid="zoi241604r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> To deal with this, 2 researchers independently mapped the FFQ items using the NOVA system and followed the commonly reported conservative approach to classify ambiguous items. In addition, we replicated the results using the UNC system, which is adapted for the North American diet, and observed similar results. To assess the potential selection bias due to loss to follow-up, we conducted 2 nonresponse analyses and found that participants lost to follow-up shared similar characteristics to the participants included in the main analyses. We ran multiple imputations for confounders in our multivariable-adjusted model to reduce bias due to missing covariate data. Additionally, the complete case analyses showed similar results, with slightly smaller effect estimates compared with the analyses on imputed data. Last, despite adjusting for several potential confounders, due to the observational design of our study, residual confounding (eg, family eating behaviors) might be possible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI241604"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this cohort study of Canadian children, UPF intake represented almost half of all energy intake, which warrants public health attention. Our results also suggest sex-driven associations between preschool UPF intake and obesity development. Future studies should examine the underlying mechanism and determine the long-term impact of UPF on youth health.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI241604"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi241604r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><collab>Pan American Health Organization, World Health Organization</collab></person-group>. <source>Ultra-Processed Food and Drink Products in Latin America: Trends</source>. <publisher-name>Impact on Obesity, Policy Implications</publisher-name>; <year>2015</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi241604r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name><surname>Vandevijvere</surname>
