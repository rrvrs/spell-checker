</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common cutaneous intraepithelial neoplasm characterized by the proliferation of atypical keratinocytes in sun-exposed areas, particularly in older individuals with the fair skin phototype. If left untreated, AK lesions may progress to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), highlighting the need for effective therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Tirbanibulin 1% ointment (Klisyri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Almirall, S.A., Barcelona, Spain) has been licensed to treat non-hyperkeratotic AK lesions on the face and scalp in adults, with good results and excellent patient tolerability due to its mild side effects and short application time of 5 consecutive days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Its mechanism of action involves the disruption of microtubule function, which leads to the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis induction in dysplastic keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition to its well-documented efficacy in treating AK lesions in both clinical trials and real-life settings, recent investigations have suggested potential additional cutaneous benefits of tirbanibulin ointment on skin aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In particular, in our case series on 7 patients, tirbanibulin displayed efficacy for AKs and solar lentigines (SLs), exerting an overall good skin-lightening effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Also known as sunspots or age spots, SLs are benign hyperpigmented lesions that result from chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure and represent a hallmark of photoaging; they are usually found in the context of field cancerization and AKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In order to investigate its efficacy and safety profile for SLs, we performed a study on patients affected by both SLs and AKs treated with topical tirbanibulin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par7">A retrospective single-center evaluation was carried out at the Dermatology Unit of the University of Messina, Italy, between February 2023 and March 2024. Adult patients affected by both AKs and SLs on chronically photodamaged areas of the scalp and face treated with tirbanibulin 1% ointment were included. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and lactation, known allergies to any component of the study drug, a history of photosensitivity, active infections, immunosuppression, a history of invasive cSCC, Bowen&#x02019;s disease, basal cell carcinoma, other malignant tumors in the treatment field, and prior therapies with other topical treatments for AKs and photoaging in the last 12&#x000a0;weeks. The procedures followed here were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and its later amendments and were approved by the local ethical committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients for their photographs and medical information to be published.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par8">The study aimed (a) to evaluate the clearance rate of both SLs and AKs at the 57-day follow-up (T1); (b) to assess the potential correlation between the response to SLs and AKs; and (c) to assess the response durability of SLs and AKs in patients with complete clearance at the 6-month follow-up (T2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Baseline Evaluation</title><p id="Par9">At baseline (T0), all patients underwent physical examination with the acquisition of clinical images. Clinically collected data included age, gender, and skin phototype. Solar lentigo (SL) and AK locations (face or scalp) were collected as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment Received by Patients</title><p id="Par10">Patients were instructed to apply tirbanibulin 1% ointment once daily for 5 consecutive days in sufficient quantities to cover affected photodamaged areas where both AKs and SLs were present. The ointment was applied as a thin layer, avoiding application on open wounds or injured skin, as indicated in the package leaflet. Daily sunscreen&#x000a0;with&#x000a0;a sun protection factor (SPF) of 50&#x02009;+&#x02009;was recommended. All patients were informed in depth about the possible onset of local skin reactions (LSRs).</p><p id="Par11">Patients were instructed to record the exact timing of onset and the duration of LSRs, if present. They were invited to come to the hospital personally, or to send digital photos when they were unable to attend in person, to allow physicians to evaluate LSRs. LSRs were defined as erythema, scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation, or pustulation as well as erosions. The assessment of LSRs was carried out with the use of a semiquantitative 4-point scale with scores of 0&#x02014;absent, 1&#x02014;mild (slightly or barely perceptible), 2&#x02014;moderate (a distinct presence), and 3&#x02014;severe (marked or intense).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>First Evaluation Post-treatment (T1)</title><p id="Par12">Patients were clinically evaluated 57&#x000a0;days (T1) after the start of the treatment with the acquisition of new clinical images. The lightening effect of tirbanibulin ointment was rated as complete clearance (CC; &#x0003e;&#x02009;75% improvement up to complete SL disappearance with no evidence of hyperpigmentation), partial clearance (PC; 75&#x02013;50% reduction in SL pigmentation), or no response (&#x0003c;&#x02009;50% SL improvement). The efficacy was also assessed according to the SL localization (face or scalp).</p><p id="Par13">For AKs, efficacy was evaluated as CC (total disappearance of the treated lesions), PC (at least 75% reduction), or no response (&#x0003c;&#x02009;75% reduction). The efficacy was also assessed according to the AK localization (face or scalp).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Second Evaluation Post-treatment (T2)</title><p id="Par14">Patients who experienced CC of AKs and SLs within the application area at day 57 continued in a 6-month follow-up to assess response durability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par15">A descriptive analysis was conducted to evaluate the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, stratified by SL and AK clearance. A further descriptive and comparative analysis was performed between patients with and without LSRs.</p><p id="Par16">Considering a non-normal distribution of some of the numerical variables evaluated by the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test for normality, a non-parametric approach was assumed.</p><p id="Par17">The descriptive statistics were reported as medians along with the first and third quartiles (Q<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;Q<sub>3</sub>) for continuous variables and as absolute frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.</p><p id="Par18">The two-tailed Pearson chi-squared test and the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for independent samples were carried out to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively.</p><p id="Par19">To identify predictors of responsiveness to SL treatment, a multivariate ordinal logistic regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] was performed, including as covariates age, gender, skin phototype, SL position (face or scalp), and LSR onset. The same ordinal logistic regression model was adopted to evaluate the association between AK clearance and the following variables: age, gender, skin phototype, AK position (face or scalp), and the onset of LSRs.</p><p id="Par20">LSRs were categorized as acute (occurring within 24&#x000a0;h) or latent (occurring after 24&#x000a0;h). Onset was defined as the time from the start of drug administration to the beginning of a reaction, and the duration of LSRs was calculated.</p><p id="Par21">Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation test was applied to identify associations between SL clearance and AK clearance. For each correlation, the Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient (r<sub>s</sub>) was reported.&#x000a0;The same model was used to estimate the associations of LSR onset, severity (absent, mild, moderate, severe), and duration with SL and AK clearance.</p><p id="Par22">Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify the factors associated with LSR occurrence. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each covariate of interest in the multivariate models. A <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed by using the SPSS statistical package, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><p id="Par23">Forty-two patients (25 male, 17 female) with a median age of 76&#x000a0;years (Q<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;Q<sub>3</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;71&#x02013;80) were enrolled in the study.

AKs arise through a multistep process involving mutations in genes responsible for maintaining epidermal homeostasis, leading to abnormal proliferation of altered keratinocytes and finally resulting in cSCC onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Being a hallmark of photodamaged skin, AKs are often accompanied by other lesions associated with chronic UV damage, including cutaneous malignancies, such as basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, and benign lesions, such as seborrheic keratoses and SLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The latter are benign well-demarcated hyperpigmented lesions that arise on chronically photodamaged areas, where the cumulative effect of UV leads to focal keratinocyte hyperplasia and melanocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite its benign traits, the potential negative social impact of SLs should not be underrated, since they appear mainly in aesthetically sensitive areas, such as the face and dorsal hands, thus representing a frustrating condition for patients, who often seek treatments to achieve clearer, more youthful-looking skin. However, the outcome can often be disappointing, as many available treatments offer limited and non-permanent results.</p><p id="Par31">Therapeutic options for SLs can be divided into two main categories: physical and topical treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Physical ones include laser therapy, cryotherapy, and chemical peels, while topical treatments require the application of active compounds, aiming at inhibiting melanin production, blocking melanocyte stimulation, and suppressing melanin delivery to keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">A recent systematic review comparing the efficacy rate of SL treatments highlighted that combination therapies are the most effective but are limited by adverse events (AEs) in over two-thirds of patients, while laser-based treatments seem to be the most effective monotherapy option, with a complete response attained in 43% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]<bold>.</bold> The most used laser source for SL treatment is the Q-switched one, with a 532-nm wavelength that selectively targets melanin pigment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Laser treatment shows a good safety profile, with an AE rate of only 23%; these AEs are mainly represented by pigmentary alterations (hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation), so this treatment requires caution in darker skin types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cryotherapy is another widely used treatment for benign hyperpigmented lesions and was once considered the first-line approach for SLs. However, it has shown lower pooled response rates compared with other treatment modalities (a complete response rate of 15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Its mechanism of action involves selectively injuring melanocytes through tissue freezing since these cells are particularly sensitive to cold. AEs occur in 33% of patients, with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation being the most frequent. Chemical peels seem to be the least effective option for SLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]<bold>.</bold> Among topical treatments, retinoids are widely used as anti-aging and depigmenting agents due to their ability to accelerate epidermal keratinocyte turnover and desquamation, leading to reduced melanosome transfer and faster melanin loss through the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, pooled data showed complete and partial responses in 21% and 45% of patients, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, topical retinoid use is limited by the so-called &#x0201c;retinoid reaction&#x0201d; that occurs in up to 82% of patients. This reaction, characterized by pruritus, burning, erythema, and peeling, is initiated by proinflammatory cytokines and is due to the free carboxylic acid in the retinoid&#x02019;s polar end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Hydroquinone, another topical agent that primarily targets tyrosinase, was once considered the gold standard due to its strong anti-pigmenting effects. However, it has associated risks of cytotoxicity and permanent depigmentation that have led to the discontinuation of its use. Arbutin, a hydroquinone derivative, represents a safer alternative, though with lower efficacy. Skin-lightening effects can also come from microbial sources, such as kojic acid, a fungal metabolite that chelates copper to suppress tyrosinase, and azelaic acid, produced by <italic>Pityrosporum ovale</italic>, which competitively inhibits tyrosinase without cytotoxicity. Flavonoids, including aloesin and glabiridin, also exert anti-tyrosinase action while offering antioxidant benefits. In contrast, niacinamide (vitamin B3) reduces hyperpigmentation by inhibiting melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes without affecting tyrosinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Finally, tranexamic acid (TXA), commonly used as an antifibrinolytic and procoagulant agent, has demonstrated anti-melanogenesis and anti-inflammatory effects, making it a viable treatment option for hyperpigmentation. While TXA is widely used for melasma and has recently gained approval for indications in some countries, it remains an off-label treatment for various other dyschromias, including SL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The major limitations of the aforementioned treatments are their high economic burden and long-term compliance. They often require multiple sessions over extended periods or daily applications for several months, thus impairing patient adherence. Nevertheless, aesthetic results can be disappointing, since pigmentation may return or the improvements may be minimal. Moreover, some advanced treatments, such as Q-switched lasers, are not readily available in all dermatological centers, making them less accessible for many patients. This combination of high costs, long treatments, and limited access leaves many patients frustrated and highlights the need for more effective, affordable, and widely accessible solutions.</p><p id="Par35">The clearance of SLs in patients treated with topical therapies for AKs and field cancerization has been anecdotally reported in the literature, with only two case reports dealing with the lightening of SLs after the application of imiquimod 3.75% cream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The results of our study confirm, for a larger series of patients, the effectiveness of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in inducing a lightening effect on dark spots, as already observed in our previous experience of 7 patients, besides its well-known positive outcome for AKs.</p><p id="Par36">Tirbanibulin ointment represents the latest-arriving AK treatment, adding to the wide range of therapeutic options already available, including 4% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream, 0.5% 5-FU plus 10% salicylic acid, 3% diclofenac sodium in hyaluronic acid gel, 3.75% and 5% imiquimod cream, and photodynamic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Currently, there are no head-to-head studies comparing tirbanibulin&#x02019;s efficacy with other topical treatments, likely due to its recent introduction to the market. However, indirect comparisons through a recent meta-analysis indicated that tirbanibulin&#x02019;s efficacy and safety profile align closely with those of other topical therapies but with a shorter treatment period, which represents its greatest step forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In our study, at the 57-day follow-up, treatment with tirbanibulin ointment led to CC and PC in 52% and 40% of patients with facial and scalp AKs, respectively, confirming the data from clinical trials and real-life experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Among patients achieving CC, AK recurrence occurred in 7 out of 22 (31.8%), as expected given the chronic relapsing nature of AKs.

We can speculate that this gender difference may be due, at least in part, to thinner skin in women, which may allow for better drug penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Conversely, younger patients typically experience faster cell turnover and an enhanced tissue repair capacity, which may amplify the effects of pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor agents such as tirbanibulin, thus promoting the elimination of precancerous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Similar positive performances were recorded for SLs, with a CC rate of 35% and a PC rate of 50% at the 2-month follow-up as well as excellent maintenance of results at the 6-month follow-up, with tirbanibulin therefore achieving overall better&#x000a0;results than those of much more expensive and time-consuming therapies (i.e., topical retinoids or cryotherapy), being slightly inferior only to laser therapy&#x000a0;performances. What sets it apart is its short application regimen of only 5 consecutive days, which provides an effective solution in a much shorter time frame compared to other expensive treatments. Furthermore, tirbanibulin ointment is readily accessible and widely available to all patients, including those living in smaller towns or rural areas. This makes it a practical and inclusive therapeutic option, in contrast to laser-based treatments, thus ensuring that even individuals living far from urban centers can receive effective care.</p><p id="Par39">To date, no studies have explored the depigmenting effect of tirbanibulin. Our study results suggest that tirbanibulin may exert therapeutic effects on both conditions, potentially due to shared molecular mechanisms.</p><p id="Par40">The antineoplastic effects of tirbanibulin 1% ointment are mediated by the inhibition of the proliferation of AK dysplastic keratinocytes through microtubule structure disruption and apoptosis induction. A similar proliferative dysregulation occurs in SLs, where UV radiation leads to keratinocyte hyperplasia and their increased production of melanocyte-activating factors, especially endothelin-1 (EDN-1) and stem cell factor (SCF), which synergistically enhance melanin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Specifically, EDN1 binds to EDN1-B receptors (EDNBR) on melanocytes, activating intracellular pathways such as protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) cascades. Simultaneously, SCF binds to its receptor c-KIT on melanocytes and activates intracellular signaling pathways. The mutual interaction between EDN1/EDNBR and SCF/c-KIT signaling leads to enhanced expression and phosphorylation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which in turn promotes melanin synthesis and melanocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Tirbanibulin&#x02019;s direct cytotoxic effect on keratinocytes might impair their ability to produce and secrete EDN-1 and SCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. By inhibiting the EDN-1 and SCF upstream signals that activate MITF, tirbanibulin may indirectly reduce the transcription of key enzymes, thus suppressing melanin production and leading to the skin-lightening effect observed in our patients.</p><p id="Par42">Another potential mechanism of action of tirbanibulin might be the modulation of melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes, which is crucial for the distribution of pigment across the epidermis. Microtubules play a significant role in facilitating melanosome transport via melanocyte dendrites.</p><p id="Par43">As tirbanibulin disrupts microtubules, it could be hypothesized that it may impair such transport, thereby reducing cutaneous hyperpigmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Additionally, the reduction of SLs was assessed on clinical criteria without instrumental evaluations. Seasonal variations in sunlight exposure during treatment administration represent a potential source of bias, as they possibly influenced biological responses and introduced variability among patients. Furthermore, the durability of the results should be assessed over a longer follow-up period to observe potential clinical recurrences. Finally, the mechanisms by which tirbanibulin exerts its skin-lightening effects on SLs need to be investigated in depth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">Our study highlighted the dual effect of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in improving the appearance of photoaged skin at application sites used for treating AKs.

Further research is essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that drive these cosmetic improvements and potentially allow patients to treat these aesthetically bothersome lesions in a few days at limited cost.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar3"><title>Medical Writing and Editorial Assistance</title><p id="Par46">No medical writing or editorial assistance was received during the writing of the article.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization: Federica Li Pomi and Francesco Borgia; methodology: Federica Li Pomi and Francesco Borgia; formal analysis: Federica Li Pomi, Andrea d&#x02019;Aloja, Michelangelo Rottura, Mario Vaccaro, and Francesco Borgia; investigation: Federica Li Pomi, Andrea d&#x02019;Aloja, Michelangelo Rottura, Mario Vaccaro, and Francesco Borgia; data curation: Federica Li Pomi, Andrea d&#x02019;Aloja, Michelangelo Rottura, Mario Vaccaro, and Francesco Borgia; statistical analysis: Michelangelo Rottura; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation: Federica Li Pomi and Francesco Borgia; writing&#x02014;review and editing: Federica Li Pomi and Francesco Borgia; visualization: Federica Li Pomi, Andrea d&#x02019;Aloja, and Francesco Borgia; supervision: Federica Li Pomi and Francesco Borgia; project administration: Federica Li Pomi and Francesco Borgia.
