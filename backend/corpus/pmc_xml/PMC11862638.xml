Delusion of pregnancy (DP) is a false and persistent belief of being pregnant despite realistic evidence to the contrary. Being considered a rare phenomenon, more cases of DP have been reported lately, however the literature about this topic is still scarce.</p></sec><sec id="sec8531"><title>Objectives</title><p>Clarify the etiology and clinical aspects of this pathology in order to diagnose and to treat it properly.</p></sec><sec id="sec8532"><title>Methods</title><p>A search on Pubmed was performed using the MeSH terms &#x0201c;delusion pregnancy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;pseudocyesis&#x0201d;. The DSM-5 and ICD-10 were also a source of information.</p></sec><sec id="sec8533"><title>Results</title><p>DP can be sometimes confused with other disorders, like pseudocyesis, pseudo-pregnancy and Couvade syndrome, but it is important to differentiate all of them to have a clear view of the pathology and follow a correct approach to the problem.</p><p>DP can manifest isolatedly, but it is more commonly associated with other diseases. Etiologically, several factors can intercede: biological, psychosocial and cultural factors, iatrogenic factors and coenaesthesis processes.</p><p>Demographically, about 50% of the patients are 20-40 years old and the most common psychiatric diagnoses are schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.</p><p>
Concerning the treatment, it is essential to exclude non-psychiatric causes and treat those, if present. After doing so, the therapeutical approach can be non-pharmacological, using psychotherapy or electroconvulsive therapy, although the latter has inconclusive results and sometimes it only remits the comorbid depressive symptoms; or pharmacological using 2nd generation antipsychotics.</p><p>In general, there is now a good response in 50-64% of the cases (Bera and Sakar, <italic toggle="yes">

Indian J Psychol Med</italic> 2012;34(1) 82-84).</p></sec><sec id="sec8534"><title>Conclusions</title><p>DP can be a psychiatric diagnosis itself or a manifestation of other psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder so we must be allert to make a precise differential diagnosis. Its genesis is multifactorial and that must be taken into account when thinking about its treatment approach.</p><p>In the past, the prognosis of the DP wasn&#x02019;t good, but in the recent literature it was found a good response in more than half of the patients treated accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="sec8535"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
