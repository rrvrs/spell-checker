ASD frequently presents with co-occurring depression and anxiety. This complex phenotype often results in psychotropic medication polypharmacy. Incorporating PGx testing into the medical work-up may reduce polypharmacy and improve quality of life with symptom reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A retrospective electronic health record (EHR) review between January 2017 and May 2023. Individuals either received PGx testing or treatment as usual (TAU). The co-primary outcomes were instance of polypharmacy and the Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q). Secondary outcomes included length of stay, average number of psychotropic medications, readmissions and assessments measuring severity of symptoms or behavioral impact. When at least one daily psychotropic medication was prescribed and reported to have an increased probability of gene&#x02013;drug interactions, the individual was classified as &#x0201c;incongruent&#x0201d; (PGx-I). Individuals were categorized as &#x0201c;congruent&#x0201d; (PGx-C) if all prescribed psychotropic medications were without potential gene&#x02013;drug interactions. Polypharmacy was evaluated and compared within the PGx-C and PGx-I subgroups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 99 individuals with ASD were analyzed. At the time of admission, 93% of individuals were prescribed at least one psychotropic medication and over half of these individuals were prescribed medications with potential gene&#x02013;drug interactions. Following PGx testing, there was an overall reduction in prescribed medications with potential gene&#x02013;drug interactions. No differences were observed between the PGx and TAU groups in polypharmacy, quality of life, or symptom assessments of depression, anxiety, obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder and body-focused repetitive behaviors. Subanalysis comparing congruent (&#x0201c;use as directed&#x0201d;) or incongruent (&#x0201c;use with caution&#x0201d;), as well as exploratory analysis of only CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 gene&#x02013;drug interactions, were observed to have a similar profile between treatment groups for all primary and secondary outcomes, except for the average number of psychotropic medications prescribed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Incorporating PGx testing into the medical workup did not improve outcomes, with all treatment groups achieving similar levels of polypharmacy and quality of life. Analysis of secondary outcomes revealed some differences in medication prescribing when stratifying by congruency; however, no differences were observed between treatment groups for all other secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13034-025-00915-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Autism</kwd><kwd>CYP2D6</kwd><kwd>ASD</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Pharmacogenomics</kwd><kwd>PGx</kwd><kwd>GeneSight</kwd><kwd>Polypharmacy</kwd><kwd>Antipsychotics</kwd><kwd>Antidepressants</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Rogers Behavioral Health Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Lynn S.

Symptoms typically manifest before age three and include deficits in communication and social interaction, repetitive behaviors, fixated interests and inflexible routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and tics also frequently co-occur with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Medication management for individuals with ASD often includes psychotropic medication polypharmacy, even in young children, underscoring the need to optimize medication selection to increase efficacy and minimize side effect burden.</p><p id="Par32">Medication management for individuals with ASD can be complicated, with only aripiprazole and risperidone approved to treat irritability associated with ASD in children and adolescents. Moreover, no pharmacologic treatments that target the underlying etiology of ASD are approved. Without medications approved to target the ASD-specific etiology, multiple psychotropic medications are frequently prescribed to manage both ASD-related symptoms and those associated with co-occurring psychiatric conditions, such as antidepressants. Additionally, children with ASD often experience more adverse effects and show limited response to psychotropic medications compared to children not diagnosed with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This is further complicated by underlying clinically significant genetic variations affecting an individual&#x02019;s neurophysiology and the heterogeneous symptomatic presentation among individuals with ASD, which often requires psychotropic polypharmacy with medications across different drug classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], including antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and stimulants.</p><p id="Par33">One approach to streamline medication trialing and optimize dosing has been to incorporate pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. More specifically, PGx tests analyze genetics to predict pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) response to medications to address the limited response rates to first-line medications, which are reported to range from 42 to 53% in depression alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, PGx-guided drug selection and dosing may help to reduce medication side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and improve medication compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and thereby reduce the need for medication changes. PGx testing may also lead to reduced emergency room visits, readmissions and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and may be particularly relevant to persons receiving treatment at higher levels of care, such as in residential, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient behavioral healthcare treatment programs. However, PGx remains controversial, as some studies report mixed or no clinical benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Evidence supporting PGx utility in child and adolescent populations is also limited. As a result the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) recommends clinicians avoid using PGx testing to select psychotropic medications in children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Emerging data has demonstrated that when used for individuals with ASD, PGx testing can provide clinically meaningful information to guide medication management and improve clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This includes global improvement in clinical symptoms when PGx is incorporated into medication management decisions for those with ASD who failed to respond to at least two psychotropic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additional studies for PGx-guided psychotropic medication management have followed guidelines by Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), the American Psychiatric Association Council of Research (APA-COR) or the Association for Molecular Pathology Clinical Practice Committee's Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Working Group and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. These focus on specific PK-related enzymes that are effective in ameliorating some ASD symptoms, including CYP2D6, which is reported to play a role in the metabolism of aripiprazole and risperidone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, there may be limitations in interpreting how specific enzyme variants will affect safety and efficacy, particularly for medications with multiple active moieties, such as risperidone. For example, CYP2D6 metabolizes risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which is an active metabolite but with decreased brain penetration. For individuals who are poor metabolizers at CYP2D6, the ratio of plasma risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone may be increased, which could result in risperidone-related adverse effects without meaningfully affecting efficacy. Conversely, ultrarapid metabolizers at CYP2D6 may result in decreased plasma levels of risperidone, and as a result, may have decreased efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Genetic variants of multiple PK-related enzymes may confer ultra-rapid, intermediate or poor metabolism of select psychotropic medications. Taking these medications may result in poor therapeutic response to altered plasma concentrations and delayed drug clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although these genetic variants occur frequently in individuals with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], there are currently no ASD-specific PGx guidelines for commercially available PGx products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As a result, PGx utilization continues to be limited for ASD and continued investigation is warranted. Therefore, a retrospective study analyzing 99 persons diagnosed with ASD was conducted to determine whether PGx-guided medication management would improve medication congruence with potential gene&#x02013;drug interactions, reduce polypharmacy and decrease symptom severity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p id="Par36">A retrospective electronic health record (EHR) review was conducted for children and adolescents with ASD treated acutely in an anxiety and depression partial hospitalization (PHP) and intensive outpatient (IOP) programs within a national behavioral health care system was approved by an institutional review board (IRB). Admission to this program required an ASD diagnosis. At admission, all available clinical information, assessments and evaluation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist and clinical&#x000a0;psychologist&#x000a0;were utilized to develop an individualized treatment plan, including medication and therapy planning. While standardized ASD-specific severity measures were not administered due to the type of program, the clinical information typically included diagnostic evaluations, family and school reports, neuropsychological assessments and external electronic medical records. Participants completed daily treatment within the PHP program (6&#x02013;7&#x000a0;h of treatment daily) or the IOP program (3&#x000a0;h daily). Treatment included cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with ASD-specific modifications, such as an emphasis on intrusive and inflexible thoughts, and social communication. Individuals in the program were able to participate in group-based CBT and other behavioral therapy practices. Overall, the programs were individualized and tailored to treating the anxiety and depression symptoms that were secondary to ASD. The goal of these specialized programs was to help improve overall quality of life, as opposed to treating the symptoms of ASD.</p><p id="Par37">PGx testing was ordered on a case-by-case basis at the prescriber&#x02019;s discretion, although 13% (6/46) of the PGx reports were provided by individuals or their parent/guardian at the time of admission. All eligible individuals with PGx testing reported between January 2017 and May 2023 were included in the study. Individuals included in the current study received daily behavioral therapy as part of their treatment program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Classification of medication congruence with PGx testing</title><p id="Par38">Any psychotropic medication-related PGx test was eligible for inclusion in this study; however, all extracted reports for this study were the GeneSight<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Psychotropic test (Myriad Genetics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Data were extracted from individual PGx reports and analyzed at the individual level. Determinations of gene&#x02013;drug interactions were based on both pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) genes. The PGx treatment group was classified as &#x0201c;incongruent&#x0201d; (PGx-I) when individuals were prescribed at least one daily psychotropic medication that was reported to have a &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;significant&#x0201d; potential gene&#x02013;drug interaction, or Individuals were classified as &#x0201c;congruent&#x0201d; (PGx-C) when prescribed medications that were all reported with use as directed, or &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;, with no suspected gene&#x02013;drug interactions. Individuals were also classified as congruent when medications in the moderate and significant categories were discontinued or titrated down before discontinuing following the PGx report.</p><p id="Par39">Exploratory analysis was manually conducted to include only the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes, which are two clinically actionable genes specifically referenced by CPIC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other consortia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. CPIC has recognized CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 as specific genes that may be evaluated as part of the psychotropic medication selection decision, particularly around certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and atypical antipsychotics due to the potential of increased side effect risk and reduced efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Analysis for the current study was kept broad to include any psychotropic medication metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP2C19. Accordingly, if the PGx report indicated either gene as having an ultrarapid, poor or intermediate metabolizer status for at least one prescribed psychotropic medication it was classified as incongruent (CYP2D6/CYP2C19&#x02013;I). If the report indicated &#x02018;normal&#x02019; or &#x02018;not reported&#x02019; for these genes, individuals were classified as congruent (CYP2D6/CYP2C19-C). The frequency of metabolizer status for these enzymes is included in Table S1 with outcomes included in Table S2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par40">Two co-primary outcomes were evaluated for this study. The first co-primary outcome was the average number of medications prescribed following the PGx report, with a focus on polypharmacy. Due to the lack of a consensus definition for polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], two criteria were used to evaluate the impact of PGx testing on psychotropic polypharmacy. Polypharmacy was defined as: (1) three or more concurrent psychotropic medications or (2) two or more medications prescribed from the same class (e.g., serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Non-psychotropic medications were not reported. The second co-primary outcome was the Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q). For the PQ-LES-Q, respondents were scored as a percentage of the total possible score and categorized as a low-quality of life (&#x0003c;&#x02009;65%), average quality of life 65&#x02013;83%, and high quality of life (84% and above) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Notably, 57% of the study population admitted on at least one medication with a potential gene&#x02013;drug interaction. With co-occurring conditions frequently affecting persons with ASD, medication regimens commonly include the use of SSRIs, antipsychotics, and psychostimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Polypharmacy in the current study was common, with over half of individuals were prescribed three or more psychotropic medications at the time of admission, and approximately half of those individuals were prescribed at least one incongruent medication. Prescribers did appear to utilize the recommendations provided within the PGx report to either switch medications or adjust dosing those admitting on incongruent medications. However, these adjustments did not result in significant changes for any outcomes evaluated in the current study, and therefore the overall utility of PGx was uncertain.</p><p id="Par63">Polypharmacy is common with ASD in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and remains a challenge that patients and prescribers must navigate to minimize side effects and drug-drug interactions, and to promote medication adherence. As individuals with ASD age into adulthood, the polypharmacy concerns grow as non-psychiatric co-occurring conditions develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While we hypothesized that individuals taking congruent medications would be prescribed fewer medications compared to those prescribed incongruent medications, the data did not support this. Overall, prescribers frequently changed medications or adjusted dose when the PGx report indicated an increased potential for gene&#x02013;drug interactions, switching to alternatives with a decreased likelihood of gene&#x02013;drug interactions. Given the high level of polypharmacy in this population, there is an opportunity to integrate PGx testing in the medical workup conducted at admission to reduce the number of incongruent medications.</p><p id="Par64">This study also highlights that PGx testing is only one of multiple factors guiding medication management decisions. The retrospective study design makes it unclear to what degree decisions were informed by guidelines and algorithms, historical family data, patient and family preference, prescriber preference, insurance reimbursement, or careful use of the PGx report to avoid potential incongruent medications. One of the more important findings of the study was that all individuals improved similarly irrespective of access to PGx testing. To further explore the potential of PGx testing for individuals with ASD, we compared the impact of the combinatorial panel with PK-focused panels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Did evaluating CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 improve utility for clinical decision support over the combinatorial PGx panel?</title><p id="Par65">PGx remains of great interest when prescribing psychotropic medications, yet there is no consensus as to which test or specific genes provide the most utility as part of the psychotropic medication selection decision. Some stakeholders advocate for a combinatorial test report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], inclusive of a range of PK- and PD-related genes, while others focus on specific genes, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2B6 and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Previous comparisons between both approaches reported the combinatorial PGx test outperformed individual genes with major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], however, little is known about this comparison in ASD. To better understand how these testing approaches can be used for children and adolescents with ASD, the current study evaluated both a comprehensive PGx panel and a PK-focused panel inclusive of only CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 to determine the impact on medication changes and assessment outcomes. The resulting data did not support one approach over another. Taken together with the complex factors informing medication changes, it may be most impactful for prescribers to order the combinatorial PGx panels, as the recommendations when narrowing to CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were similar to the more comprehensive commercial product. Commercial PGx products also tend to have short turnaround times, which can be helpful in high acuity settings. These panels typically report the metabolizer status of specific genes, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, allowing prescriber discretion on which clinical decision tool to utilize as part of the overall medication selection decision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Clinical implications</title><p id="Par66">The study&#x02019;s co-primary outcome of polypharmacy rate did not differ between treatment groups. Indeed, medication selection and dosing decisions are complex and multifactorial. Prescribers must navigate guidelines and algorithms, family history, past medication trials, co-occurring conditions, allergies, patient and family preferences, insurance reimbursement and other factors. Disentangling the impact of the results from PGx reports in such a complex clinical decision-making context is challenging, particularly when patient outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Moreover, the retrospective nature of the study did not allow us to understand how the PGx tests were used by prescribers and how the data were weighted in decision-making, e.g., a moderate versus significant potential gene&#x02013;drug interaction and the cost&#x02013;benefit of PGx testing.</p><p id="Par67">Clinical assessment outcomes were modest across all treatment groups. The PQ-LES-Q showed improvement from low to average quality of life across all groups. Improvements were also observed for depressive symptoms, social anxiety and repetitive behaviors, regardless of treatment group. The modest overall improvements for all treatment groups, lack of separation between any treatment groups when stratified by combinatorial PGx test and medication congruency (PGx-C versus PGx-I; CYP2D6/CYP2C19-C versus CYP2D6/CYP2C19-I), and complexity of medication decision-making suggest that longitudinal prospective trials that incorporate long-term follow-up are necessary. To more comprehensively assess the role of pharmacogenomic testing in this population, future longitudinal studies should incorporate detailed prescribing histories, data on non-psychotropic medication use, more granular classification of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer status to inform medication selection, surveys of prescribers to evaluate how PGx results influenced clinical decisions, documentation of side effects, and the inclusion of ASD-specific outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par68">Due to the retrospective nature of the study, medication compliance was reliant on patient self-report and prescription refills, and the history of failed medication trials were not evaluated. The sample size may have limited the detection of statistical differences, particularly within subgroups. While the assessments used for the current study are validated in pediatric populations, they were also used for individuals up to the age of 20 within the treatment program. Additionally, the relatively brief length of stay, which averaged under 40&#x000a0;days, decreased the likelihood of observing medication-related differences in assessment outcomes. Communication and sensorial disorders, which are prevalent in this population, were not evaluated in the current study and as part of the treatment program. The classification of medications based on CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer status may not fully align with specific recommendations that consider additional genes (e.g., CYP3A4) or specific metabolizer statuses (e.g., ultrarapid metabolizer), potentially influencing the findings. Although the study allowed for the inclusion of any pharmacogenomic (PGx) test, only the GeneSight PGx test was used by prescribers, limiting the generalizability of findings to other PGx tests. Only psychotropic medications were evaluated in the current study, leaving the possibility that drug&#x02013;drug interactions may have occurred with additional prescribed medications that could affect prescribing decisions related to these medications. Although adverse effects were monitored as part of standard of care for all individuals in the program, they were not systematically evaluated or compared between groups in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par69">The current study evaluated the utility of PGx testing for individuals with ASD in a high-acuity depression and anxiety program. Medication selection or dose changes appeared to be adjusted based on the PGx results, although it is unclear if prescribers used it as a clinical decision-making tool. No benefit in clinical outcomes was observed when assessing congruency, polypharmacy, quality of life, symptom severity or other variables. However, the level of evidence presented in this study does not invalidate the potential benefit of PGx for individual cases or the need for a prospective, definitive clinical trial to more clearly establish its utility, as is recommended by AACAP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
