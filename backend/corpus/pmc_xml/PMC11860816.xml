Introduction</title><p>In recent years, climate change has significantly affected agricultural productivity in Eastern Europe. Prolonged droughts and declining hydrological resources have degraded soil quality and reduced crop yields in vulnerable regions. The lack of adaptive irrigation infrastructure aggravates these challenges, leaving farmers without the tools to manage water shortages or stabilize production.</p><p>In the context of ensuring thriving harvests, the introduction of modern agricultural techniques becomes necessary. The use of new data-driven technologies is helping to provide appropriate solutions for increasing crop yields, a concept known as precision agriculture. This type of agriculture monitors the climatic factors, the soil, and the type of plant and its needs in order to obtain quality production [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-01199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. </p><p>Therefore, the implementation of automated systems using Internet of Things (IoT) technology allows real-time monitoring of environmental parameters such as soil, air, and water, providing a deeper understanding of their impact on plants and contributing to the user&#x02019;s adaptation to natural conditions [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-01199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These data play an essential role in understanding plant development processes and optimizing irrigation processes, thereby supporting the sustainability and efficiency of agriculture. While precision agriculture and IoT systems offer partial solutions, they remain limited by static decision models that cannot adapt to real-time microclimatic variations or future extreme weather events.</p><p>Unlike existing IoT systems reliant on static models, the paper proposes an architecture that combines IoT technology with OpenAI&#x02019;s artificial intelligence, implementing three main contributions: contextual recommendations, where OpenAI models analyze multi-source data (soil moisture, temperature, weather forecasts, etc.) to generate dynamic irrigation suggestions by transforming raw data into actionable instructions; national-scale risk mapping to classify regions into risky, precautionary, and optimal zones, facilitating strategic resource allocation; and dynamic optimization of water consumption. The proposed architecture synchronizes continuous data collection with adaptive decision-making, providing an operational framework for both farmers and policy makers. By integrating OpenAI predictive models with real-time IoT data, this work links passive environmental monitoring with proactive, climate-adaptive decision-making&#x02014;a crucial step forward for Eastern European agriculture.</p><p>In this article, the authors present an example of an IoT system that includes a hardware part consisting of an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor, and a capacitive soil moisture sensor combined with an efficient software infrastructure based on ReactJS 18.3.1 and Python 3.10.11. The microcontroller&#x02019;s role is to collect information on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity from the sensors, which is sent to a centralized database and displayed in real time via an easy-to-use graphical interface. The system&#x02019;s scalability is ensured by secure wireless WebSocket communication and geospatial metadata tagging, allowing seamless integration of thousands of monitoring stations across a national network. The hardware system is designed to operate independently and can be integrated into a network with multiple IoT systems, allowing data to be collected and transmitted from multiple locations, from local to national levels. The collected data are sent wirelessly to the server via WebSocket, where they are stored in a database, indexed by the device&#x02019;s unique identity and geographical location. The system allows dynamic configuration of monitoring stations, which are identified by a unique ID and access key stored internally, with the rest of the information such as location, name, and coordinates stored on the server. The architecture of the proposed IoT system is illustrated in <xref rid="sensors-25-01199-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. </p><p>The integration of irrigation systems with IoT technology allows for promising results to be achieved through the implementation of modern techniques. This approach offers features such as activating irrigation as needed and analyzing daily water use [<xref rid="B3-sensors-25-01199" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Related Work</title><p>The authors G. E. Rani et al. [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-01199" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] propose an automated irrigation mechanism based on the Arduino platform that uses moisture sensors to monitor soil water levels and automatically deliver the required amount of water to the plants. The sensors send data to the Arduino microcontroller, which calculates water requirements based on pre-defined values in the code and activates the irrigation system only when needed. This process optimizes the use of water, saves time and resources, and provides an efficient solution for farmers, especially those in rural areas where access to technology is limited.</p><p>The autonomous monitoring of the irrigation system in large and small plantations is aimed at eliminating the manual system [<xref rid="B6-sensors-25-01199" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

This system optimizes the use of water and resources by providing precise irrigation, thus maximizing agricultural production and managing resources more efficiently, including the use of cloud computing.</p><p>An intelligent irrigation system based on IoT technology and sensor networks for real-time monitoring of agricultural conditions is provided by [<xref rid="B9-sensors-25-01199" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Sensors collect soil and weather data such as temperature, humidity, and other important characteristics, which are transmitted through a wireless network (WSN) to a central processing platform. The automated system optimizes water consumption, thereby contributing to resource conservation and reducing environmental impact.</p><p>Another smart irrigation system based on IoT technology and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for automated irrigation monitoring and control is also described by S. B. Saraf and D. H. Gawali [<xref rid="B10-sensors-25-01199" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The system utilizes sensors for air temperature (DHT11), humidity, soil moisture (LM393), and water level (M116) that collect data in real time and transmit them via Zigbee to a main node. The data are then processed on a cloud server where an irrigation algorithm compares the measurements with pre-set thresholds based on crop type. Automated irrigation control is provided by AtMega328 microcontrollers at each node, which activate or deactivate the drip system according to the decisions received from the cloud server. The system allows remote monitoring and control via an Android app, providing farmers with real-time information on field conditions.</p><p>Compared to previous work, the novelty of this work lies in its nationwide scalability and AI-driven contextual adaptability. While existing IoT systems rely on rigid thresholds, our architecture eliminates static rules by leveraging OpenAI to dynamically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time microclimatic shifts&#x02014;a critical advancement for regions facing erratic rainfall and heatwaves. Furthermore, our system extends traditional IoT frameworks with national-scale localization capabilities, enabling seamless integration of data from thousands of possible low-cost nodes. This ensures accessibility for small-scale farmers while providing interactive risk maps that classify regional risk zones tiers using multi-source data.</p><p>Unlike threshold-driven approaches, OpenAI&#x02019;s models analyze historical trends and real-time sensor data provided by our system to generate personalized irrigation recommendations (e.g., &#x02018;Delay irrigation during peak daylight hours (12:00&#x02013;16:00) due to high soil temperature (38 &#x000b0;C) and dry conditions (soil moisture &#x0003c; 40%) to prevent water waste&#x02019;) and automated risk reports tailored to crop-specific needs (e.g., 20% increased water demand for maize during flowering). By bridging localized IoT monitoring with national-scale predictive analytics, this work offers a replicable framework for climate-resilient agriculture in vulnerable regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-sensors-25-01199"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>The potential for using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize irrigation processes is highlighted by the results of this study. The initial hypothesis is that AI can help reduce water consumption by adjusting the amount of irrigation to the actual needs of the crop and local climatic conditions. Although no large-scale experiments were conducted in this study, the results of the simulations indicate a very promising potential for integrating AI in agriculture to optimize water use efficiency and increase productivity.</p><p>In simple irrigation methods without AI support, farmers often rely on fixed routines or visual observations to decide when and how much water to use. Although this approach is less expensive, it has several limitations:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Water waste: Frequent and chaotic irrigation leads to water run-off into already saturated soils, reducing irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Water stress: Without accurate measurements, crops can suffer from either overwatering or lack of water.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lack of adaptability: Traditional irrigation does not take into account how the weather or local soil varies.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In contrast, AI technologies prevent both waste and water stress by dynamically adjusting the amount and timing of irrigation. For example, an AI system can automatically reduce the amount of water applied before a rainstorm, which is not possible with manual systems that do not pay attention to the weather forecast.</p><p>Applying artificial intelligence to irrigation systems has major implications for agricultural sustainability. In the long term, this technology can help reduce the risks associated with climate change by using water resources more efficiently and increasing the resilience of agricultural systems. In addition, the use of AI could help small-scale farmers by reducing their operating costs and increasing their productivity.</p><p>A key aspect of this study is improving the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) index. AI algorithms enable precise irrigation. Over-irrigation and water loss are avoided. Simulations indicate a theoretical extrapolation of up to a 25% increase in IWUE by lowering water usage, but these estimates need to be validated by future experiments under real conditions.</p><p>There are several limitations that need to be addressed, although the results presented are promising. The main obstacles are a lack of field testing and a reliance on simulated data. The implementation of artificial intelligence in irrigation depends on several factors, including the existence of a traditional irrigation system. Without it, upfront costs can be significant, making technology adoption difficult. In addition, a poorly developed digital infrastructure in rural areas can make the process of implementing and developing smart solutions more difficult.</p><p>One of the main objectives in the development of the application should also be to take advantage of the sustainability of water resources in specific regional contexts. This approach could take into account how different regions are affected by drought and other climatic conditions, helping to personalize irrigation strategies and optimize water resource management based on the specific characteristics of the location. </p><p>Optimizing the decision-making process is also an essential objective to ensure the continuity of the application and maintain the momentum of the decision-making process, otherwise the application will not be able to evolve with the rapid climate changes caused by global warming.</p><p>In addition, future research should focus on the development of scalable storage solutions for recorded data, capable of handling large amounts of information collected from multiple sensors. This could include the use of cloud platforms to ensure that data can be accessed quickly and analyzed in an efficient manner. </p><p>Developing a learning and self-adapting system based on the results of the application&#x02019;s past actions is another important aspect. By constantly analyzing and integrating the relationship between actions and their effects, the system can optimize the decision-making process and dynamically adapt to changing environmental and resource conditions. This self-adjusting mechanism would allow the application to learn from experience, reduce errors, and improve overall performance, ensuring that its full potential is realized. In this way, the application could evolve over time, becoming more and more efficient and offering more and more personalized solutions.</p><p>From a hardware point of view, there is a need for expansion of the sensor network. The exact number of sensors that need to be deployed depends on various factors, such as the wanted accuracy of the readings and the distribution of irrigation pipes. These sensors should include soil sensors to measure the pH value, air pressure, and wind sensors, as well as precipitation sensors to measure the amount and rate of rainfall. By monitoring climatic conditions more extensively and accurately, we can obtain more detailed data and make more informed decisions.</p><p>As potential future research directions, we plan to extend our work to provide data from our custom and advanced sensor systems, solar powered and fully integrated with our main application, expanding the information available to AI by measuring the slope, the custom feature that truly make every cultivable area unique, to better assess the micro-changes that could happen.</p><p>By analyzing the hardware feedback from our current system, we can see that the sensors chosen for the system might lack the desired precision; more sophisticated sensor solutions might appeal more to smaller parcels where the accuracy of irrigation might be critical, but for large-scale farms, the accuracy is less critical, and this system does not interfere with good irrigation decisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec6-sensors-25-01199"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>The originality of this study lies in its advanced integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with highly scalable nationwide IoT networks and interactive geospatial visualization, a paradigm shift from conventional IoT-based irrigation systems. Unlike existing solutions constrained by static thresholds, our framework employs dynamic AI models to analyze real-time microclimatic data, historical trends, and crop-specific requirements, enabling adaptive irrigation schedules responsive to erratic weather patterns&#x02014;a critical innovation for drought-prone regions in Eastern Europe.</p><p>Key advancements include contextual AI recommendations powered by OpenAI&#x02019;s API, which translates raw sensor data into actionable insights (e.g., &#x0201c;Delay irrigation during peak daylight hours to reduce evaporation losses by 30%&#x0201d;). The system also introduces national-scale risk mapping, capable of aggregating data from distributed IoT nodes to generate heatmaps that classify regions into risk tiers (high-risk, precautionary, optimal), enabling proactive resource allocation. While this study focuses on a single node, the system is designed for scalability across multiple nodes nationwide.</p><p>The system&#x02019;s real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture&#x02014;combined with predictive analytics&#x02014;provides a holistic view of national climate conditions. Scalability and adaptability are central to the framework: by integrating low-cost IoT sensors with OpenAI&#x02019;s analytics, the system supports thousands of monitoring stations while remaining accessible to small-scale farmers. Interactive dashboards and customized reports bridge the gap between data collection and actionable strategies, offering crop-specific advice (e.g., &#x0201c;Increase maize irrigation during flowering by 20%&#x0201d;).</p><p>This paper provides a replicable model for global climate adaptation, with applications extending beyond agriculture, such as urban air quality monitoring. By democratizing AI-driven tools, the framework empowers stakeholders to address water scarcity, extreme weather, and food security challenges. In summary, this study advances precision agriculture by merging IoT scalability with AI-driven adaptability, offering a proactive, data-driven solution to enhance sustainability in vulnerable regions. Its integration of real-time analytics, geospatial risk mapping, and dynamic decision-making sets a new benchmark for climate-resilient agriculture.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the editor and the anonymous reviewers for reviewing our manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
