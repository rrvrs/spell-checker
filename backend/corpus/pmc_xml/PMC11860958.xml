However, these agents present challenges such as a limited therapeutic window, incomplete reperfusion rates, risk of transformation, reperfusion-induced inflammation, and a lack of promoting neuroprotection. We investigated an additional strategy in which prior studies indicated a neuroprotective role. Using a murine transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model, we sought to evaluate the neurotherapeutic efficacy of a positive allosteric modulator of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#x003b1;7-nAChR), PNU-120596 (PNU), specifically examining whether PNU would modulate stroke-induced neurological dysfunction and neuropathology, with modulation of neuroinflammation as a possible mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Young male C57BL/6J mice received a subcutaneous injection of 20mg/kg of vehicle (DMSO) or PNU-120596 immediately after reperfusion, and infarct area and Bederson score were analyzed 24 hours post-stroke.

Currently, there is only one FDA-approved pharmaceutical thrombolytic option for stroke called alteplase (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Catanese et al., 2017</xref>). Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with a narrow therapeutic window of 0&#x02013;4.5 h after stroke onset and is only designed to target the clot. However, even when complete reperfusion is attained, approximately only 50% of patients experience neurological recovery (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Dhillon, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Neumann-Haefelin et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, exploring additional therapeutic options is crucial, especially since there are no FDA-approved therapies that specifically promote post-stroke recovery.</p><p>The pathophysiology of stroke is characterized by neuronal loss due to central nervous system (CNS) ischemia and the subsequent induction of an inflammatory response, which has been shown to induce secondary neuropathology (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Various immune cells, including CD4 T-cells, are activated after an ischemic stroke. In a study examining the role of CD4 T-cells in stroke, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref> induced a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II knockout mice and observed a smaller infarct volume as compared to the wildtype control, supporting the idea that the presence of CD4 T-cells is detrimental in stroke. Similar results were found in a study where an antibody depletion protocol was used to remove CD4 T-cells. In this study, CD4 T-cell depleted tMCAO mice demonstrated improved neurological scores and increased contralateral movement, a motor deficit commonly observed in the tMCAO model, compared to the control-treated mice (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2020</xref>). However, there are several CD4 T-cell subtypes. In a study evaluating T helper (Th) 1, Th2, and Th17 CD4 T-cells in acute ischemic stroke patients, an increase in both Th1 and Th17 cells was observed, with no significant difference in the Th2 subset compared to controls. Furthermore, when comparing the National Institute of Health Stroke Score Scale (NIHSS), a tool used to assess the severity of stroke, the researchers found that that patients with higher levels of Th1 and Th17 cells exhibited worse NIHSS scores (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). This correlation suggests that CD4 T-cells play a significant role in stroke pathology and recovery, making them a critical focus of interest.</p><p>A novel drug PNU-120596 (PNU), a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#x003b1;7-nAChR), has demonstrated promising results in reducing infarct volumes and improving motor function, primarily in a rat stroke model (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev, 2018</xref>). PNU is classified as a type II PAM, meaning it does not bind to the orthosteric site where agonists and antagonists compete. Instead, it binds to the transmembrane domain and inhibits receptor desensitization, making it a compelling therapeutic agent (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). The &#x003b1;7-nAChR is expressed in various central nervous system cells, and additional studies have shown that &#x003b1;7-nAChR is also expressed in immune cells, with increased expression observed in activated inflammatory CD4 T-cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Nizri et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>However, the target cell and mechanism of action of PNU remain to be fully determined. In addition to its direct neuroprotective role, PNU&#x02019;s ability to modulate stroke-induced neuroinflammation is unknown. Elucidating this is crucial, as various stroke models have demonstrated the secondary neuropathological effect of stroke-induced CD4 T-cells. Supported by the current literature, we hypothesize that PNU will be effective in a mouse stroke model, and PNU employs an additional mechanism that regulates stroke-induced neuroinflammatory CD4 T-cells. In this study, we sought to investigate the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of an &#x003b1;7-nAChR PAM, PNU-120596, using a mouse tMCAO model, specifically examining whether PNU would modulate stroke-induced neurological dysfunction and neuropathology, with modulation of neuroinflammation as a possible mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>2.1 Mice</title><p>Young male C57BL/6J mice (9&#x02013;12 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were housed in climate-controlled, pathogen-free facilities under veterinary supervision. They were under a 12 h light and dark cycle with access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All experiments were conducted using the ARRIVE guidelines and were approved by the University of North Texas Health Science Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC 2021-0045).</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS2"><title>2.2 Murine stroke model</title><p>All experimental time points were conducted on a minimum of two separate replicates. Similar to our previous report but briefly described here, the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) procedure was performed by a surgeon who anesthetized the animal using isoflurane (1.8&#x02013;2%), 70% nitrous oxide, and 30% oxygen (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ortega et al., 2020</xref>). After the animal was anesthetized, they were placed on a heating pad to maintain a constant body temperature throughout the procedure. For the surgical process, an incision was made on the carotid bifurcation, the left carotid artery was ligated, and a 0.23 mm in diameter nylon filament (Cat 602334PK10, Doccol Corporation) was inserted into the internal carotid artery and advanced to the middle cerebral artery. The filament remained in place for 60 min before being removed to allow for reperfusion. Cerebral blood flow and baseline reductions were measured using a Laser Doppler (moorVMS-LDF 1, Moor Instruments), with a successful tMCAO defined by an 80% reduction in cerebral blood flow and a 50% baseline recovery following reperfusion. A neurological assessment was also performed for inclusion. Animals that did not display circling behavior were excluded from the study. Post-surgery, animals received local anesthetics, including bupivacaine, to support recovery and were closely monitored for any signs of distress. If there were any signs of distress, the animals were removed from the study.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS3"><title>2.3 &#x003b1;7-nAChR positive allosteric modulator</title><p>Upon confirmation of successful occlusion and reperfusion, the animals received the vehicle (DMSO) or the &#x003b1;7-nAChR PAM PNU-120596 (reconstituted in 100% DMSO). The injections were administered randomly, and the individual administering the injections was blinded to the treatment groups. Based on body weight, each animal received up to 100 &#x003bc;L per injection throughout the experimental course. There were no signs of toxicity observed, such as skin lesions, hair loss, or any other adverse effects due to DMSO administration. In the 24 h post-stroke study, the animal was administered 20 mg/kg of vehicle or PNU-120596 subcutaneously immediately after reperfusion. Twenty-four hours later, behavior function and infarct percentage were assessed. In the 72 h post-stroke study, the animals were injected with 20 mg/kg of PNU or vehicle subcutaneously immediately after reperfusion, followed by two additional doses of 10 mg/kg of PNU or vehicle at 24 and 48 h post-tMCAO (referred to as 20-D0 &#x000d7; 10-D1 &#x000d7; 10-D2). Seventy-two hours later, behavior function and infarct percentage were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS4"><title>2.4 Behavioral Assessments</title><p>To study stroke-induced unilateral brain damage, we used the Adhesive Removal Test.

The mice were then placed in the center of the apparatus, and the direction of their turn (left or right) was recorded. Each animal underwent five trials per day with a 30 s rest in between trials. The corner turning (CT) score was analyzed as CT score = [(Right turn)/(Right turn + Left turn)] &#x000d7; 100 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lekic et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Neurological deficits were assessed using the Bederson score, with the following scoring criteria: 0 = no deficits, 1 = forelimb flexion, 2 = decreased resistance to lateral push, 3 = circling.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS5"><title>2.5 Infarct percentage assessment</title><p>Using the 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride Stain (TTC) assay (Cat A10870.30, Thermofisher, United States), brain tissue was collected, and the olfactory region was removed to create approximately 1 mm sections using a brain matrix. The brain slices were placed in a petri dish with 2% TTC for 7 min. After 7 min, the slices were flipped and incubated for another 8 min in the TTC solution.

These immune cells, from both the innate and adaptive compartments (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ortega et al., 2015</xref>), produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which exacerbate neuronal damage and contribute to secondary injury (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Khoshnam et al., 2017</xref>).

These receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate rapid signal transmission by being the target of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In the CNS, they are predominantly expressed in neurons and glia of the cortex and hippocampus, playing crucial roles in cognitive functions such as learning and memory (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Letsinger et al., 2022</xref>).

For example, RG3487, an &#x003b1;7-nAChR agonist and serotonin receptor antagonist, has shown efficacy in modulating cognitive function in rodents and holds potential for treating Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wallace et al., 2011</xref>).

In stroke models, several &#x003b1;7-nAChR agonists and antagonists have been described. Using a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion murine model, PHA 568487-(agonist) treated mice were found to perform better on neurofunctional tests, had decreased infarct volumes, and less neuronal cell death, which was reversed in mice treated with the antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ischemic injury in the CNS leads to the development of neuroinflammation, a physiological process that is initially beneficial by removing injured/dead cells and initiating tissue regeneration. However, excessive and long-term inflammation after a stroke has been shown to lead to secondary neuropathology (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, targeting and suppressing this excessive neuroinflammation is paramount to promoting neurological recovery after a stroke. &#x003b1;7-nAChRs have been shown to be expressed on microglia (CNS endogenous innate cell) and macrophages (peripheral innate cell). In fact, treatment by exogenous nicotine or the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) has been shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, a phenomenon absent in cells obtained from &#x003b1;7 knockout mice, termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jonge and Ulloa, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). A similar observation was observed when microglia and astrocytes were treated with ACh (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Egea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Shytle et al., 2004</xref>). This immune inhibition is believed to occur through two pathways: Jak2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Bencherif et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Jonge et al., 2005</xref>). The Jak2/STAT3 metabotropic signaling results in the inhibition of the nuclear factor (NF)-kB, which is involved in the expression of several inflammatory cytokines including, IL1&#x003b2;, IL6, and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Egea et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, the PI3K signaling leads to Nrf2 inhibiting NF-kB (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Egea et al., 2015</xref>). With a similar end result but mediated by PLC signaling, activation of &#x003b1;7-nAChRs in microglia and astrocytes results in an increase in intracellular calcium stores, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and P44/42, kinases involved in neuroinflammation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Youssef et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In our study, a single dose of PNU immediately after reperfusion decreased the infarct percentage at 24 h post-tMCAO. However, when the young mice were treated with the method that mimics the drip infusion given to stroke patients, the infarct percentage did not decrease compared to the vehicle 3 days post-tMCAO. There was no difference in neurological dysfunction between the vehicle and PNU in both treatment regimens. The lack of significant differences in infarct percentage between groups in the multi-dose treatment regimen may be due to the specific dosage and method of administration used, as well as the time of assessment. This supports the idea that PNU&#x02019;s neuroprotective efficacy may be time-dependent, and its effects are beneficial when administered early, emphasizing the importance of timing in the therapeutic intervention of stroke. It should also be noted that a sham group was not included in testing the efficacy of PNU, as previous studies have shown no significant differences in immune system responses under sham conditions (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Morales et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the differences in observations may be attributed to the possibility that the drug has lost its biological activity; however, this seems unlikely, as experiments demonstrating protection were conducted alongside those in which protection was not observed. In the literature, PNU has demonstrated efficacy in a rat model of stroke (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), improved cognition in a schizophrenia model (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">McLean et al., 2012</xref>), and shown anti-depressant-like properties (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Targowska-Duda et al., 2021</xref>). It has also improved motor function in Parkinson&#x02019;s (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gowayed et al., 2022</xref>) and showed better outcomes in an Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease model (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Callahan et al., 2013</xref>). However, as we transitioned from a rat to a mouse model, we found that a higher dose of PNU is required to observe efficacy during the first 24 h of a stroke. In addition, it is possible that the observed differences may be due to differences in drug metabolism between species, as previous work has shown efficacy with lower dosages in rats (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To account for this, we selected a 20 mg/kg dosage as an intermediate between the 11.5 mg/kg used by <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev (2018)</xref> and the 30 mg/kg used by <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Kalappa et al. (2013)</xref> in rat stroke models, both of which administered PNU subcutaneously. Like <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev (2018)</xref>, we utilized a three-dose injection regimen. However, rather than waiting 6.5 h post-tMCAO, we administered the first dose immediately after reperfusion, followed by additional doses at 24 and 48 h (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev, 2018</xref>). The subsequent doses were half the initial dose [10 mg/kg in our study compared to 5.5 mg/kg in <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev&#x02019;s (2018)</xref> study], following a similar dosing strategy (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gaidhani and Uteshev, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al. (2013)</xref>, performed a similar experimental setup but was focused on intravenous injection at a 1 mg/kg dosage.</p><p>After establishing that PNU did not alter the general neurological function when using the Bederson score, we wanted to evaluate asymmetrical and sensorimotor coordination. In the adhesive removal test (which tests sensorimotor function), the vehicle and PNU-treated groups showed increased removal times on days 1 and 3 post-tMCAO compared to the training day, with no differences between treatment groups. In the time to contact, no differences were observed between each treatment group. This outcome corresponds with the lack of significant differences in infarct volume between groups in this multi-dose treatment regimen, suggesting that PNU was ineffective at reducing stroke pathology in the multi-dose treatment regimen. In contrast, PHA 568487, a selective &#x003b1;7-nAChR agonist, has been tested in a pMCAO model and has been shown to decrease infarct volume and alleviate the asymmetrical motor deficits in the adhesive removal and corner test during the first 7 days post-pMCAO (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2014</xref>). This agonist has also improved long-term neurobehavioral deficits in an intracerebral hemorrhage model (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Krafft et al., 2017</xref>). This further supports the idea that targeting the &#x003b1;7-nAChR is beneficial in stroke therapy.</p><p>CD4 T-cells are recruited 24 h after a stroke, but peak infiltration occurs 3&#x02013;4 days after the stroke (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 2002</xref>). While there are a variety of CD4 T-cell subsets, the Th1 subset has shown promotion of stroke neuropathology. <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al. (2012)</xref> compared Th1, Th2, and a Treg knockout mice and saw a more significant decrease in infarct volume in the Th1 knockout and a lower neurological score compared to the other groups, supporting the hypothesis that the Th1 subset promotes stroke neuropathology. The &#x003b1;7-nAChR is found on CD4 T-cells, and the literature shows that cholinergic signaling can attenuate inflammatory CD4 T-cells, and the receptor expression exponentially increases after the CD4 T-cells become activated (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Nizri et al., 2009</xref>). In an animal model of multiple sclerosis that was treated with nicotine, an &#x003b1;7-nAChR agonist, the authors saw a decrease in Th1 transcription factor and Th1 cytokines (IFN-y, TNF-a), an increase in Th2 transcription factor GATA-3, a reduction in IL-10, an increase in IL-4, and a decrease in IL-17. Their work demonstrated that &#x003b1;7-nAChR agonist can modulate CD4 T-cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Nizri et al., 2009</xref>). However, our data demonstrated no changes in the inflammatory Th1 (CD4+IFNY+) and Th17 (CD4+IL-17A+), the anti-inflammatory Th2 (CD4+IL-4+), and the T regulatory (CD4+FOXP3+) CD4 T-cell phenotype in the PNU-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group in both the spleen and cervical lymph nodes. There was also no difference in the Th1 to Th2 ratio between the groups. This may reflect a lack of protection at 3 days post-tMCAO, supporting the time-dependent efficacy of PNU-120596 in the mouse stroke model.</p><p>Future research should explore three main areas. First, investigating different dosage regimens and timing is paramount. Especially since type II PAMs could lead to unregulated receptor activation, disrupting calcium homeostasis and causing cell death - particularly during a stroke as choline levels significantly increase (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, PNU administration immediately followed stroke induction, and although this may have an effect on the neurological aspect of stroke, stroke-induced inflammation may not have reached its apex; thus, future research should evaluate delayed PNU administration. Additionally, future research should test varying dosage levels. The pharmacology kinetics in mice may differ significantly, and dosages that were effective in previous rat studies may not be efficacious in mice. For the same reason, future investigations should also consider extending treatment duration.</p><p>Second, future studies should look into combination therapies. It may be that PNU might work synergistically with other therapies currently incorporated into the standard of care, including anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants, thrombolytic agents, or other alpha 7 partial agonists.</p><p>Finally, future studies should evaluate long-term cognitive and sensory outcomes. Our study was limited to outcomes during the acute phases of stroke. Future studies should extend the study to months and years and expand the scope to include spatial learning, memory, and behavior&#x02014;outcomes significantly affected after a stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, a 20 mg/kg dose of PNU provided initial protection 24 h post-tMCAO. However, the protection is lost at 72 h post-tMCAO and no differences were seen in CD4 T-cells during this time frame. This suggests that the therapeutic window for PNU may be limited in a murine model, which is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The data presented herein were obtained at the Flow Cytometry Facility, a core research facility at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, with the training and assistance of Dr. Sharad Shrestha.
