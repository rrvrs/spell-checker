Chinese liquor is categorized into four major aroma types: Jiangxiang, Nongxiang, Qingxiang, and Fengxiang (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2024</xref>). Fengxiangxing, a distilled liquor exclusive to China with a long history and distinctive flavor, is also characterized by its unique brewing process and storage practices (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2022a</xref>).</p><p>Fengxiangxing Baijiu is a distilled spirit made primarily from barley, wheat, peas, sorghum, and other grains. It is prepared using Fengxiangxing Daqu as the saccharification and fermentation agent through saccharification, fermentation, and distillation (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2022</xref>). The formation of Fengxiangxing Baijiu can primarily be attributed to the unique geographical, environmental, raw materials, and process conditions determined by Fengxiangxing Daqu, with its unique flora serving as the core factor (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2022</xref>). Currently, the evaluation of Daqu quality primarily focuses on sensory characteristics and physicochemical properties. However, since the microbial flora in Daqu is its core component, establishing a fungal flora evaluation system could be instrumental in ensuring the stability of Baijiu aroma. By detecting and controlling the microbial flora, it is possible to maintain consistency in flavor. Exploring the characteristics and mechanisms of core flora within Daqu can further unveil the intrinsic nature of various Baijiu flavors, facilitating the transformation of Chinese Baijiu from traditional practices to intelligent processes. However, despite its importance, research on the characterization of core functional flora in Daqu and the mechanisms behind the flavor compounds they produce remain limited.</p><p>Currently, research on the fungal flora in Fengxiangxing Daqu primarily focuses on the diversity of the flora and its correlation with the genus-level microorganisms, physicochemical properties, and volatile compounds of Daqu. Studies have identified the five most abundant fungal genera as <italic>Thermoascus</italic>, <italic>Saccharomycopsis</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Wickerhamomyces</italic>, and <italic>Kazachstania</italic> (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). These genera had different correlations with the liquefaction power, saccharification power, fermentation power, esterification power, and volatile compounds in Daqu. However, genus-level analyses were unable to identify the specific species responsible for these effects. Some studies on fungal species revealed the top five fungal species in order of abundance were <italic>Thermoascus aurantiacus, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Aspergillus chevalieri, Wickerhamomyces anomalus,</italic> and <italic>Kazachstania humilis</italic>. Among them, <italic>Aspergillus chevalieri</italic> and <italic>Thermoascus aurantiacus</italic> positively correlated with liquefaction power, saccharification power, and esterification power. In contrast, <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic> and <italic>Wickerhamomyces anomalus</italic> showed negative correlations with liquefaction, saccharification, and esterification power. Additionally, <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic> showed a positive correlation with the fermentation power of Daqu (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2024b</xref>). These fungal species also exhibited different correlations with various volatile compounds in Daqu, including alcohols, aldehydes, acids, esters, ketones, phenols, nitrogen-containing compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, terpenes, lactones, furans, and aromatics (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2024</xref>). However, correlation analysis between the fungal flora and the physicochemical properties and volatile compounds of Daqu, based on microbial diversity, cannot accurately quantify which species contributes to the metabolic power of Daqu, the size of its flavor compounds, and the flavor markers produced, as well as the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>The present study employed advanced biological and informatics analysis techniques. These included PacBio SMRT ITS sequencing technology, fungal genome <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing, and Headspace Solid-Phase Micro-extraction/Gas Chromatography&#x02013;Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC&#x02013;MS) analysis of volatile compounds. Additionally, the study examined the flavor markers produced by the three fungal species and their formation mechanisms. The investigation focused on the abundance of these fungi, their liquefaction, saccharification, fermentation, and esterification power, as well as their impact on fungal volatiles, simulated volatiles in solid fermentation cultures, and metabolic relationships. This research aids in the development of a comprehensive fungal flora indicator system for Daqu, which can help stabilize its quality and facilitate the transformation of Chinese Baijiu production from traditional methods to intelligent processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Sources of Fengxiangxing Daqu and fungal samples</title><p>Five replicate batches of Fengxiangxing Daqu were obtained from Shaanxi Xifeng Liquor Company Limited in Liulin Town, Baoji City, Shaanxi Province.

The first pathway involved the conversion of mevalonic acid (MVA) into isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), a common precursor for terpene synthesis. This pathway, known as the MVA pathway, leads to the production of different terpenes, including linalool. The second pathway was the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate/methylerythritol phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway. Unlike the MVA pathway, the DXP/MEP pathway differs in both the site of synthesis and the route used to produce IPP.</p><p>Several key enzyme-encoding genes involved in linalool production were identified based on whole-genome functional gene annotation. These included hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS), mevalonate kinase (MVK), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK), diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MVD), and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS). Specifically, strain MHR2 encoded one HMGCS, two MVK, one PMVK, one MVD and five FDPS genes. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>, strain MHR2 entered the MVA pathway to synthesize MVA from acetoacetyl-CoA and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) in the presence of HMGCS and MVK. IPP was formed through subsequent phosphorylation and decarboxylation reactions. IPP was then catalyzed by FDPS to produce geranylpyrophosphate (GPP), a C10 backbone molecule that serves as a direct precursor for terpenoids. Finally, GPP enters the terpenoid skeleton biosynthetic pathway. In the presence of (3S)-linalool synthase, GPP is converted into (+)-linalool, whereas in the presence of (3R)-linalool synthase, it forms (&#x02212;)-linalool. However, genome annotation revealed that strain MHR2 does not encode enzymes related to the DOXP/MEP pathway, suggesting that linalool synthesis occurs exclusively through the MVA pathway in this strain.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Possible metabolic pathways of linalool in strain MHR2 <bold>(a)</bold> and &#x003b3;-nonanolactone in strain XFSa-P5 <bold>(b)</bold>.

Functional gene annotation of the whole genome indicated that strain XFSa-P5 encoded ten ACSL genes, three FAS1 genes, and two ACOT genes.</p><p>A possible metabolic pathway for &#x003b3;-nonanolactone production by strain XFSa-P5 is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>. Strain XFSa-P5 produced palmitic acid under the catalysis of FAS1. Palmitic acid was then catalyzed by ACSL to form palmitoyl coenzyme A, which underwent a series of elongation and desaturation reactions to yield linoleoyl-CoA. Linoleoyl-CoA was converted to linolic acid through the action of enzymes such as ACOT. Linolic acid was subsequently hydroxylated to form (9Z,11E)-(13S)-13-hydroperoxyoctadecane. Hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid is a key precursor compound for (S)-&#x003b3;-nonanolactone synthesis. In the pre-metabolomics assay of strain XFSa-P5 mycelium, non-targeted metabolomics indicated a high abundance of this compound. Finally, (S)-&#x003b3;-nonanolactone was synthesized through several cycles of &#x003b2;-oxidation followed by lactonization, constituting the primary pathway for &#x003b3;-nonanolactone synthesis in strain XFSa-P5.</p><p>Meanwhile, strain XFSa-P5 synthesized &#x003b3;-decalactone through a multi-step process. First, hydroxy fatty acids, non-hydroxy fatty acids, and fatty acid esters were used as substrates. These substrates underwent &#x003b2;-oxidation to generate the precursor compound 4-hydroxydecanoic acid. Finally, 4-hydroxydecanoic acid was converted into &#x003b3;-dodecalactone through hydroxylation and carboxyl hydroxyl lactonization reactions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec34"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In previous studies, <italic>Aspergillus chevalieri</italic>, <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic>, and <italic>Thermoascus aurantiacus</italic> were identified as the dominant microbial species in Fengxiangxing Daqu (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2024</xref>)<italic>.

Comparing the correlation between the dominant fungi in other Daqu types and their metabolic power showed that the dominant fungus <italic>Thermoascus</italic> in high-temperature Daqu exhibited strong esterification power, positively correlated with saccharification and liquefaction power. Similarly, the dominant fungus <italic>Saccharomycopsis</italic> in Daqu showed a highly significant positive correlation with the fermentation power of the samples (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2022</xref>), consistent with the results of this study. However, the abundance of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> positively correlated with the esterification power of samples in strong-flavored Daqu (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). These findings suggested that the results of the correlation analysis between the microbial flora and the metabolic power of Daqu, based on diversity analysis, are affected by the type of Daqu and subject to variability.</p><p>Therefore, these three fungi are pivotal in shaping the sensory quality, physicochemical properties, and flavor compounds of Fengxiangxing Daqu, playing a crucial role in the controlled enhancement of both Daqu and baijiu quality.</p><p>The XFTh-X1 strain positively influenced the esterification capacity of Daqu. The HS-SPME/GC&#x02013;MS and OAV analyses demonstrated its potential for pyrazine compound production. As a thermophilic fungus, XFTh-X1 thrived in the high-temperature environment of Daqu fermentation. The heat-resistant hydrolases produced by the strain under these conditions enhanced the Maillard reaction, increasing the formation of pyrazine compounds (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). Studies have shown that the contents of 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 2-butyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, 3, 6-dimethyl-pyrazine, tetramethylpyrazine and methylpyrazine in high-temperature Daqu were higher than those in medium-high temperature, medium-temperature and low-temperature Daqu samples (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2023</xref>). The contents of <italic>Thermoascus</italic> and <italic>Thermomyces</italic> were positively correlated with pyrazines in high-temperature Daqu, which played an important role in the formation of soy sauce flavor of high-temperature Daqu (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The XFSa-P5 strain was capable of producing a wide range of lactone compounds. Through HS-SPME/GC&#x02013;MS and OAV measurements, five lactone compounds, including &#x003b3;-nonanolactone, were identified among the volatile flavor compounds produced by <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic>. &#x003b3;-Nonanolactone is a compound with a complex aroma, including cream and caramel. &#x003b3;-Decalactone imparted a fruity and peach-like aroma when diluted. These lactone compounds were abundant and contributed to the aroma of XFSa-P5 samples. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis further revealed the presence of three key genes associated with linolenic acid biosynthesis in <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic>. Linolenic acid is a precursor in the biosynthesis of &#x003b3;-nonanolactone. The identification of these genes has revealed the metabolic pathway for &#x003b3;-nonanolactone production in <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic>. This finding offers a theoretical basis for future strategies to enhance &#x003b3;-nonanolactone production through metabolic pathway regulation, similar to the mechanism reported for the production of lactone compounds from fatty acids in yeast. Lactone compounds are widely distributed in different products, including baijiu, yellow wine, and whisky. In a related study, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Su et al. (2020)</xref> reported that ester compound content increased by 11.8% during <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> fermentation compared to traditional fermentation agents. Additionally, <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic> produced various other flavor compounds, including esters, alcohols, organic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, contributing to an enhanced flavor experience in the final product (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al.

Therefore, the production of lactone compounds, such as &#x003b3;-nonanolactone, by strain XFSa-P5, as the dominant fungus in Fengxiangxing Daqu, plays a significant role in enhancing the flavor of wine.</p><p>The results of HS-SPME/GC&#x02013;MS and <italic>r</italic>OAV analysis of the MHR2 strain showed that the fungus produced linalool, a terpene compound with a strong greenish-sweet aroma that resembles rosewood, along with floral notes of lilac, lily of the valley, and a blend of woody and fruity aroma profiles (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2025</xref>). Terpenes in baijiu are highly known for their aroma and flavoring properties and are considered essential functional compounds in the beverage. In recent years, research on terpenoids in baijiu has expanded significantly, with three primary sources identified: (1) terpenoids were introduced to baijiu through the raw materials used in brewing; (2) they were synthesized by microorganisms either <italic>de novo</italic> or via precursor compounds; and (3) they formed as a result of chemical reactions during the baijiu fermentation process (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2023</xref>). Terpene compounds were distributed across raw materials, Daqu, Zaopei, and finished wine during the production processes of Jiangxiangxing and Nongxiangxing baijiu, with high concentration observed during the fermentation of Daqu and the finished product. The highest content of total terpene compounds was found in Jiangxiangxing Daqu, at 2088.68&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>), followed by Nongxiangxing Daqu, which contained 2020.32&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/kg (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2023</xref>). Although terpenoid compounds are a significant component of Chinese baijiu, particularly in Jiangxiangxing and Nongxiangxing varieties, there is a lack of specific research on the types, contents, and sources of terpenoids in Fengxiangxing baijiu. Linalool, a terpene compound, was investigated in this study. In simulated Daqu fermentation using <italic>Aspergillus chevalieri</italic>, the highest yield of linalool was 1.511&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/g. A genome-wide analysis of the MHR2 strain using Maker2 software identified ten key genes involved in monoterpene synthesis, enabling the development of an initial metabolic pathway for linalool production. The identification of these genes sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying linalool biosynthesis in <italic>Aspergillus chevalieri</italic>, opening the possibility of enhancing flavor compound production through genetic engineering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec35"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings identified <italic>Aspergillus chevalieri</italic>, <italic>Saccharomycopsis fibuligera</italic>, and <italic>Thermoascus aurantiacus</italic> as the core functional fungi in Fengxiangxing Daqu.

These results revealed the distinct contributions of the three fungi to the physicochemical properties and flavor profiles of Daqu, as well as the formation mechanisms of the flavor markers linalool and &#x003b3;-nonanolactone. Additionally, it supports the development of a comprehensive fungal flora indicator for Daqu, contributing to quality stabilization and facilitating the transformation of Chinese baijiu production from traditional methods to intelligent systems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p>
