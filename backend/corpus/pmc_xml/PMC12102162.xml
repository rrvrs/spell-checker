Prevalence rates are high among South Asian adults compared to white Europeans (25% vs. 5%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over time, high postprandial glucose (PG) increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications, including atherosclerosis-related diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease), kidney failure, retinopathy, and limb amputations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of these complications is higher in South Asian populations as compared to other regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Dietary management remains the first-line treatment strategy for T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Food with high glycaemic load or high in available carbohydrates are the main contributors to increased PG response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, a limited number of studies have shown differences in metabolic response between ethnicities when fed the same intervention. A study administrating a 5-day dietary challenge mimicking western-diets (high fat, high-calorie diet) showed that healthy South Asians exhibited increased fasting glucose, insulin and insulin resistance compared to white European counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, another study in healthy adults showed that the PG response was significantly higher in South Asians (e.g., by +62% for malted wheat cereal, high in fibre) compared to matched-white Europeans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, data on the PG response to an acute dietary challenge in South Asians and white Europeans with T2D is not available. Thus, nutritional solutions or ingredients which adapt to one&#x02019;s cultural preferences, that lower PG response in people with poor metabolic control, are of great need. In this context, mycoprotein is a protein-rich ingredient derived from the continuous fermentation of the fungus <italic>Fusarium venenatum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (nutritional profile shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) which is currently available in 16 countries as meat-alike products (available from Quorn<sup>TM</sup>). Mycoprotein has been shown to improve glycaemic control, lipid profiles and to lower appetite and energy intake, in both acute and in mid-term (7-day) interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in subjects with normal glycaemic control. These effects have been attributed to its intrinsic fibre and protein content, as well as its unique food structure (i.e. hyphae), including its fungal cell wall, which makes alpha-amylase diffuse into it, entrapping it, being less available to perform carbohydrate enzymatic hydrolysis, as observed in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Evidence shows that high dietary fibre and protein intake play a role in regulating glycaemia and appetite responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], achieved through elevated incretin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], insulin secretagogue effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the stimulation of anorexigenic gut hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, to date, no study has sought to examine the effect of mycoprotein on postprandial responses in people with T2D.</p><p id="Par8">Other ingredients with relevant efficacy at decreasing PG response and appetite include guar gum, which is a soluble fibre derived from processed guar bean (<italic>Cyamopsis tetragonoloba)</italic>. The effects of guar gum on the glycaemia and appetite responses have been tested in people with T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and have been mechanistically linked to delayed gastric emptying, owing to the viscous qualities of guar gum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We therefore hypothesised that guar gum and mycoprotein would lower PG response, and may act synergistically when combined, in subjects with T2D. The aim of our work was to determine the independent, and interactive effects of mycoprotein, guar gum and ethnicity in lowering both PG and insulin responses, as well as appetite responses in people with T2D.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par9">A total of 25 non-insulin treated male and female subjects with T2D (12 white Europeans and 13 South Asian) volunteers were recruited from May 2019 until February 2021 (with a pause from March 2020 to September 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic). Recruitment was performed via advertisements in the press, community posters (including local community NHS organizations and GP practices) and social media. Participants were screened against the eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria consisted of being diagnosed with T2D, being of South Asian origin (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) or white European ethnicity (ethnicity was self-reported as origin of the 4 grandparents), aged 18-70 years old, and having 5.5&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;9.0%.</p><p id="Par10">Exclusion criteria included: parents of different ethnicity (self-proclaimed), insulin therapy, GLP-1 agonists or orlistat, gastrointestinal disease effecting bowel function or nutritional intake, significant heart, hepatic or renal disease (requiring dialysis), cancer, pancreatitis, history of alcohol and/or drug abuse, or current smokers.

The study visit order were randomised using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sealedenvelope.com">www.sealedenvelope.com</ext-link>. The same researcher generated the random allocation sequence, enroled participants, and assigned participants to interventions. Visits were separated by a wash-out period of 3&#x02013;7 days. Participants were asked not to change their physical activity routine or dietary habits throughout the study, but were asked to refrain from strenuous physical exercise for 72&#x02009;h prior to the study visits. Participants attended the NIHR Imperial Clinical Research Facility at Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK, following an overnight fast. The last dose of any oral medication was to be taken 8&#x02009;h the day before each study visit and not during the test meal of the study visit. 24&#x02009;h prior to the study visit participants were asked to consume a standard evening meal of their choice, which was kept constant on the following visits, and monitored by asking the participants to provide the package label at each visit.

Next, an intravenous cannula for serial blood sampling was placed into the antecubital fossa, which was kept patent for 195&#x02009;min to allow blood withdrawal at different timepoints without further discomfort. This allowed for 2 fasting (&#x02013;15 and &#x02013;5&#x02009;min relative to start of meal intake) blood samples. Then, a test meal (details in the Test Meal section) was served and asked to be consumed within 15&#x02009;min, with both researcher and participants blinded to the type of meal. Next, participants rated its palatability with an analogue scale ranging from 1 (not good at all) to 10 (extremely good). Seven postprandial 8&#x02009;ml blood samples were drawn at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180&#x02009;min relative to start of meal intake. Before every blood sample, participants completed a 100&#x02009;mm visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess subjective appetite feelings (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

We found that PG response was modulated by independent or additive effects of protein, guar gum and ethnicity, where mycoprotein independently reduced PG response by -27% (similarly to soy) vs. chicken. Moreover, we found that guar gum independently reduced PG response by &#x02013;40%, however, there was no interactive effect between protein and guar gum. For postprandial insulin, an interactive or synergistic effect of guar gum with ethnicity was found, where guar gum only reduced insulin levels in the South Asian participants.</p><p id="Par32">Evidence in the literature on the effects of mycoprotein on postprandial glucose and insulin response iAUC0-180&#x02009;min is limited to only one study including healthy subjects with overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], in which similar amounts of mycoprotein (132&#x02009;g) to the ones tested in the present study, did not lead to a decrease in glucose iAUC0-180&#x02009;min but decreased insulin iAUC0-180&#x02009;min by 21% compared to protein and energy matched-chicken combined with 25&#x02013;30&#x02009;g of carbohydrate intake. We found opposite findings, as we found that mycoprotein, similarly to soy, independently lowered glucose iAUC0-180&#x02009;min and did not affect insulin response, however the population used was people with T2D, which could explain the different findings. Recruited participants in the current study may have had different degrees of impaired insulin sensitivity/secretion and had an heterogenous intake of drugs affecting different mechanisms (some on lifestyle only, while others on metformin, gliptins, sulfonylureas) which may have a long-lasting effect on insulin sensitising/stimulating effects, despite asking them to refrain from their morning dose on study visit only. These factors described above may have contributed to greater insulin response variability and lack of significant effect by protein. However, the reduced PG response observed with mycoprotein could be due to both the fibre content and hyphal nature of mycoprotein, affecting digestive processes such as alpha-amylase entrapping by the fungal cell walls, thus delaying starch hydrolysis and later glucose absorption as shown in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other mechanisms such as increased viscosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and delay in gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], are not yet conclusive, and warrant further investigation.</p><p id="Par33">The independent effects observed with guar gum at lowering PG response are in line with previous studies testing guar gum(6&#x02009;g)-enriched breads in 38 normal weight subjects, where it is observed a 40% reduction compared to high fibre flour-breads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

The effects of guar gum at reducing PG response could be because it is a viscous fibre, well-known to decrease PG in healthy adults and long-term glucose control in T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

While its effects on gastric emptying have been not proven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], delayed gastric emptying leads to slowed carbohydrate breakdown, absorption in the gut to bloodstream, and ultimately a reduced PG response.</p><p id="Par34">The significantly increased PG response following a mixed meal in the South Asian vs<italic>.</italic> white European cohort is aligned with previous studies conducted in participants without T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A study administering a 5-day dietary challenge mimicking Western diets (high fat, high-calorie diet) showed that healthy South Asians exhibited increased fasting glucose, insulin and insulin resistance compared to age and BMI matched-white European counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, another study in metabolically healthy participants showed that the PG response to a malted wheat cereal meal was 62% higher in South Asian participants compared to matched-white Europeans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In our study, we observed an increase in PG response in the South Asian group despite white Europeans having similar age, sex ratio, HbA1c, duration of T2D, and fat free mass ratio. Interestingly, white Europeans had worst metabolic phenotype such as increased body fat, body weight, blood triglycerides, and fasting glucose levels. Although the reason for this differing effect remains unclear, it may be attributed to variations in body fat distribution or the use of medications for T2D &#x02014;areas that were beyond the scope of this study.</p><p id="Par35">Interestingly, there was a significant interactive effect between guar gum and ethnicity, where the impact of guar gum at lowering postprandial insulin response was only observed in South Asian participants. Decreasing insulin demand from beta-cells may be protective in people with T2D, as hyperinsulinemia overtime is followed by pancreatic beta-cell impairment and exogenous insulin dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This study is noteworthy as it utilizes a realistic food product, chapati, which is a flour-based staple in South Asian culture. We demonstrated that the simple addition of 5&#x02009;g of guar gum, a culturally recognized ingredient, per 100&#x02009;g of flour, can provide specific benefits for this cohort in managing diabetes. The observed interactive effect was unexpected; we did not anticipate differences in insulin response among ethnicities due to guar gum, which primarily influences digestive processes, such as reducing alpha-amylase activity. The underlying reasons for this interactive effect remain unclear, as this study was not designed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the varying physiological responses.</p><p id="Par36">Gut hormone response, <italic>ad libitum</italic> and post-visit energy intake were not affected by protein type, guar gum or ethnicity. This finding is in contrast with the literature on the effects on energy intake by mycoprotein using similar amounts in metabolically healthy cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Our observation that the addition of guar gum to the test meals did not result in a significant impact on <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake is in line with a recent meta-analysis also showing no effect of guar gum-enriched foods on energy intake, and explained by a loss of satiating properties when guar gum is given in the form of bread compared to liquid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The main strength of this study is its design (acute, controlled, randomised) and the tight control for glycaemic confounders (i.e., standard evening meals, strenuous physical activity avoidance, iso-caloric and -macronutrient matched meals). This allowed us to dissociate, as much as possible, the effect of added ingredients being investigated (protein type or guar gum) on postprandial glycaemic responses. Furthermore, half of the participants were of South Asian ethnicity, allowing for comparison of PG responses between ethnic groups with culturally relevant foods and ingredients (chapati, guar gum, mince protein format) and pave the way for generating further evidence to inform south-Asian specific nutritional advice. Importantly, test meals designed for this study delivered approximately 19&#x02009;g of dietary fibre in one serving, with a good palatability profile, representing &#x0003e;60% of the daily recommended intake of fibre by World Health Organisation&#x02019;s guidelines.</p><p id="Par38">We recognise the limitation of using a 180-min time frame to capture postprandial metabolic responses in a population with impaired glucose management, rather than the complete postprandial time frame (360-min). This approach may have not been enough to understand the full digestion and metabolic interplay beyond the time of returning to baseline, thereby potentially missing a later-stage effect in postprandial responses to the test meals. We acknowledge that the medication heterogeneity present in this study may have led to reduced interpretability of results. Implementing a more stringent exclusion criterion, such as including only first-line medication for diabetes (e.g., metformin), would homogenize the cohort, reduce variability, minimise further confounding, and allow for a more accurate attribution of changes in postprandial glucose response to the interventions. We also recognise that the number of subjects we recruited is slightly under what we aimed to (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12 per ethnicity) for unfounded studies. This was because this clinical trial was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, time and budget constraints. However, we strongly believe that the variance and effect size hereby reported can help power future nutritional clinical studies using this understudied cohort.</p><p id="Par39">In conclusion, this study shows that replacing chicken for mycoprotein and including guar gum (5&#x02009;g within 100&#x02009;g of chapati bread) have additive effects at decreasing PG response in people with T2D. This study also adds on to the current scarce evidence on postprandial responses to culturally adapted mixed meals in South Asians with T2D, who have a poor metabolic response to foods. Nonetheless, this study has only assessed the acute postprandial response, and data from this study may be used to inform the design and power of forthcoming studies aimed at testing chronic combinatory effect of mycoprotein and guar gum on long-term glycaemic control. Moreover, future studies should use a more homogenous cohort to investigate the mechanisms underpinning these effects, such as the role of gut microbiota fermentation, gastric emptying, or gut hormone response, as these remain unclear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
