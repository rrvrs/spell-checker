To the best of our knowledge, we report the first documented case of Nevus of Ota in Trinidad and Tobago, presenting in a 67-year-old female with characteristic pigmentation and no family history of similar conditions. The diagnosis was confirmed clinically, and the patient was counseled on potential ocular and dermatological complications. This case highlights the importance of recognizing rare dermatological conditions in diverse populations to facilitate timely diagnosis, appropriate management, and effective monitoring for potential complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>dermal melanocytosis</kwd><kwd>nevus of ota</kwd><kwd>oculodermal melanocytosis</kwd><kwd>oculodermal melanosis</kwd><kwd>scleral hyperpigmentation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nevus of Ota, also known as oculomucodermal melanocytosis, is a benign congenital hyperpigmentation of the facial skin and mucous membranes, following the distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 1939, Dr. Masao Ota provided the first detailed description of its classical clinical presentation, characterized by hyperpigmentation along the cutaneous distribution of the first and second divisions of the trigeminal nerve, often accompanied by mucosal involvement [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>This condition is very rare, with a reported prevalence of 0.014%-0.034% in the Asian population [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While it is most common among individuals of Japanese descent, it has also been documented in those of African, Chinese, Indian, and European ancestry. There is a greater female predominance, with a female-to-male ratio of 5:1 [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of Nevus of Ota in Trinidad, occurring in a female of East Indian descent. Documenting such cases in diverse populations, including the Caribbean region, is essential for improving global understanding of its presentation, prevalence, and potential genetic or environmental influences. As Trinidad is a multiethnic society with a genetic heritage from Africa, India, China, South America, and other regions, a myriad of factors may contribute to disease patterns, none of which can be isolated. This unique case, however, could help raise ophthalmological awareness of this diagnosis in other patients, paving the way for further assessment of regional and genetic influences on its presentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 67-year-old female of East Indian descent presented to the ophthalmology clinic for a routine check-up with a history of left keratitis previously treated elsewhere. At presentation, she was asymptomatic, reporting no visual impairment, hearing loss, or sensory deficits. Examination revealed congenital, non-hereditary, unilateral left facial pigmentation with irregular borders that had progressively darkened with age.&#x000a0;At this time, she had not previously been provided with an explanation for the hyperpigmentation.&#x000a0;Written consent was obtained from the patient for the documentation and discussion of this case.</p><p>On cutaneous examination, there were multiple mottled bluish-black macular pigmented regions involving the left malar region, left upper eyelid, left ala of the nose, and the inferonasal sclera of the left eye (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There were no pigmentary changes on other parts of the body, including nails, mucous membranes, or axillary regions.&#x000a0;</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Multiple pigmented regions at presentation </title><p>A: Cutaneous bluish-black pigmentation on the left side of the face compared to the right side; B: Pigmentation of the left ala of nose and malar region of the face; C: Pigmentation of the left upper eyelid&#x000a0;</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078311-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>The patient was hypermetropic and used corrective lenses.

Near vision was N5 with +2.50 readers. Intraocular pressures were within normal limits: OD 12 mmHg and OS 11 mmHg, respectively.</p><p>The patient had a history of left herpetic keratitis, a 10-year history of hypertension controlled with Atenolol, an eight-year history of diabetes managed with Metformin, and a history of cervical cancer at age 48, treated with chemotherapy and radiation. There have been no further recurrences or complications since treatment.&#x000a0;</p><p>Anterior segment examination showed left pigment dispersion, left inferonasal pigmentation of the sclera, and left iridum heterochromia secondary to a hyperpigmented iris (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

It can be congenital, present at birth, or acquired later in life, with acquired cases commonly occurring during the second year of life, puberty, or pregnancy [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The macular discolorations typically appear as unilateral, confluent, non-hairy, flat-pigmented lesions with poorly defined margins, although bilateral cases can also occur [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The characteristic hyperpigmented patches are thought to result from incomplete migration of melanocytes from the neural crest to the epidermis during embryonic development, leading to dermal nesting and melanin production [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The pathogenesis of the nevus is multifactorial, with key predisposing factors including genetics, family sex hormones, infections, trauma, and ultraviolet light exposure [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Pigmentation generally affects the forehead, temple, malar, auricular, nasal, and periorbital regions. Tanino (1939) classified pigmentation into four types based on its distribution [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The four categories are based on the area of involvement (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).&#x000a0;</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Tanino's classification of Nevus of Ota</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subtypes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Area of Involvement</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type I</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type IA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild Orbital - upper and lower eyelids, periorbital, and temple regions are affected.</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type I</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type IB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild Zygomatic - infrapalpebral fold, nasolabial fold, and zygomatic region affected.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type I</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type IC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild Forehead - only the forehead.</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type I</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type ID</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ala nasi only affected.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type II</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moderate type - upper and lower eyelids, periocular, zygomatic, buccal, and temple regions.</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type III</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Distributed over the scalp, forehead, eyebrows, and nose.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type IV</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bilateral distribution</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The case reported here is classified as Tanino type II. The ocular adnexa and globe may also be involved, including the sclera, conjunctiva, cornea, iris, choroid, and, less commonly, the optic nerve, retrobulbar area, and extraocular muscles [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The sclera is most frequently affected in patients with Nevus of Ota. Ocular complications associated with Nevus of Ota include glaucoma, cataracts, and choroidal melanoma [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Severe pigmentation in the anterior chamber can block the iridocorneal angle, leading to increased intraocular pressure. Nevus of Ota can, therefore, be a cause of secondary glaucoma, and regular ophthalmic examinations are necessary to assess the anterior chamber and intraocular pressure for signs of glaucoma.</p><p>Diagnosis of Nevus of Ota is made based on classical clinical features. Differential diagnoses include caf&#x000e9;-au-lait patches, melasma, and drug-induced hyperpigmentation [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The pigmentation can be an isolated occurrence or part of a systemic condition, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, or neurofibromatosis [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A skin biopsy is warranted if the pigmented lesions become ulcerated or change color.</p><p>The diagnosis was confirmed by an experienced ophthalmologist based on the clinical presentation. Treatment often involves modern technologies such as YAG laser, Q-switched ruby, and Q-switched alexandrite lasers [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers and Q-switched ruby lasers target the melanocytes and melanosomes responsible for the pigmented lesions [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These laser treatments have been shown to remove the pigmented lesions without scarring. Dermatological treatments include dermabrasion, epidermal peeling, and argon laser therapy [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Beyond cutaneous involvement, ocular manifestations of Nevus of Ota, such as choroidal melanocytosis, require careful evaluation [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Choroidal melanocytosis, a form of ocular melanocytosis, presents as diffuse uveal hyperpigmentation and is commonly associated with Nevus of Ota. While benign, it significantly increases the risk of uveal melanoma, necessitating lifelong ophthalmic surveillance, including dilated fundus exams, ultrasonography, and OCT for early detection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, Nevus of Ota is a pigmentary condition that typically presents with characteristic macular patches along the trigeminal nerve distribution on the face, with potential ocular involvement, especially in the sclera. Its pathogenesis is linked to incomplete melanocyte migration during embryonic development, and it can be congenital or acquired, often triggered by factors such as hormonal changes or ultraviolet exposure. While the condition is generally benign, ocular complications such as glaucoma, cataracts, and malignancy may arise making regular ophthalmic monitoring essential. Early diagnosis is primarily clinical, with differential diagnoses including caf&#x000e9;-au-lait patches and melasma. Treatment options are based on the specific findings, but for the pigmented lesions, advanced laser technologies such as Q-switched Nd:YAG and ruby lasers have shown promising results in effectively removing them while minimizing the risk of scarring. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the clinical features and potential ocular risks is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications in patients with Nevus of Ota. This case highlights the importance for ophthalmologists in the Caribbean region to consider this condition, given the diverse population with mixed genetic backgrounds from across the globe.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Rajiv V.
