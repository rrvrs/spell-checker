Snowballing methods and purposive sampling were used to recruit participants in Australia. Coordination involved tracking the time spent by the research team for one round of focus groups. Participant engagement was measured through focus group attendance and survey feedback and analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.

Conducting two identical focus groups required 29&#x02009;h of project manager/coordinator time, 8&#x02013;11&#x02009;h for facilitators and 6.5&#x02013;8.5&#x02009;h for chief investigators. Most participants (86%) attended &#x02265;&#x02009;5/8 focus groups. Engagement was enhanced through pre&#x02010;reading material, structured/well&#x02010;organised focus groups and experienced facilitators. All participants contributed at each focus group, with varying levels of input. Health knowledge experts preferred written contributions over verbal contributions and wrote longer messages compared to community members. Community members spoke for a longer duration than health knowledge experts. Participant satisfaction was high, with participants reporting that the research team &#x02018;always valued our opinions&#x02019;.

End&#x02010;users of research may include a variety of different stakeholders, such as patients, clinical and non&#x02010;clinical staff, community members and policymakers. Co&#x02010;design is a powerful tool to align research aims and the design of interventions with community needs, by creating an opportunity for knowledge exchange, and shared power, trust and decision&#x02010;making among stakeholders [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This can result in a sense of empowerment and accomplishment for those involved [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Specifically for digital health interventions, co&#x02010;design is essential to optimise success by ensuring the needs of users are adequately incorporated [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Active stakeholder engagement bridges the gap between research and practice [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], to enhance the relevance, usefulness and acceptability of health interventions [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>There is no consistent way to report co&#x02010;design methods [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite the existence of co&#x02010;design theoretical frameworks, all components are rarely included, and reporting is often limited to the quantity and quality of outputs produced [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The processes of co&#x02010;design include the project management strategies selected by the research team, composition of the group, tools and activities used during co&#x02010;design sessions, decision&#x02010;making processes, engagement of participants, and the financial investment related to participant reimbursement and staff time [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Evaluation of the person&#x02010;level experience of co&#x02010;design can include attributes such as satisfaction, value&#x02010;proposition, achievement of a positive outcome or impact, and sense of equality and respect throughout the process [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We aimed to describe our experiences and knowledge gained from co&#x02010;designing a digital platform for stroke prevention called Love Your Brain.

Co&#x02010;design is integral to Love Your Brain, with consumers and people with lived experience working in partnership with researchers to guide the entire project. This project leverages the success of the Stroke Foundation StrokeSafe program, which provides community&#x02010;based education for primary stroke prevention. StrokeSafe presentations are effective in improving short&#x02010;term knowledge of stroke; however, this knowledge diminishes over time without reinforcement [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Love Your Brain digital platform will include a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and text messaging system to deliver stroke prevention information over 12 weeks. The aims of Love Your Brain are to increase visits to medical practitioners for assessment of stroke risk factors, improve knowledge retention of stroke risk factors and increase healthy behaviours (e.g., adherence to prescribed medication).</p><p>We report on the attributes that underpinned the co&#x02010;design process of the digital platform. In a separate report, we have outlined how the needs and preferences of participants involved in the co&#x02010;design process were used to develop the digital platform [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="hex70272-sec-0090"><label>2.2</label><title>Study Design</title><p>We undertook a distributed co&#x02010;design methodology where stakeholder groups were engaged separately.

Participants shared their ideas and experiences and were active partners in this research. The insights gained from the initial seven focus groups per cohort were used to inform and develop the digital platform over 7 months.

Each fortnight, the health knowledge expert focus group occurred on Tuesday at 1&#x02009;pm, followed by the community member focus group on Thursday at 1&#x02009;pm. Focus groups were held on the same day and time throughout, with the exception of the final focus groups, which were altered due to facilitator availability. The day and time for focus groups were chosen to accommodate the availability of the research team, with consideration of different time zones across Australia, and the likely availability of working professionals at lunchtime.</p><p>Focus groups were facilitated by the same experienced qualitative researchers with a background in stroke research and clinical care (health knowledge experts: T.P., female, PhD; community members: S.B., male, PhD). Each focus group started with an introduction to the project and a summary of the previous focus group discussion, followed by a semi&#x02010;structured discussion. The focus groups incorporated activities such as viewing sample videos and images curated by the research team, brainstorming and facilitated discussion using prompt questions. The topics discussed in the focus groups comprised the most important content to include, type and depth of information, formatting and appearance, and functionality of each component (e.g., text message frequency) of the digital platform. Throughout the co&#x02010;design process, discussions with each cohort iteratively informed the key considerations for the digital platform and guided the topics and content for subsequent focus groups. Additional research staff (M.F.K., S.L.G., C.F., C.B. and R.F.) supported the facilitator to stimulate engagement and participation by annotating a virtual whiteboard with participant responses, launching polls within Zoom, monitoring the chat function, providing technical support and responding to participant queries as required. To support repeat attendance, reminder emails containing the Zoom link were sent to participants 1 week before and 1 day before each focus group. For simplicity, the same Zoom link was used for all focus groups. After each focus group, the facilitator advertised the next focus group date and time, and the project coordinator circulated an email with a link to provide feedback on the current focus group, with instructions for reimbursement (supermarket gift voucher or bank transfer). Reimbursement for participants' time and contribution was in line with the Monash Partners Remuneration and Reimbursement Guidelines [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Gift vouchers were distributed after each focus group. Bank transfers for the total reimbursement amount were processed after the final focus groups.

One community member stated that the impact of their involvement meant their &#x02018;stroke has a positive outcome&#x02019; and another commented that the process &#x02018;made me think about my own stroke&#x02019; and they &#x02018;had to think about the things under discussion in a different way&#x02019;.</p><p>Notably, several (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) health knowledge experts commented on the opportunity of co&#x02010;designing with a &#x02018;diverse range of professionals&#x02019; who had &#x02018;different clinical background and experiences&#x02019;. And one reported they were &#x02018;inspired &#x02026; to think and explore more about stroke education on both patients and staff&#x02019;. This was echoed among community members, with one respondent stating that through the co&#x02010;design process they were &#x02018;exposed to a variety of lived experiences, which were different, but ultimately all the same&#x02019;. One community member commented that &#x02018;I felt we all knew what was the most important thing to say, we just went about it in different ways&#x02019;.</p><p>The final evaluative focus group was described as very important by the participants.

The focus groups were reported to be well organised, structured and facilitated by experts in co&#x02010;design, and this level of coordination likely contributed to participants' sustained engagement and satisfaction reported throughout the process. Participants also identified benefits to their participation and enjoyed being involved, which also likely contributed to their level of engagement. Overall, the following three components were critical to the success of this collaborative co&#x02010;design process: coordination, participant engagement and participant satisfaction.</p><p>Certain elements of co&#x02010;design research, such as the timeframe, method of co&#x02010;design (e.g., focus group or workshop) and the number and type of participants involved, are commonly reported [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While there is no consistent way to report co&#x02010;design methodology, there is growing interest in establishing more consistent and transparent evaluation practices, as reflected in recently published frameworks and protocols for guideline development [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Objective evaluation of the co&#x02010;design process is often lacking as it is difficult to measure aspects of participation (e.g., capacity building and shared power) [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are numerous frameworks to evaluate consumer involvement in research, but these are often poorly used beyond the authors who developed them [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Given the differences in co&#x02010;design approaches, a universal method to evaluate co&#x02010;design is not necessarily the solution. Instead, it may be more useful and relevant to evaluate each co&#x02010;design project using a purpose&#x02010;built framework based on elements of existing work [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For that reason, we evaluated our co&#x02010;design approach using relevant concepts from the Co&#x02010;Design Evaluation Framework [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and included broad themes of partnership described in other co&#x02010;design literature (project management, communication, reimbursement and collaborative learning) [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which may guide and strengthen other co&#x02010;design projects.</p><p>There was considerable interest in participation in this study from people with diverse perspectives. However, we were unable to recruit medical practitioners, which is a common limitation of similar co&#x02010;design studies [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We offered equal reimbursement to both cohorts [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which they found satisfactory, but some guidelines suggest that reimbursement for participants acting in their professional capacity should be in line with industry pay rates [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It was also difficult to recruit people in the community without personal experience of stroke. Stroke prevention is of particular interest to people with lived experience of stroke, and as a result, the community member cohort was predominantly people with lived experience and people already involved in the Stroke Foundation StrokeSafe program [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This may explain why participant engagement and retention were so high in the community member cohort. We acknowledge that a different group of participants with no interest in stroke may have had different perspectives.</p><p>As Love Your Brain is a digital platform, online focus groups were the ideal medium to ensure we engaged relevant stakeholders. Compared to in&#x02010;person focus groups, video conferencing is cost&#x02010;effective, saves time and allows participants to join from anywhere they feel comfortable (including one participant who joined from the side of a highway whilst on holiday) [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our experience aligns with similar co&#x02010;design projects, where remote focus groups resulted in more sustainable involvement as participants could join as it suited them, in addition to cost and time savings [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As researchers, the ability to rewatch the focus group recordings ensured that we incorporated participant suggestions and feedback into the digital platform and had a detailed and accurate record of each session. There are inherent limitations to video conferencing, including restricting access to people with appropriate technology and digital literacy [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Technical issues disrupted the discussion at times, similar to other virtual research projects [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="hex70272-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While these challenges were difficult to troubleshoot during the focus groups, they fostered collaboration between participants and the research team, who helped each other to resolve issues.</p><p>While conducting 16 focus groups allowed time to follow an iterative co&#x02010;design process, this large number of focus groups took longer than expected and required a significant investment of research staff time. Our estimate of the time invested is likely to be conservative, as we did not include time to transcribe focus groups and analyse and synthesise data or for activities to support the broader project, such as funding acquisition, protocol development, ethics approval, committee oversight, risk management and budgeting. These activities were excluded because they do not directly influence participant experience and engagement in the focus groups. Other researchers have identified that co&#x02010;design requires adequate resources to maximise the process [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Participants in our study valued the benefits of a structured and well&#x02010;organised co&#x02010;design process, justifying the time invested by research staff. Our iterative co&#x02010;design process allowed us to incorporate participant feedback to refine our processes and develop ideas across multiple focus groups, which ultimately enhanced the co&#x02010;design experience. To optimise attendance at multiple focus groups, we recommend scheduling all dates and times well in advance, as suggested by investigators in an Austrian co&#x02010;design project [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Participants were actively engaged, and it is likely that the high level of participant engagement [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] resulted in excellent retention. Having the same expert facilitators deliver each focus group helped to develop a strong rapport between the participants and facilitators. Zechmeister&#x02010;Koss et al. [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] described the importance of building relationships between co&#x02010;design participants for successful project outcomes. For both cohorts in our study, the first focus group had fewer contributions, which was largely attributable to the greater proportion of time required to introduce the project, the other participants and the co&#x02010;design process. After the first focus group, we observed that participants, particularly community members, appeared to be more familiar with the other participants, the structure of the sessions and Zoom functionality.</p><p>Participants were committed to this project and were eager to contribute. All participants actively contributed in each focus group they attended, and no single person dominated the conversations. It is important to tailor co&#x02010;design activities to different stakeholders [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and our findings suggest that preferences differed between cohorts. There was considerable use of the chat function, particularly by health knowledge experts, demonstrating the benefit of having both verbal and written options to contribute. The chat function provided the opportunity for participants to contribute ideas after the discussion had moved on, thereby not interrupting the flow of the focus group. It was also useful having a virtual whiteboard to summarise the discussion in real&#x02010;time, and this also encouraged participants to build on or disagree with the ideas of others. We were surprised that participants wanted pre&#x02010;reading material, as we thought this would be an additional burden on them. Throughout the co&#x02010;design process, the pre&#x02010;reading materials were reviewed thoroughly by participants and prompted unsolicited responses from participants ahead of the focus groups. Community members felt the pre&#x02010;reading was more useful than the health knowledge experts, but this may be due to the different levels of expertise, project expectations and information needs. Active engagement is associated with shared power between stakeholders and valuing people's ideas [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We found that separate focus groups for health knowledge experts and community members helped to overcome potential inherent power imbalance between these stakeholders [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and allowed tailored approaches, which may have increased the level of meaningful engagement within each cohort.</p><p>A critical step in the co&#x02010;design process was the final evaluative focus group, where participants previewed the co&#x02010;designed digital platform. Notably, there were fewer participants in the final evaluative focus group, potentially due to the time gap and as we were no longer asking for knowledge input. Those who attended witnessed how their suggestions and feedback had been incorporated into the final product, which confirmed that their contribution to co&#x02010;design was heard, worthwhile and valuable. While the final focus group was highly regarded by participants in our study, an international survey of co&#x02010;design researchers reported that 42% of respondents skipped a final &#x02018;celebration/review event&#x02019; [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We recommend that other co&#x02010;design projects include a final evaluative focus group, given how important it was for the participants.</p><sec id="hex70272-sec-0330"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Our distributed co&#x02010;design method, where health knowledge experts and community members were engaged separately, allowed us to balance potential inequities between stakeholder groups and achieve equitable contributions from participants. In contrast, other investigators have conducted successful co&#x02010;design with combined groups where participants valued the learnings and partnerships formed between health professionals and people with lived experience [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The project investigators who attended the focus groups may have affected the outcomes. Participants may have been restricted in freely expressing their views in the presence of the project investigators [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alternatively, by attending the focus groups, the investigators demonstrated their commitment to the project and interest in the participants' contributions, which may have encouraged participation [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Proficiency in the English language may have excluded people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds from participating. Co&#x02010;designing a solution with these populations may help overcome known barriers to using technology for health, including language, digital literacy and accessibility [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. After our initial effectiveness trial, we plan to further develop and tailor the Love Your Brain digital platform content and delivery with, and for, cultural and language diverse groups.</p><p>Measuring participant engagement by quantifying contributions at focus groups is not a validated measure, but it provides an indication of participation. We acknowledge that shorter or less frequent contributions from participants can also provide meaningful insight. Authors of this manuscript were directly involved in the co&#x02010;design process and overarching research project; therefore, this is not an independent evaluation. Only a 2&#x02010;week period was evaluated to determine the level of resourcing required to conduct focus groups, with additional administration (such as recruitment of staff, onboarding, annual leave and steering committee) not considered.</p></sec><sec id="hex70272-sec-0340"><label>4.2</label><title>Future Suggestions</title><p>There may be benefits of smaller focus groups. We prioritised diversity with up to 15 participants in each cohort, but recognise that smaller groups may have provided more in&#x02010;depth conversation. However, there is a balance, as the focus groups we conducted with four or fewer participants were more intense for the participants who had to constantly contribute to the discussion, with fewer comments to build upon. Other authors suggest that interpersonal dynamics are more important than focus group size [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and small groups may be preferable in health research to give people time to tell their story [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>We did not use breakout rooms due to the increased amount of coordination and to reduce the time involvement of participants. We preferred that all participants hear and contribute to the same discussion, rather than having separate discussions facilitated by different researchers, and then spend time summarising the small group discussions. We acknowledge that this method may be effective for enhancing small group collaboration, but it introduces additional resourcing and technological requirements [<xref rid="hex70272-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="hex70272-sec-0350"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>We completed a large co&#x02010;design project, with seven pre&#x02010;design and generative focus groups, and one evaluative focus group per cohort. We provide a novel quantitative method for assessing the level of engagement, using the count and duration/length of contributions captured using technology. This metric enabled comparison between cohorts to identify their preferred method of communication in focus groups (e.g., community members preferred verbal contributions, while health knowledge experts preferred to write messages though the chat function), and this approach should be used to enhance future research by offering a range of appropriate communication options for the participants involved.</p><p>The engagement of key stakeholders over an extended period enabled the development of familiarity and rapport between facilitators and the participants, which benefited the iterative design of a final product that the participants took pride in creating. For successful co&#x02010;design, we recommend consideration and investment in the underpinning processes of recruitment, coordination, participant engagement and satisfaction. We advocate for co&#x02010;design to involve repeated meetings with the same stakeholders. We identified that re&#x02010;engagement provided familiarity with the structure, facilitators and other participants, which likely enhanced engagement, discussion and satisfaction with the co&#x02010;design process for all participants.</p></sec><sec id="hex70272-sec-0360"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
