make mass
spectrometry (MS) one of the most valuable tools in metabolomics and
lipidomics. However, translation of metabolomics MS methods to multiyear
studies conducted across multiple batches is limited by variability
in electrospray ionization response, making batch-to-batch comparisons
challenging. This limitation creates an artificial divide between
nontargeted discovery work that is broad in scope but limited in terms
of absolute quantitation ability and targeted work that is highly
accurate but limited in scope due to the need for matched isotopically
labeled standards. These issues are often observed in stem cell studies
using metabolomic and lipidomic MS approaches, where patient recruitment
can be a years-long process and samples become available in discrete
batches every few months. To bridge this gap, we developed a machine
learning model that predicts electrospray ionization sensitivity for
lipid classes that have shown correlation with stem cell potency.
Molecular descriptors derived from these lipids&#x02019; chemical structures
are used as model input to predict electrospray response, enabling
quantitation by MS with moderate accuracy (semiquantitation). Model
performance was evaluated via internal and external validation using
cultured cells from various stem cell donors, achieving global percent
errors of 40% and 20% for positive and negative electrospray ion modes,
respectively. Although this accuracy is typically insufficient for
traditional targeted lipidomics experiments, it is sufficient for
semiquantitative estimation of lipid marker concentrations across
batches without the need for specific chemical standards that many
times are unavailable. Furthermore, the precision for model-predicted
concentrations was 16.9% for the positive mode and 7.5% for the negative
mode, indicating promise for data harmonization across batches. The
set of molecular descriptors used by the models described here was
able to yield higher accuracy than those previously published in the
literature, showing high promise toward semiquantitative lipidomics.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000054</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA218664</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Division of Engineering Education and Centers</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000149</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EEC-1648035</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ci4c02040</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ci4c02040</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-based therapies hold
great promise for the treatment of incurable
diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> through cell replacement or release of trophic factors.
Such therapies can be manufactured from a number of cell types, including
primary, progenitor, or stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The
inherent complexity associated with cellular processes grants these
therapies their unique potential but also makes consistent manufacturing
at specific quality and safety levels a significant challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) used in immunotherapy
applications, for example, have been known to suffer from donor-to-donor
variability and intracolony heterogeneity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> In this context, discovery and quantitation of biochemical critical
quality attributes (CQAs) indicative of relative potency and mechanisms
of action are critical for standardizing treatments and ensuring the
rigor of clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p><p>Metabolomics and
lipidomics are emerging as sources of CQAs highly
predictive of cell therapy properties, including potency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> These &#x02018;omic approaches produce metabolite abundance profiles
that are the closest to the cellular phenotype at any given time point.
Metabolomics/lipidomics experiments typically rely on liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) conducted in a nontargeted fashion to discover
CQAs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> producing relative quantitation
data within a given batch of experiments. The transition from nontargeted
data sets to targeted quantitative CQA assays is often difficult to
achieve,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> limiting the comparison of CQA abundances
across batches and cell types. For example, a recent MSC metabolomics
study on three cell lines identified four ether-linked phosphatidylcholine
(O-PC) lipid CQA candidates that correlated with inhibited T-cell
proliferation during coculture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However,
a follow-up expanded study on ten cell lines showed that these markers
were not as strongly correlated, while a small panel of different
phospholipids were better predictors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></p><p>While the standard practices of quantitative (targeted) metabolomics
and lipidomics are well-established, the practices of the corresponding
nontargeted workflows have not yet been standardized, emphasizing
the need for data harmonization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Nontargeted
CQA discovery work is broad in scope but limited in terms of quantitative
ability, while targeted work is highly accurate but limited in scope
due to the need for expensive stable isotope-labeled standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Semiquantitative metabolomics and lipidomics methods leverage some
of the advantages of targeted and nontargeted approaches by utilizing
surrogate standards to obtain quantitative information for hundreds
of analytes in a single experiment, but at the cost of some accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Drotlef et al., for example, developed a lipid class-specific calibration
workflow with stable isotope-labeled standards achieving acceptable
accuracy levels, but the approach required the use of a reference
material to calculate the necessary response factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The use of such surrogate standards alone, however, cannot
correct common effects observed in the LC-MS electrospray ionization
(ESI) ion source, such as differential nonlinear responses, variations
in matrix effects, or differences in analyte ionization efficiencies
within a lipid class.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></p><p>Machine learning (ML) has
played a role in the merging of nontargeted
and targeted metabolomics/lipidomics LC-MS workflows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Both random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks
(ANN) have been used to predict ESI sensitivity based on analyte properties
such as LC-MS chromatographic retention time, capillary electrophoresis
effective charge, and even fragmentation information from incomplete
structural assignments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> These studies were able to achieve
regression models with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values above
0.8, but in both cases, the models performed poorly on independent
data sets. Approaches based on molecular descriptors have also been
used to predict relative ionization sensitivity using support vector
regression (SVR), RF, ANN, and other ML techniques, but the work was
limited to a very narrow data set comprising only carboxylic acids
in negative ion mode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The most successful
molecular descriptor-based studies for the prediction of ionization
efficiency have achieved excellent <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> results
on training and test sets but had errors as high as &#x0223c;200% when
predicting the concentration of analytes in real samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> These studies were conducted without accounting for matrix effects
and included very large training sets that span many chemical classes.
Here, we present the first results of a semiquantitative LC-MS lipidomics
approach that includes stable isotope surrogate internal standards,
matrix matching, and ML relative ionization sensitivity prediction
in order to account for all major sources of inaccuracy encountered
in MSC lipid quantitation experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Preparation of Standard Mixtures</title><p>Avanti Polar Lipids UltimateSPLASH ONE mix was diluted with isopropanol

Class</title><p>The relative electrospray ionization efficiency of
a given chemical species is largely controlled by its structure, other
sample or solvent components, and the specific experimental conditions
used, such as flow rate, solvent type, applied electric field strength,
etc. For lipids, the molecular properties of the headgroup are important
determinants of ionization efficiency, with the lipid tail chain lengths
also having a marked impact. Lipids can also undergo in-source fragmentation
with ESI, which will result in signal loss. In order to ensure ionization
efficiency measurements were not significantly biased due to in-source
fragmentation signal loss, common in-source fragments were identified
and tabulated (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02040/suppl_file/ci4c02040_si_002.xlsx">Supporting Information</ext-link>).

involved in using surrogate standards for quantification. Attempting

Following the assessment of model performance under calibration and

(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>e,f). The

were then used to calculate the concentrations of the matching lipids
in each of the donor 1 samples in the internal validation set (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a,b). Concentration
prediction errors were at or below 40%, with the exception of a few
cases of higher errors, which included two phosphatidylglycerols (PGs)
in positive mode, a phosphatidylinositol (PI) in positive mode, and
a diacylglycerol (DG) in negative mode. For the PG and PI lipids,
their errors are likely due to testing effects, as three out of five
total class members were allocated to the internal validation set,
leaving only two members in the training set. The concentration error
for DG can be explained by the class&#x02019;s large range of ionization
efficiencies in negative mode. The global average error including
these higher error cases was 43.6% for positive mode and 41.3% for
negative mode. If these four lipid outliers are removed, the global
average for positive ion mode was 22.9% and 25.1% in negative mode.
Although errors in the 20&#x02013;30% range would typically be unacceptable
for strict quantitation work, they could still be acceptable for semiquantitative
work in a nontargeted metabolomics setting where strict accuracy is
not the ultimate goal of method development. The overall precision
for internal calibration was determined by taking the mean of the

accuracy should be maintained across different sample types, ideally
even across different matrices. In order to assess ionization prediction
accuracy in these stringent conditions, external validation sets comprised
of Splash Lipidomix lipids were also tested (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>c,d). If outliers were removed, the global

indicated that predicting lipid concentrations in a variety of matrices
with acceptable accuracy was possible for a number of different lipids
as long as their lipid classes were well-represented in the training
set. From these results, it was also apparent that matrix effects
from individual cell donors were not significant enough to disrupt
concentration prediction accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>Outlier Analysis</title><p>A few of the lipids
in the external validation set had high prediction errors compared

of PI (15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7)) in negative mode (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02040/suppl_file/ci4c02040_si_001.pdf">Figure S11a</ext-link>), the source of the observed high error is likely
the product of the innate model accuracy. However, for the two Splash
Lipidomix standards measured in positive mode, PG(15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7))
and PC(15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7)) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02040/suppl_file/ci4c02040_si_001.pdf">Figure S11b,c</ext-link>), the errors may have resulted from additional factors. Testing
effects may have caused these high errors given the relatively few
examples of PC and PG lipids in the data set (5 each). Analysis of <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02040/suppl_file/ci4c02040_si_001.pdf">Figure S11b,c</ext-link> shows that PG (15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7))
and PC (15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7)) had much higher than expected responses,
which deviated from the expected trend line. Examination of the retention
times of these outlier lipids did not show them outside the range
of retention times of training lipids (Tables SI 4a and SI 4b). Errors
may be introduced if the external validation lipid has a much higher
(or lower) relative sensitivity than the same lipid class components
in the training set. As discussed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>, lipid ionization efficiency showed a significantly
large range. Another possible explanation for the observed errors
is ionization enhancement or suppression due to coeluting compounds
present in cell extracts that did not affect ionization of training
lipids. The percent recovery for PC (15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7)) is over
100%, which supports that this error was likely due to ionization
enhancement in this case. Although spiking of deuterated standards
into real biological samples should mitigate these effects due to
matrix matching, it might not offer a universal mitigation of matrix
effects in all possible scenarios, such as when there is coelution
of highly ionizable lipids.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><label>3.7</label><title>Comparison to Traditional Quantitation Approaches</title><p>More often than not, quantitation in lipidomics is performed using
simple calibration approaches such as 1-point calibration or establishing
a least-squares linear regression for a specific lipid class. For
these approaches, surrogate chemical standards are used to determine
a response relationship that is applied to all lipid analytes of the
same class, even if they are not perfectly matched to the standard.
For comparison purposes, we applied two semiquantitative approaches
described in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02040/suppl_file/ci4c02040_si_001.pdf">Figure S1a</ext-link>. These methods
resulted in concentration estimation errors higher than the ML-based
approach developed in this work (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>a). The approach with the highest mean error
was the 1-point approach, with errors ranging from 100% to 60% in
positive and negative ionization modes. The lipid class-specific calibration
curves showed lower mean errors (50&#x02013;90%), but still higher
than the SVR model, which was between 20 and 40%. When the performance
was evaluated on a lipid class basis for each ionization mode, the
simpler quantitation methods were often sufficiently accurate but
failed for PG (15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7)) and DG (15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7))
in positive mode, and PI (15:0&#x02013;18:1(d7)) in negative mode.
The SVR regression approach showed more accurate concentration estimates
than one-point calibrations and lipid-class specific calibration curves
in all examined cases.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Model accuracy compared to traditional nontargeted quantitation

the lipid classes presented here or exist in different classes altogether.
To examine how well the model can generalize to new lipid classes,
all lyso lipids were removed from the training set and designated
as a separate validation set. In this experiment, the model was trained
on all lipids, excluding lyso lipids. The performance in this experiment
indicates that the model does not easily predict unseen classes, as
the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for model validations was &#x02212;16.3
and &#x02212;151.7 in positive and negative mode, respectively (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02040/suppl_file/ci4c02040_si_001.pdf">Figure S12</ext-link>). This result is not surprising given
the nature of machine learning. Without the necessary trends represented
in the training set, extrapolation by the model is usually unsuccessful.
Another way to examine robustness, however, is to examine how well
the model performs within each class instead of how it performs out-of-class.
For example, we may want to know whether it can extrapolate to quantify
very large or very small lipids. The largest ultimate lipids (by mass)
from each class were removed for the test set (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02040/suppl_file/ci4c02040_si_001.pdf">Figure S13</ext-link>), and the smallest lipids (by mass) from each class

0.75 and 1, with greater accuracy in the large lipid validation sets,

approach for semiquantitation in nontargeted
lipidomics workflows that utilizes machine learning prediction of
ionization efficiency for concentration estimation. Although this
approach requires the use of lipid standards for matrix matching,
it enables the quantitation of thousands of lipids from only 69 standards
and enables the quantitation of some lipids for which standards do
not exist. The prediction of concentration is more accurate than simple
nontargeted calibration approaches and can be achieved with high precision,
indicating promise for use in studies for which conducting LC-MS lipidomics
in multiple sample batches is necessary. The model presented here
was created with cellular samples, but this approach could be adopted
in many types of sample matrices and is customizable to other instrumentation.
Without the need to reoptimize the modeling approach, creation of
project/instrument-specific models is simple. The length of time that
a single model could hold for continued batches in a project is yet
to be determined, but here we demonstrate the general feasibility
of this approach for semiquantitation. This method could be used to
determine relevant biological lipid concentrations to inform the development
of targeted assays directed from nontargeted data, aiding biomarker
discovery work. Data harmonization and lipidomics data set comparison
remain the most promising future application of this work, as meta-analysis
of several cellular lipidomics studies remains a challenge in the
field that accurate semiquantitation could help address.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="data-availability" id="notes2"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The full Jupyter
