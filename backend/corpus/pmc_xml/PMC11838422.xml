However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end-users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to four-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortex in mice with high labeling density (80&#x02013;90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2&#x02013;3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.</p></abstract><abstract id="ABS2" abstract-type="summary"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="P4">Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>genetically encoded calcium indicator</kwd><kwd>two-photon calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>one-photon wide-field calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>neuropil contamination</kwd><kwd>red fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>protein engineering</kwd><kwd>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</kwd><kwd>FRCaMPi</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have been long established as a standard tool for real-time recording of activities from neuronal compartments and neuron populations <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> in model organisms<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In recent years, GECIs based on green fluorescent proteins have received substantial improvements in their sensitivity (<italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>. &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> = (F<sub>max</sub> &#x02212; F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, defined as maximal fluorescence change over the baseline of the calcium transient), which is crucial in defining performance of the sensors for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> imaging<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These advancements in sensitivity have been achieved through iterative mutagenesis, as seen in the GCaMP series<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, or by increasing the dynamic range of the indicators with a brighter fluorescent protein (for example, mNeonGreen instead of GFP in NCaMP7 &#x00026; NEMOs)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Despite the advancement in engineering green GECIs, creating calcium sensors with red-shifted fluorescence spectra offers certain advantages over green ones, such as deeper tissue imaging and spectral multiplexing with a variety of already available green indicators<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. After engineering the first red-shifted Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, R-GECO1<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, several red Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators based on circularly permutated red fluorescent proteins (cpRFP) have been developed with improved sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. However, progress in developing and optimizing red-shifted GECIs has been much slower and more challenging than green ones, with limited variants<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and inferior <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> performance. Similar to GCaMPs, advancements in red GECIs also often come at the cost of extensive directed molecular evolution followed by time-consuming and laborious characterization of the top variants to select one that is best performing for a particular application.</p><p id="P7">Alternative strategies to extend the applicability of genetically encoded indicators are engineering topological variants and cellular focusing by targeting specific subcellular compartments, <italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., nucleus and soma. The topological engineering reverses the conventional GCaMP-like design to a so-called non-circularly permutated (ncp) topology with C- and N-terminus reassigned to the FP, similar to the topology of GECIs such as NCaMP7 (ref.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>) and camgaroo<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. One of the major outcomes of the topological inversion of the existing indicators is an elevated ligand binding affinity<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, which was recently shown to boost the amplitude of signal response<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, this engineering strategy has been rarely explored in the existing red GECIs<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Complementary to topological engineering, soma-targeting of GECIs is known to improve the effectiveness of population calcium imaging at single-neuron resolution <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> due to reduced neuropil contamination, as was demonstrated specifically for wide-field imaging, one of the most popular imaging modalities, in zebrafish and mice (see Supplementary Note 1 more in-depth discussion). Through fusion with soma-localization motif appended to the C-terminus of sensors, such strategy facilitates image segmentation for extraction of single cell traces, reduces signal contamination from neighboring neuropils<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and increases signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, this strategy has not been tested to improve the previous and newly generated red GECIs.</p><p id="P8">Here, we employed these strategies to generate FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi, a pair of red GECIs that demonstrate high dynamic range with enhanced sensitivity. FRCaMPi is the inverted topological variant of FRCaMP, while SomaFRCaMPi is the first reported soma-localized calcium indicator in red, which was engineered by tethering FRCaMPi to the 60S subunit of ribosome via ribosome protein L10 (RPL10). Both FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi were evaluated <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> in zebrafish larvae using confocal imaging and in awake, behaving mice using wide-field, two-photon imaging, and fiber photometry. Compared to conventional red GECIs under identical imaging conditions, SomaFRCaMPi minimized neuropil contamination and further demonstrated greater performance in metrics relevant to imaging neural populations in both wide-field and two-photon setups <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Importantly, SomaFRCaMPi outperformed soma-localized versions of all other state-of-the-art red GECIs generated in this study along all major axes of performance.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Engineering and biochemical characterization of FRCaMPi</title><p id="P9">The NCaMP7-like topological design<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, which involves inserting the sensing domains within the FP, has recently resurged in the field of fluorescent biosensors and resulted in the successful construction of several green ncp indicators for glutamate and calcium. Those examples include ncpiGluSnFRs<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> for glutamate, ultrahigh-affinity GECIs<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> for detecting low nanomolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (&#x0003c;100 nM), bioluminescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator based on ncpGCaMP6s<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and mNeonGreen-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators of superior sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Recently, FRCaMP was introduced as the first red GECI engineered based on the calcium-binding domain CaM and the M13 peptide from a non-metazoan origin, possessing a similar dynamic range but a greater sensitivity than R-GECO1<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In addition, FRCaMP did not interact with the cytosolic environment of the mammalian cells. Motivated by these advancements, we initially explored the benefits of an altered topology in FRCaMP. To alter the topology of FRCaMP, we genetically connected the terminal of M13 and CaM with a flexible linker (GGSGGSGSGS) and reintroduced the original termini of mApple protein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We then termed this ncpFRCaMP as FRCaMP with the inverted topology (FRCaMPi; i stands for &#x0201c;inverted&#x0201d;). Consistent with previous observations of the biochemical properties of ncp indicators, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> characterization revealed that FRCaMPi binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> with a dissociation constant (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">d</italic></sub>) that is approximately threefold lower (81 &#x000b1; 2 nM) compared to FRCaMP (214 &#x000b1; 6 nM; Supplementary Table 3 and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.1d</xref>). Similarly, FRCaMPi inherited the outstanding dynamic range (16.3&#x000b1;0.3-fold) from FRCaMP (16.4&#x000b1;0.7). The Hill coefficient for FRCaMPi was slightly higher (3.1 &#x000b1; 0.2) compared to that of FRCaMP (2.5 &#x000b1; 0.2) (Supplementary Table 3). In addition, the biophysical properties of FRCaMPi, such as fluorescence spectra, quantum yield, extinction coefficient, dynamic range, and pK<sub>a</sub>, remained very similar to the parental FRCaMP (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">c</xref> and Supplementary Table 3).</p><p id="P10">The increased calcium binding affinity and preserved key features from FRCaMP, such as large dynamic range, led us to compare the performance of FRCaMPi directly with FRCaMP in cultured neurons using external electrical bursts at 87 Hz of 300 APs to evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, FRCaMPi demonstrated a peak fluorescence response that was 2.36 times as high as that observed with FRCaMP (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). We found that the decay half kinetics is slightly slower for FRCaMPi in comparison to FRCaMP (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Sensors featured by a higher calcium binding affinity are known to buffer a greater quantity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and could result in heightened sensitivity but prolonged decay kinetics<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. This was consistent with our observation in FRCaMPi. In conclusion, topological inversion of FRCaMP resulted in a new sensor with over twice the sensitivity of its precursor, thus representing a promising candidate for further applications in neurons both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of FRCaMPi in mammalian cell cultures</title><p id="P11">Since FRCaMPi demonstrated even higher sensitivity in the initial <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> characterization, we decided to benchmark FRCaMPi performance against other known state-of-the-art red calcium indicators, including X-CaMPR<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, K-GECO1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, jRGECO1a<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>), characterized by high sensitivity in the cytosol of mammalian cells. To demonstrate the utility of FRCaMPi in mammalian cells, we first characterized the indicator in cultured HeLa cells (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). By expressing a bicistronic vector, the basal brightness of red GECI was reported as the fluorescence ratio of the indicator fluorescence to the fluorescence of a reference protein, mGreenLantern (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>,<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). A similar brightness level was found between FRCaMPi and jRGECO1a and the brightness level of K-GECO1 was slightly higher (1.2-fold) compared to FRCaMPi (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Under continuous wide-field illumination at 7.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (about 4&#x02013;5 times higher than typically used for FRCaMPi imaging in cultured cells), the photobleaching rate of FRCaMPi was about 2- and 3.6-folds faster than those of jRGECO1a and K-GECO1, respectively. Nevertheless, we observed a quicker signal plateau of FRCaMPi after 3 mins with eventually a brightness level similar to jRGECO1a at 10 mins of bleaching time (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To assess the capability of FRCaMPi to detect Ca2<sup>+</sup> signals in HeLa cells, we recorded the fluorescent responses to cytoplasmic Ca2<sup>+</sup> transients elicited by consecutive application of histamine followed by ionomycin. During pharmacologically induced Ca2<sup>+</sup> changes, the maximal fluorescence response (&#x00394;F<sub>max</sub>/F<sub>min</sub>) of HeLa cells expressing FRCaMPi was at least two-fold to the response of XCaMP-R and jRGECO1a and was more than 4 folds higher than that for K-GECO1 (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>,<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and Supplementary Video 1). To this point, we noted that FRCaMPi exhibited a larger dynamic range without sacrificing a baseline fluorescence. In support of this notion, we also found that in pharmaceutically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, cells expressing FRCaMPi showed matched basal fluorescence levels of those expressing jRGECO1a still exhibited a distribution over higher dynamic range, indicating a higher maximal brightness of FRCaMPi that can possibly achieve (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we systematically and quantitatively assessed &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub>, SNR, and kinetics of response of FRCaMPi in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, adapting an electrical stimulation protocol that was well established for other GECIs, including GCaMPs, jRGECO1a, and NIR-GECO1<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1a-c). Field stimuli (45&#x02013;50 V, 83 Hz, 1 ms) were delivered in trains of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 pulses to transduced mouse hippocampal neurons and five minutes of illumination were applied prior to trace recording to remove initial bleaching to equalize the effect of bleaching to all indicators (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>). Fluorescence changes detected from cell bodies show that FRCaMPi possesses a 50&#x02013;60% larger peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> compared to jRGECO1a and K-GECO1 at 1 pulse (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">f</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). As the number of electrical pulses increased, the peak difference of FRCaMPi to K-GECO1 and XCaMP-R became more distinct (2.77 and 3.34 folds, respectively) and stayed approximately 1.5 times as high as jRGECO1a (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">f</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). GECIs with a high calcium affinity and Hill coefficient tend to saturate more easily at smaller spikes<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. However, despite possessing a low K<sub>d</sub> and a Hill coefficient larger than 3, fluorescence responses of FRCaMPi showed fair linearity on the log scale with no notable saturation up to 160 pulses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). This behavior could be attributed to the extensive dynamic range of the indicator, as supported by experiments in HeLa cell calcium responses. The baseline brightness of FRCaMPi in primary mouse hippocampal neurons observed was not significantly different from that of jRGECO1a but higher than that of X-CaMPR and K-GECO1 (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Given a similar level of baseline brightness but more rapid bleaching, the peak SNR of FRCaMPi remains comparable to jRGECO1a after 5 minutes of illumination (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>), which could be attributed by the larger sensitivity (<italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> in response to pulse trains) of the indicator. The rise kinetics of FRCaMPi appeared similar to those of other indicators (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>), while the decay kinetics of FRCaMPi was slower, with the 2.8-fold difference to jRGECO1a decreased over the increased number of pulses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). Altogether, FRCaMPi faithfully reports Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mammalian cell cultures with greater dynamics and sensitivity observed than existing red indicators of high sensitivity. Red genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are known to have significantly compromised functional performance in vivo, particularly during long-term expression. Therefore, before proceeding with further development, we assessed the fluorescence response of FRCaMPi expressed in the central amygdala (CeA) neurons using fiber photometry (Supplementary Fig. 2a&#x02013;c). Notably, even after three months of expression, FRCaMPi exhibited reproducible and reliable responses during licking behavior and air-puff stimulus (Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). The combined in vitro and in vivo results thus encouraged us to optimize the probe further for its soma-targeted version.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Development and characterization of soma-targeted FRCaMPi</title><p id="P14">A recent effort in developing soma-localized green GECIs<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> has inspired us to explore the possibility of engineering a competent red soma-localized counterpart. To achieve this, we appended C-terminus of FRCaMPi with the four peptides known to facilitate somatic localization and assessed them in cultured neurons for fluorescence changes (peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub>), SNR in response to evoked extracellular stimulation, and cytotoxicity (assessed as total number of functional cells obtained from transfected neuronal culture; Supplementary Fig. 2). Based on the screening, we chose to use the RPL10-tagged FRCaMPi for further characterization and named the selected variant SomaFRCaMPi. The RPL10 peptide was previously used to generate the soma-localized versions of the GCaMP6 sensors, which is a component of the 60S ribosome subunit<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). To understand whether the SomaFRCaMPi is a competitive soma-targeting indicator in red, we generated fusions of K-GECO1, XCaMP-R, and jRGECO1a with the same tag and linker for comparison and referred to them as SomaK-GECO1, SomaXCaMP-R, and SomajRGECO1a (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">First, we characterized the subcellular localization of all generated constructs compared to the corresponding non-targeted GECIs in cultured mouse neurons. The ribo-tagged indicators exhibited a much steeper fluorescence decrease along the neurites compared to non-targeted versions. Specifically, ribo-tagged indicators have fluorescence dropped to 36.8% of soma value (we use e<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>-based function for fitting and quantification here, which is often used for characterizing the dropping speed of traits exhibiting an exponential decay) at a distance that was only 5-times shorter than that of the non-targeted version, indicating a strong elimination of expression from neurites by ribo-tagging (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that ribo-tagging could decrease the baseline fluorescence, resulting in dimmer constructs<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Similarly, we found that ribo-tagging resulted in a decreased baseline fluorescence of all tested red indicators in neuronal culture, with the extent differed for each indicator. Pairwise comparison of corresponding soma-targeted and non-targeted biosensors revealed that soma localization reduced brightness by 7.38 folds for SomajRGECO1a and by 4.85 folds for SomaXCaMP-R while SomaFRCaMPi and SomaK-GECO1 received much lower decreases in baseline (2.24 and 1.47 folds, respectively; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). Consequently, SomaFRCaMPi demonstrated a baseline 2.64- and 2.16-fold brighter than that of SomajRGECO1a and SomaXCaMP-R, respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We then performed functional characterization of SomaFRCaMPi by adapting electrical field stimulation, the same as was applied to non-targeted indicators described above. Similar to the characterization of non-targeted indicators in neurons, SomaFRCaMPi exhibited the highest sensitivity (peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> = 1.74 at 1 pulse) among all tested indicators (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">k</xref>;). Furthermore, we found that the peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> of SomaFRCaMPi preserved a degree of monotonical increase to the growing number of pulses similar to FRCaMPi with no obvious saturation detected up to 160 pulses (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). The peak response of SomaFRCaMPi was more pronounced relative to non-targeted GECIs in comparison, showing the largest peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> in all the numbers of stimuli applied and approximately 2-fold peak difference response to SomajRGECO1a at numbers of pulses in the range from 40 to 160 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). Notably, despite the initial bleaching, the SNR of SomaFRCaMPi was still 90% to 180% higher compared to all other indicators at 1 pulse and stayed at least twice as high as that of SomajRGECO1a (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2m</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>) across all assessed pulse numbers, in consonance with the large peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> and a higher baseline observed for SomaFRCaMPi (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">i</xref>).

However, in other soma-localized indicators, we observed either a stronger decrease in baseline brightness or a significant drop in sensitivity such as for SomaK-GECO1 (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig 4e</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). SomaFRCaMPi shares a similar half-rise kinetics to that of SomaXCaMP-R and SomaK-GECO1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2o</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>) and showed a faster half-rise time than SomajRGECO1a. The decay kinetics of SomaFRCaMPi remained slower but showed a lesser degree of difference to that of other soma-localized indicators compared to the case in non-targeted GECIs (compare results in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2p</xref>, and see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref> for the extracted numerical values). Those results demonstrate the high sensitivity and superior capability of SomaFRCaMPi to report calcium signals in neuronal culture.

We, therefore, investigated whether SomaFRCaMPi with ribo-tag motif could also be used in zebrafish for functional imaging, and if so, whether this would have any advantages over non-target sensors in fish. In this regard, we generated transgenic lines that pan-neuronally express jRGECO1a, FRCaMPi, and their soma-targeted variants SomajRGECO1a and SomaFRCaMPi followed by a side-by-side comparison of their performance in zebrafish larvae. However, during establishing stable lines, we observed that SomajRGECO1a in zebrafish was significantly dimmer compared to other indicators in the F1 generation. Specifically, the baseline brightness of SomajRGECO1a was still approximately three times lower than that of SomaFRCaMPi, despite the implementation of a 2.0-fold higher laser power for SomajRGECO1a (Supplementary Fig. 4). Additionally, the fluorescence response of SomajRGECO1a upon stimulation was limited, despite acquired using a laser power (0.74 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) ten times to that for the other three indicators (0.076 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Video 3). These factors complicated the selection of SomajRGECO1a-expressing zebrafish for breeding and the establishment of stable transgenic lines for sensors&#x02019; assessment in F3 generation. Consequently, we decided to exclude SomajRGECO1a from further breeding efforts.</p><p id="P18">We first characterized the expression of indicators in larvae aged at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) in F3 generation. The baseline brightness of the three indicators in fish larvae was comparable, with jRGECO1a being 28% and 17% brighter than FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi, respectively (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). We observed that in SomaFRCaMPi-expressing larvae, cell bodies could be more easily identified with minimal neuropil fluorescence found in the regions enriched with neuropils (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and in stratified neuropils in cell-body region (<italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., the tectal periventricular cells; <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). A quantification of soma-to-neuropil fluorescence in optical tectum further shows that fish larvae expressing SomaFRCaMPi exhibit a soma-to-neuropil fluorescence ratio more than twice to that of fish expressing non-targeted indicators, implicating a restriction of SomaFRCaMPi expression to neuronal soma (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) in fish. With clearer cell bodies observed in SomaFRCaMPi-expressing larvae, we next investigated whether ribo-tagging facilitates the identification of neuronal soma in fish larvae by automated segmentation of maximum projection images using Cellpose<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.

Similarly to the findings from external electrical stimulation, we found that tectal cell bodies expressing SomaFRCaMPi demonstrate the highest peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> of 325% upon stimulation. More significantly, the peak SNR at cell bodies for SomaFRCaMPi larvae was 70% higher that of jRGECO1a. FRCaMPi larvae further showed 16% higher peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>) and 24% larger SNR (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>) than those of jRGECO1a.

For <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> mouse experiments, we utilized 2P imaging to evaluate the calcium dynamics of FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi. Using AAVs, we expressed jRGECO1a, FRCaMPi or their soma-targeting variants into the primary visual cortex and recorded activities from L2/3 neurons of awake mice in response to drifting gratings presented in eight orientations (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistent with previous reports of 2P imaging of ribo-tagged GCaMPs<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, we first found that the fluorescence of SomaFRCaMPi was confined to neuronal cell bodies whereas the expression of FRCaMPi and jRGECO1a contributed to a much broader neuropil fluorescence surrounding (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Under identical experimental conditions, the expression of SomajRGECO1a resulted in many fluorescent foci with nuclear filling, and no fluorescence dynamics was detected during the recording of spontaneous activity (n = 3 mice; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Therefore, we did not examine SomajRGECO1a further.</p><p id="P22">The basal fluorescence of FRCaMPi in 2P imaging was 70% of that of jRGECO1a, while SomaFRCaMPi had approximately half the basal fluorescence of FRCaMPi (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). This level of decreased baseline brightness in SomaFRCaMPi compared to FRCaMPi corresponded to that found in mouse neuronal culture (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>). Despite the twice lower basal fluorescence of SomaFRCaMPi, we used the same imaging parameter for fair comparison among all indicators to record visual stimulus-evoked activity. We found that the L2/3 neurons expressing all three indicators exhibited specific response selectivity to grating orientation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). For kinetics, we applied a sampling frequency (33Hz) that was similarly used in GCaMP8 characterization<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and observed 1.4-fold slower half-decay kinetics in FRCaMPi (0.32 s) compared to jRGECO1a (0.23 s). Strikingly, the half-decay time of SomaFRCaMPi (0.19s) is similar to jRGECO1a and 41% faster than that of FRCaMPi (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>,<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Meanwhile, the total number of responsive neurons extracted by SomaFRCaMPi from a single field of view (FOV) in L2/3 (930 neurons &#x000f7; 16 FOVs = 58.125 neurons/FOV) was twice that obtained with FRCaMPi (30.45 neurons/FOV) and 2.6 times that achieved with jRGECO1a (21.9 neurons/FOV) from multiple mice. To further validate that the improvement in neuronal segmentation can be achieved in brain regions with different neuroanatomy, we imaged the parabrachial nucleus in the brainstem, where the neuronal population density is much higher than in the cortex (2.73 vs. 0.94 neurons per gram of brain tissue)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. We conducted imaging across a large volume with a field of view of 0.8 &#x000d7; 1.0 mm<sup>2</sup>, comprising four z-stacks with no overlapping neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). SomaFRCaMPi enabled automatic segmentation of twice as many neuronal ROIs per field of view compared to FRCaMPi (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and reported activity from thousands more neurons when datasets were combined (Supplementary Fig. 5d). These findings demonstrated that SomaFRCaMPi facilitates improved segmentation and allows for high-throughput recording of neuronal activities in two-photon imaging modalities from brain regions with varying neuronal density levels. We then quantified and compared the sensitivity of the three GECIs by adapting two established metrics, the proportion of responsive neurons detected and the cumulative distribution of peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> from each neuron<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

In parallel, the cumulative distribution of peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> of FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi was substantially shifted over larger values, indicating FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi being more sensitive than jRGECO1a (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).

This correlation was 2- to 7-fold lower in neurons expressing SomaFRCaMPi compared to both FRCaMPi and jRGECO1a (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). We then implemented a standard algorithmic approach to subtract neuropil signals from neuronal traces as previously suggested<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. This adjustment resulted in a more than a 3-fold reduction in signal correlation between neurons expressing either jRGECO1a or FRCaMPi. We further quantified correlation coefficient of neuron pairs within 100 &#x003bc;m (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>). Post-subtraction, the signal correlation levels of jRGECO1a (mean 0.099) and FRCaMPi (mean 0.093) were slightly lower than those of uncorrected SomaFRCaMPi (mean 0.13) but remained within a very similar degree of low correlation. Neurons expressing SomaFRCaMPi also exhibited a slight drop in correlation following signal correction. The mean correlation coefficient of corrected signals was still more than 50% lower than those of jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi after correction. Moreover, the pattern of comparison in correlation was found similar in neuronal activity from L5 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">l</xref>). Therefore, SomaFRCaMPi substantially reduces the neuropil-induced correlation between cells in 2P imaging experiments with superior sensitivity levels, demonstrating its capacity as a competent soma-localized GECI in red for 2P imaging.</p><p id="P26">To further evaluate the sensitivity of SomaFRCaMPi compared to top-performing green sensors in the field, we co-expressed RiboL1-GCaMP8s and SomaFRCaMPi in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of the brainstem. RiboL1-GCaMP8s was chosen as the most sensitive soma-GECIs reported to date as it has been found to exhibit a similar fluorescence response in vivo to non-targeted jGCaMP8s, one of the most sensitive green calcium indicators to date (see Fig. S5 in the reference<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>). Neuronal activity was examined using dual-color 2P calcium imaging in response to multiple internal organ stimuli (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>,<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Neurons co-expressing green and red calcium probes showed selective and dose-dependent functional responses to increasing gastric distension, characterized by a growing number of responding neurons and elevated fluorescence response amplitudes (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>,<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), validating the functionality of the NTS calcium imaging system. Next, we compared the peak responses from NTS neurons that co-expressed both indicators. We found that the overall peak &#x00394;F/F level of SomaFRCaMPi was approximately 33% less than that of RiboL1-GCaMP8s, as demonstrated by least-squares fitting (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>). However, we observed an overall lower noise in the red channel (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). Specifically, examination of the baseline noise level in SomaFRCaMPi showed it to be approximately 32% lower than that of RiboL1-GCaMP8s (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>), resulting in an almost identical Z-score between the two probes (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7g</xref>). These results indicate that SomaFRCaMPi exhibits lower imaging noise and comparable sensitivity to a state-of-the-art green soma GECI.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Wide-field primary neocortical imaging of awake mice using SomaFRCaMPi</title><p id="P27">Provided with the faithful neuropil elimination and the enhanced sensitivity of SomaFRCaMPi under 2P microscopy, we next investigated the benefits of using SomaFRCaMPi in awake behaving mice using one-photon widefield microscopy, which is a more accessible and less complex system compared to 2P setups. Challenges in neuron detection and deteriorated somatic signals<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> were often observed in one-photon widefield or micro-endoscopic imaging of the mouse brain due to tissue scattering and the strong out-of-focus background fluorescence<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Restricting the expression of indicators to neuronal somas, in turn, may help to directly enhance the clarity of somatic calcium signaling and improve signal accuracy in wide-field imaging<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (Supplementary Note 1).

Meanwhile, those studies were often facilitated by achieving optimal neuronal labeling density<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and/or special optics such as holographic illumination patterns<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> to reduce background and improve cell signal detection (Supplementary Note 1). Provided with the superior sensitivity of our red probes in zebrafish and mice, we, therefore, investigated whether SomaFRCaMPi could report population neuronal activity with single-cell resolution and improved accuracy in mouse cortex under a widefield imaging setup.</p><p id="P28">For this experiment, we pan-cortically expressed either SomaFRCaMPi or FRCaMPi in the mouse cortex (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>,<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">b</xref>) and installed a polymer cranial window that spans the dorsal cortex of mice<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. We then head-fixed the mouse and imaged neuronal activity using a wide-field stereoscope<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). By tuning the stereoscope to the highest spatial resolution achievable for our setup (zoom body set to 6.3x), we achieved a millimeter-sized FOV for populational imaging of neurons. A green indicator, GRAB-5HT3.0, was co-expressed to help assure pan-neuronal expression pattern and enhance visualization of the vasculature morphology as a reference for locating specific brain regions at higher magnifications (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref> and Supplementary Video 2). We chose to image the primary somatosensory (S1) and visual cortex (V1), which are considered to be two of the densest cortical regions, with 110,000 &#x000b1; 1,000 and 164,000 &#x000b1; 50,000 neurons per mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Thus, obtaining quality somatic signals would be, in principle, more challenging in those regions compared to others due to a stronger labeling density in the background. To ensure a fair comparison between non-targeted and soma-localized versions of FRCaMPi, and to evaluate the contribution of neuropil contamination to distance-dependent neuronal activity correlation, neuronal activity was recorded only while the mouse was resting on the treadmill. This approach was taken to prevent additional input from correlated neuronal activities in the somatosensory and visual cortex that could arise due to locomotion, as suggested by previous studies<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. As a result, we successfully detected Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes from neuronal soma in both S1 and V1 of brains expressing FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). We identified many more spiking neurons by simple visual assessment of the raw datasets (Supplementary Video 5). In parallel, we observed a consistently high labeling density of 80&#x02013;90% of cortical neurons estimated at the imaging site using post-hoc histological analysis (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>). Further analysis of the number of ROIs segmented by CNMF-E<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> confirmed that the number of ROIs identified per FOV for SomaFRCaMPi in S1 and V1 was 3.3 and 2.9 times larger than that for FRCaMPi, respectively (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Consistent with observation in mouse neuronal culture and in mouse <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> under 2P, the baseline fluorescence of SomaFRCaMPi neurons in mouse cortex was about 23% and 57% dimmer than that of FRCaMPi ones under the same imaging parameters in S1 and V1, respectively (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p><p id="P29">The profiling of neuronal spikes showed similar peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> between FRCaMPi- and SomaFRCaMPi-expressing mice in S1 and 2-fold peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> for SomaFRCaMPi spikes in V1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>), consistent with the observation in 2P mouse imaging. However, the peak SNR of SomaFRCaMPi spikes from both brain regions was higher than FRCaMPi ones, with 10% and 40% higher peak SNR observed for SomaFRCaMPi spikes in S1 and V1, respectively (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). This indicates that the expression of SomaFRCaMPi reduces the overall background noise to a level that achieves a higher SNR despite owning a lower brightness. The decay kinetics remained very similar between SomaFRCaMPi and FRCaMPi obtained from individual spike waveforms (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>). Meanwhile, SomaFRCaMPi neurons also reported approximately 50% more calcium events than those of FRCaMPi in FOV from both brain regions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We next measured the distance-wise correlation of neuronal activity from neuron pairs within the FOV of SomaFRCaMPi vs. FRCaMPi mice. To achieve this, we analyzed the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of raw data trace extracted from ROIs as previously suggested<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In S1 and V1 of mice expressing either of the indicators, we observed correlation coefficients of 0.73&#x02013;0.99 between cell pairs, with the drop of correlation found for cell pairs at increasing distances over the range of 0&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;m. The magnitude of correlation was much higher than that observed in 2P imaging experiments, and the correlation difference between FRCaMPi and SomaFRCaMPi was also much higher. As suggested by Chen et al.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, optical scattering and out-of-focus fluorescence likely contribute to the overall blurriness observed in wide-field imaging and, thus, dominate high correlation by noise. Despite presenting a much denser spiking population and a higher spiking rate on top (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">e</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">j</xref>), SomaFRCaMPi still exhibited a lower correlation coefficient across the broad range of distances with a steeper decrease of coefficient between neuronal pairs, ending up at a level approximately 20% to 30% less than FRCaMPi at 800 &#x003bc;m (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">m</xref>). We further analyzed the mean correlation coefficient for distance ranges: 0&#x02013;200, 200&#x02013;400, and 400&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;m and found correlations at different distance ranges were all significantly lower in SomaFRCaMPi-expressing mice compared to FRCaMPi ones (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>). To summarize, in both S1 and V1 regions, SomaFRCaMPi reduced contamination to a less signal correlation, enabled detection of more neurons with a higher number of neuronal spikes and increased SNR using the widefield setup. These results collectively underscore the efficacy of SomaFRCaMPi for one-photon widefield imaging, demonstrating its advanced ability as a red soma-localized indicator to report more somatic signals with higher precision in this noisy imaging modality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Advancements in microscopic techniques<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> and image processing algorithms<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> have profoundly improved the proficiency of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> calcium imaging to achieve concurrent profiling of large populational neuronal activities with cellular resolution, making it possible to address computational and coding principles of functional brain units beyond single neurons<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. This advancement can be further enhanced by the optimization of GECIs.

In this study, we reported FRCaMPi and its soma-localized version, SomaFRCaMPi, a pair of red calcium indicators with high dynamic range and excellent sensitivity. Furthermore, we highlighted the advantages of using SomaFRCaMPi for signal extraction and precision recording of populational neuronal activities in mice and zebrafish <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P32">It is advantageous to use GECIs with affinity that match the resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> level of the cellular system, as the maximal slope of the fluorescence change in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> titration curve occurs near the resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>), maximizing their detectability of changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.

A recent study on ultra-high affinity GECIs based on single fluorescent protein (1-FP) may provide an alternative way to generate sensitive mutants<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. By inverting topology and further optimizing linker length between CaM and the CaM binding peptide<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>, <italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">d</italic></sub> of GECIs were tuned down to less than 30 nM (5 to 8 folds lower to their precursor). Those indicators enabled the detection of fluorescence change in amoebae that possess an ultra-low resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (~10 nM) and small intracellular dynamics (&#x0003c;100 nM)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, which is not accessible to most GECIs designed for sensing neuronal calcium dynamics. In this study, similarly, we found that by a simple topological inversion of FRCaMP, the sensitivity of the indicator was increased in detecting neuronal calcium dynamics (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">d</italic></sub> value of FRCaMPi (81 nM) is much closer to the resting intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in neurons compared to its precursor (214 nM), which likely explains the improved sensitivity in neuronal recording. This approach offers a shortcut to enhance indicator sensitivity without the need for laborious mutant screening.</p><p id="P33">To find an effective soma-targeting motif for engineering a red soma-localized GECI, we conducted a peptide screening and chose the RPL10 tag to generate SomaFRCaMPi for characterization in neuronal culture and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 2). While soma-localization improved soma restriction and functional imaging in GCaMPs, it could significantly hamper the functionality of the probe such as baseline brightness<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. To mitigate this issue, the fusion of RPL10 to FRCaMPi avoids direct linkage of the structurally dynamic calcium-interactive part of the sensor, the M13 peptide, to localization peptide that could anchor the probe rigidly to ribosomes in cells. By systematical characterization in cultured neurons, the resulting indicator, SomaFRCaMPi, indeed outperformed the three other ribo-tagged red GECIs that are all based on cpRFP. Out of all ribo-tagged red indicators examined, SomaFRCaMPi showed both the highest sensitivity with peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> of ~180% per single AP and only 2-fold lower brightness compared to the non-targeted version (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). A substantial decrease of baseline fluorescence was seen in the case of SomaXCaMP-R (about 5 folds) and SomajRGECO1a (&#x0003e;7 folds), and a significant drop in fluorescence responses was observed in SomaK-GECO1 (&#x0003e; 2.3 folds; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Given that current red GECIs exhibited significantly lower brightness and weaker fluorescence responses compared to optimized green GECIs<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, a further substantial reduction of brightness and/or response amplitude could significantly influence their performance <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. This likely explains the absence of reports on soma-localized red GECIs to date. Another successful example showing the benefit of the ncp design in fusions is the generation of a bioluminescent GECI, LUCI-GECO1, based on a genetic fusion of NanoLuc luciferase domain to ncpGCaMP6s, showing a 2.7-fold higher bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) efficiency than fusion to the original GCaMP6s<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Together, we think the inversion topology for the existing GECIs might be more compatible with genetic fusions for preserved functionality of the indicator and may facilitate subcellular targeting to other organelles.</p><p id="P34">For <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> applications, we demonstrated both the structural and functional compatibility of RPL10 fusion used for calcium imaging in fish larvae. Structurally, SomaFRCaMPi reduced neuropil fluorescence substantially in zebrafish and enabled segmentation of a doubled number of neuronal somas than non-targeted FRCaMPi. Functionally, SomaFRCaMPi demonstrated exceptional sensitivity in zebrafish. Notably, in the looming experiment, SomaFRCaMPi has shown the ability to clearly differentiate neuropil signals from somatic signals in the optic tectum. Given the advancements in zebrafish imaging technologies and data analyses<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>, implementing ribo-tagged indicators would allow for the extraction of a greater number of neurons with improved signal precision, advancing the outcome of whole-brain imaging. More strikingly, applying ribo-tagging to FRCaMPi did not compromise its basal fluorescence in zebrafish larvae (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>), a phenomenon whose underlying reasons remain unclear given the variability of expression observed across different biological systems<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, integrating those advanced properties of SomaFRCaMPi holds promise for more precise, sensitive and comprehensive neural imaging in zebrafish studies.</p><p id="P35">For imaging in mice, we utilized both 1P and 2P microscopy to elucidate the advantages of using SomaFRCaMPi in functional recording of neuronal populations. SomaFRCaMPi enhanced signal detection with improved SNR in densely labeled neuronal populations during wide-field 1P imaging. It was also sufficient to reliably report activity in deeper cortical layers under 2P imaging and improved recording precision by reducing artificial signal correlations in both 1P and 2P imaging. These observations highlight the critical features of soma-localized indicators, consistent with those observed in soma-localized GCaMPs<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, underscoring the effectiveness of using SomaFRCaMPi in mice. Previous reports have shown that jRGECO1a exhibits a sensitivity level comparable to that of GCaMP6f but performs 40% worse than GCaMP6s in L 2/3 of V1 <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In our study, we extended this comparison by evaluating SomaFRCaMPi against the latest generation of GCaMP indicators. Side-by-side characterization of RiboL1-GCaMP8s and SomaFRCaMPi fluorescence responses in neurons of the NTS demonstrated comparable Z-score levels, along with a 30% reduction in baseline noise for SomaFRCaMPi. These results highlight the advantages of using a red fluorescent probe for imaging in dense tissue such as brain stem and confirm the outstanding sensitivity of SomaFRCaMPi, matching that of top-performing soma-targeted GECIs.</p><p id="P36">Intriguingly, SomaFRCaMPi demonstrated a higher sensitivity level compared to the non-targeted FRCaMPi, both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. The enhanced sensitivity resulting from ribo-tagging likely stems from several factors. Firstly, sensitivity may be directly influenced by the targeted sensor design, as evidenced by the varied effects on sensitivity observed for the other three ribo-tagged red GECIs based on cpRFPs (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4g</xref>). Secondly, fusions to different localization peptides using the same indicator might lead to differential changes in &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub>, as seen in the peptide screening results of this study and in the study by Shemesh et al<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Another possible explanation for the increased sensitivity in SomaFRCaMPi is the resultant Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering in neurons. In contrast to non-targeted FRCaMPi localized throughout the entire neuron, including neuropils, the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity of SomaFRCaMPi is presumably weaker due to fewer sensor molecules present in the cytoplasm since SomaFRCaMPi expression was restricted to neuronal soma. Consequently, as compared to FRCaMPi, upon calcium influx, the SomaFRCaMPi sensor molecules have access to more Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in a stronger fluorescence change and, thus, a higher &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub>. This reduced buffering should also accelerate the kinetics of the indicator, as the reduced resistance to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx would make both the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the indicator more reflective of their true dynamics. Although we did not observe a significant improvement in kinetics in zebrafish for SomaFRCaMPi to support the hypothesis of reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, we did observe faster kinetics for SomaFRCaMPi versus FRCaMPi in neuronal culture and under 2P imaging in mice evoked by visual stimuli (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="P37">In this study, we have showcased the advantages of coupling topological inversion and soma restriction to re-engineer an mApple-based red calcium indicator for higher sensitivity and improved performance in populational calcium imaging. The resulting indicator, SomaFRCaMPi, achieved applications and image quality as for those of soma-targeted green GECIs. However, the limitations of the current study should be considered. Since our goal was to demonstrate the application of topological inversion using FRCaMP as an example, the amino acid sequence of both FP and calcium sensing domain is not perturbed. As a result, FRCaMPi retains certain characteristics of FRCaMP, such as suboptimal photostability and off-kinetics. In addition, the topological inversion enhanced calcium binding affinity, which led to slower calcium dissociation and further prolonged the off-kinetics of the indicator as a trade-off (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Both FRCaMP and FRCaMPi are based on mApple RFP, which could lead to complications such as fluorescent aggregates (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>,<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Nevertheless, those should indicate a great opportunity and space to optimize the indicator further for better applications. Recent studies hold promise in eliminating undesired features in existing red GECIs<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> and engineering red GECI using better performing RFP than mApple is likely to lead to GECIs with improved properties.</p><p id="P38">In addition, topological inversion can be explored in alternative ways, presenting valuable opportunities for sensor optimization. By analogy, the engineering of a topological variant can also be reversed. For instance, inverting the topology of a 1-FP potassium indicator, GINKO1 (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">d</italic></sub> = 2.38 mM), which originally had a non-circular permuted (ncp) topology, resulted in cp-GINKO1 with a substantially reduced ligand binding affinity (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">d</italic></sub> = 270 mM)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Consequently, the pursuit of topological variants may be a more general strategy, as changes in ligand affinity are necessary to optimize signal detection in biological or subcellular targets with either low or high ligand concentrations. This strategy of reversing topological configurations (between cp and ncp) could also be applicable to sensors other than GECIs, as were shown for potassium (ncp to cp) and glutamate (cp to ncp).</p><p id="P39">In conclusion, we have developed a pair of new red GECIs by integrating altered topological structures and fusing them with a soma-localization motif. Unlike traditional screening methods, our approaches rapidly yielded indicators with improved peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub>, demonstrating markedly higher sensitivity compared to one of the leading competitors, jRGECO1a. The high sensitivity against jRGECO1a was validated across all tested biological imaging modalities, with minimal compromise to other properties of the indicators. Our results suggest that utilizing topological inversion can be a valuable strategy for re-engineering 1-FP-based GECIs, thereby enhancing Ca<sup>2+</sup> detectability. Furthermore, additional genetic fusions using the ncp topology design should be encouraged, as this approach holds promise for diverse applications of 1-FP GECIs.
