Despite praziquantel as the primary treatment, concerns about resistance in schistosomes underscore the need for alternative therapies. The success of RNA interference (RNAi) in schistosomes shows promise for identifying potential drug targets to facilitate drug discovery. Meanwhile, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is commonly used in functional gene analysis <italic>via</italic> RNAi, with double-stranded green fluorescent protein (ds-GFP) widely employed as a control in schistosome-related studies. However, the potential for off-target effects of dsRNAs in various biological systems raises concerns about the reliability of conventional controls in schistosome RNAi experiments. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the safety and suitability of ds-GFP as an RNAi negative control in <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic>. Our data indicate that ds-GFP is innocuous and exerts no discernible impact on the host&#x02019;s physiology and immune responses. Comprehensive evaluations conducted in mice showed no significant alterations in body and organ weights. While a splenic immune response was observed, histopathological examinations of multiple organs confirmed the absence of significant lesions following ds-GFP treatment. Additionally, <italic>S. japonicum</italic> morphology, reproductive capacity, and host responses to parasite eggs showed no significant variations. Taken together, these findings bolster the endorsement of ds-GFP as an appropriate negative control in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> RNAi experiments, offering reliable outcomes crucial for advancing research on schistosomiasis and related parasitic diseases.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="fr"><p>La schistosomiase touche plus de 250 millions de personnes dans 78 pays.

Utilizing modern molecular biology techniques, transcriptome analyses of various developmental stages of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> and dynamic transcriptome analyses from cercariae to egg-laying stages have been conducted [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These studies provide novel insights for screening effective anti-schistosome vaccine candidates and drug targets. Furthermore, in-depth exploration of molecules with potential key functions and elucidation of their roles in schistosome development, evolution, and host interactions highlight RNA interference (RNAi) as a valuable research tool. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a trigger for RNAi is a well-established technical approach for functional gene analyses in many organisms, including parasites [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In 2003, the initial utilization of RNAi was reported in the parasitic flatworm <italic>S. mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since then, RNAi has emerged as an indispensable tool in reverse genetics for this and other parasites, demonstrating its significant value in scientific research. In the absence of an <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system supporting sexual maturity and organ function in <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, traditional RNAi methods for gene expression suppression were deemed unsuitable. To overcome this limitation, we previously pioneered a method for RNAi-mediated gene expression suppression throughout the complete life-cycle of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> within experimentally infected mouse hosts [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved cellular process that controls the expression of foreign genes and chromosomal function in a wide variety of animals [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), Dicer and Drosha enzymes process it into short interfering RNAs (siRNA) of 19&#x02013;23 nucleotides. These siRNAs, in conjunction with argonaute proteins, assemble into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which selectively binds to specific RNA targets, leading to their degradation [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. RNAi has emerged as a preferred tool in parasite research for investigating gene function, capitalizing on the intrinsic RNAi machinery of these organisms. This method holds particular significance in parasitology, where, unlike model organisms, gene knock-out techniques have yet to be established [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Comprehensive transcriptome and genome sequencing data for schistosomes has made it possible to identify putative gene targets and devise novel tactics. Since the introduction of transient RNAi in 2003, utilizing both long and short-interfering dsRNA, it has proven to be a straightforward and essential tool for studying gene function in schistosomes and other parasites [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Under <italic>in vitro</italic> circumstances, <italic>S. japonicum</italic> cannot achieve sexual maturity, and reproductive organs of sexually mature parasites degenerate. Consequently, utilizing RNAi methods for gene expression suppression to validate the corresponding phenotypes of functional genes is not suitable within an <italic>in vitro</italic> worm culture model system. We have solved this problem by using a new method that uses RNAi to decrease gene expression in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> throughout its complete life cycle in mouse hosts that were experimentally infected [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Meanwhile, adapting the approach to the parasite&#x02019;s complicated life phases within the mammalian host requires a detailed understanding of host-parasite interaction dynamics. Understanding the host immunological response, cellular absorption pathway, and the stability of dsRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> is critical for the successful application of RNAi techniques.</p><p>Nevertheless, the established potential for off-target effects of dsRNAs in diverse biological systems raises concerns about the reliability of conventional controls in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> RNAi research [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These controls frequently contain &#x0201c;scrambled&#x0201d; sequences of the target-oriented dsRNA, as well as non-schistosome dsRNAs targeting genes such as <italic>gfp</italic>, <italic>mcherry</italic>, and luciferase [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While these sequences are initially believed to have no nonspecific effects, observed concerns, such as altered expression of off-target genes, propose the creation of siRNAs that match non-homologous sequences. This underscores the need for a thorough reevaluation of these controls to prove the accuracy and specificity of RNAi experiments in schistosomes.</p><p>Therefore, the primary goal of our study was to reevaluate the safety and usefulness of double-stranded green fluorescent protein (ds-GFP), which is routinely employed as RNAi control in <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. This evaluation was critical for establishing the consistency of experimental results in RNAi research with <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. Our study involving <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments with mice infected by <italic>S. japonicum</italic> cercariae showed that ds-GFP treatment did not cause significant body weight loss or immune cell profile changes, despite a splenic immune response indicated by elevated cytokines at 28 days post-infection. Furthermore, ds-GFP did not induce organ damage or adversely affect the growth, development, or reproductive capacity of <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. These results support the safety and reliability of ds-GFP as a control in RNAi studies related to schistosomiasis and similar parasitic diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with the animal husbandry guidelines of Fudan University.

</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>ds-GFP induces gene expression alterations in mice spleen</title><p>The investigation delved into the molecular realm, specifically examining alterations in gene expression within mice spleen following ds-GFP administration. The contrast between ds-GFP-treated and NaCl-treated groups showed that ds-GFP challenge induced more upregulated DEGs than downregulated DEGs, with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05&#x000a0;at 28 dpi (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.parasite-journal.org/10.1051/parasite/2025003/olm" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the functional implications of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene ontology (GO) analysis was conducted to categorize and annotate these genes based on biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF). In the spleen at 28 days dpi, the GO analysis revealed notable trends in biological processes. &#x0201c;Wound healing&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;angiogenesis&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;phagocytosis&#x0201d; were identified as significantly up-regulated processes in response to ds-GFP challenge (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). These findings suggest that ds-GFP may contribute to enhanced tissue repair, vascular development, and phagocytic activity within the spleen. Conversely, immune response-related biological processes were observed to be down-regulated by ds-GFP. This down-regulation may indicate a modulation of immune-related pathways, potentially reflecting a regulatory influence of ds-GFP on specific components of the immune system in the spleen (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). At the cellular component level, the GO analysis revealed an upregulation of &#x0201c;membrane&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;immunoglobulin complex&#x0201d;, while &#x0201c;collagen-containing extracellular matrix&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;transmembrane transporter complex&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;ribosome&#x0201d; were downregulated (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). These changes indicate potential alterations in membrane-associated structures and immune-related complexes, suggesting a dynamic impact of ds-GFP on the cellular microenvironment within the spleen. In addition, the analysis of molecular functions demonstrated that &#x0201c;cell adhesion molecule binding&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;carbohydrate binding&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;extracellular matrix structural constituent&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;antigen binding&#x0201d; were upregulated, while &#x0201c;sulfur compound binding&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cytokine and chemokine activity&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;glycosaminoglycan binding&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;heparin binding&#x0201d; were downregulated by ds-GFP (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). These molecular function alterations point towards potential changes in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix composition, and antigen recognition within the spleen induced by ds-GFP. In summary, these results provide detailed insights into the diverse functional consequences of ds-GFP-induced gene expression alterations in the spleen.</p><p>

As shown in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results demonstrate that the patterns exhibited by ds-GFP.F (female <italic>S. japonicum</italic> worms treated with ds-GFP) and NACL.F (female <italic>S. japonicum</italic> worms treated with NaCl) are consistent, as are those of ds-GFP.M (male <italic>S. japonicum</italic> worms treated with ds-GFP) and NACL.M (male <italic>S. japonicum</italic> worms treated with NaCl). Additionally, the Pearson correlation analysis showed that these 16 RNA-seq samples were well clustered by gender rather than ds-GFP treatment (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). We then evaluated differential gene expression in both male and female <italic>S. japonicum</italic> after ds-GFP RNAi. Of a total of 8,441 variables, 1 was up-regulated and 4 were down-regulated in ds-GFP.F <italic>vs</italic> the NACL.F group (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). In addition, only 2 genes were up-regulated in ds-GFP.M <italic>vs</italic> the NACL.M group (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). Taken together, these findings highlight that ds-GFP did not significantly impact the gene expression pattern in <italic>S. japonicum</italic>.</p><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S26"><title>Discussion</title><p>RNAi has emerged as a preferred tool in parasite research for investigating gene function, capitalizing on the intrinsic RNAi machinery of these organisms. dsRNA, in particular, has proven to be a simple, yet essential method for studying gene function in schistosomes and other parasites [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the potential off-target effects of dsRNAs, demonstrated across various biological systems, raise concerns, especially with high concentrations that may saturate the RISC complex, leading to systemic dysregulation of gene expression [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given that GFP is commonly used as a control in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> RNAi experiments, the potential for altered expression of off-target genes in other species should be considered [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The primary aim of our study was to reevaluate the safety and suitability of ds-GFP as an RNAi control in <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. In this study, we confirmed that ds-GFP is a safe RNAi control with minimal impact on host physiology and immune responses. The comprehensive assessments demonstrated no significant organ damage in mice and no adverse effects on the growth or reproductive capacity of the parasitic organism. These findings enhance the reliability of ds-GFP as a suitable control in experimental designs involving <italic>S. japonicum</italic>.</p><p>In the assessment of the effects of ds-GFP on mice, our results demonstrated that ds-GFP treatment did not induce significant changes in the body and organ weights of C57BL/6&#x000a0;J mice over a 28-day period (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The weights of five major organs and the maintenance of normal food and water intake further supported the conclusion that ds-GFP did not exert a substantial influence on the overall physiological parameters of the mice. Despite these minimal impacts on body and organ weights, ds-GFP did elicit a modest splenic immune response, as evidenced by the upregulation of specific cytokines at 28 dpi (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Studies have reported that dsRNA can induce an undesirable activation of the interferon (IFN) response [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Utilizing a multiplex cytokine bead array assay, we assessed 22 cytokines/chemokines in serum samples from mice subjected to ds-GFP or NaCl treatments at days 0, 14, 21, and 28 post-injection. Consistent with previous reports, by day 28, ds-GFP-treated mice displayed significantly elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17A, IL-12(p70), IFN-&#x003b3;, MIP-&#x003b2;), and notably, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels were also significantly increased compared to NaCl-treated mice. Encouragingly, there were no significant changes observed in the levels of the remaining 11 chemokines and cytokines (Eotaxin, KC, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MCP-1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-12(p40), IL-13, IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and TNF-&#x003b1;) in both ds-GFP-treated and NaCl-treated mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="http://Fig.S1" ext-link-type="uri">Fig. S1</ext-link>). These findings indicate that ds-GFP treatment led to an increase in several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines at 28 dpi. This immune response was further corroborated by the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and IL-17A, in the spleen of ds-GFP-treated mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3G</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). However, these alterations did not result in significant changes in the peripheral blood immune cell profile, as evidenced by routine blood analysis and flow cytometry (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><p>In the molecular realm, RNA-seq analysis of the spleen revealed notable gene expression changes induced by ds-GFP treatment. The PCA plot showed clear separation between ds-GFP-treated and NaCl-treated groups, and GO analysis indicated changes in biological processes related to wound healing, angiogenesis, and phagocytosis. Additionally, changes in cellular components and molecular functions suggested potential impacts on cell adhesion, extracellular matrix composition, and antigen recognition within the spleen, induced by ds-GFP (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Importantly, histopathological examinations of multiple organs, including the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, intestines, and spleen, at 28 dpi showed no signs of significant damage or abnormalities following ds-GFP administration (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These comprehensive assessments collectively suggest that ds-GFP treatment had minimal impact on body and organ weights, but did induce some immune responses in mice, particularly an increase in certain cytokines at 28 dpi. Notably, these alterations did not adversely affect the overall health and vitality of the mice.</p><p>Moving beyond host immune response, our study also investigated the impact of ds-GFP on <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, the parasitic organism. Morphological assessments and quantitative measurements of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> specimens revealed no significant deviations or disruptions attributable to ds-GFP treatment (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>). The reproductive capacity of the parasites, as indicated by egg counts, remained unaffected by ds-GFP (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Furthermore, liver sections from ds-GFP-treated mice displayed typical granuloma structures and collagen distribution patterns comparable to those in the control group, indicating that ds-GFP did not significantly alter the host&#x02019;s granulomatous and fibrotic responses to <italic>S. japonicum</italic> eggs (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, employing meticulous primer design and rigorous techniques, particularly <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments with mice infected by <italic>S. japonicum</italic> cercariae, we established that ds-GFP treatment did not result in a significant loss in mouse body weight. While a splenic immune response was found, indicated by the elevation of cytokines at 28 dpi, it is interesting that the immune cell profile in mice remained unaffected following ds-GFP administration. Additionally, administration of ds-GFP did not induce significant organ damage and had no adverse effects on the growth, development, or reproductive capacity of <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. This comprehensive evaluation provides substantial evidence supporting the safety of ds-GFP as an RNAi control in the context of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> studies, thereby endorsing its reliability in facilitating accurate research outcomes in studying schistosomiasis and related parasitic diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><label>a</label><p>Lei Xiu, Xiaoling Wang and Shaoyun Cheng contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="funding-statement" id="S27"><title>Funding</title><p>This work has been supported by funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31725025 to W.H.), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31972699 to W.H.), Science and Technology Leading Talent Team plan (2022SLJRC0023 to W.H.), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M710789 to L.X.) and Inner Mongolia University Startup Foundation for Young Academic Talents (10000-24220101 to L.X.).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="S28"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S29"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw sequencing data generated in this study have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession number PRJNA1100745 and can be accessed via this link: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1100745" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1100745</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S30"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><p specific-use="print-only">The supplementary material for this article can be found at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.parasite-journal.org/10.1051/parasite/2025003/olm" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.parasite-journal.org/10.1051/parasite/2025003/olm</ext-link>.</p><p>
