The activation of traumatic memory as a center for generating a complex of pathological symptoms is provoked due to the personal structural inability of a person to legally reorganize, reintegrate and absorb stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec7438"><title>Methods</title><p>For a complete psychological exploration of an organization, personality dynamics, symptoms, defenses, motives, goals, values, interpersonal relationships, etc. I have applied: MMPI-202, NEO PI-R, Millon&#x02019;s test, PIE, ZS and Azinger aggression scale.</p></sec><sec id="sec7439"><title>Results</title><p>The result is an inadequately structured person of the avoidant type: introverted, vulnerable, disturbingly self-centered, constantly alert to prevent his impulses and affectional compunctions from leading to a repetition of pain and suffering experienced in the past, denying his feelings to maintain interpersonal distance, sensitive, helpless in an aggressive environment, low self-esteem and self-confidence, with weak capacities to overcome stress, etc. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are dominant. Manifest symptomatology is elaborated.</p></sec><sec id="sec7440"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In a person with an inadequate structure, there is an increased vulnerability, therefore applying an exploratory approach to people with a stressful condition in daily professional practice is a necessary need in order to more effectively, comprehensively treat the current and previously memorized stressful reactions with an emphasis on the highly personalized response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec7441"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
