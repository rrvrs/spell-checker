HPSE 2, an isoform of HPSE, binds to but does not possess the enzymatic activity needed to cleave cell surface HS. Our study demonstrates that HSV-2 infection significantly elevates HPSE 2 protein levels, impacting two distinct stages of viral replication. We show that higher HPSE 2 negatively affects HSV-2 replication which may be through the regulation of cell surface HS. By acting as a competitive inhibitor of HPSE, HPSE 2 may be interfering with HPSE&#x02019;s interactions with HS. We demonstrate that the enhanced expression of HPSE 2, either via viral infection or plasmid transfection, reduces HPSE&#x02019;s ability to cleave HS, thereby hindering viral egress. Conversely, low HPSE 2 levels achieved through siRNA transfection allow HPSE to cleave more HS, reducing viral entry. Altogether, we propose a hypothetical model in which the modulation of HPSE 2 impedes HSV-2 replication by regulating HS availability on the cell surface. This dual role of HPSE 2 in viral replication and potential tumor suppression underscores its significance in cellular processes and viral pathogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>heparanase 2</kwd><kwd>herpes simplex virus type 2</kwd><kwd>heparan sulfate</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>R01EY024710</award-id><award-id>R01 EY029426</award-id><award-id>P30EY001792</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Research to Prevent Blindness, Inc.</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH grants R01EY024710, R01 EY029426, and P30EY001792, as well as unrestricted funds from Research to Prevent Blindness, Inc.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01832"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a nuclear replicating double-stranded DNA virus, which enters cells via the binding of its envelope glycoproteins, gB and gC, to cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HSV-2 is the primary etiological agent of genital herpes, a condition characterized by painful lesions and inflammation in the genital and anal regions [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In males, infection typically manifests on the penile shaft or anal area, whereas in females, it predominantly affects the vaginal region, cervix, and perianal area. Moreover, HSV-2 genital infection is associated with an increased risk of both HIV transmission and acquisition [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although HSV-2 can cause ocular and labial infections, these occurrences are less common compared to HSV-1. Currently, there is neither a vaccine nor a cure for HSV-2, and resistance to existing antiviral therapies, such as acyclovir, has been documented [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These antiviral agents, developed over decades ago, primarily target viral DNA replication [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Hence, there is a critical need for delineating the mechanisms that drive HSV-2 pathogenesis and identifying new targets for improved interventions.</p><p>To understand the host factors that facilitate the viral lifecycle, our study focuses on an HS binding host protein, heparanase 2 (HPSE 2) [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HPSE 2 is the only known cell protein that sequesters HS, a ubiquitous cell surface polysaccharide and HSV-2 attachment receptor, by inhibiting heparanase (HPSE) [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Unlike HPSE, which cleaves HS, HPSE 2 competitively inhibits HPSE&#x02019;s HS cleaving activity [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] by targeting the same epitopes with a higher affinity but without any enzymatic activity of its own [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HPSE 2 has been recognized as a tumor suppressor in various studies, regulating genes involved in tumor vascularity, fibrosis, cell differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Three splice variants of HPSE 2 exist and they contribute to overlapping functions in health and disease.</p><p>In recent studies by our lab, we have investigated the pro-viral functions of HPSE in vitro and in vivo models in HSV-1 infections and in vitro models regarding HSV-2 infection [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our studies, we found that HS is needed for viral entry but its removal after viral replication by HPSE is required for the optimal release of newly generated virion particles. We also showed that higher levels of HPSE during infection contribute to viral pathogenesis and the induction of a proinflammatory environment. While several past studies have focused on HPSE in viral infections, very little knowledge exists on the role of its competitive inhibitor, HPSE-2. In this study, we show that the overexpression and knockdown of HPSE 2 negatively affects HSV-2 replication, shedding light on the molecular interactions that regulate viral entry and egress from host cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01832"><title>2.

Flow Cytometry</title><p>Measurement of HS and HPSE-1 cell surface expression was performed after HSV-2 333-WT infection. Monolayers of VK2 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 or 1 then harvested at different times post-infection (12 hpi, 24 hpi, 36 hpi, and 48 hpi). Cells were harvested and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, then incubated with 5% BSA for 1 h followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-HS with a 1:100 dilution in PBS with 1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were then suspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 5% FBS, and 0.1% sodium azide). For detection of HPSE-1 on the cell surface, cells were harvested then fixed with 4% PFA for 4 min, then incubated with 5% BSA for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS with 5% BSA for 1 h, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then resuspended in FACS buffer. Cells stained with respective FITC-conjugated secondaries only were used as background controls. Entire cell populations were used for the mean fluorescence intensity calculations. At the termination of cellular incubations, cells were collected on ice, washed twice with FACS buffer, and analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer. BD Accuri C6 Plus software and Treestar FlowJo v10.0.7 were used for all flow cytometry data analyses. Briefly, the gating strategy is as follows: (1) live cells were gated using forward scattering (FSC-A) and side scattering (SSC-A); (2) single cells from the live gate were gated using FSC-A and FSC-H gates; and (3) single cells were then plotted on a histogram to obtain counts of FITC-positive populations post, and FlowJo v10.0.7 software was used to obtain MFI counts.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-viruses-16-01832"><title>2.6.

HPSE 2 Is Upregulated in Response to HSV-2 Infection</title><p>To understand how HSV-2 infection modulates HPSE 2 levels, we infected an established cell type that is a normal target for the virus, human vaginal epithelial cells (VK2), with HSV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. We observed a large and significant upregulation of HPSE 2 transcripts starting at 24 hpi through 48 hpi quantified as a 70-fold increase (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). The increase in mRNA transcripts corresponded to an increase in HPSE 2 protein levels after infection (with an MOI of 1) from 12 hpi through 48 hpi. Note that three separate bands denoting HPSE 2 splice variants a, b, and c can be distinguished (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).

To determine whether the further modulation of HPSE 2 could influence viral proliferation, we overexpressed all three splice variants (a, b, and c) of HPSE 2 in VK2 cells, followed by infection with HSV-2 strain 333 at an MOI of 1. Initially, we assessed the expression of a viral late gene product, glycoprotein gD, known for its abundance, using a Western blot analysis. Our results indicated a substantial decrease in gD levels across all time points and in cells overexpressing each splice variant compared to the empty vector (Vector) control (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). This finding was unexpected, given that only the HPSE 2c variant is known to localize to the cell surface and interact with HS. Subsequently, we performed a plaque assay on the media from infected cells plated without methylcellulose to allow for the release and spread of extracellular virions. This assay revealed a significant reduction in viral titers in all three-splice variant-overexpressing cells compared to the empty vector control (PcDNA), consistent with the Western blot results (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>We further evaluated the intracellular viral load by conducting a plaque assay on cell lysates from VK2 cells infected with HSV-2 at an MOI of 1. The cells were collected 24 h post-infection and sonicated to release the intracellular virus. The assay showed a marked decrease in viral titers in all three-splice variant-overexpressing cells relative to the control, aligning with the results from the extracellular virus plaque assay and the Western blot (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Lastly, we infected VK2 cells at an MOI of 0.1 with HSV-2 333 GFP following the overexpression of the three HPSE 2 splice variants. At 12, 24, and 36 hpi, we conducted flow cytometry to measure fluorescence in infected cells. The data indicated reduced fluorescence in HPSE 2-overexpressing cells compared to the PcDNA control (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Collectively, these results suggest that the overexpression of HPSE 2 negatively impacts HSV-2 replication, corroborating our findings from the Western blot, plaque assay, and flow cytometry analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-16-01832"><title>3.3. Silencing HPSE 2 Curbs HSV-2 Infection</title><p>Our investigation so far has demonstrated that HSV-2 infection leads to an increase in HPSE 2 levels, and that the overexpression of HPSE 2 has a detrimental effect on HSV-2 replication. To further explore the influence of reduced HPSE 2 levels on viral proliferation, we designed a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of HPSE 2. We synthesized four siRNAs targeting HPSE 2, named si1, si2, si3, and si4, along with a scrambled siRNA as a control. A Western blot analysis identified si4 as the most effective in reducing HPSE 2 protein levels (data not included). Following HPSE 2 knockdown with si4, VK2 cells were infected with HSV-2 strain 333 at an MOI of 0.1. Additionally, control cells treated with either scrambled siRNA (for 12 h as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol) or cells exposed to the HPSE inhibitor OGT 2115 (at two hpi) for a total of 12 h were used. We first assessed the levels of the abundant viral protein glycoprotein D (gD) using a Western blot analysis. To our surprise, the results showed a significant decrease in gD production in both HPSE 2 knockdown and OGT 2115-treated cells compared to cells treated with scrambled siRNA (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). The quantification of the Western blot data confirmed a significant reduction in gD expression in HPSE 2 knockdown and OGT 2115-treated cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), which was unexpected given that the overexpression of HPSE 2 previously had inhibited HSV-2 infection.</p><p>Next, we measured the amount of infectious virus produced, both intracellularly and extracellularly, using plaque assays. The results revealed significantly lower viral titers in both HPSE 2 knockdown and OGT 2115-treated cells, consistent with the Western blot findings (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C,D). Finally, we infected VK2 cells with HSV-2 333 GFP and measured the mean fluorescence intensity at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpi as an indicator of infection levels. The results showed a significantly lower level of infection in HPSE 2 knockdown and OGT 2115-treated cells at all time points, corroborating the plaque assay and Western blot data (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). These findings indicate that reduced HPSE 2 levels negatively affect HSV-2 replication, highlighting the complex role of HPSE 2 in the viral lifecycle.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-16-01832"><title>3.4. Effect of Modulation of HPSE 2 on Cell Surface HS </title><p>After establishing that both the overexpression and knockdown of HPSE 2 negatively affect HSV-2 replication, we aimed to determine if these effects are mediated through HPSE 2&#x02032;s regulation of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS). To investigate this, we first examined whether HPSE 2 localization to the cell surface changes during infection. Using confocal microscopy at 63&#x000d7; magnification, we stained for HPSE 2 at the cell surface of VK2 cells infected with HSV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). We observed a significant increase in the cell surface localization of HPSE 2 12 h post-infection, which decreased by 24 hpi and remained low to 48 hpi. Next, we focused on HPSE 2c, the only splice variant known to localize to the cell surface. We overexpressed an HPSE 2c-myc construct in VK2 cells, infected them with HSV-2 at an MOI of 1, and conducted cell surface straining for myc to visualize only the cell surface localization of our construct with and without infection. Our results indicated a significant change in the localization of myc and, consequently, HPSE 2c upon infection, confirming that HPSE 2c localizes to the cell surface during infection (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>We then examined whether the overexpression of HPSE 2c can sequester HS at the cell surface during infection. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that overexpressed HPSE 2c retained HS at the cell surface to 24 hpi (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). This finding contrasts with previous publications from our lab, which demonstrated a substantial decrease in HS cell surface localization 24 h post-infection. Lastly, we assessed the ability of HPSE 2 splice variants to sequester HS at the cell surface. We conducted flow cytometry to measure for cell surface HS after overexpressing HPSE2c alongside the positive control GS3-HPSE, which is a constitutively active HPSE1 construct previously shown to cleave cell surface HS [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We observed that compared to the PcDNA vector, HPSE2c overexpression showed higher HS cell surface levels post-infection (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). When we treated our cells with OGT 2115 to inhibit HPSE1 followed by infection with HSV-2 strain 333 for 24 h, we observed a reduction in HS staining in the non-infected, HPSE2-silenced cells and negligible differences between the PcDNA control and siHPSE2 in the infected conditions (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). Finally, silencing HPSE2 decreased the cell surface localization of HS (<xref rid="viruses-16-01832-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). These findings suggest that the regulatory effects of HPSE 2 on HSV-2 replication are mediated through its modulation of cell surface HS, with significant changes in HPSE2 localization and HS cell surface localization observed during the infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-16-01832"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have elucidated the novel role of HPSE 2 in the context of HSV-2 infection, demonstrating its critical involvement in regulating viral replication through the modulation of HS dynamics at the cell surface. Contrary to our initial expectations based on previous findings with HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections, in which elevated HPSE levels were associated with enhanced viral replication, our current data reveal that HPSE 2 overexpression or knockdown leads to consistent reductions in HSV-2 replication, despite its ability to repress HPSE&#x02019;s enzymatic activity [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Our findings suggest that HPSE 2 plays a dual role in HSV-2 pathogenesis. Consistent with previous reports, HPSE 2 first appears to sequester HS at the cell surface by competitively binding to HS epitopes with a higher affinity, thereby limiting the availability of HS for viral binding and entry [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01832" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Secondly, in the absence of HPSE 2, HPSE activity is increased, resulting in the enhanced cleavage of HS and facilitating viral egress from infected cells. This dual mechanism underscores the intricate balance between HPSE 2-mediated HS sequestration and HPSE-driven HS cleavage in regulating viral replication dynamics.</p><p>Furthermore, our proposed model integrates these observations, proposing that optimal HPSE 2 levels are crucial for HSV-2 pathogenesis. Insufficient HPSE 2 prior to viral binding may lead to inadequate HS presentation at the cell surface, impairing viral entry. Conversely, an early high expression of HPSE 2 during infection may shield HS, thereby impeding viral egress by maintaining higher HS levels at the cell surface. Moving forward, elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms through which HPSE 2 regulates HS availability and HPSE activity during HSV-2 infection will be essential. These insights could not only deepen our understanding of viral pathogenesis but also uncover potential therapeutic targets for modulating HS dynamics to mitigate HSV-2 replication and associated clinical manifestations. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Patricia G.
