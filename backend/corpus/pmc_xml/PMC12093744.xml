Despite the availability of comprehensive on-demand treatment guidelines, compliance to guideline recommendations remains suboptimal, resulting in persisting unmet need.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This observational, online survey was conducted between September 6, 2022, and October 19, 2022 to understand the behaviors and perspectives of individuals in the US with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Participants were recruited by the US Hereditary Angioedema Association and were eligible if they were US residents with clinician-diagnosed HAE type I or II and had experienced at least one HAE attack. The survey included multiple-choice, rank-order, and scale-based responses using a 5-point Likert scale for agreement and an 11-point Likert scale for anxiety. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, summarizing continuous variables as means, medians, and ranges, and categorical variables as frequency distributions and percentages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 107 out of 155 participants completed the survey (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;41 years; 80.4% female). Half of the respondents used both prophylaxis and on-demand therapy, while the other half used on-demand therapy only. Icatibant was the most commonly used on-demand treatment (78.5%). The survey revealed that 57% of respondents did not treat all HAE attacks, and only 14% treated attacks immediately. Delays in treatment were common, with a mean time to treatment of 2.4&#x000a0;h, and younger patients were less likely to carry on-demand treatment. Reasons for delaying treatment included the perceived severity of the attack, lack of on-demand treatment availability, and pain associated with treatment. Additionally, 32.7% of respondents experienced the return of an HAE attack after initial treatment, with those delaying treatment more likely to experience recurrence. The survey also found that delayed treatment led to more severe attacks and longer recovery times, impacting work, social activities, and overall quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Although guidelines recommend early treatment of HAE attacks, many respondents do not treat immediately. This finding underscores the importance of incorporating open patient-physician communication to improve guideline compliance and the management of HAE.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13223-025-00969-0.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hereditary angioedema</kwd><kwd>On-demand treatment</kwd><kwd>Guideline recommendations</kwd><kwd>Compliance</kwd><kwd>Survey</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100031004</institution-id><institution>KalVista Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Canadian Society of Allergy &#x00026; Clinical Immunology 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) protein, leading to the uncontrolled activation of the kallikrein-kinin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. HAE is characterized by unpredictable, painful, and debilitating attacks of tissue swelling in various locations of the body that can be life-threatening depending on the location affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current management of HAE involves the use of parenteral medications for on-demand treatment of angioedema events (HAE attacks) with the objective of relieving symptoms as quickly and completely as possible. To help reduce the frequency and potentially the severity of HAE attacks, it is also recommended that appropriate patients receive long-term prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 2021 updated HAE guidelines recommend that patients consider the treatment of all attacks, regardless of location or severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], treat attacks as early as possible to minimize their duration and severity, and always carry enough on-demand medication to treat at least two attacks.

Respondents who delayed treatment were more likely to express moderate or extreme anxiety about using on-demand treatment compared with those who treated immediately (59% vs. 34.7%). Among the reasons cited by respondents for delaying treatment were the attack not being considered severe enough to treat (86.9%), not having on-demand treatment with them (59%), and &#x0200b;on-demand treatment being too painful (32.8%). Respondents who waited 1&#x000a0;h or longer to initiate on-demand treatment were also less likely to carry on-demand treatment when away from home and more likely to not treat their attacks compared with patients who treated within [&#x0003c; ] 60&#x000a0;min of an attack. Reasons given for not carrying treatment were the preference to treat at home (72%), forgetfulness (56%), excessive confidence in the effectiveness of long-term prophylaxis (77% of patients taking long-term prophylaxis), and avoidance of triggers (44%). These findings highlight the lack of compliance with HAE guidelines and the importance of reinforcing the need to carry on-demand treatment at all times, regardless of whether or not additional long-term prophylaxis is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Although HAE guidelines recommend that attacks be treated as early as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], results from the current analysis confirm that patients frequently delayed on-demand treatment, which suggests that they may not fully understand the time window associated with the recommendation of &#x0201c;early treatment&#x0201d; or that barriers to treatment associated with current therapies are high for many patients. Many reasons for non-compliance with HAE guidelines may be associated with aspects of current on-demand treatment. Previous survey results indicated that respondents waited to treat HAE attacks due to various treatment-related reasons including pain associated with on-demand treatment, lack of privacy, time required to prepare on-demand treatment, and fear of needles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These treatment-related factors may contribute to patient anxiety and logistical barriers associated with delaying on-demand treatment. Having treatment options that are more easily transportable, accessible, and less invasive can potentially remove many of these barriers to timely administration of on-demand treatment.</p><p id="Par41">HAE is unpredictable, and any attack may be followed by another one in short succession; therefore, it is essential that patients have on-demand medication to treat all attacks and that all patients have and carry on-demand medication for the treatment of at least two attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is not uncommon for people with HAE to experience the return of an HAE attack requiring one or more additional doses of on-demand treatment, as previously reported by one-third of survey respondents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, survey results showed that initial delays in HAE attack treatment resulted in increased frequency of attack return when patients waited 1&#x000a0;h or longer to initiate on-demand treatment.</p><p id="Par42">The HAE attack journey is highly individualized for each patient, marked by significant variability in the severity and frequency of attacks which may also fluctuate over a patient&#x02019;s lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As reported previously, respondents recognized the importance of recovering from an HAE attack quickly and agreed that their HAE attacks were more severe and longer when they delayed using on-demand treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, various factors can impede a patient&#x02019;s ability to comply with HAE guidelines. Although HAE guidelines advise treating all attacks regardless of severity, patients may have misconceptions regarding attack severity, leading them to delay treatment when attacks are deemed not severe enough to treat. Although progression patterns may be variable, HAE attacks typically start as mild, then may progress in severity as well as move to other locations in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Conflicting language contained in HAE guidelines may further contribute to the delayed treatment of HAE attacks. The recommendation from HAE guidelines to consider all attacks for on-demand treatment potentially conflicts with their guidance to treat attacks as early as possible. The term &#x0201c;consider&#x0201d; suggests the possibility of treatment delay as patients weigh the severity of the attack to determine whether or not to take action. Therefore, recommendations to enhance patient-physician discussions related to HAE guidelines should include engaging in a dialogue to more clearly define &#x0201c;early treatment&#x0201d; and encourage patient behavior that reinforces the importance of compliance with guidelines to improve patient outcomes. Utilizing patient-driven approaches to enhance communication between patients and physicians and facilitate shared decision-making can optimize outcomes by improving symptom relief, patient satisfaction, and adherence to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. By asking appropriate questions, physicians can gather information about the patient&#x02019;s goals, motivations, and other key factors to guide treatment selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">One limitation of the analysis is that patient surveys rely on subjective opinions; nevertheless, they can offer valuable insights into the patients&#x02019; experiences and identify areas for improvement in care. The current analysis may also have limitations due to the potential for sampling bias in the online survey which was conducted in English and may not fully reflect the perspectives of a wider population, as it was conducted only in the US and respondents were predominantly female. Another limitation of the analysis is the inability to verify self-reported data. Furthermore, observational research is constrained by the lack of a control group for comparison.</p><p id="Par45">In conclusion, survey results revealed that despite guidelines recommending early treatment many respondents do not treat HAE attacks immediately. Treatment delays were associated with increased attack recurrence and reduced likelihood of carrying on-demand medication. These survey findings support a tailored approach for the management of HAE to improve compliance with guidelines, encompassing open patient-physician communication that can help patients navigate the complex and highly individualized HAE attack journey and manage their attacks more effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
