The sustainment of evidence-based care is essential for ongoing population benefits. In a randomized stepped-wedge controlled trial of public maternity services across three health sectors in New South Wales, Australia, we demonstrated a positive practice change related to addressing alcohol use during pregnancy. This change followed a 7-month implementation strategy conducted between February 2018 and November 2019. However, evidence suggests that the impact of implementation strategies may reduce over time. It is important to document when and if recommended care reduces, so that timely support for sustainment can be provided.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>As a secondary analysis, an interrupted time series analysis of outcomes from the largest sector of the randomized stepped-wedge controlled trial was conducted. The analysis explored the rate, time points, and extent of change in women&#x02019;s reported receipt of recommended antenatal care for alcohol consumption, following delivery of an effective implementation strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 4,909 (82% consented) women were surveyed. The proportion of pregnant women receiving recommended care reduced significantly per week following the withdrawal of implementation support, for three of the four outcomes: assessment of alcohol consumption (% change per week: &#x02212;0.66, 95% CI: &#x02212;1.1, &#x02212;0.26); advice not to consume alcohol during pregnancy and of potential risks (% change per week: &#x02212;0.63, 95% CI: &#x02212;1.1, &#x02212;0.22); and complete care relevant to alcohol risk level (advice and referral) (% change per week: &#x02212;0.64, 95% CI: &#x02212;1.1,-0.22). Similar results were observed regardless of the timing of antenatal visits. A more rapid decline occurred for most outcomes from the end of implementation until approximately 30&#x0202f;weeks post-implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite a reduction in the receipt of recommended care, rates were still higher post-implementation than pre-implementation. Receipt of recommended antenatal care for alcohol consumption declined after active implementation support was withdrawn. The findings suggest the need for ongoing monitoring of care delivery and the introduction of additional sustainability strategies at key time points post-withdrawal of implementation support.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sustainment</kwd><kwd>sustainability</kwd><kwd>interrupted time series</kwd><kwd>segmented regression</kwd><kwd>implementation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Clinical practice guidelines (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref>) recommend that healthcare providers (i) routinely assess alcohol consumption by all pregnant women throughout their antenatal care using a validated tool; (ii) advise all women on the potential harms of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and recommend abstinence; and (iii) refer women to support services appropriate to their level of risk to assist in abstaining from alcohol consumption. However, the provision of all three elements of care is less than optimal (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In a recent randomized stepped-wedge controlled trial undertaken in public maternity services in three health services in New South Wales, Australia (i.e., sectors), it was found that a multi-strategy practice change intervention (i.e., implementation intervention) was effective in increasing the proportion of women who reported receiving all individual and combined elements of recommended care (assess, advise, and refer) appropriate to their level of alcohol risk (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To have an impact, an implementation intervention needs to result in the continued delivery of guideline-recommended care long term, beyond the provision of initial implementation support. This is commonly referred to as sustainment (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that once initial implementation support or funding is withdrawn, the impact of effective implementation strategies often diminishes (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref>). For example, in a systematic review of trials assessing the sustainment of health professional&#x02019;s adherence to clinical practice guidelines, only seven of 18 evaluations illustrated 100% sustainment of professional adherence more than 1&#x0202f;year after active implementation (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). There is no agreed definition of what constitutes a successful rate of sustainment (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, recent definitions emphasize the need for the target behavior change or practice to be maintained to a level that continues to produce benefits for individuals or the system (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>Although the effects of implementation interventions often reduce over time, little is known about when, how quickly, and to what extent such reductions occur. According to the Dynamic Sustainability Framework, sustainability is a dynamic process that is impacted by the continually changing environment in which the intervention/model of care is being delivered (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To ensure that sustained delivery is optimized and appropriate support is provided, continuous monitoring, evaluation, and refinement of the intervention and implementation strategies are required (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>To adequately assess and understand the complex process of sustainability, longitudinal designs (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and statistical analyses that allow modeling of complex, non-linear relationships are necessary (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Measurement of sustainment should also be considered from the outset of the implementation process, rather than at the end, when it may be too late to identify when improvements or additional support are needed (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Due to short funding periods and the difficulties of undertaking continual data collection, long-term assessments are rare (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Several examples do exist, where data across multiple time points have been used to gain a greater understanding of how implementation effects change over time (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In one study conducted in the general practice setting in Forth Valley, Scotland, (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) an interrupted time series was used to examine how prescribing rates changed during and following a 12-month quality improvement intervention. An improvement in high-risk non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was found at the end of the intervention period, but also that such effects began to wane in the 12&#x0202f;months following the intervention phase (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In another example, (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) <italic>post-hoc</italic> analyses of a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in 20 hospitals across three Australian states, examining thrombolysis rates across time, illustrated initial improvements toward the end and directly after active implementation support, followed by rapid declines thereafter (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These studies illustrate the advantages of assessing implementation effects across time in terms of understanding the potential for sustainment and if and when additional support and improvements may be needed. There are also examples where the implementation and/or sustainment of alcohol screening and brief behavioral interventions generally (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and in the context of maternal health specifically (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), have been investigated. While these studies provide important insights into the potential barriers and facilitators of implementing and sustaining these interventions, these studies use predominately qualitative and case study methods, which do not allow for a comprehensive assessment of how implementation rates change over time. We are unaware of similar studies that assess implementation changes over time that address the sustainment of antenatal care addressing alcohol consumption.</p><p>The randomized controlled stepped-wedge trial undertaken by Doherty et al. (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) provides a unique opportunity to undertake a secondary analysis of women&#x02019;s receipt of guideline-recommended care in relation to alcohol consumption over time. While the primary analysis followed recommended practice for a stepped-wedge design (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), it only informs us whether the level of care received is on average higher across the entire post-implementation period combined, compared to the pre-implementation period combined. It does not examine whether the observed increase in recommended care changes after active implementation support has ended. In this study, many, but not all the practice change strategies, were intended to continue to support the delivery of the recommended model of care following the implementation period, with the primary exceptions being the withdrawal of the clinical champion and educator and the provision of academic detailing and audit and feedback. Thus, an examination of how care continued to be delivered post-active implementation support will provide an opportunity to assess whether implementation effects are being sustained, or if and when additional support may be needed to support long-term sustainment. In this study, the three participating sectors were randomly allocated to one of three wedges. Each wedge started with baseline data collection (or pre-implementation phase) and then moved one by one into receiving the multi-strategy implementation intervention (or implementation phase), which lasted for 7&#x0202f;months. This was followed by a period of post-implementation data collection (or post-implementation phase), which ranged from 9&#x0202f;months for sector three to 21&#x0202f;months for sector one (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for a depiction of sector one&#x02019;s research phases). The extended follow-up data collection for sector one provides an ideal opportunity to explore the sustainment of this implementation intervention and assess whether care changed during the post-implementation phase following receipt of the implementation intervention.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of study phases illustrating the number of months of data collection for each of the phases of pre-implementation, implementation, and post-implementation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmed-12-1476083-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>In a secondary analysis of data collected from public maternity services located in the largest health sector (i.e., a geographically and administratively defined region overseeing healthcare services in that region) from the original stepped wedge trial conducted by Doherty et al.

It was designed to address the key impediments to increasing and sustaining the delivery of the recommended model of care (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Strategy selection, content, and delivery were informed by current evidence, behavior change experts, practitioner input, and cultural inclusion informed by Aboriginal women, Aboriginal health staff, and local community members and organizations. Broadly, the strategies included leadership and managerial supervision, development of local clinical practice guidelines, electronic prompts and reminders, dedicated clinical champions, provision of educational materials and meetings, academic detailing and audit and feedback, and monitoring and accountability for the performance of the delivery of healthcare. Five of the seven strategies were designed to be integrated within the maternity service&#x02019;s usual systems and processes, with the intention they would continue as part of routine practice to support the delivery of the recommended model of care following the implementation period and without the external support provided as part of the practice change intervention. Only the dedicated clinical champion and educator, and the provision of academic detailing and audit and feedback strategies were not continued following the implementation period.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Data collection and outcomes</title><p>Data from pregnant women were collected continuously on a weekly basis for the entire 35-month study period (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Characteristics of participating women</title><p>Women reported their age, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin, education, employment, marital status, first/subsequent pregnancy status, and the antenatal care providers they saw during their visit in the self-report surveys.

It overcomes existing limitations of the field by using an appropriate analytic approach to explore changes in outcomes across the implementation process, using recently collected data (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It helps to identify if and when the implementation intervention effects may reduce (&#x0201c;wash out&#x0201d;), and when additional support may be required. Encouragingly, rates of care receipt were positively influenced by the implementation intervention (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, rates for all outcomes declined after the implementation phase ended, with immediate and more rapid declines appearing to occur for all but one outcome until approximately 30&#x0202f;weeks following the completion of implementation support. For most outcomes, the prevalence of care seemed to stabilize from this point, although longer follow-up assessment is needed to confirm if further reductions occur.</p><p>These findings illustrate an immediate decline in women&#x02019;s receipt of recommended care once implementation support ended, regardless of what antenatal visit women were attending, and despite the intervention including a number of implementation strategies that were ongoing through integration with existing resources and systems, such as those that were believed to support sustainment due to their system-level technological changes, including reminders built into the existing medical record system. However, for two of the 18 outcomes, this decline was not statistically significant, one of which was for outcomes assessed in women attending their initial visit. This is not surprising as the rates of recommended care delivered prior to the implementation intervention were higher for women attending their initial visit compared to those attending a subsequent visit (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, the implementation intervention was found to have a greater effect on outcomes for women attending their subsequent visits than those attending their initial visit (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); thus, there was the potential for a greater level of implementation effect to be lost for women attending subsequent visits as rates of recommended care were already high for initial visits. The findings are consistent with systematic reviews and individual trials that have identified a decline in implementation following the withdrawal of funding or completion of implementation support (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The findings highlight the difficulties in sustaining long-term changes in clinical care, which are likely impacted by a range of organizational and outer environmental factors that can change rapidly over time (e.g., staffing, policies, regulations, and evidence) (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). As recommended, ongoing monitoring and adaptation of the intervention and implementation support may be needed to ensure that successful practice changes continue to fit and are integrated within changing clinical environments (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In this specific instance, additional support may need to be considered within 30&#x0202f;weeks following implementation.</p><p>It is likely that an array of contextual factors impact the declines observed in this study. However, our understanding of the clinical setting and existing evidence suggests that two possible factors may have had an impact on the sustainment of recommended care being delivered. First, a lack of capacity or capability for clinicians to provide recommended care due to the withdrawal of the specifically trained clinical champion who educated and supported clinicians during this trial, and the provision of academic detailing and audit and feedback, with evidence suggesting that clinical champions in particular are influential to sustainment (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The second relates to reductions in the number of staff who had been exposed to the initial implementation intervention due to regular clinical rotations and workforce turnover. Post-implementation surveys with staff 12&#x0202f;weeks after the intervention found that only approximately 70% had received the training. The high rotation of staff from antenatal clinics may reduce the impact of a number of the implementation strategies, including educational meetings, academic detailing, and support from clinical champions (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Additional strategies, such as booster education for existing staff and inclusion of training in the orientation of new staff, may be needed to ensure sustainment. Working with services to develop education and training that can be incorporated, as much as possible, into current systems and workflows will be necessary to ensure that such strategies can be embedded into routine practice. We are currently testing the impact and feasibility of delivering such sustainment strategies in the maternal health setting (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Limited research has been conducted on sustainability-specific strategies to address declines following effective implementation support. We are aware of one systematic review that assessed sustainability strategies, which focused on public health interventions (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Only six of the 26 included studies reported the use of strategies specifically to support sustainment (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The effect of such strategies was not assessed, providing limited knowledge as to which strategies maybe most effective. Further research is required that involves the development and conduct of specific sustainability trials aimed at supporting the long-term receipt of recommended care generally and addressing pregnant women&#x02019;s consumption of alcohol specifically (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><sec id="sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p>This is a secondary analysis. The design and sample size were not developed <italic>a priori</italic> to undertake this study. Consequently, the findings should be interpreted as hypothesis and concept generating only. Only one of the three sectors from the primary trial was included, due to the small sample sizes within the other two sectors. Finally, we only assessed implementation rates until 17&#x0202f;months post-implementation, which is contrary to recommendations that sustainment should be considered from 2&#x0202f;years post-implementation. However, our finding that care delivery reduced by the end of the 17-month post-implementation period highlights the need to consider issues relating to sustainment earlier in the implementation continuum.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This secondary analysis provided an opportunity to explore the rate, time points, and extent of change in women&#x02019;s receipt of recommended antenatal care addressing alcohol consumption during pregnancy, following the withdrawal of effective implementation support. Consistent with previous research, we found that the effects of the implementation intervention declined after active implementation were completed. However, for most outcomes, this decline appears to stabilize from approximately 30&#x0202f;weeks post-implementation. The results suggest the potential need for additional sustainability strategies initially after the withdrawal of implementation support to ensure that the benefits of delivering guideline-recommended care are continued long term.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the women and antenatal providers who participated in the study; Aboriginal women and organisations for their cultural information; the trial&#x02019;s investigator group; the project team, including Milly Licata and Julia Dray, for their contributions to the implementation of the study; the Clinical Midwife Educators in each of the health sectors, Brendon Williams, Sophie Curtin, and Debra White; the Maternal Alcohol Cultural Review Group in reviewing the final manuscript; and Brydie McEvoy for assisting with manuscript formatting.</p></ack><fn-group><title>Abbreviations</title><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>AUDIT-C, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption; CATI, Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec25"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because data is housed with the authors following ethical approval.
