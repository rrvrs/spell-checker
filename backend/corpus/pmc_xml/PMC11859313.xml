Evidence suggests that ASD &#x00026; psychosis present with overlapping clinical features &#x00026; cognitive symptoms leading to misdiagnosis (Trevisan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> Front.Psych 2020;11:548). Clinicians encounter diagnostic dilemma during assessment of psychosis in adolescents with ASD.</p></sec><sec id="sec4830"><title>Objectives</title><p>To discuss the clinical challenges in the assessment &#x00026; treatment of young people with ASD &#x00026; comorbid psychosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4831"><title>Methods</title><p>A case report of a young girl with ASD &#x00026; comorbid psychotic illness.</p></sec><sec id="sec4832"><title>Results</title><p>A young girl with ASD was admitted to CAMHS inpatient Unit with unusual beliefs &#x00026; perceptual disturbances. She reported hearing the voice of &#x02018;Hydrogis&#x02019; who was talking to her about his girlfriend. She made a voodoo doll &#x00026; tried to set it on fire, as she believed that this would kill the girlfriend. She also heard voices of characters from a TV show, discussing her in third person. She absconded from home due to the distress associated. She attempted suicide by tying a ligature. She was seen responding to external stimuli, laughing incongruously &#x00026; was thought disordered. Despite never being to USA, she spoke in American accent. She lacked insight &#x00026; struggled to differentiate reality from fantasy. The aim of admission was to determine if the symptoms were part of ASD or a psychotic disorder. She had medication free assessment but continued to be very distressed. We commenced Aripiprazole which was optimised. She responded well to the treatment &#x00026; was discharged to the care of Early Intervention in Psychosis team with partial remission of symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec4833"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Historically psychotic illnesses &#x00026; ASD were thought to be closely linked. Research suggest that they are two separate disorders with specific onset, progress, signs &#x00026; symptoms. ASD might be misdiagnosed as psychosis as difficulties in communication may resemble thought disorder, &#x02018;melt down&#x02019; may mimic catatonia &#x00026; difficulties in recognising others&#x02019; intentions may mimic paranoia. Our patient was experiencing first episode psychosis in late adolescence. This age of onset is consistent with research findings. A study to differentiate between ASD &#x00026; psychosis found that positive symptoms like hallucinations &#x00026; delusions were suggestive of psychosis while odd emotional gestures, stereotyped speech &#x00026; restricted interests indicated ASD. Our patient predominantly had positive symptoms of delusions, hallucinations &#x00026; thought disorder, hence our diagnosis of psychotic episode. In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate childhood fantasies from delusional beliefs (Ribolsi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> Front.Psych 2022;13:768586). Bleuler explains that children with ASD replace imperfect realities with imaginations &#x00026; hallucinations but Michael Rutter claims that autistic children lack fantasy. There are varying views on this subject &#x00026; this is the challenge we faced when treating this young person.</p></sec><sec id="sec4834"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
