Shortly before, frequent &#x0201c;d&#x000e9;j&#x000e0; vu&#x0201d; crises had also begun. Additional imaging tests (CT and cranial MRI) had been performed privately, which had been normal, and an EEG with sleep deprivation had been requested, but the patient had not attended.</p><p>For 8 years he had started various successive antidepressant treatments that had always been ineffective or had produced agitation, which was diagnosed as akathisia, after a week of treatment. In a single previous hospital admission, with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disorder finally ruled out, he was discharged apparently asymptomatic, and was readmitted after making three new successive serious attempts at self-lysis a week after discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec8844"><title>Methods</title><p>Throughout this hospitalization (37 days), a practically invariable mental state is observed from the first day in which only rambling thoughts with very limited content stand out, with permanent and apparently credible criticism regarding previous self-harming behaviors, without appearance of new impulses or self-harming behaviors and reporting a significant decrease in the frequency and emotional impact of &#x0201c;d&#x000e9;j&#x000e0; vu&#x0201d; type crises, which are now limited to the moment of waking up in the afternoon, after a brief nap, and occasionally.</p></sec><sec id="sec8845"><title>Results</title><p>He was discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of post-concussive syndrome (ICD 10-F0.78.2) and remains stable for the moment (one month later) in improvement, maintaining anxiolytic and antidepressant treatment, as well as anticonvulsants, and pending continuation of the study for part of neurology.</p></sec><sec id="sec8846"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We think that this case shows how, within the immense etiological variety of suicidal behavior, there may be a cause conditioned exclusively by brain damage.</p></sec><sec id="sec8847"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
