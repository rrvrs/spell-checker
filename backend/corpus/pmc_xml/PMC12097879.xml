During her hospital course, she was found to have severe multi-endocrine dysfunction as evidenced by persistent hypotension, bradycardia, and intermittent hypothermia with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and diabetes insipidus, which were confirmed by laboratory testing. Due to the patient&#x02019;s hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction along with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis of unknown etiology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was ordered. The MRI demonstrated a large, heterogeneously enhancing mass centered in the hypothalamus and infiltrating the pituitary stalk. This case stands out because of its diagnostic trajectory where investigating the cause of endocrine dysfunction revealed a cerebral neoplasm that contributed to the patient&#x02019;s development of cirrhosis. There is an established association between hepatic pathologies and hypothalamic masses with the proposed mechanism being deficiencies of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and consequently, triiodothyronine (T3). GH deficiency predisposes patients to hepatic steatosis while IGF-1 and T3 deficiencies leave the liver more vulnerable to oxidative damage. As such, cranial imaging and endocrine evaluation should be considered in young patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>cryptogenic cirrhosis</kwd><kwd>growth hormone deficiency</kwd><kwd>hypothalamic mass</kwd><kwd>insulin-like growth factor-1 deficiency</kwd><kwd>panhypopituitarism</kwd><kwd>thyroid hormone receptor beta</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While common etiologies of end-stage liver disease include chronic alcohol use, metabolic disease, viral infection, autoimmune processes, and toxin ingestion, there is a subset of patients diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis, in which there is no obvious driving force despite extensive workup [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

The patient had followed up regularly with a hepatology clinic and had undergone extensive diagnostic workup for her liver&#x000a0;including biopsy, magnetic resonance elastography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. There was no evidence of steatosis or autoimmune, genetic, alcoholic, or infectious etiologies. Mild hepatic iron deposition was observed on pathology obtained from the liver biopsy, but subsequent testing was not consistent with hemochromatosis. Her alpha-fetoprotein level was minimally elevated at 7.71 IU/mL. Other mild elevations were noted in angiotensin-converting enzyme (94 U/L), alpha-1-antitrypsin (233 mg/dL), and ceruloplasmin (46 mg/dL). Interestingly, at the time of diagnosis, her C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly elevated at 206 mg/L with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 41 mm/h. Additional laboratory tests that were within normal limits included: antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, liver-kidney microsomal antibody, anticentromere antibody, immunoglobulins A/E/G/M, and both chronic and acute viral hepatitis testing (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Previous hepatology workup</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Laboratory test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Result</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference range</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hereditary hemochromatosis DNA analysis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wild-type</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wild-type (no mutations of HFE C282Y, H63D, and S65C)</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alpha-fetoprotein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.71 IU/mL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;7.22 IU/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Angiotensin-converting enzyme</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">94 U/L</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14-82 U/L</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alpha-1-antitrypsin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">233 mg/dL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100-188 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ceruloplasmin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">46 mg/dL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.0-39.0 mg/dL</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C-reactive protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">206 mg/L</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;10 mg/L</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">41 mm/h</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0-20 mm/h</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antinuclear antibody</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antimitochondrial antibody</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;20.0 units</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;20.0 units</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anti-smooth muscle antibody</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 units</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0-19 units&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Liver-kidney microsomal antibody</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 units</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;20.0 units&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anticentromere antibody</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.2 AI</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0-0.9 AI&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Immunoglobulin A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">118 mg/dL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">87-352 mg/dL</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Immunoglobulin E</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">51 IU/mL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6-495 IU/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Immunoglobulin G</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,227 mg/dL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">586-1,602 mg/dL</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Immunoglobulin M&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83 mg/dL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">26-217 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatitis A antibodies</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatitis B surface antibody</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reactive</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e; 10 mIU/mL consistent with immunity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatitis B surface antigen</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatitis B core antibodies&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatitis C antibody</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.1 S/Co</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0-0.9 S/Co</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The patient had no evidence of varices but did have trace ascites with splenomegaly.

Her past surgical history was significant for rectopexy, colonoscopy, and liver biopsy. The patient denied any history of alcohol or tobacco use, and notable family history was limited to melanoma in her father and type II diabetes mellitus in her mother.</p><p>On initial evaluation, the patient&#x02019;s vitals were as follows: temperature of 35.2&#x000b0;C (95.3&#x000b0;F), heart rate of 72 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 91/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, and a body mass index of 33 kg/m2. She appeared pale and lethargic. There was no active rectal hemorrhage; therefore, she did not require acute interventions beyond resuscitation with packed red blood cell transfusions.</p><p>However, after adequate resuscitation, the patient remained hypothermic, hypotensive, and bradycardic despite a stable hemoglobin level. As a result, further workup was initiated including thyroid hormone testing and cortisol levels. The patient was found to have low&#x000a0;TSH (0.08 uIU/mL) (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), free thyroxine (T4) (0.37 ng/dL), and triiodothyronine (T3) (1.46 pg/dL) levels (Table <xref rid="TAB3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). At home, the patient was non-adherent with her levothyroxine regimen. Due to the inappropriately low TSH level in the absence of exogenous steroid use, the patient was diagnosed with central hypothyroidism. Her baseline cortisol and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were decreased at 3.7 &#x000b5;g/dL and 4.8 pg/mL, respectively. After ACTH stimulation testing, her cortisol levels appropriately increased to 105 &#x000b5;g/dL at 30 minutes and 81.8 &#x000b5;g/dL at one hour.

A computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated nodular infiltrates on the right and minimal ground-glass opacities. As such, it was thought that she had aspiration pneumonitis which was present on admission. However, on hospital day seven, the patient&#x02019;s respiratory status deteriorated, and she was in respiratory distress, desaturating to 60% after removing her oxygen delivery systems secondary to worsening mentation and agitation. Extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were evident on repeat chest x-rays, and she was subsequently intubated and started on empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy. At this time she was hypothermic at 30&#x000b0;C (86&#x000b0;F), bradycardic to thirty (bpm) with first-degree atrioventricular block, and hypotensive at 76/46 mmHg. The patient was started on stress dose steroids and intravenous levothyroxine with improvement in her hemodynamic markers. Therapy with twice daily 0.5 &#x000b5;g intravenous desmopressin was also initiated for central diabetes insipidus due to polyuria, hypernatremia (152 mmol/L), and decreased urine osmolality. After developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, the patient had a complex and lengthy hospital course. She underwent a diagnostic bronchoscopy, which was unrevealing. Initial extubation failed due to tracheal edema and negative pressure pulmonary edema requiring reintubation. Hepatic cirrhosis and protein-calorie malnutrition predisposed the patient to ventilator dependence ultimately necessitating placement of a tracheostomy. She was discharged to a long-term acute care facility where she continued to improve. Outpatient follow-up with neurosurgery and endocrinology were arranged for the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Though an uncommon occurrence, there have been reports of cirrhosis thought to be secondary to a mass in the hypothalamus [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This case is particularly unique in that the diagnosis of cirrhosis preceded identification of the neoplasm. As a direct consequence of her hypothalamic mass with involvement of the pituitary stalk, this patient effectively suffered from panhypopituitarism as evidenced by alterations in&#x000a0;both anterior and posterior pituitary hormones. Although her prolactin level was within normal limits, she had decreased production of ACTH, TSH, FSH/LH, and likely GH from the anterior pituitary. ADH and oxytocin from the posterior pituitary were not directly measured, but the patient clinically presented with central diabetes insipidus given her hypernatremia and low urine osmolality, which were corrected with desmopressin.</p><p>Due to the pulsatile release of GH, IGF-1, which is produced&#x000a0;in the liver, is often measured instead. The patient had decreased levels of IGF-1 with otherwise normal synthetic function of the liver; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she was deficient in GH [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A deficiency of IGF-1, as seen in this case, is hypothesized to contribute to chronic hepatic disease via progressive inflammation [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The development of liver disease is often preceded by metabolic dysfunction, resulting in the accumulation of free fatty acids within hepatocytes.&#x000a0;The formal insult occurs via the direct cytotoxic effects of free fatty acids, leading to oxidative stress from the reactive oxygen species generated by defective mitochondria [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While GH deficiency predisposes patients to hepatic steatosis, IGF-1 deficiency leaves the liver more vulnerable to oxidative damage [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which are catalyzed by lipotoxic species, cause&#x000a0;hepatic stellate cells to transition from producing type IV collagen to synthesizing types I and III collagens, resulting in fibrosis [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Biopsy findings consistent with this mechanism include decreased glutathione and glutathione peroxidase in hepatocytes with an increased ratio of oxidized glutathione to glutathione [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although these exact values were not measured in this patient, other inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP and ESR) were consistently elevated. Interestingly, studies have suggested that antioxidant activity observed on liver biopsy can be used as a prognostic factor in hepatic disease [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Thyroid hormones have also been shown to influence hepatic function, as thyroid hormone receptor-&#x003b2; (THR-&#x003b2;), which binds T3, is most prevalent in the liver and is important in reducing serum triglycerides [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. T3 promotes mitochondrial oxidation through a combination of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This process increases the &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids, ultimately leading to decreased lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].&#x000a0;Impairment of thyroid hormone signaling processes results in a cycle of repetitive liver injury. With chronic hepatic disease, there is decreased conversion of T4 to T3 by types I and II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1 and DIO2), and instead, there is an increased conversion of T4 to inactive reverse T3 by type III iodothyronine deiodinase. This shift favors the accumulation of lipotoxic species [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>These processes are mediated by the complex interplay between GH and thyroid hormones as DIO1 and DIO2 are stimulated by GH. Therefore, GH deficiency is associated with decreased conversion of T4 to T3, and thus, decreased activation of THR-&#x003b2; [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In patients with a baseline deficiency of both GH and TSH, there is a significant reduction in the conversion from T4 to T3 when compared to someone with an isolated GH deficiency. Ongoing investigation is currently underway regarding IGF-1 and THR-&#x003b2; agonists as therapeutic options [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case indicates the importance of strongly considering cranial imaging and endocrine hormone testing in patients with cirrhosis where the underlying cause of liver damage is unknown, and when the degree of fibrosis is in excess of what would be expected at the patient&#x02019;s age at presentation. It also sheds light on the potential importance of IGF-1 and emphasizes that although IGF-1 is a marker of cirrhosis, the hormone is protective for the liver. Deficiency of the hormone at baseline can predispose patients to the future development of cirrhosis. Additionally, the role of thyroid hormone signaling in the progression of hepatic injury as well as the intricate feedback amongst major endocrine axes is the current focus of many clinical trials targeting the management of non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Previous studies have observed the development of liver disease in patients with known hypothalamic tumors. However, this patient demonstrates that the reverse may also be true, and that the diagnosis of cirrhosis can precede identification of the brain mass.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Holly N.
