</self-uri><abstract><p>Understanding the responses of marine organisms to environmental changes at their distribution limits is crucial for predicting climate-change associated habitat changes. This study analyzed the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on the temporal distribution of Chum salmon (<italic toggle="yes">Oncorhynchus keta</italic>) in the eastern and southern coastal waters of Korea (ESCK) and on the southern limit of their distribution in the North Pacific. The temporal distribution of Chum in the ESCK and adjacent rivers was statistically compared based on three SST types (T1&#x02013;T3). Chum were first caught in the northern and then in the southern area, with riverine migration occurring faster in the south than in the north. These migration patterns did not change with SST type. There was no significant difference in the coastal arrival timing of the Chum between T1 and T3, which respectively represented the entire region cooling either rapidly or slowly compared to an average year. In T2, in which the north cooled rapidly and the south cooled slowly, the coastal arrival timing was approximately 4 days earlier compared to T1 and T3. Moreover, as the SST type shifted from T1 to T3, the coastal residence time in the north became shorter, while in the south became longer. These findings help us to understand the adaptation strategies of Chum, and to predict changes in their distribution and resources in the North Pacific under climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Recently, marine ecosystems have been affected by environmental changes due to global warming, such as the poleward shift of subtropical waters and strengthened stratification [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These changes have caused the suitable temperature habitats of marine organisms to shift poleward [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], increased thermal stress [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and enhanced metabolic activity [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These shifts have led to changes in the ecological characteristics of marine life, such as their distribution, phenology, movement, and behavioral traits, as they adapt to the changing environmental conditions. Specifically, they are expanding their distribution range poleward by an average of 30.6 km per decade and increasing their average spawning and blooming period by 4.4 days per decade [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,146,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Anadromous fishes, such as Salmonidae, must respond and adapt to environmental changes in both freshwater and marine ecosystems throughout their life cycles. During their extensive migration, anadromous fish are frequently exposed to environments that vary in intensity with climate change, such as the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the North Pacific, anadromous fishes have reacted sensitively to recent environmental changes, leading to increased abundance of pink salmon in the northern Bering Sea, improved survival rates of Salmonidae in Alaska, decreased survival rates of Pink, Chum, and Sockeye salmon in Washington and British Columbia [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the early spawning and redistribution of Chinook salmon in the northeastern Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Chum salmon (<italic toggle="yes">Oncorhynchus keta</italic>) is an anadromous fish that plays a critical role in energy transfer between terrestrial, riverine, and marine ecosystems throughout its life. Water temperature is a significant environmental factor that affects the migration timing and distribution of Chum [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. According to the poleward expansion of warm water masses, favorable habitats extend towards the Arctic Ocean [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and warming of these habitats accelerates the growth and maturation of Chum [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These environmental changes have led to variations in the physiological and ecological characteristics of Chum. For instance, in Alaska, the timing of spawning migrations has advanced by more than two weeks and has become more synchronized across different rivers [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There has also been an increase in the number of Chum spawning in the rivers of the Alaskan Arctic [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the responses of Chum to temperature changes have primarily been studied in high-latitude regions, a lack of understanding of these responses along the distributional limits of Chum remains.</p><p>Coastal waters are crucial habitats for Chum as they transition between two ecosystems with different environmental characteristics. During spawning migration, when warm water is distributed in the upper coastal water layers, Chum move to deep water layers to control their energy expenditure and maturation rates. They remain in these waters for an extended period and repeatedly move vertically to check the upper water temperature and navigate to their natal river using river signals [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The amount of time Chum spend in these deeper layers and their vertical movements in coastal waters influence the timing of their riverine migration [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The timing of this migration affects the hatching time and the growth environment of subsequent generations, thereby affecting their survival [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Countries bordering the North Pacific have long recognized the importance of understanding Chum response strategies to coastal environmental changes to predict changes in their distribution, resource abundance, and return patterns. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted on the relationships between coastal environmental changes, such as changes in coastal water temperature and riverine water inflow, and the movement and distribution patterns of Chum [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The eastern and southern coastal waters of Korea (ESCK) represent the southernmost distribution limits of Chum in the North Pacific. Uniquely in the ESCK, Chum, which prefers cold water and avoids radical environmental changes, migrates to various regions for spawning. These regions include the eastern coastal waters of Korea (ECK), where the boundaries between the warm and cold-water masses are distributed, and the southern coastal waters of Korea (SCK), where warm water masses influence even the deeper layers [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Because Chum must migrate from the coast to rivers through the upper coastal layers, the continuous return of Chum to the ESCK and its adjacent rivers, where warm water masses are distributed in the upper layers, incites curiosity. The ECK is the region within the ESCK where Chum is most abundantly distributed [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The ECK is strongly influenced by the Tsushima Warm Current in the upper layers, has cold water masses persistently distributed in the deeper layers, and features a subpolar front around 37&#x000b0;&#x02013;38&#x000b0; latitude [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This creates a diverse set of environmental conditions within a relatively narrow space compared to higher-latitude regions, such as Alaska and the Kamchatka Peninsula. The high concentration of Chum in the ECK is believed to be related to its unique environmental characteristics, specifically the year-round presence of cold-water masses (&#x0003c;15 &#x000b0;C) at depths of 30&#x02013;50 m (<xref rid="pone.0317917.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>The environmental conditions in the ESCK have changed with climate change, including an increase in sea surface temperature (SST) by about 1.5 &#x000b0;C compared to that in the past [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], strengthened stratification [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and increasing frequency of events such as marine heat waves [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Accordingly, these changes have led to an environment that is increasingly unfavorable for spawning-migrating Chum. Despite these changes, the number of returning Chum, which significantly declined in the late 1990s, has steadily increased from the early 2000s to the present [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; (<xref rid="pone.0317917.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). This raises various questions regarding the adaptive strategies of Chum to environmental changes in the ESCK and potential future changes in their distribution and resource abundance.</p><p>Studies on Chum ecology in the ESCK have mainly focused on the ECK and have aimed to identify the environmental factors influencing the migration and behavioral characteristics of spawning-migrating Chum in each region [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Studies have found that Chum in the ECK migrate to rivers when the SST decreases to below 20 &#x000b0;C, during high tides when the estuarine space expands, and during spring tides when the mixing between the upper and lower coastal layers is enhanced [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These findings suggest that the migration and behavioral patterns of Chum vary according to vertical temperature distribution and tidal changes. However, spawning-migratory Chum must encounter diverse and changing environmental conditions in the ESCK to allow them to navigate to their natal river, which suggests that their responses to environmental changes may vary depending on the specific spawning sites they return to.</p><p>In this study, SST was considered the primary environmental factor influencing the migration of spawning-migratory Chum. We hypothesized that SST changes influence not only the timing of coastal arrival but also the duration of delay in coastal waters before river entry, thereby affecting the overall migration timing and patterns in the ESCK and its adjacent rivers. To elucidate this, the distribution of SST in the ESCK was divided into three types, and the timing of spawning-migratory Chum migrating to the ESCK and its adjacent rivers was compared for each environmental type. Studying Chum responses to marine environmental changes in the ESCK, which displays threshold conditions for Chum, is crucial for understanding their responses and adaptation strategies to the distributional shift of warm water masses. Additionally, this study provides valuable data for predicting future changes in the distribution and resource abundance of Chum in the North Pacific region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>Chum return to the ECK and SCK in the ESCK between October and December (<xref rid="pone.0317917.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In the lower reaches of seven rivers in the ECK and one river in the SCK, catching and population checks were conducted almost daily using fishing gear installed for Chum return rate analysis and artificial propagation. Additionally, at the ports in each region, the daily number of individuals caught by the set and gill nets in the ESCK was recorded. Coastal fishing activities were also conducted almost daily during the season when Chum return to spawn. It is important to note that fishing activities were not limited to specific locations or vessels; instead, the data were collected across a range of areas within each region, with samples considered to be randomly distributed. While fishing efforts might not have occurred consistently at the same locations, this variability was treated as a random error in the dataset.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0317917.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0317917.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of the study area, showing the eastern coastal waters of Korea (ECK) and southern coastal waters of Korea (SCK), collectively referred to as the eastern and southern coastal waters of Korea (ESCK).</title><p>The study area in the ESCK was divided into the northern and southern areas based on latitude 37&#x000b0; N.

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the optimal equation for analyzing coastal arrival timing and residence time (<xref rid="pone.0317917.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The AIC value indicates the fit and complexity of a model equation, with lower AIC values signifying a better fit and lower complexity.

In the LME analysis, SST distribution type was used as a fixed effect. The region was either used as an interaction term in the fixed effect, used as a random effect, or not used at all. The dependent variables were the coastal arrival timing and residence time. Coastal arrival timing was defined as the median date of migration (MDMT) at the ESCK, determined as the date when more than 50% of the total number of Chum were caught between October and December each year. The coastal residence time was defined as the relative time difference between the MDMT at the ESCK and the MDMT in adjacent rivers. Various equations used were as follows: (1) The MDMTs from CR1 to CR6 are almost same, but MDMT varies according to SST distribution type, (2) MDMTs vary across regions, but the magnitude of variation in MDMT across SST distribution types is consistent across all regions (e.g., MDMT gradually shifts later from CR1 to CR6, but under SST distribution type T1, MDMT is consistently 3 days earlier across all regions compared to other types), and (3) MDMTs vary by region and depend on the SST type, i.e., in some regions, MDMT under SST type T1 occurs 3 days later than under T2 and 4 days earlier than under T3, while in other regions, MDMT under T1 occurs 5 days earlier than under T2 and 4 days earlier than under T3 (<xref rid="pone.0317917.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0317917.t001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0317917.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) results of the linear mixed-effects model (LME) for each equation regarding the median date of migration timing (MDMT) of Chum in the ESCK and adjacent rivers.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0317917.t001" id="pone.0317917.t001g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Equation</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AIC (Coastal)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AIC (Riverine)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1) <inline-formula id="pone.0317917.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0317917.e001" id="pone.0317917.e001g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">439.87</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">237.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(2) <inline-formula id="pone.0317917.e002"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0317917.e002" id="pone.0317917.e002g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M2" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">426.98</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">236.39</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(3) <inline-formula id="pone.0317917.e003"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0317917.e003" id="pone.0317917.e003g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M3" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">431.68</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">233.75</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analyses: non-linear regression</title><p>Nonlinear regression analysis (NLA) was conducted on the SST and the coastal and riverine migration volume by date in each region to determine how the preferred environment differs when Chum migrates to the ESCK and adjacent rivers based on the SST distribution type.

The Chum was first caught in the northern area and then gradually through the southern area. Additionally, while the coastal arrival timing and residence time of the Chum varied according to the SST distribution type in each region, the migration patterns derived from the regions in which they were first caught remained unchanged. This suggests that Chum migrates progressively from the northern to the southern area.</p><p>The timing of Chum coastal arrival was advanced or delayed to a similar scale across all regions of the ESCK depending on the SST distribution type. There were no significant differences between types T1 and T3, and the entire ESCK cooled down either early or late. This is probably because the consistent cold water in the deep layers of the ESCK minimized the thermal challenges for Chum migrating southward, resulting in a relatively stable migration pattern. However, in type T2, the northern area cooled early, the southern area cooled late, and the coastal arrival timing was significantly earlier by approximately 4 days compared to T1 and T3 types across all regions of the ESCK. This is likely due to a Chum migration strategy to avoid abrupt temperature changes during spawning migration in environments with significant temperature differences, such as those between the northern and southern area under these conditions.</p><p>During their spawning migration, Chum may die from heat shock or develop gonadal disorders when they encounter radical changes in water temperature [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. To mitigate this risk, Chum adopt a variety of strategies under radical environmental changes, such as staying longer in consistently cold deep layers or moving rapidly from the coastal waters to the river [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A subpolar front is distributed between approximately 37&#x000b0;&#x02013;38&#x000b0; N in the ESCK, resulting in rapid vertical and horizontal temperature changes [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Chum returning to spawn in the ESCK primarily migrate southward, originating from northern areas [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the ESCK, Chum in the northern area are unlikely to detect the environmental conditions in the distant southern area, stop their southward migration, and move into northern rivers. Similarly, under T2 conditions, it is improbable for Chum to reverse their migration northward after encountering the thermal boundary where cold and warm water masses meet. Instead, our findings suggest an alternative behavioral strategy. As Chum approaches the thermal boundary, they may adopt one of two responses: (a) continue migrating southward rapidly, enduring the stress of high temperatures and abrupt thermal changes, reach their natal river, or (b) halt their southward migration near the subpolar front and move into non-natal northern rivers adjacent to this thermal boundary.</p><p>Under T2 conditions in the ESCK, if the Chum adopt behavioral strategy (a), described above, coastal arrival migration will be concentrated in environments akin to T1 in the north and T3 in the south, as they migrate southward, regardless of the SST distribution type. However, if strategy (b) is adopted, some Chum that would have migrated to the southern area may instead move to the northern area adjacent the thermal boundary when the upper layers of the southern area are warm. This would lead to an increased concentration of Chum migration in high-temperature environments in the northern area compared to the patterns under conditions similar to T1. Subsequently, the number of Chum moving to the southern area would decrease when the upper layer of the southern area became cold, resulting in a concentrated increase in coastal arrival migration in high-temperature environments in both the southern and northern area.</p><p>When the ESCK is under T2 conditions, the volume of migrating Chum arriving in coastal waters in the north adjacent the thermal boundary (such as CR3) will be concentrated in high-temperature environments (about 18&#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C), unlike the situation under T1 conditions. In the south adjacent the thermal boundary (such as CR4), the migration volume will be concentrated in high-temperature environments (20&#x02013;21 &#x000b0;C), unlike the situation under T3 conditions. This suggests that under T2 conditions, some of the Chum heading south to spawn chose to move to northern rivers adjacent the thermal boundary instead to reduce the stress caused by radical changes in water temperature and to increase their spawning success. According to this strategy, under T2 conditions, the return rate of Chum to northern rivers adjacent the thermal boundary would be higher than that in an average year, while the return rate to southern rivers would be lower. The strategy in which some Chum enter to non-natal rivers affects genetic diversity, distribution changes, ecosystem stability, resource management, and evolutionary perspectives [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This includes facilitating genetic exchanges between populations, pioneering new habitats, and maintaining ecosystem stability [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>If, in the future, we study differences in Chum movement and behavior by SST distribution type focusing on the return rate rather than migration timing, we can better understand Chum climate change responses and adaptation strategies. This approach would provide useful data for predicting Chum distribution and resource fluctuations in the North Pacific.</p><p>Chum spent less time in the coastal waters of the southern area compared to the northern one. Although the overall pattern of coastal residence time between the northern and southern areas remained consistent, the direction and extent of change (shortening or extending) varied depending on the SST distribution type. Coastal residence time in the northern area was shorter under T3 compared to T1 or T2, while it was longer in the southern area. In environments where Chum primarily entered rivers, the coastal residence time in the northern area progressively decreased with higher temperatures from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3. In contrast, in the southern area, the coastal residence time remained relatively stable within a consistent temperature range of approximately 19&#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C. This efficient adjustment of coastal residence time by Chum in the ESCK, where various environmental conditions present, is believed to reflect their behavioral strategies to align their river entry timing with optimal reproductive maturation at their spawning grounds.</p><p>Chum metabolism accelerates, and energy is quickly consumed, in high-temperature environments [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Because Chum rarely feed during spawning migration, the presence of high-temperature water in the upper layer during their migration increases the time they stay in the deep cold-water layers and the frequency of their vertical movement [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Chum returning to the northern rivers may travel relatively short distances compared to those returning to the southern rivers, expend less energy as they move through cold waters, and arriving in the coastal waters while still immature [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In contrast, Chum returning to southern rivers travel further and, as they move through warmer waters, expend more energy, arriving at coastal waters in an imminent spawning state [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>As coastal waters cool more rapidly, Chum returning to northern rivers may benefit from staying in the coastal waters longer to increase their metabolism, rather than migrating directly to the rivers [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This is because these rivers are usually colder than the coastal waters during the spawning season. Chum returning to the southern rivers expend a substantial amount of energy and arrive in the coastal waters in an imminent spawning state; therefore, it may be advantageous for them to move quickly to the rivers shortly after the upper layers cool down [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. For this reason, Chum returning to northern rivers and arriving at the coast in an immature state are likely to spend less time in the coastal waters, as prolonged high temperatures in the upper coastal layers accelerate their gonadal development. Conversely, Chum returning to southern rivers, despite having mature gonads, are likely to spend more time in the coastal waters owing to the challenging conditions in coastal waters.</p><p>In this study, we could not analyze the gonadal maturity of the Chum in each of the coastal water and river regions. However, future studies comparing the maturity of Chum upon their arrival in coastal waters and immediately after entering the rivers in different regions will provide a deeper understanding of their response strategies to the distribution of warm water masses in the northern and southern area.</p><p>Our findings provide significant implications for the development of resource management and conservation strategies for Chum salmon. For example, the differences in migration patterns according to SST distribution types could be utilized to adjust fishing schedules or implement fishing bans in specific areas. Currently, a uniform fishing ban period is applied across all regions, regardless of regional differences in migration timing or environmental conditions. However, our findings suggest that fishing ban periods could be adjusted based on environmental patterns and the unique characteristics of each region. Considering the observed variations in migration strategies between the northern and southern regions, it is crucial to establish region-specific management strategies that address the unique environmental conditions and behavioral responses of Chum salmon in each area. By tailoring conservation measures to regional dynamics, resource sustainability and population resilience can be better ensured.</p><p>As global warming, Chum resource management is shifting from increasing release volumes to enhancing early-life survival rates of Chum [<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0317917.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Historically, Chum releases followed fixed schedules, disregarding coastal environmental variability, but future strategies should instead optimize release timing based on regional conditions and SST patterns. Expanding studies to include early-life stages would provide valuable insights for sustainable management and ecosystem health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the ESCK, which represents the southernmost distribution of spawning Chum, Chum migrate progressively southward from the northern area, and their coastal arrival timing and residence time vary according to SST distribution. In the ESCK, the temperature difference between the northern and southern areas was a significant environmental factor that influenced the arrival timing of Chum. The arrival time was accelerated when the temperature difference between these regions increased. In rivers adjacent to the ESCK, the distribution period of warm water in the upper coastal layers near the rivers is an important environmental factor affecting the coastal residence time of Chum. The longer the high SST persisted, the shorter the coastal residence time of Chum in the northern area, whereas their coastal residence time increased in the southern area. These findings enhance our understanding of how the poleward shift in warm water masses associated with climate change influences salmon migration and behavioral patterns.</p></sec><sec id="sec014" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0317917.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Years corresponding to each coastal seawater temperature distribution type.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0317917.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0317917.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>AIC results for each nonlinear regression equation (polynomial, exponential, and logistic) between Chum coastal arrival timing and coastal sea surface water temperature by type of sea surface water temperature distribution and region.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0317917.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0317917.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>AIC results for each nonlinear regression equation (polynomial, exponential, and logistic) between the coastal residence time and coastal sea surface water temperature by type of sea surface water temperature distribution and region.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0317917.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0317917.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Results of the polynomial regression model between Chum coastal arrival timing and coastal sea surface water temperature by region and type of sea surface water temperature distribution.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0317917.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0317917.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Results of the polynomial regression model between coastal residence time of Chum and coastal sea surface water temperature by region and type of sea surface water temperature distribution.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0317917.s005.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0317917.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Long-term variations of annual mean vertical temperature distribution in each region (CR1&#x02013;CR6).</title><p>The x-axis represents the years, the y-axis represents the depth, and the colors indicate temperature.

However, the manuscript requires significant revisions to meet publication standards, particularly in terms of experimental rigor, statistical analysis, and clarity in presenting conclusions. One key area for improvement is the framing of the research question. By refining and more clearly defining the objectives, the authors can better select appropriate statistical methods that align with their hypothesis, resulting in a stronger and more cohesive analysis. A well-defined hypothesis will help focus the statistical approach and improve the alignment of results with the study&#x02019;s goals.</p><p>Moreover, while SST is a critical factor influencing marine species distribution, other environmental variables such as ocean currents, salinity, and nutrient availability also play a substantial role in shaping the migration patterns of Chum salmon. The current study appears to treat SST as a standalone variable, which could oversimplify the complex interactions affecting salmon behavior. Expanding the analysis to incorporate these confounding variables, either through additional data collection or by referencing existing data, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind distribution shifts. If including these factors is not feasible, the authors should explicitly acknowledge them as limitations in the discussion to provide context for their findings.</p><p>Lastly, the conclusions could benefit from clearer presentation and stronger linkage to the study's objectives and data. Revisiting the narrative structure of the results section, with an emphasis on clarity and data relevance, would help ensure that the conclusions are well-supported by the data and leave a lasting impact. Additionally, visual aids such as multi-layered mapping or comparison charts could enhance the interpretation of results, making the observed relationships easier to understand. With these revisions, the study would be better positioned to offer a robust and scientifically sound analysis of the factors influencing Chum salmon migration patterns.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

They observed differences in coastal migration timing as a function of the difference in SST between northern and southern areas during the period of return migration, as well as differences in river timing as a function of regional temperature conditions. Understanding the potential for behavioural adaption as a result of changing climate is of particular interest for populations such as ESCK Chum salmon, which exist at the southern end of their range.</p><p>While the authors pose an interesting research question, the conclusions drawn from their results seemed hypothetical and not always supported by their findings. I also found the level of description with respect to the data sources in the methods to be lacking, which contributed to some confusion in interpreting the results. The display of the results seem inconsistent between the coastal and river timing analyses, with different formatting and labelling applied to similar figures. I also had some concerns with respect to the appropriateness of the statistical analysis and feel like the authors could have investigated the key relationships underlying sea surface temperature and return migration timing using a more comprehensive approach.</p><p>Although the research topic is certainly relevant and the results show support for a relationship between ocean temperature conditions and Chum salmon migration behaviour, without major revisions I do not feel that the current article merits publication, in particular due to failure to meet standards related to &#x0201c;Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical standard and are described in sufficient detail&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by the data&#x0201d;. More clearly framing their research question may help the authors better refine their choice of statistical analysis and presentation of results to better support their original hypothesis.</p><p>For more detail regarding my decision and suggestions for major and minor revisions, please see below.</p><p>1. The study presents the results of original research.</p><p>While the authors acknowledge previous studies had shown a relationship between sea surface temperature and Korean Chum salmon migration, to the best of my knowledge, the exact type of relationships in the current publication have not been reported elsewhere.</p><p>2. Results reported have not been published elsewhere.</p><p>Not to my knowledge.</p><p>3. Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical standard and are described in sufficient detail.</p><p>I found the description of the underlying data sources in the paper to be lacking. In particular, it was unclear the location, number, and time period over which sea surface temperature data was collected. In addition, it would useful for the authors to address underlying assumptions resulting from the use of catch data as a proxy for abundance. For example, how did they standardise for changes in effort or catchability? I also found it strange that the river locations were referred to generically instead of actually naming, and providing some basics characteristics of, each system. For example, what is the relative return size of the Chum salmon population to each river? Are these all wild stocks? Hatchery? Or a combination? A figure showing historical coastal and river entry timing (e.g. year vs. timing) for each location would have also provided a useful baseline for understanding the underlying differences across locations, and across different sea surface temperature SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d;.</p><p>While the use of SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d; was interesting, I was still not clear as to how this particular characterisation of ocean conditions would be preferable to using a numerical indicator such as SST (or SST anomaly) averaged over a relevant time period (e.g. centred around peak historical migration timing). The authors do not clearly characterise how they defined a year as cooling faster or slower than average. I was also concerned about the limited sample size (3-years only) for &#x0201c;Type 1&#x0201d; conditions, and the fact that the timeseries ended in 2018. If the author&#x02019;s want to continue with the current SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d; as defined in the current study, I think they need to:</p><p>(a) better justify their approach for defining alternative SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d;</p><p>(b) more clearly explain how the metrics to define each &#x0201c;type&#x0201d; was calculated</p><p>(c) consider the trade-offs between using a categorical variable as opposed to a numerical representation of ocean temperature conditions</p><p>I was also unclear on the author&#x02019;s definition of river entry timing. On L. 180-181, the authors state: &#x0201c;The river entry timing in each region was determined as the period between the MDMT of the ESCK and that of the adjacent river&#x0201d;. I interpreted this to mean that the river timing was being represented as the relative difference between arrival in coastal areas and arrival into the river. I presume this is because river entry timing is a function of both coastal arrival timing AND how long fish delay in coastal areas before entering the river, and the authors were more interested in the latter. i.e. assess whether fish were delaying longer in coastal areas before migrating upstream. However, subsequent wording in the body of the report and in the figures seemed to suggest that the analyses were performed directly on the median arrival timing into the river.</p><p>Given that a large part of the focus on the results was on latitudinal differences in responses to changing temperature, particularly for river timing, I also wonder if the authors considered using the latitude of each river mouth as a continuous variable as opposed to the fixed location definitions.</p><p>The author&#x02019;s used AIC to select across fixed model types. Another option would have been to apply a step-wise AIC to the most complex model form. Given the small sample sizes in some groupings (e.g. only 3 years of data for SST Type &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;; only 4 locations used for river timing analysis) and the appearance of unequal variances in some of the figures, I wonder if the authors considered any failure of underlying model assumptions for their linear analysis. I also did not see any major advantage in the non-linear analysis in terms of supporting the authors results. The main question the authors appeared to be asking is if the peak river migration varied as a function of SST. This could be done much more simply, and potentially grouped together with the linear analysis by including SST associated with the median timing date as a variable in the model.</p><p>I did not find the non-linear analysis to provide a lot of additional useful information. My main interpretation of the resulting figures was that the peak migration tends to be associated with a narrow temperature range for a given river system, with coastal and river timing for northern systems being associated with cooler SSTs than for southern systems. I think this relationship could be illustrated more simply by plotting median timing vs. SST associated with median timing. The histograms are useful in that they illustrate that there is some capacity for adaptation in that the salmon do enter the coastal or river systems over a range of temperatures. But maybe the authors could include a vertical line illustrating the peak timing of migration with a label showing the associated SST. The AIC values for the northern rivers also appeared to be much higher, on average, than for the southern rivers which also raises the question of how useful this analysis was for the northern systems.</p><p>4. Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by the data.</p><p>There was some apparent inconsistency in the presentation of figures throughout the report, with differences in labelling and formatting between figures describing results for coastal vs. river temperatures. While the focus was on trends, and so relative differences are important, the current presentation masks the underlying differences in timing between northern and southern sites, which is referenced by the authors in the text, but would be more clear if the actual timing was displayed.</p><p>I found it challenging to link the patterns of earlier coastal arrival timing in both the north and south under Type T2 conditions to the explanations raised by the authors in the discussion. Some specific examples are provided below.</p><p>L. 345 &#x02013; 348. The authors state that earlier coastal timing under the type T2 SST scenario was because the Chum salmon are trying to avoid migration through abrupt temperature changes. However, it is unclear how southern temperatures would impact the timing into northern coastal areas if the fish migrate from the north into the south. If southern migrants strayed into northern rivers to avoid higher temperatures in the south, then potentially this could impact both abundance and timing in the north but the results are not produced in a clear way to support this argument.</p><p>L. 374-378. The authors discuss a change in fish abundance in the north vs. the south under type T2 SST conditions, but no analysis was shown to support this result.</p><p>L. 391-393. Authors state that timing into northern rivers was associated with higher temperatures as overall cooling patterns shifted from earlier to later. However, this does not seem supported by the results in Table S5, where the relationship isn&#x02019;t significant for CR1 or CR2 under T1, or in CR1 under T2.</p><p>The authors could have expanded more on how behavioural strategies between northern and southern systems may have been impacted because southern migrants are already dealing with warmer temperatures on average which are closer to the physiological limits for salmon than the conditions experienced by migrants in the north. It would also have been informative to tie the results and discussion back to statements in the introduction relating to improved returns to the ECSK even as environmental conditions have become less favourable. Is this because of adaptability? Or have there also been coincident declines in fisheries harvest contributing to this trend?</p><p>5. The article is presented in an intelligible fashion and is written in standard English.</p><p>Paper was difficult to follow in sections due to unclear definitions, changes in flow between methods and results, and inconsistency in figure labelling. For example, the term &#x0201c;region&#x0201d; was sometimes used to describe individual rivers and at other times to describe the northern/southern aggregations of study sites. The term &#x0201c;advanced&#x0201d; timing could also be interpreted as fish arriving either earlier, or later, to a system.</p><p>6. The research meets all applicable standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity.</p><p>NA</p><p>7. The article adheres to appropriate reporting guidelines and community standards for data availability.</p><p>NA</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The article on the temporal distribution shifts of Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in relation to sea surface temperature (SST) changes provides valuable insights into how marine species respond to climate change. However, several aspects could be strengthened to enhance the study&#x02019;s rigor and its broader implications.</p><p>The focus on analyzing the impact of SST on Chum salmon migration is timely and relevant, yet the study appears to treat SST as a standalone variable without sufficiently considering other influential factors. For instance, changes in ocean currents, salinity, and nutrient availability are critical factors that can also impact the distribution and migration patterns of marine species. By not addressing these potential confounding variables, the study may oversimplify the complex interplay of factors affecting Chum salmon behavior.</p><p>I recommend modifying and updating the first statement of the introduction with given studies as [1,2] &#x0201c;Similar to agricultural ecosystems, climate change also impacts marine ecosystems [3]. Recently, marine ecosystems have been affected&#x02026;</p><p>[1] <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2024.103994" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2024.103994</ext-link></p><p>[2] <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.826838" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.826838</ext-link></p><p>[3] <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-822373-4.00024-0" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-822373-4.00024-0</ext-link></p><p>The categorization of SST into three types (T1&#x02013;T3) provides a structured approach to examining temperature variations. However, the definition of these categories appears somewhat arbitrary, with limited justification for why these specific types were chosen. It would be beneficial to clarify the criteria used to distinguish between rapid and slow cooling, especially given the potential variability in regional oceanic conditions.</p><p>While the study identifies a temporal shift in riverine entry timing based on SST changes, the conclusions could be more robust if supported by additional ecological data. For instance, the study could benefit from integrating biological factors such as the age structure of the salmon population, prey availability, and predator pressure, which might influence the observed migration patterns.</p><p>The lack of significant differences in coastal arrival timing between the T1 and T3 scenarios raises questions about the sensitivity of the analysis. The study could delve deeper into why these changes in SST, despite being categorized as rapid or slow cooling, did not produce observable effects on salmon arrival. A discussion on the potential buffering mechanisms that Chum salmon might possess against temperature fluctuations would provide a more comprehensive understanding.</p><p>The article presents its results as if they are directly applicable to predicting future climate change impacts on Chum salmon distribution. However, it does not account for the fact that SST is only one of many factors affected by global warming. The study's findings would be more meaningful if contextualized within broader climate change projections, such as ocean acidification or changes in seasonal precipitation patterns, which can also alter habitat suitability for salmon.</p><p>Additionally, while the study claims that the findings are useful for predicting changes in Chum distribution and resources in the North Pacific, it does not provide specific recommendations for fisheries management or conservation strategies. This is a missed opportunity to connect the research to actionable policy measures, especially given the importance of Chum salmon for both ecological systems and coastal communities.</p><p>Lastly, the article could be improved by expanding its geographical scope. Focusing solely on the eastern and southern coastal waters of Korea limits the generalizability of the results. Including data from other parts of the North Pacific could provide a more holistic view of the species&#x02019; adaptation strategies across their entire southern distribution range. some regional studies are suggested to incorporate and validate with your results in discussion section.</p><p>

They observed differences in coastal migration timing as a function of the difference in SST between northern and southern areas during the period of return migration, as well as differences in river timing as a function of regional temperature conditions.

We understand the concerns raised by the reviewer, including the lack of clarity in the research questions, insufficient explanation of data sources, inconsistencies in the presentation of results, and the issues regarding the statistical analysis approach. Based on this feedback, we have made significant revisions to address these issues.</p><p>First, to improve the clarity of the research questions, we revised the introduction and objectives sections to clearly present the hypotheses and goals of our study. This has enhanced the logical flow and analytical direction of the manuscript. Additionally, we provided more detailed descriptions of the sea surface temperature (SST) and catch data, including their collection methods and spatial and temporal scope, to strengthen the explanation of the data sources.</p><p>In the results section, inconsistencies in the labeling and formatting of visual materials have been addressed. This difference was caused by the different LME model equations that are best for analyzing the difference between coastal arrival times and coastal stay times by SST type. We revised the methods and results sections to clarify these differences and improve reader comprehension.</p><p>Regarding the statistical analysis, we re-evaluated the statistical approaches to ensure they appropriately support the main hypotheses of the study. We thoroughly validated the model assumptions and confirmed their suitability. Furthermore, we clarified the limitations of the analytical methods in the discussion section and proposed directions for future research.</p><p>Once again, we sincerely appreciate the valuable advice and feedback. We hope these improvements have contributed to significantly advancing the manuscript. Detailed answers to specific questions are provided below.</p><p>Q1) I found the description of the underlying data sources in the paper to be lacking. In particular, it was unclear the location, number, and time period over which sea surface temperature data was collected. In addition, it would useful for the authors to address underlying assumptions resulting from the use of catch data as a proxy for abundance. For example, how did they standardise for changes in effort or catchability? I also found it strange that the river locations were referred to generically instead of actually naming, and providing some basics characteristics of, each system.

A figure showing historical coastal and river entry timing (e.g. year vs. timing) for each location would have also provided a useful baseline for understanding the underlying differences across locations, and across different sea surface temperature SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d;.</p><p>A1) Thank you for your valuable feedback. In response to your suggestions, we have added detailed explanations regarding the sea surface temperature (SST) and catch data in the Materials and Methods section (L133&#x02013;138, L144&#x02013;146, L159&#x02013;164). The rivers CR1&#x02013;CR6 are areas where Chum are annually caught and released as part of hatchery programs. However, we cannot determine the exact proportion of individuals returning to each river that originate from hatcheries versus those that are wild. Additionally, we have included year-by-year data on the MDMT of Chum arriving at coastal waters and entering rivers in S4 Fig. We sincerely appreciate your insightful comments, which have greatly contributed to improving our study. Thank you again.</p><p>Q2) While the use of SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d; was interesting, I was still not clear as to how this particular characterisation of ocean conditions would be preferable to using a numerical indicator such as SST (or SST anomaly) averaged over a relevant time period (e.g. centred around peak historical migration timing). The authors do not clearly characterise how they defined a year as cooling faster or slower than average. I was also concerned about the limited sample size (3-years only) for &#x0201c;Type 1&#x0201d; conditions, and the fact that the timeseries ended in 2018. If the author&#x02019;s want to continue with the current SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d; as defined in the current study, I think they need to:</p><p>(a) better justify their approach for defining alternative SST &#x0201c;types&#x0201d;</p><p>(b) more clearly explain how the metrics to define each &#x0201c;type&#x0201d; was calculated</p><p>(c) consider the trade-offs between using a categorical variable as opposed to a numerical representation of ocean temperature conditions</p><p>A2) Thank you for your valuable feedback, which has greatly contributed to improving this study. The ESCK is characterized by the interaction of cold-water masses flowing southward from the north and warm water masses moving northward from the south, resulting in distinct SST distribution types along the coastline. As you mentioned, studying the relationship between SST and Chum migration timing is an interesting research topic, and we have submitted related work to another journal, which is currently under review. In this study, we focused on investigating how Chum returning to Korea respond to these SST distribution types.</p><p>The SST types in this study were defined as follows: T1 and T3 represent conditions where the northern and southern areas cool below 20&#x000b0;C around the same time. However, T1 indicates an earlier-than-average cooling, while T3 represents a later-than-average cooling. T2 reflects conditions where the northern area cools faster than the southern area, regardless of whether the cooling is earlier or later than the average. These definitions have been clarified and revised in L164-174.</p><p>Q3) I was also unclear on the author&#x02019;s definition of river entry timing. On L. 180-181, the authors state: &#x0201c;The river entry timing in each region was determined as the period between the MDMT of the ESCK and that of the adjacent river&#x0201d;. I interpreted this to mean that the river timing was being represented as the relative difference between arrival in coastal areas and arrival into the river. I presume this is because river entry timing is a function of both coastal arrival timing AND how long fish delay in coastal areas before entering the river, and the authors were more interested in the latter. i.e. assess whether fish were delaying longer in coastal areas before migrating upstream. However, subsequent wording in the body of the report and in the figures seemed to suggest that the analyses were performed directly on the median arrival timing into the river.</p><p>A3) Thank you for your valuable feedback. Based on your feedback, we have replaced the term "river entry timing" with "coastal residence time" throughout the manuscript (such as L197-198).</p><p>Q4) Given that a large part of the focus on the results was on latitudinal differences in responses to changing temperature, particularly for river timing, I also wonder if the authors considered using the latitude of each river mouth as a continuous variable as opposed to the fixed location definitions.</p><p>A4) Thank you for raising an important point. In this study, the "Regions" variable is defined based on latitude, from north to south, effectively reflecting changes in latitude. Additionally, we conducted supplementary analyses comparing the results of using latitude as a continuous variable versus the fixed location definitions (Regions). The results from both approaches were nearly identical, suggesting that the "Regions" variable sufficiently represents latitudinal variation and adequately explains the response patterns based on latitude, which is the main focus of this study. Therefore, we chose to retain the fixed location definitions in the final model to maintain clarity in interpretation.</p><p>Q5) The author&#x02019;s used AIC to select across fixed model types. Another option would have been to apply a step-wise AIC to the most complex model form. Given the small sample sizes in some groupings (e.g. only 3 years of data for SST Type &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;; only 4 locations used for river timing analysis) and the appearance of unequal variances in some of the figures, I wonder if the authors considered any failure of underlying model assumptions for their linear analysis. I also did not see any major advantage in the non-linear analysis in terms of supporting the authors results. The main question the authors appeared to be asking is if the peak river migration varied as a function of SST. This could be done much more simply, and potentially grouped together with the linear analysis by including SST associated with the median timing date as a variable in the model.</p><p>A5) Thank you for your valuable feedback. This study designed to analyze the response of Chum to sea temperature distribution types from a temporal distribution perspective using a simple and clear manner. To achieve this, SST types were treated as categorical variables, focusing on their primary effects rather than exploring additional variables or complex interaction effects. We compared three model equations that included SST types and their interactions with regions, and the best model was selected based on AIC. Employing a stepwise AIC approach to analyze a more complex initial model was considered beyond the scope of this study, as it did not align with our research focus. This approach was chosen to clearly identify the effects of SST distribution types and fulfill the study&#x02019;s objectives effectively.</p><p>Additionally, the interactions between SST types and regions were included as key explanatory variables in the analysis. The exclusion of more complex interactions or additional variables was an intentional decision to maintain consistency in study design and focus. While future research could explore these additional variables and expanded analyses, this study focused specifically on SST distribution types to ensure a clear understanding of their effects.</p><p>As you noted, the small sample size in some groups (e.g., three years of data for T1) is acknowledged. To address this, we utilized LME model and verified the normality and suitability during the analysis process, concluding that the model was appropriate for the data.</p><p>Q6) I did not find the non-linear analysis to provide a lot of additional useful information. My main interpretation of the resulting figures was that the peak migration tends to be associated with a narrow temperature range for a given river system, with coastal and river timing for northern systems being associated with cooler SSTs than for southern systems. I think this relationship could be illustrated more simply by plotting median timing vs. SST associated with median timing. The histograms are useful in that they illustrate that there is some capacity for adaptation in that the salmon do enter the coastal or river systems over a range of temperatures. But maybe the authors could include a vertical line illustrating the peak timing of migration with a label showing the associated SST. The AIC values for the northern rivers also appeared to be much higher, on average, than for the southern rivers which also raises the question of how useful this analysis was for the northern systems.</p><p>A6) Thank you for your valuable feedback. In this study, the nonlinear regression method was employed to compare the temperature ranges and catch patterns of Chum under different SST distribution types, providing insights into their behavioral strategies in coastal and river environments. Specifically, the analysis aimed to determine whether catches became more concentrated within specific temperature ranges as SST types progressed from T1 to T3, whether higher temperatures were uniquely associated with T2, or whether certain types exhibited evenly distributed catches across a variety of temperature ranges.</p><p>The nonlinear analysis revealed that the coastal arrival timing of Chum under T1 and T3 conditions was similar, while T2 showed ear</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0317917.s011" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0317917.s011.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0317917.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0317917.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pokkathappada</surname><given-names>Abdul Azeez</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Abdul Azeez Pokkathappada</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Abdul Azeez Pokkathappada</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0317917" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
