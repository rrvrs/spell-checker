These owls are also involved in a variety of human&#x02013;owl conflicts, including killing of domestic poultry, predating colonially nesting seabirds and shorebirds, and pose a hazard to safe aircraft operations. Managing these conflict situations presents unique challenges as great horned owls are nocturnally active and occupy a wide range of habitats. We evaluated information about great horned owl collisions with civilian aircraft and found this is a contemporary and growing aviation safety issue. We conducted a study to determine whether a biological (e.g., age of the bird) and logistical factors (e.g., month and translocation distance) influenced the return rate of great horned owls following a mitigation translocation from 13 civil airports and three military airfields during 2013&#x02013;2023. Great horned owls (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,020) were live-captured, banded, and translocated various distances from the airfields which were then monitored for returning owls. We developed a set of candidate binomial-distributed generalized linear models [involving all possible subsets of three factors (age, month, and distance translocated) as well as interactions]. The return rate of translocated great horned owls was very low (i.e., 2.6%) and we found no evidence that these biological and logistical factors influenced great horned owl homing behavior. Management programs that use release sites 40&#x02009;km from the conflict location and translocate individual owls only once would increase program efficacy by minimizing homing behavior and decreasing implementation costs.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Airports</kwd><kwd>Bird strikes</kwd><kwd><italic>Bubo virginianus</italic></kwd><kwd>Great horned owls</kwd><kwd>Management</kwd><kwd>Predation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>USDA Wildlife Services</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The great horned owl (<italic>Bubo virginianus</italic>) has the most extensive distribution of any owl in the Americas (Duncan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>; Artuso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>). Great horned owls are abundant in forested, grassland, desert, and anthropogenically altered (e.g., suburban and urban) landscapes (Artuso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>). They are generalist predators with one of the most diverse prey profiles of all North American raptors (Duncan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>). Great horned owls use a &#x02018;perch-and-pounce&#x02019; foraging strategy and are active nocturnally. These owls are non-migratory and breeding adults hold territories throughout the year (Holt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1996</xref>; Rohner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1996</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Human-wildlife conflicts occur worldwide and encompass a broad spectrum of situations where humans and/or wildlife directly or indirectly impact (or are perceived as impacting) one another, often involving human health, safety, and well-being, agricultural commodities, natural resources (especially those of cultural or ecological importance), infrastructure, or recreation (Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Nyhus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>, Conover and Conover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>). Great horned owls are involved in many human-raptor conflicts, including depredation of backyard domestic poultry (Washburn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>), predation upon colonial waterbirds and nesting shorebirds and seabirds (Catlin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Pollet and Shutler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>; Serr&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2023</xref>; Stantial et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2024</xref>), and human health and safety issues involving collisions with vehicles (e.g., cars, aircraft; Franson and Little <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>; Bishop and Brogan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>; Linnell and Washburn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). Also, great horned owls are formidable predators that can kill and eat other raptors, such as peregrine falcons (<italic>Falco peregrinus</italic>; Cade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1989</xref>; Craig and Enderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Dzialak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>), osprey (<italic>Pandion haliaetus</italic>; Ewins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1997</xref>; Artuso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>), and swallow-tailed kites <italic>(Elanoides forficatus</italic>; Coulson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). Such predation events can be costly to reintroduction programs with the goal of increasing raptor populations or expanding the range of those species.</p><p id="Par4">Of particular importance, great horned owls pose a hazard to safe aircraft operations at civilian airports and military airfields throughout North America. Among the 13 North American owl species that have been involved in aircraft strikes, great horned owls were the third most frequently struck species (Linnell and Washburn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). Great horned owls were ranked as the 30th riskiest species in a study of the economic risk of bird strikes with civilian aircraft associated with 76 bird species (DeVault et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). Similarly, Pfieffer et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2018</xref>) quantified and ranked avian hazards to military aircraft (more specifically from the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy) and listed great horned owls as the 24th most hazardous among the more than 100 bird species evaluated. A better understanding of great horned owl collisions with aircraft is needed to allow for the development of effective resolutions to this important issue.</p><p id="Par5">We queried the Federal Aviation Administration&#x02019;s National Wildlife Strike Database and found that during 1990&#x02013;2023, 407 great horned owl-aircraft collisions (an average of 12.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7 SE annually) were reported. Aircraft collisions involving this species increased by 2500% during the same time period. Great horned owl strikes occurred throughout the year, but 53% of these events occurred from September through December. Higher owl-aircraft strike rates during fall and early winter might be related to increased airfield use by great horned owls due to juvenile natal dispersal or adult post-breeding dispersal of adults. Among the 390 great horned owl strikes for which the specific geographic location could be determined, the states with the highest number of reported events were Colorado (25%), California (7%), Missouri (7%), and Texas (6%). Great horned owl strikes were also reported in 39 other states, although 15 or less strikes were reported per state. Forty-six of the great horned owl collisions with aircraft resulted in damage to the aircraft; the estimated total cost was more than $7.8 million USD. Almost all of these events resulted in mortality of the owls involved.</p><p id="Par6">Many tools, such as non-lethal hazing with pyrotechnics (Marsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1991</xref>), are valuable for managing avian hazards at airports during the daytime; however, these methods are not practical during the night when nocturnal species (e.g., great horned owls) are active. Consequently, few options are available for managing the risks to safe aircraft operations posed by great horned owls or to alleviate great horned owl predation upon threatened and endangered shorebirds. Mitigation translocation (i.e., the live-capture and translocation of individuals away from the location where the conflict is occurring) and lethal removal of problematic individuals (Baxter and Allan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>) are arguably the most practical methods available to resolve such conflicts.</p><p id="Par7">Mitigation translocation is commonly used in a wide array of human-wildlife conflict situations (Fischer, Lindenmeyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>; Sullivan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>). Translocating problematic wildlife is often perceived as a panacea for resolving human-wildlife conflicts and a large proportion of the public favors non-lethal management actions over lethal removals (Massei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>). Unfortunately, management programs involving mitigation translocations are typically conducted without any monitoring or means of determining whether actions were successful (Germano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>; Bradley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">No published information is available regarding the efficacy of great horned owl hazard management programs for reducing the abundance on and use of airfields by these birds and thus reducing the frequency of owl-aircraft collisions within airport environments. Effective, publicly-acceptable methods to reduce the hazards posed by great horned owls to aviation safety are needed. We conducted a study to increase our understanding of using mitigation translocation as a non-lethal wildlife damage management tool for reducing the frequency of great horned owl&#x02013;aircraft collisions.</p><p id="Par9">Based on our understanding of owl seasonal movements and land cover use (Rohner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1996</xref>; Artuso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>), we hypothesized that a biological factor (i.e., age of individual owls) and two logistical factors related to mitigation translocation events (i.e., month when the translocation occurred and the distance of the release site away from an airfield) would influence the frequency of homing behavior in great horned owls. We predicted that older birds would have higher return rates than younger birds and that translocating individual owls farther away from the capture location would reduce return rates due to increased energetic costs of flying longer distances. The objectives of our study were to: (1) determine return rates of great horned owls following a mitigation translocation, and (2) evaluate factors that might influence the return rate of translocated great horned owls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Areas</title><p id="Par10">We conducted this study within the states of California, Colorado, Iowa, and Missouri.

We used the age classification system employed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Bird Banding Laboratory. Hatching-year (HY) birds were between 6 weeks and 9 months old at the time of capture, second-year (SY) birds were between 9 and 21 months of age, and after-second-year (ASY) birds were &#x02265;22 months of age. Although great horned owls exhibit sexual dimorphism, accurately placing individuals into sex classes is not possible without genetic testing. Each live-captured great horned owl was banded with a standard USGS aluminum leg band.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mitigation Translocations</title><p id="Par16">Using a stratified random selection process to ensure relatively equal sample sizes, we assigned each owl to one of four pre-selected release location distance.

All great horned owls were held for &#x0003c;48&#x02009;h (from time of capture to release). We kept all owls under climate-controlled conditions, in individual cages, and with minimal human disturbance while in captivity. Release sites selected for use in this study were typically in an eastern or western direction from the airport or airbase. Release sites consisted of urban parks, golf courses, state wildlife management areas, and other greenspaces within both urbanized and rural landscapes. We ensured that all release sites located away from major interstate highways and airports.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Monitoring for Great Horned Owl Returns</title><p id="Par17">We define a great horned owl return as any situation where an individual owl was resighted (e.g., visually observed) or recovered (e.g., re-captured or found dead) at an airport or military airfield following a mitigation translocation event. Live-trapping activities for great horned owls were conducted on the airports and airbases from September 2013 (the start of this study) to March 2024 (one year after the marking phases of the project ended in March 2023). Biologists examined all great horned owls that were recaptured for the presence of a federal bird band (if possible) and recorded the identity of all known individuals in addition to other pertinent information (e.g., date, time, location).</p><p id="Par18">Great horned owls that returned to a civilian airport or military airfield following a mitigation translocation were managed according to predetermined, wildlife-damage management actions outlined within the facility&#x02019;s airport wildlife hazard management plan.

Initially, we used a generalized linear mixed model approach and included the location (i.e., airport) where an owl was live-captured as a random factor in all models. However, the random effect variance was essentially &#x02018;zero&#x02019; and thus we removed the random effect from all models for further analyses. We developed a set of candidate generalized linear mixed models (binomial distribution) fit with Laplace estimation [involving all possible subsets of three factors (age, month, and distance translocated) as well as interactions].</p><p id="Par20">We used Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criterion (AIC; Burnham and Anderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>) and whether explanatory coefficients in the selected model(s) were informative (i.e., 95% CIs did not overlap 0; Arnold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>) to evaluate the great horned owl return models.

Great horned owls colliding with civilian aircraft is a contemporary and growing aviation safety issue within the United States. Although great horned owl collisions with aircraft occurred in most U.S. states, Colorado, California, Missouri, and Texas had the highest frequencies of such events.</p><p id="Par30">Homing behavior of great horned owls after a mitigation translocation was limited and not influenced by the biological or logistical factors examined during our study. Interestingly, homing behavior (as determined by return rates) of great horned owls were considerably lower that what has been found for other raptors [e.g., burrowing owls (<italic>Athene cunicularia</italic>; Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2023</xref>), snowy owls (<italic>Bubo scandiacus</italic>; McCabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2022</xref>), red-tailed hawks (<italic>Buteo jamaicensis</italic>; Pullins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>; Washburn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>), and vultures (Galv&#x000e3;o Novaes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>)]. The return rate of great horned owls in our study (2.6%) was consistent with other efforts examining great horned owl mitigation translocation from airports in southern California (2.1%; Biteman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>) and at many airports across the USA (3.4%; Schafer and Washburn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>). We believe all of these estimates are conservative, as detection and identification of marked and unmarked nocturnally active owls can be very challenging and thus it is likely that not all owls that returned following a mitigation translocation were observed or recaptured.</p><p id="Par31">Interestingly, great horned owls translocated for a second time were more than 15 times more likely to return compared to after the initial translocation event. This finding is consistent with homing behavior patterns observed in red-tailed hawks and American kestrels (<italic>Falco sparverius</italic>) following a mitigation translocation. Pullins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>) found that the odds of a red-tailed hawk returning to an airport increased by a factor of 12 for each subsequent translocation event. Similarly, Washburn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2024</xref>) found that compared to an initial mitigation translocation, American kestrels were more than 10 times more likely to return following a second mitigation translocation.</p><p id="Par32">Relatively few (7.4%) great horned owls that returned to an airfield following a mitigation translocation did so within a month. Approximately 40% of the returning individuals did so after (apparently) being elsewhere for at least a year (and for one owl up to four years). Alternatively, it is possible that these owls returned to the airport environment but did not get recaptured until a later date. Interestingly, on average great horned owls took three times longer than red-tailed hawks (Pullins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>) and 9 times longer than American kestrels (Washburn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2024</xref>) to return to an airport following a mitigation translocation. Thus, not only did few great horned owls return but those that did took considerably longer to do so, consequently reducing the hazards to aviation posed by these individual owls.</p><p id="Par33">Over half of the great horned owl collisions with aircraft and two-thirds of the mitigation translocation events occurred during fall months, suggesting much of the airfield use by great horned owls is occurring during this time of year. Seasonally higher levels of great horned owl abundance and activity on airfields during these months might be associated with juvenile dispersal (Rohner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1996</xref>), territory searching and establishment activities by pre-breeders and adults (Artuso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>), or seasonally abundant prey resources. Future research studying the season habitat use and movement patterns of great horned owls using airport environments would provide valuable insights.</p><p id="Par34">The abundance of hazardous wildlife, as well as the specific behaviors exhibited by those species, within the airfield environment is an important factor related to the likelihood of wildlife-aircraft collisions (DeVault et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). However, determining the presence and abundance of nocturnally active species, such as great horned owls, within active airfield environments can be particularly challenging as traditional auditory survey methods (Anderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Reynolds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>) would be impractical and non-territorial &#x02018;floaters&#x02019; do not respond to conspecific calls (Rohner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1996</xref>). Novel means of detecting and counting great horned owls on airports or in other conflict situations are needed. Such methods would allow a better understand of how the abundance and behavior of great horned owls (and other wildlife hazardous to aviation) within airport environments influences the potential for owl-aircraft collisions and thus lead forward to effective solutions.</p><p id="Par35">Great horned owls are generalist avian predators that use a very diverse prey base (Artuso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). However, numerous studies have shown that mammals (e.g., lagomorphs and small mammals) comprise the largest proportion of great horned owl diets in most areas and that owl prey selection is typically based on the abundance or availability of specific mammalian species within a given landscape (Zimmerman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1996</xref>; Don&#x000e1;zar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1989</xref>; Cromrich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>). Managing populations of lagomorphs and/or small mammals to reduce the attractiveness of airfields to foraging great horned owls might be a valuable component of an integrated hazard reduction program in some situations (Washburn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>; Witmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>) but this remains unstudied.</p><p id="Par36">Consistent with our findings, many known great horned owl mortalities have an anthropogenic influence; major contemporary challenges faced by great horned owl populations include collisions with vehicles (e.g., automobiles, aircraft), electrocutions, and secondary effects of rodenticides (Franson and Little <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>; Houston and Francis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1996</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>). However, other research has shown that owls killed by human-related causes are more likely to be discovered than those that die of natural factors (e.g., disease, starvation, predation) far from human development (Franson and Little <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>; Houston and Francis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1996</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">Although our study is focused on great horned owl conflicts associated with civilian airports and military airfields, the findings have direct implications for the management of other human-owl conflicts. Great horned owls often prey upon federally threatened and endangered shorebirds, such as piping plovers (<italic>Charadrius melodus</italic>) and roseate terns (<italic>Sterna dougalliillii</italic>), typically while these shorebirds are nesting (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>; Stantial et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2024</xref>). Such conflicts typically involve only a few individual great horned owls, but the impacts of their predation can substantially decrease productivity (Catlin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Stantial et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2024</xref>). Great horned owl predation on other raptors, such as peregrine falcons, ospreys, and swallow-tailed kites, can have negative consequences for management actions (e.g., hacking programs) to enhance existing populations or expand the range of those species (Cade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1989</xref>; Dzialak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>). Managing great horned owls using mitigation translocation might be a valuable option to resolve such conflicts. We suggest studies evaluating the efficacy of management programs (including mitigation translocation or other tools) to reduce non-aviation related human-owl conflicts represents an area of valuable and important future research.</p><p id="Par38">The recent development of highly accurate GPS-capable transmitters small enough to be used on great horned owls (although the nocturnal activity of this species creates additional challenges) provides excellent opportunities to advance our understanding of both the basic ecology of the species and what factors are important in developing science-based and effective management programs. This technology could be particularly useful for increasing our understanding of great horned owl seasonal movements and habitat use within highly urbanized landscapes. Also, increasing our understanding of how and when owls use locations where vehicle-collision mortality is substantial (e.g., airports, highway corridors) represents an important area of future research. Determining the survival, post-translocation movement patterns, and habitat use of translocated great horned owls would be a very important area for future research and would provide highly valuable information for the development of efficacious management programs.</p><p id="Par39">Management decisions on specific methods and practices to alleviate conflicts between humans and great horned owls involves a complex set of biological and social variables [e.g., the biology of the species involved (this study; C&#x000f4;te and Sutherland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1997</xref>), direct economic costs of management actions, hidden logistical costs (Massei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>), personal and corporate liability of wildlife strikes (Dale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>), and public perception of the management program in an increasingly social media-focused world (Washburn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>)]. This study represents an important step in providing a scientific foundation for the development of efficacious management programs to reduce the frequency and negative impacts of these conflicts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">Mitigation translocation of raptors (such as great horned owls) is an important component of integrated wildlife damage mitigation programs at many civilian airports and military bases. Based on our findings, we recommend that to reduce the potential for great horned owl conflicts and consequently maximizing the benefits of program resources, damage management programs should consider live-capturing and translocating great horned owls to a distance of at least 40&#x02009;km from the location of the problem (e.g., an airport) and translocated individual owls only one time. In addition, other potential factors might influence the behavior of great horned owls after a mitigation translocation and thus should be investigated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Federal Aviation Administration, 13 civilian airports, and 3 military airfields provided funding and logistical support for this project.
