This study aimed to investigate the association between PFAS mixture exposure and lipid profiles in Korean adolescents. Using data from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (2018&#x02013;2020), we analyzed 824 adolescents aged 12&#x02013;17 years. Serum concentrations of PFAS, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDeA), and lipid profiles were assessed. In multivariate regression models, PFDeA and PFNA were positively associated with elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and PFDeA was associated with hypercholesterolemia risk in boys. In girls, PFDeA was associated with higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglycerides, though no significant association with hypercholesterolemia risk was observed. Bayesian kernel machine regression demonstrated positive associations between PFAS mixture exposure and hypercholesterolemia risk in boys but not in girls.

Introduction</title><p>Hypercholesterolemia, defined by high blood cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and total cholesterol (TC), is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart diseases and strokes [<xref rid="B1-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The early hypercholesterolemia onset in adolescence raises significant concern, as lipid profiles established during this critical period often persist into adulthood, heightening the risk of early atherosclerotic changes and lifelong cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B1-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Recently, hypercholesterolemia prevalence among Korean adolescents has risen substantially, a trend largely attributed to the increasing adoption of Westernized dietary and lifestyle habits [<xref rid="B2-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This shift, characterized by greater consumption of high-fat, high-sugar foods along with reduced physical activity, has contributed to growing rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome, both of which are strongly associated with dyslipidemia, including hypercholesterolemia [<xref rid="B2-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although lifestyle factors are central to hypercholesterolemia development, emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposures are significant yet under-recognized contributors to its increasing prevalence. In particular, growing evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure may negatively impact metabolic health, including lipid profile dysregulation.</p><p>PFAS, a group of artificial chemicals, are prevalent in industrial and consumer goods for their distinct qualities, such as their resistance to water, oil, and high temperatures [<xref rid="B3-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Humans are frequently exposed to PFAS via polluted water and food sources, the use of consumer products, such as non-stick cookware, and direct contact with treated fabrics and packaging materials [<xref rid="B3-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies have consistently detected PFAS in the blood samples of the general population, highlighting the pervasive nature of this exposure [<xref rid="B4-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The potential adverse health outcomes of PFAS exposure include endocrine disruption, immune system impairment, and an elevated risk of certain cancers [<xref rid="B4-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Of particular interest is the association between PFAS exposure and hypercholesterolemia, which may offer insights into how environmental pollutants contribute to metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Multiple studies have suggested the potential unfavorable impacts of PFAS exposure on human lipid health. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 29 studies consistently demonstrated positive associations between PFAS exposure and lipid levels in adults, with perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being the most extensively studied compounds. These studies reported significant associations between PFAS exposure and increased levels of TC, triglycerides (TGs), and LDL-C, although the magnitude of these increases was generally modest [<xref rid="B5-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A recent contribution to this body of research reported that increased serum PFAS mixtures correlated with elevated trends in TC and LDL-C over a 15-year life span in a large cohort of mid-life United States (US) women [<xref rid="B6-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This finding suggests that PFAS exposure may have long-term consequences on lipid health, potentially contributing to elevated cardiovascular disease risk later in life.</p><p>However, despite these findings, evidence regarding PFAS exposure&#x02019;s impact on lipid health remains inconsistent, particularly in pediatric populations. Studies involving children and adolescents have reported mixed results, with some studies indicating a positive association between PFAS exposure and altered lipid profiles [<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while others found no significant associations [<xref rid="B11-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Research on Norwegian adolescents found that higher serum PFOS, perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDeA), and perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) levels correlated with increased apolipoprotein B, TC, and LDL-C [<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely, two cross-sectional studies&#x02014;one involving girls exposed to PFAS through drinking water and another involving the US general adolescent population&#x02014;reported null associations between most PFAS compounds and serum lipid profiles [<xref rid="B11-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>These inconsistencies may be attributed to various effect modifiers, including ethnicity/race and sex. Ethnicity/race has been proposed as a factor that modifies the health effects of PFAS exposure through genetic, dietary, and environmental differences. For example, differences in the consumption of diet across ethnic groups can influence the types and levels of PFAS exposure, with certain populations being more exposed to specific PFAS compounds. In addition, genetic susceptibility to the same PFAS exposure levels can differ between ethnic and racial groups, further contributing to variations in health outcomes. The Multiethnic Cohort Study highlighted the significance of assessing PFAS health effects in racially and ethnically diverse populations, discovering evidence of increased kidney cancer risk among African American participants with higher PFAS levels compared with those of other ethnicities [<xref rid="B13-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The potential effects of PFAS exposure on lipid metabolism in the Asian pediatric population remain largely unexplored, presenting a significant gap in the literature. Given the potential distinctions in physiology and diet, particularly the high seafood consumption in Asian populations, further research is needed to understand how PFAS exposure may influence lipid metabolism in this understudied group.</p><p>Sex-related differences in lipid profiles may also influence the association between PFAS exposure and dyslipidemia. Female adolescents typically exhibit higher TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels than their male counterparts do [<xref rid="B14-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas they tend to have lower serum PFAS levels owing to menstruation [<xref rid="B15-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These biological differences suggest that sex could be an important modifier of the PFAS-related effects on lipid regulation; however, a few studies have specifically investigated this potential interaction.</p><p>Furthermore, although PFAS compounds may exert additive or synergistic effects when present as mixtures, most studies have primarily focused on the effects of individual PFAS compounds on lipid health. Specifically, a lack of comprehensive analysis on the joint effects of multiple PFAS exposures exists, including potential interactions between different PFAS compounds [<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This gap is particularly evident in pediatric populations, where such investigations remain scarce.</p><p>Given the inconsistent findings and the potential influence of various effect modifiers, more comprehensive studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between PFAS exposure and lipid health in adolescents. The Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) 2018&#x02013;2020 provides an opportunity to investigate these associations in a representative sample of South Korean adolescents. This study aimed to explore the associations between serum PFAS concentrations and lipid profiles in adolescents, considering potential effect modifiers such as sex differences and the joint effects of multiple PFAS compounds.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-toxics-13-00091"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxics-13-00091"><title>2.1. Study Population</title><p>Our study utilized data obtained from the fourth cycle of the KoNEHS (2018&#x02013;2020), an extensive nationwide biomonitoring investigation designed to systematically monitor and evaluate environmental chemical exposures among the Korean general population. It employed a stratified, multistage probability sampling method ensuring comprehensive demographic representation across South Korea [<xref rid="B17-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The survey collected a comprehensive range of data encompassing factors such as socioeconomic status and health conditions, obtained through interviews based on questionnaires that specifically investigated environmental chemical exposure. Furthermore, the survey comprised physical assessments to acquire anthropometric measurements and laboratory examinations to substantiate the information collected. This study utilized information from the fourth cycle of the KoNEHS since it was the sole cycle that measured serum PFAS levels. Initially, a pediatric population of adolescents aged 12&#x02013;17 years, totaling 828 participants, was included in KoNEHS 2018&#x02013;2020. After applying exclusion criteria, three participants who did not undergo blood sampling or PFAS concentration testing and one participant with severely elevated serum TG levels (&#x02265;800 mg/dL), whose LDL-C could not be accurately calculated using the Martin&#x02013;Hopkins formula, were excluded. This resulted in a final dataset of 824 participants. No participant reported lipid-lowering medication use or had a known history of endocrine disorders that affect lipid metabolism, such as thyroid dysfunction or diabetes mellitus.</p><p>The KoNEHS adhered to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was collected from all participants and their legal guardians before participation. The study protocol received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital (IRB No. 2024-02-005).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxics-13-00091"><title>2.2. Determination of Serum Lipid Profiles</title><p>Participant blood samples were drawn using venipuncture and stored in serum separator tubes. Fasting was not mandated prior to blood sample collection. Samples were left to clot at ambient temperature for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The separated serum was used to determine lipid profiles using an ADVIA 1800 Clinical Chemistry System (Siemens Medical Sol., Malvern, PA, USA). The ADVIA 1800 system is an automated analyzer designed for high-throughput biochemical assays, including lipid profiling. A colorimetric enzymatic assay was used to measure TC, beginning with cholesterol ester conversion to free cholesterol, which is then oxidized to produce a color intensity directly proportional to cholesterol concentration, with absorbance read at 505/694 nm. For HDL-C measurement, LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) were selectively precipitated, with the remaining HDL-C measured by a similar colorimetric enzymatic assay. TGs were measured by hydrolyzing them to glycerol and free fatty acids, with the ensuing reactions forming a colored complex, whose absorbance at 505/694 nm indicates the TG concentration. To obtain non-HDL-C, the HDL-C value was subtracted from the TC as follows: non-HDL-C = TC &#x02212; HDL-C [<xref rid="B18-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. LDL-C was calculated using an extended Martin/Hopkins equation, which applies a strata-specific median ratio of TG to VLDL-C. This method is based on 40 TG categories and 6 non-HDL-C categories, resulting in a 240-cell stratification, as detailed in a previous study [<xref rid="B19-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This approach enhances the accuracy of LDL-C estimation, particularly in individuals with elevated TG levels and in non-fasting states.</p><p>Subnormal lipid profiles were defined according to the cut-off values established by the 2017 clinical practice guidelines for dyslipidemia in Korean children and adolescents as follows: TC &#x02265; 170 mg/dL, LDL-C &#x02265; 110 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C &#x02265; 120 mg/dL [<xref rid="B1-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as meeting one or more of these subnormal lipid profile criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxics-13-00091"><title>2.3. Measurement of Serum PFAS Concentrations</title><p>The serum samples were processed by aliquoting into polypropylene tubes and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until analysis. For PFAS quantification, specifically targeting compounds such as PFOA, PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), PFNA, and PFDeA, high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was utilized (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Sample preparation involved adding internal standards along with 800 &#x000b5;L of acetonitrile to each serum sample, followed by a 10 s agitation to facilitate protein precipitation. The samples were then centrifuged, after which 800 &#x000b5;L of the supernatant was collected and further concentrated under nitrogen gas. The final concentrated samples were diluted in a 50% methanol solution, preparing them for HPLC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>To enhance the methodological rigor and ensure the validity of the analytical procedures, quality control (QC) measures were systematically implemented. The QC protocol incorporated the use of certified reference materials such as PFHxS, PFOA, PFNA, PFOS, and PFDeA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) to establish calibration curves and assess the quantification process accuracy. To further refine analysis precision, isotopically labeled internal standards, specifically PFOA-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>8</sub> and PFOS-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>8</sub>, were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories and integrated into the sample preparation workflow. In addition to the internal quality assurance measures, the performance of the method was subjected to external validation through participation in the German External Quality Assessment Scheme. This interlaboratory comparison program provided an independent assessment of the accuracy of the method and comparability with other laboratories. The detection limits for PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDeA were 0.056, 0.050, 0.071, 0.019, and 0.017 &#x000b5;g/L, respectively. For concentrations below the detection limit, the square root of the limit was used for imputation [<xref rid="B20-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxics-13-00091"><title>2.4. Covariates</title><p>Data were collected using standardized survey methodologies to assess sociodemographic variables, including sex, age, and family income, stratified into the following three categories: &#x0003c;3, 3&#x02013;5, and &#x0003e;5 million KRW/month. The survey also examined various lifestyle aspects. Alcohol intake was classified based on frequency, distinguishing between individuals who consumed less than one drink per week and those who had one or more drinks weekly. Smoking status was categorized as never smoked, former smoker, or current smoker. Physical activity was assessed through the walking routines of participants, with a threshold of &#x0003c;150 min per week to &#x02265;150 min. In addition, the frequency of mass-produced food consumption was assessed in the following four categories: &#x0003c;twice, two to three times, four to six times, and &#x02265;seven times per week. Quartile analysis was used to determine seafood consumption frequency. The intake of mass-produced food items such as instant noodles, hamburgers, frozen foods, popcorn, and canned goods served as a proxy for high-calorie consumption.</p><p>Anthropometric assessments were performed with participants wearing light attire and without footwear. Heights and weights were recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm and kg, respectively, using a stadiometer and a calibrated digital scale. Waist circumference (WC) was assessed at the midpoint between the lower rib and the top of the iliac crest using a nonelastic tape measure. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Obesity status was classified according to the 2017 Korean National Growth Charts for children and adolescents, using the following sex- and age-specific BMI percentile values: normal weight (&#x0003c;85th percentile) and overweight and obese (&#x02265;85th percentile) [<xref rid="B21-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. BMI z-scores were derived using the Lambda-Mu-Sigma method. Central obesity was defined based on sex- and age-specific WC percentiles, with a cut-off at &#x02265;90th percentile [<xref rid="B22-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The final dataset was complete with no missing covariates among participants, eliminating the need for additional preprocessing steps to handle missing data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxics-13-00091"><title>2.5. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.3.3). Results were considered statistically significant if the two-sided <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value was &#x0003c;0.05. The study design adhered to the KoNEHS guidelines, incorporating complex survey elements such as strata, primary sampling units, and sampling weights. Due to the right-skewed non-normal distribution of PFAS concentrations, a logarithmic transformation was applied before analysis. Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficients (&#x003c1;) were calculated to evaluate the associations between serum PFAS concentrations. PFAS levels were categorized into three groups based on tertiles, using the lowest tertile as the baseline reference for comparison. TG also underwent log transformation to approximate a normalized distribution, whereas the other lipid parameters exhibited normal distribution and, consequently, did not require transformation.</p><p>Sex-stratified analyses were conducted to account for lipid profile differences between male and female adolescents. Multivariate linear regression assessed the association between serum PFAS levels and lipid profiles, while multivariate logistic regression evaluated the associations between PFAS concentrations and the likelihood of subnormal lipid profiles. Each model was adjusted for potentially confounding variables, including age, central obesity, family income, smoking, alcohol habits, walking habits, consumption of mass-produced food items/seafood, and menstruation years for girls.</p><p>To assess the impact of multiple PFAS exposures on hypercholesterolemia, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and quantile g-computation models were used. BKMR was chosen for its strength in modeling complex interactions and non-linear relationships between exposures, allowing for a nuanced evaluation of environmental health effects [<xref rid="B23-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The posterior inclusion probability (PIP) in BKMR quantifies the relevance of each exposure in the model, with higher PIP values indicating a stronger influence on the outcome. BKMR result interpretation typically involves comparing the exposure&#x02013;response relationships when all PFAS levels are set to a specific percentile against when they are set to the 50th percentile. In this analysis, PFAS concentrations underwent log transformation and standardization. BKMR was then applied, utilizing 50,000 Monte Carlo iterations across a 260-knot grid, to comprehensively examine the exposure&#x02013;response relationship.</p><p>Quantile g-computation offers a robust alternative to BKMR by directly assessing the effects of a quantile increase in chemical mixtures on health outcomes. Unlike BKMR, which models non-linear relationships and interactions, quantile g-computation provides a clear interpretation of how each exposure level increment affects the outcomes, enhancing a better understanding of exposure&#x02013;response dynamics. The contribution of each PFAS compound to the overall mixture effect was quantified by weights, with the sum of weights normalized to one [<xref rid="B24-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Positive weights imply that a chemical exposure increase is associated with an increase in health outcomes, while negative weights suggest an inverse relationship, where higher exposure correlates with a decrease in the outcome. In this study, a binomial distribution was used as the link function, and tertiles were chosen for the quantile division owing to the absence of significant non-linear patterns in most dose&#x02013;response relationships. Two hundred bootstrap iterations were conducted to enhance the robustness of the model. The results are interpreted as the combined effect of a one-tertile increase in the PFAS mixture on hypercholesterolemia outcomes. Owing to the limitations of both BKMR and quantile g-computation methodologies, survey-weighted analyses were not included. BKMR and quantile g-computation methods were conducted using the &#x02018;bkmr&#x02019; (version 0.2.2) and &#x02018;qgcomp&#x02019; packages (version 2.15.2) in R.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-toxics-13-00091"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>This study highlights significant sex-specific differences in the associations between PFAS exposure and hypercholesterolemia in Korean adolescents. In boys, PFDeA and PFNA showed strong positive associations with elevated TC and LDL-C, with PFDeA notably increasing hypercholesterolemia risk (OR 2.38, 95% CI: 1.23&#x02013;4.59). In contrast, girls demonstrated a positive association between PFDeA and HDL-C and lower TG levels; however, no significant association was found between PFAS exposure and hypercholesterolemia risk. These findings suggest a clear sex difference in PFAS-related lipid dysregulation, which is more pronounced in boys, while the direction and magnitude of PFAS effects appear to differ between the sexes. Advanced mixture models, including BKMR and quantile g-computation, revealed positive associations between PFAS mixture exposure and hypercholesterolemia risk in boys, although these associations were less pronounced compared to the individual impact of PFDeA. This suggests that the combined effects of PFAS mixtures on lipid metabolism may be moderated by interactions between PFAS compounds, leading to non-linear or antagonistic effects.</p><p>Our study contributes to the growing body of research on the relationship between PFAS exposure and lipid metabolism, specifically focusing on the adolescent population. Although most existing studies focused on adult populations, several studies have consistently demonstrated the association between PFAS exposure and elevated cholesterol levels. For instance, Liu et al. conducted a meta-analysis revealing significant associations between PFOA and PFOS exposure and increased TC and LDL-C levels in adults [<xref rid="B5-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is in line with the findings from Canova et al., who observed that PFAS, particularly PFOS and PFOA, were linked to altered lipid parameters such as TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C, emphasizing the potential role of these substances in lipid dysregulation [<xref rid="B9-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In adolescent-focused studies, the first large-scale studies by Frisbee et al. (2010) and Geiger et al. (2014) identified associations between PFOA, PFOS, and elevated TC and LDL-C among US pediatric populations, showing similar patterns to those in adults [<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. More recent studies have expanded on these observations by including other PFAS compounds and reporting potential associations with elevated lipid profiles. For example, Koshy et al. expanded on this by including other PFAS compounds, including PFHxS, PFNA, PFDeA, and PFUnDA, further supporting the potential lipid-disrupting effects in US children [<xref rid="B26-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, Averina et al. reported that PFOS, PFNA, PFDeA, and PFUnDA concentrations were positively associated with not only TC and LDL-C but also with apolipoprotein B levels in Norwegian adolescents, with PFNA and PFDeA particularly linked to higher dyslipidemia risk [<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Canova et al. (2021) added further evidence by evaluating highly exposed adolescents from Italy [<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Their results revealed significant associations between PFOS, PFNA, and higher TC and LDL-C levels, similar to those found in studies from the US and Norway. These findings align with those of our study, where PFNA and PFDeA were associated with elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adolescents, highlighting the consistent role of specific PFAS in lipid dysregulation across diverse populations.</p><p>PFAS are known for their persistent bioaccumulative nature, and their impact on cholesterol metabolism is an emerging concern. PFAS can interfere with lipid metabolism through various pathways, particularly by interacting with nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) [<xref rid="B28-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and pregnane X receptor (PXR) [<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which regulate lipid homeostasis. The stimulation of these nuclear receptors due to PFAS exposure may lead to elevated serum cholesterol levels through alterations in lipid production, bile acid metabolism, and cholesterol excretion [<xref rid="B30-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that PFAS compounds may induce oxidative stress and inflammation, further contributing to dyslipidemia [<xref rid="B32-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These mechanisms are particularly relevant in adolescence, a period of rapid hormonal and metabolic changes that may amplify the effects of environmental pollutants on lipid health.</p><p>In this study, PFOS and PFOA&#x02014;two of the most well-documented PFAS compounds&#x02014;were not significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia risk in the Korean adolescent population. Notably, serum PFOS levels showed a borderline significant positive association with TC concentrations in boys, although no association was observed with LDL-C. This finding aligns with, but is weaker than, associations reported in adult populations worldwide. For example, the meta-analysis by Liu et al. found positive associations between PFOS and PFOA exposure and elevated cholesterol levels in adults [<xref rid="B5-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A possible explanation for the weaker association in adolescents is that the lipid-disrupting effects of PFOS and PFOA may require prolonged, cumulative exposure, which may not yet be reflected in younger individuals. Moreover, adolescents undergo significant hormonal and metabolic changes that could modify their susceptibility to PFAS-induced lipid disturbances. Furthermore, global reductions in PFOS and PFOA exposure following the restrictions introduced by the Stockholm Convention could have influenced these findings [<xref rid="B33-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey studies, such as those by Geiger et al. [<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Dong et al. [<xref rid="B12-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], reported much higher serum PFOS and PFOA concentrations&#x02014;up to 100% greater than those observed in our study&#x02014;accompanied by stronger associations with increased cholesterol levels. In Korea, declining PFOS levels have been reported between 2006 and 2015, suggesting that reduced exposure could potentially exacerbate the sensitivity of the population to its lipid-altering effects over time [<xref rid="B34-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Recent studies in adolescent populations from Norway [<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Italy [<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], where PFOS concentrations were comparable to or even lower than those found in our study, still demonstrated positive associations between PFOS exposure and both TC and LDL-C levels. This suggests that other factors, such as genetic predispositions, dietary habits, or environmental influences, play a significant role in modifying the health effects of PFAS exposure in adolescents of diverse ethnic backgrounds. These findings highlight the importance of future research to unravel the complex interplay between these variables and to better understand the population-specific effects of PFAS exposure.</p><p>In this study, significant positive associations between PFDeA and PFNA exposure and hypercholesterolemia in Korean adolescents were identified. The health effects of PFNA and PFDeA are less explored compared with PFOS and PFOA, primarily due to their historically lower concentrations in most populations. However, in this study, PFNA and PFDeA concentrations were notably higher than internationally reported levels [<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], highlighting the importance of regional exposure patterns in assessing health risks. Positive associations of PFDeA and PFNA with serum lipid profiles were also reported in large-scale cross-sectional studies from Norway and Italy and longitudinal studies of mother-child cohorts from the Faroe Islands and the US [<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These associations may result from the distinct bioaccumulation patterns of these longer-chain PFAS compounds and their differential activation of nuclear receptors, including PPAR&#x003b1;, PXR, and CAR. PFNA and PFDeA tend to accumulate more effectively in the liver, where they exert hepatotoxic effects that impair the ability of the organ to regulate cholesterol synthesis, transport, and excretion. This disruption may promote lipid accumulation and increase serum cholesterol levels. A key aspect underlying these associations involves the differential activation of nuclear receptors by PFAS compounds. PPAR&#x003b1;, PXR, and CAR are central to lipid metabolism and homeostasis, and each receptor responds differently to PFAS exposure [<xref rid="B35-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b1; enhances fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, promoting energy metabolism in the liver; however, this increased lipid breakdown may trigger compensatory cholesterol synthesis as part of hepatic homeostasis [<xref rid="B36-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Meanwhile, PXR, the primary regulator of drug metabolism, upregulates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2, contributing to elevated LDL-C levels [<xref rid="B37-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, CAR activation promotes cholesterol clearance by enhancing bile acid synthesis and stimulating excretion through bile, mitigating hypercholesterolemia [<xref rid="B38-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Experimental studies reveal that PFAS compounds differ in their potential to activate PPAR&#x003b1; [<xref rid="B39-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and bind to PXR [<xref rid="B40-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Long-chain PFAS, PFNA, and PFDeA show stronger activation of these receptors than their shorter-chain counterparts, even though CAR activation remains consistently high across most PFAS compounds [<xref rid="B28-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B41-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Using two different mixture models, PFDeA and PFNA were identified as the primary contributors to hypercholesterolemia risk in Korean adolescents, while the effects of PFAS mixtures showed only marginal statistical significance. This discrepancy may be attributed to the complex interactions among PFAS compounds in mixtures, which could potentially attenuate the robust effects observed in individual compounds. Emerging evidence suggests that PFAS mixtures behave differently from individual compounds, with nuclear receptor activation profiles shifting based on the composition and ratios of the PFAS involved. These interactions may produce non-linear outcomes&#x02014;ranging from additive and synergistic to antagonistic effects&#x02014;depending on the specific mixture [<xref rid="B39-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For example, research on human liver cell models has shown that perfluorinated carboxylic acids act as full agonists of PPAR&#x003b1;, while perfluorinated sulfonic acids act as partial agonists. Mixtures of these compounds displayed non-additive effects, with antagonistic interactions becoming evident at higher concentrations [<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B42-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, studies in larval fish noted that PFOA could reduce the oxidative stress induced by PFOS, suggesting that certain PFAS may mitigate the toxic effects of others within mixtures [<xref rid="B43-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Such interactions may explain the weaker combined effects observed in this study. Our findings from mixture models provide valuable insights into real-world exposure scenarios where individuals are exposed to multiple PFAS compounds simultaneously. These findings highlight the importance of advanced statistical approaches, such as BKMR and quantile g-computation, to account for the complex, non-linear relationships among PFAS compounds. However, the marginal significance observed in some mixture models emphasizes the need for further validation using larger and more diverse cohorts. Replication studies are crucial to confirm these associations and provide greater clarity on the interplay between individual PFAS compounds, mixtures, and hypercholesterolemia risk.</p><p>A key finding of this study was the sex-specific differences in how PFAS compounds impacted lipid profiles, with boys exhibiting stronger associations between PFAS exposure and lipid disturbances than girls. These differences may be partially attributed to hormonal variations, particularly estradiol&#x02019;s role. Estradiol plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism by enhancing LDL-C clearance and promoting HDL-C production, which could offer protective effects in females [<xref rid="B44-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, estradiol has been shown to modulate nuclear receptor activity, including PPAR-&#x003b1;, which regulates lipid metabolism. Evidence suggests that estradiol can inhibit PPAR-&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activity by interfering with coactivator recruitment [<xref rid="B45-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], potentially reducing susceptibility to PFAS-induced lipid disturbances in females. This hormonal modulation may explain why males are more vulnerable to PFAS-related lipid dysregulation. Beyond estradiol&#x02019;s effects, other mechanisms likely contribute to these sex-specific differences. Differential activation of nuclear receptors such as PXR and CAR by PFAS compounds may play a role. These receptors are involved in xenobiotic metabolism and lipid homeostasis, and their activation patterns may differ between sexes due to hormonal influences or genetic factors [<xref rid="B46-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Variations in liver function between males and females, including differences in hepatic lipid processing pathways, may also influence PFAS metabolism and its downstream effects on lipid profiles [<xref rid="B31-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Animal studies further support these findings, with zebrafish and rodent models demonstrating that males are more susceptible to PFAS-induced disruptions in lipid metabolism, such as hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. For example, male rodents exposed to PFOS exhibited greater hepatic lipid accumulation compared to females, likely due to sex-specific differences in liver function and hormonal regulation of lipid pathways [<xref rid="B46-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These findings underscore the significance of sex as a biological variable in PFAS toxicology and suggest that males may experience greater disturbances in lipid homeostasis following PFAS exposure. In contrast, human studies have not extensively examined sex-related differences in lipid metabolism following PFAS exposure. The stratified analysis conducted in this study revealed that boys had higher serum concentrations of PFAS compounds compared to girls (<xref rid="app1-toxics-13-00091" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>), which could partially explain the stronger associations observed between PFAS exposure and hypercholesterolemia risk in boys (<xref rid="toxics-13-00091-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="toxics-13-00091-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These findings underscore the significance of sex as a biological variable in PFAS toxicology and suggest that males may experience greater disturbances in lipid homeostasis following PFAS exposure.</p><p>This study has several notable strengths. It is one of the few to investigate PFAS exposure in adolescents, a vulnerable population group, while also exploring sex-specific differences in lipid metabolism. A key strength lies in the use of advanced statistical models such as BKMR and quantile g-computation, allowing assessment of the combined effects of multiple PFAS exposures and accounting for interactions between compounds. These models provided a robust approach to exploring non-linear relationships and complex interactions, which are often overlooked in traditional regression analyses. Furthermore, the use of data from a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents in this study increases the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the cross-sectional design restricts the ability to establish causality between PFAS exposure and lipid profile alterations; our findings primarily highlight associations rather than causal relationships. Furthermore, PFAS exposure was measured at a single time point, which may not accurately capture long-term exposure patterns. Another notable limitation is that blood samples were collected without requiring participants to fast. While we used the Martin&#x02013;Hopkins formula to calculate LDL-C, which improves the reliability of lipid measurements under non-fasting conditions, fasting blood samples are still considered the gold standard for lipid analysis. The absence of fasting may have introduced variability in lipid measurements due to dietary influences or temporal fluctuations in blood lipid levels. Future studies using standardized fasting protocols are needed to improve measurement accuracy.</p><p>Additionally, while we adjusted for several confounding factors, such as age, sex, household income, and central obesity, unmeasured variables such as dietary habits, genetic predispositions, high-temperature environments, and co-exposure to other environmental pollutants were not accounted for, potentially leading to residual confounding. Although we employed advanced statistical models, such as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and quantile g-computation, to analyze the joint effects of PFAS mixtures, our study did not explore potential synergistic interactions between PFAS and other environmental or lifestyle factors, such as dietary intake. Future longitudinal studies integrating dietary, genetic, and environmental factors are essential to validate these findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between PFAS exposure, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular risk in adolescents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-toxics-13-00091"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that PFAS mixtures play a role in lipid metabolism disruptions in adolescents, with potential sex-specific effects. Although the findings indicate an association between PFAS exposure and altered lipid profiles, further research is needed to confirm these observations and clarify the mechanisms underlying these effects. Future studies should also explore the long-term health implications of PFAS mixtures on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk in pediatric populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We sincerely acknowledge the National Institute of Environmental Research, under the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea, for providing access to the KoNEHS data used in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
